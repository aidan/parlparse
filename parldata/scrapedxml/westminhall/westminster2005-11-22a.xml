<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-22a.356.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" speakername="Mark Hunter" colnum="356"  time="010:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051122/halltext/51122h01.htm#51122h01_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.356.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1474" name="Malcolm Moss">the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I know that the issue has affected a number of his constituents and he appears to have uncovered a flaw in the system for dealing with contaminated land. It is only right that we should seek to pursue a &quot;polluter pays&quot; policy on contaminated land, but in this case the principle appears not to have been enforced in the way that was intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.0/2">I want to broaden the discussion slightly and praise the Government for their endeavours in bringing brownfield sites back into use. That is a worthwhile policy and the Government are making some progress. It is clear that there are a large number of reasons why we should not let the kinds of difficulties that we have heard about undermine what my party believes is a crucial aim. Given the finite amount of land resources available to us in Britain, brownfield development is an obvious and correct policy. That is why I am interested to know how seriously the Government take proposals put forward by my party, and supported by a number of respected and independent bodies, to alter the VAT regime so that we can do away with the frankly ludicrous situation in which it is often more expensive to repair an old house than to build a new one. It is still cheaper to build new houses than to convert the estimated 1 million dwellings that could be brought into use which are located above shops, the conversion of which would go a long way towards filling the black hole in housing provision. I would be interested to know whether the Government intend to publish the report by Grant Thornton, which I understand effectively sounded the death knell for revitalising over-the-shop living. It would make interesting reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.0/3">It is also my belief that the tax regime does not provide the incentives that we need to encourage development on brownfield sites in the first place. Despite some of the problems that can be encountered when dealing with brownfield sites, we simply cannot ignore the fact that that is the only game in town if we are serious about meeting the housing challenge at the same time as protecting our natural heritage. Are the Government still considering proposals for a planning gain supplement, as proposed by the Barker report, or a planning tariff to encourage brownfield over greenfield development?</p>
	<p pid="a.356.0/4">On development on contaminated land, all the evidence of which I am aware suggests that we are dealing with a hopeless lack of knowledge about the precise location of the land involved. That lack of knowledge has led to the type of unfortunate situation that we heard about this morning. In my constituency, a planning application on the site of a disused landfill site has caused much local controversy. It is my view, and it was the view of my predecessor in Cheadle, that the local authority lacks detailed knowledge of what went into the tip when it was in use. We should not allow a major development on the site without far more details on the level of contamination.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.0/5">Following detailed work at the end of last year, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> found that local authorities across the country had uncovered only the tip of the iceberg when it came to identifying contaminated land in their localities. The problems can be traced back to the mid-1990s, when a certain Environment Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>, cancelled plans to develop a toxic land register. With greater vision from a previous Government, we might have avoided many of the problems that an increasingly large number of hon. Members will face over the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.0/6">I would be interested to learn of the progress that has been made by local authorities on inspections under part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which was referred to by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase>. I understand that the first round should be completed by 2006. It would be interesting to hear the latest progress report and to know the scale of the problem. It seems that this is yet another case of extra burdens being placed on councils with a complete lack of resources to back up the requirements. We cannot forget the danger that some of the chemicals we are talking pose to human health. After all, that is the most important aspect of the problem. In many cases, such chemicals can cause terrible damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.0/7">In conclusion, a lack of knowledge has caused the problem to arise and it is imperative that we have clarity about its scale so that other residents do not suffer as some already have. More importantly, people need to know more about the location of contaminated sites to protect the health of current and future generations. That does not appear to be happening at present.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-22a.357.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1679" speakername="Bill Wiggin" colnum="357"  time="010:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051122/halltext/51122h01.htm#51122h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.357.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1474" name="Malcolm Moss">the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss)</phrase> on securing the debate. He spoke with great feeling about his constituents in Littleport near Ely and the difficulties that they face because their houses are built on the site of an old gasworks. It is extremely difficult for people who are unable to sell their homes and who live in fear for their health. They are unable to escape such health hazards, and, through scientific developments, by-products from coal and gas production will become easier to identify as time goes by.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/2">My hon. Friend asked who was responsible and made it clear that the responsibility was historic. It was difficult to pin down one group who should or could foot the bill for clean-up. It is a great shame that the guidance from DEFRA and the Environment Agency is so confused. Although we all have benzo(a)pyrene in fires in our homes, in the right concentration it can be extremely dangerous. He did an extremely good job in identifying the problems involved and I have a great deal of sympathy for those poor people in Littleport. I hope that the Minister will tell us who will help them.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/3">The hon. Members for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin), for Cheadle (Mark Hunter) and for Rochdale (Paul Rowen) spoke with great feeling about their constituency cases, although I have to take issue with one minor point of the hon. Member for Cheadle. He said that the burden could fall very heavily on local councils. That is incompatible with his party's policy on local income tax, given that local councils with the worst contamination have constituents with some of the lowest incomes. I am sure that he will forgive me for saying that.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/4">The debate provides us with a valuable opportunity to discuss the brownfield situation in England and the Government's disjointed strategy. The development of brownfield sites, contaminated or not, can play an important role in reducing the housing shortage and preserving our environment. Current Government estimates suggest that 3.8 million new homes will be needed in England by 2021, and if we are determined to preserve the green belt, we will have to develop brownfield sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/5">In 1998, the then Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions set a target for 60 per cent. of new dwellings to be built on previously developed land, often referred to as brownfield land, by 2008. The real test is whether we can achieve that target. I believe and hope that we are likely to reach it, but to do so it will be necessary to build on contaminated land. I am concerned about the effectiveness of current Government policy towards contaminated brownfield sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/6">The national land database, which is co-ordinated through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, estimates that 64,130 hectares of brownfield sites are unused or may be available for development, of which only 28,650 have been deemed suitable for housing. In some localities in England, brownfield sites constitute a significant proportion of land use. For example, in Wolverhampton, about a third of the area in the Short Heath and Wednesfield South wards has been classified as brownfield. Overall, brownfield density in parts of Wolverhampton is nearly 15 per cent., in parts of Sunderland it is 11 per cent. and in parts of Bradford it is 9 per cent. Nevertheless, given the industrial past of many of those sites, the Government do not keep accurate central records on the number of sites that are contaminated. Records are only collated at local government level. Moreover, details of developments and remediation for contaminated sites are dealt with through a variety of Government organisations, including the Rural Development Service and the Environment Agency, as well as local government. To clarify the situation, we must have records from central and local levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/7">We must also know which Department is overseeing the remediation of contaminated brownfield sites. Is it DEFRA, with a responsibility for the environment, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, with its responsibility for planning matters, or even the Treasury? The Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions were also mentioned. One of those Departments at least must take the lead.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/8">It is hardly surprising that with all those different organisations, authorities and Whitehall Departments managing brownfield sites and their remediation, local authorities have failed to make full use of funds available for investigation and contamination clean-up. Although the Environment Agency estimates that there are between 5,000 and 20,000 contaminated brownfield sites in the UK, not all are brownfield. We must know from the Government exactly how many are.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/9">In a report published in 2000 which surveyed eight locations throughout England, the national brownfield sites project found:</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The highest remediation cost is attributable to those sites that are categorized as contaminated and/or derelict.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/11">Additionally, the Environment Agency has stated that the cost of developing brownfield land is more expensive than greenfield. It stated also:</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The regulatory complexities of reclaiming some brownfield land may . . . be a barrier to new development.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/13">Contamination is a major problem environmentally and economically. It must be redressed so that development can take place. We must know the costs, and only the Government in Whitehall can provide us with that information. I hope that the Minister will ensure that those figures are produced. Once the costs are known, effective action can be taken. We should like to know when it will take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/14">The Government could make progress on cleaning up and developing contaminated brownfield sites by adopting policies, such as tax incentives, that are designed to encourage private investment, especially in areas where the economic costs of clean-up deter investment. Some 55 per cent. of brownfield land is privately owned and 28 per cent. is publicly owned.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/15">If land is to be developed and, if contaminated, cleaned up, the Government must use a range of economic instruments to promote such activity, particularly in the private sector. If they were to promote clean-up and development of privately owned brownfield sites, the stability that it would offer would provide private developers with the confidence to invest.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/16">When there are plans afoot to develop brownfield sites, currently developers must make provisions for the investigation of contamination and the clean-up of those sites. The Government could help by making the planning process easier and by performing their own studies to ensure that contaminated land is cleaned up effectively. The Environment Agency advocates that, favouring economic incentives such as corporation tax relief and landfill tax exemption. Developers can qualify for tax incentives from the Treasury, such as a 50 per cent. relief for &quot;qualifying land remediation expenditure.&quot; None the less, the Government could do more, including offering VAT relief for new developments. Such incentives would be particularly constructive in promoting developments in the north-east, where many developers are deterred because the high costs of clean-up and red tape do not always make projects economically viable. Those incentives could also be repeated to support the remediation of publicly owned brownfield sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/17">I understand that the business regulation team has formed a taskforce to consider the possibility of granting a single remediation permit for brownfield developers, and I hope that it will cut through the red tape and bureaucracy that restrains development. None the less, I am concerned about the implications of the decision in the European Court of Justice to classify contaminated soil as landfill. It opens up a new set of red tape and bureaucracy that may serve only to replace any savings made by the business regulation team. I hope that the Government ensure that the decision of the Court does not damage the prospects for brownfield development. I should be interested to know from the Minister how the Government have responded to its decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.0/18">We want to continue to develop brownfield sites, making them available for residential and business use. We must ensure that the Government can facilitate the clean-up of such sites, so that they become available for development. We know how much land is brownfield, but we need to know from the Government the cost of clean-up. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and the hon. Members for Heywood and Middleton, for Rochdale and for Cheadle spoke with great expertise and with dismay at the situations in their constituencies. I hope that the Minister will turn his energy and his efforts to assisting the existing situation and the future of brownfield development.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-22a.362.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" speakername="Elliot Morley" colnum="362"  time="010:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051122/halltext/51122h01.htm#51122h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.362.0/1">I accept what the hon. Gentleman says, but it would not be appropriate for me to go into the background of the case. How we do these kinds of assessment is the issue that I am trying to address. I am also trying to answer the questions that have been asked and comment on the Rochdale case to which my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton spoke.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/2">As I was saying, the mere presence of contaminants does not mean that risk&mdash;let alone unacceptable risk&mdash;is present. That can only be determined through detailed investigations on site and the risk assessments that are made. That can be a complicated and painstaking process, but getting it right can save unnecessary remediation and disruption. That is relevant to a point made by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. That work has to be done for individual sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/3">That point also applies to the site in Rochdale. There has to be an environmental impact assessment, which I understand the local authority is doing; that is a sensible and responsible move. There are strict regulations about on-site remediation. Regardless of whether BAP or asbestos is involved, hazardous material has to be disposed of in a licensed site in a separate cell. In terms of lorry and other vehicle movements, there will be a role for both the Environment Agency in relation to waste licensing, and perhaps for the Health and Safety Executive in making sure that the vehicles are properly sheeted and there is proper dust control. A range of regulations exist to protect our constituents. Sadly, clearance of major sites involves a lot of lorry movements&mdash;not much can be done about that. The question is whether we want derelict sites to be left derelict as an eyesore for many years, or whether we want them to be developed and accept short-term disruption, which is inevitable in any site remediation or management. I believe that all of us as Members of Parliament experience that from time to time.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-22a.368.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" speakername="Elliot Morley" colnum="368"  time="010:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051122/halltext/51122h01.htm#51122h01_spnew26">
	<p pid="a.368.1/1">On the first point, I confirm that funds are available from ODPM&mdash;not from DEFRA. There is a fund that local authorities can apply to. How much they get and for what depends on the individual circumstances and the basis of the application, and is a matter for the local authority and ODPM.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.1/2">I can give the hon. Gentleman some longer-term comfort. DEFRA and the Environment Agency have published the contaminated land exposure assessment, the CLEA, which I think he mentioned. That is a methodology&mdash;a series of reports&mdash;of which the SGVs are just one part. It provides a scientifically-based framework for the assessment of land contamination and the risk to human health. That technical guidance also applies when we are considering regulatory action of proposals for development of the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.1/3">Under the CLEA methodology a wide range of guidance is available, not just from the Government but from external experts. The SGV taskforce is also considering the most recent guidance, contaminated land advice note 2/05, which addresses the short-term points, and a development team is working on additional technical guidance. It remains to be seen what will emerge from that work. However, as the CLAN indicates, it is recognised that we need something to bridge the gap between a tox value and an SGV properly applied. It also suggests how that will inform the assessor and what the legal test demands where part IIA of the Act is applied to an area of land. That should deal with the point about the long-term assessment in relation to the risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.1/4">As I mentioned, a number of sites fall into the category mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, many of them in the north-east because of its industrial legacy. In the majority of those cases, I am not aware of any long-term problems following remediation. in the majority of those cases. There may well be cases of which I am unaware, but once action has been taken to deal with remediation, there should be no reason for long-term blight. It is uncertainty and doubt which tend to cause blight on people's houses. As we have seen in the debate, the kind of doubts that can blight property values include questions about what figures mean and whether they mean that is contaminated or not. It can be difficult, but when those questions have been resolved and the contamination level and therefore what needs to be done have been clearly assessed, and when remedial action has been taken, the sites do not just technically comply with requirements in relation to contaminated land, but they legally comply with them as well. Post-remediation, there really should be no problem with the long-term future of those properties. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman and his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.1/5">Apart from applications for grants relating to the land, funding is available to help local authorities with their investigation, as well as the remedial costs. DEFRA has some funds available under the contaminated land capital projects programme. I am reluctant to make them public, but the hon. Gentleman has dragged the existence of that money out of me. About &pound;17 million is available to local authorities for carrying out their duties to investigate contaminated land in their area and seeing to its remediation. The Government's revenue support grant helps to cover local authorities' revenue expenditure. An element for that work was added to the RSG in 1997 to support the introduction and implementation of the regime. However, the local government finance system means that the RSG is not ring-fenced to particular functions; it is distributed on a generalised formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.1/6">The hon. Gentleman may like to know that East Cambridgeshire district council bid in 2004 for the Littleport site and received &pound;17,000 for the investigation. A further bid was made in 2005&ndash;06 for just over &pound;17,000, which was also approved. Those sums of money are for investigations to help the council to decide whether the land presents an unacceptable risk, and therefore needs to be formally determined as contaminated land under part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.1/7">DEFRA has issued a letter of intent for a successful bid. Once expenditure takes place on site, a sum is added to the Government's RSG settlement. Support is based on the notional cost of borrowing money and of paying it back over 20 years, and distributed in accordance with the RSG formula. The relevance of this, as I mentioned, is significant harm. So I can tell the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire that there are guidelines, and that they are being revised. Some of the points raised in the debate are being addressed through the taskforce. There is financial help to assist councils in addressing those issues, and providing the reassurance and security that his constituents, and those of other hon. Members, clearly want.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-22a.370.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="370"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051122/halltext/51122h02.htm#51122h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.370.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss this subject. It affects a vast number of people throughout the world and there are various ways in which we, as a major industrial trading power, can help to eliminate such a scourge. I wish to declare an interest. It is not in any sense financial, but I am a trustee of Dalit Solidarity Network UK. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase> is also an active member of that organisation. I have attended several conferences on the network's behalf in this country and I have also spoken at Dalit Solidarity Network events in Mumbai in India.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/2">The work of the Dalit Solidarity Network is to give voice to a group of people mainly in India and Nepal, but also in other parts of the world, who are grievously discriminated against. It puts pressure on European and north American Governments to do something about that and to use the international legal system, through the United Nations and the United Nations Committee on Human Rights, to give strength to the cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/3">Caste discrimination is an hereditary system of discrimination that comes from a perversion of the values of Hinduism in India and which, in the case of Africa, is a similar corruption of mentality, but just as brutal in its discrimination. The number of people throughout the world who suffer caste discrimination is astonishing. Those who are seriously discriminated against amount to 300 million people. That number is equivalent to the population of the United States of America or to the population of all of western Europe. Those people lose out on education, housing, employment and job opportunities. They lose out on life. They suffer death by violence, death by poverty and death by illness because health care is not available to them. As a planet, we condemn 300 million people to the worst living standards and to have shorter lives than would otherwise be the case. Discrimination has brutal consequences. It is hard for us in the west to understand fully how bad the position is.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/4">A Dalit is the modern form of untouchable. When translated, it means broken people. The magazine <i>New Internationalist </i>quotes Narayanamma, a toilet cleaner in India. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/5" class="indent">&quot;'In the rainy season,' the woman began, 'it is really bad. Water mixes with the'&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/6">excrement&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/7" class="indent">&quot;'and we carry it (on our heads) it drips from the baskets, on to our clothes, our bodies, our faces. When I return home I find it difficult to eat food sometimes. The smell never gets out of my clothes, my hair. But this is our fate. To feed my children I have no option but to do this work.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/8">The magazine then well describes the differences in modern India. For example, major railway stations have internet connections, western cappuccino bars, fast food restaurants, people in smart suits and so on. However, 100 m away from those areas, to the backs of the stations and the toilets, are groups of people using the most primitive equipment and who are treated in the most disgusting way. They are the &quot;untouchables&quot;&mdash;the Dalit people, who exist throughout India because of a perversion of the values of Hinduism and because it suits the wealthy and powerful to ensure that they continue to exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/9">It is not as though the problem has not been recognised. Let me outline the social indicators. The infant mortality rate is 83 per 100,000 for Dalits and 61.8 per 100,000 for non-Dalits. The child mortality rate is 39 per 100,000 for Dalits and 22 per 100,000 for non-Dalits. The figure for undernourishment is 54 per 100,000 for Dalits and 41 per 100,000 for non-Dalits. The level of self-employment in agriculture, rather than employment as day labourers, is 16 per cent. for rural Dalits and 41 per cent. for rural non-Dalits. The level of self-employment in non-agriculture is 10 per cent. for rural Dalits and 14 for rural non-Dalits. The poverty rate exemplifies the pattern, and the level of poverty that exists among the Dalit people throughout Indian cities and villages is appalling by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/10">As if the poverty and the discrimination are not bad enough, the violence that goes with it is shocking. Many stories could be quoted, and many issues are raised in various local and international media on the subject, but I will just quote a <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-31">31 August</phrase> report, which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/11" class="indent">&quot;In one of the worst ever instances of caste violence in Haryana, upper caste villages belonging to the Jat community in Gohana village near Sonepat burnt down 60 houses of Dalits today. The officials, however, say about 40 houses were burnt.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/12" class="indent">That pattern of practice by officials is normal. The Dalits were attacked because it was &quot;apparently suspected&quot; that a Dalit murdered somebody else the previous week. The report continues by detailing the murder, violence and the burning of homes that occurred. Unfortunately, such events are common.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/13">That is not to say that India has not sought to address the problem. Gandhi clearly recognised the discrimination against the untouchable people. During all his marches he sought to seek them out and to work with them. He also sought their protection in the Indian constitution, which, ironically was written by Ambedkar, a Dalit. I shall return to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/14">It also must be said that India, as the home of the majority of Dalit people in the world&mdash;the majority of people who suffer from caste discrimination&mdash;is reluctant to have the issue raised internationally. It is to the credit of the Dalit Solidarity Network worldwide and of the Dalit movements in India that the issue was finally brought more to the world's attention in the 2001 summit against racism that was held in Durban.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/15">The Indian Government moved might and main to prevent the subject from being raised in India at all. They said that caste discrimination was not the same as racism and that it should not be equated with what had happened in apartheid South Africa or with the degree of discrimination that existed in the southern states of the USA before the Civil Rights Act. They said it was not of that order and that it was more of a cultural issue. It might well have a cultural basis&mdash;or a perversion of such a basis&mdash;in where it started, but the reality is that it condemns generations of people to a second-class existence when they should be able to have a first-class one.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/16">It is also important to recognise that the problem is now being more widely understood. Such discrimination does not apply just in India, but in Nepal&mdash;I will discuss that a bit later&mdash;and parts of west Africa, notably in Burkina Faso and Senegal. The same degree of discrimination applies, with the same degree of people not being allowed to go into restaurants or cafes, not being allowed to use the same utensils as other people and not being allowed to undertake any skilled work&mdash;only for such people are the foul jobs of cleaning sewers, sweeping streets and that type of thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/17">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office also recognises that. The excellent Library briefing for the debate includes an extract from the FCO human rights report of 2005, page 213 of which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/18" class="indent">&quot;In many parts of India caste discrimination remains a problem, despite being outlawed under the Indian constitution of 1950. Dalits&mdash;formerly &quot;untouchables&quot; but now known as &quot;scheduled castes&quot;&mdash;make up 16 per cent of India's population (this is approximately two and a half times the population of the UK). A proportional number of seats in both union and state assemblies are reserved for scheduled castes . . . However, many people continue to view Dalits as below the caste system and they are among the most disadvantaged and vulnerable of all Indians. Dalits have poor access to public services such as education, health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/19">The report mentions that Dalits are reduced to jobs such as &quot;manual scavenging&quot;. It also points out that when aid is delivered when a natural disaster, such as the tsunami, takes place, the solution to the problem, obviously, is to assist people at a time of desperate emergency. However, in assisting those people, who loses out but the Dalit people? They are last in line to get water, food, clothes and a place of safety in which to live.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/20">There was a national public hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-30">30 August</phrase> in Chennai, Tamil Nadu on discrimination against Dalits in tsunami relief and rehabilitation. I shall not quote the entire document, as it is long, but I have selected some of the observations made by the jury of experts who assessed the effects of tsunami relief. It said:</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/21" class="indent">&quot;The jury panel observed that there is discrimination in distributing relief and rehabilitation during tsunami. Particularly the revenue officials and the district administration that were carrying out the relief operations have neglected the requests made by Dalits and not provided the relief materials.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/22">The report goes on to state:</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/23" class="indent">&quot;the relief materials distributed to the Dalits have been plundered&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/24">by others, and that the</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/25" class="indent">&quot;district administration appointed for monitoring the distribution was inactive and silent in curbing these atrocities . . . During our visit to the tsunami affected areas, we could see that the temporary shelters constructed by both the Government and the NGOs have segregated the Dalits and the fishermen.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/26" class="indent">We feel that it is the duty of the Government to bring peace and harmony between the communities where already exists the concept of discrimination. Instead the relief operation carried out by the government of Tamil Nadu has widened the division between the Dalits and non-Dalits.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/27">Those millions of people around the world who responded so magnificently to the tsunami disaster did not give their money so that it could be distributed unfairly. They made a humanitarian gesture to ensure that everybody got a fair share of the aid, but the Dalit people certainly did not get a fair share. When my right hon. Friend the Minister replies, I hope that he will offer some assurance on that. I am not blaming the British Government. The concern is whether the aid got through fairly, and, clearly, the evidence is that it absolutely did not.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/28">Despite Indian objections, the Durban conference managed to raise several important issues. I want to deal with what is, obviously, a terrible scourge on the face of the earth. First, I recognise the strong position of Indian law and the Indian constitution on the matter. However, the reality at town and village level, and in society, is that the scheduled caste reservation system, which provides for reserved places in state and federal elections and other things in India, works for a small number of people but not for the majority. It does not work for the majority of Dalit people, who continue to be extremely badly treated.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/29">To address the issue, we should consider the Ambedkar principles, which were drafted after a great deal of debate among the community in India, among the exiled community and among the Dalit Solidarity Network worldwide. The Ambedkar principles are based on the work of Ambedkar, a brilliant man who was the author of the Indian constitution. I shall not read all of the document, as it is long, but I shall quote parts of it. Those who have been involved in Irish issues over the years will recognise some similarity with the MacBride principles on employment practices which were eventually introduced in Northern Ireland. They helped to reduce the discrimination that clearly existed there. The principles state:</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/30" class="indent">&quot;The Signatories of these Principles, building on existing national anti-discrimination laws and policies and in the spirit of internationally recognised human and employment rights will . . . Include in any statement of employment policy a reference to the unacceptability of caste discrimination and a commitment to seeking to eliminate it . . . Develop . . . a plan of affirmative action, including training on caste discrimination for all employees and making specific reference to Dalit women&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/31">Then there is this important principle:</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/32" class="indent">&quot;Ensure the company and its suppliers comply with all national legislation, particularly in relation to bonded labour, manual scavenging, child labour, pay specific attention to the role that caste relations might play in legitimising or covering up such forms of labour, and contribute actively to the implementation of existing anti-caste laws such as the Civil Rights Act and the Prevention of Atrocities Act.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/33">Supplementary principles were approved later, at a conference in Kathmandu in November and December 2004. I shall quote a few of them, because they are important:</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/34" class="indent">&quot;Ensure that all corporate support to community development programmes and other charitable activities in caste-affected countries or areas includes the participation of Dalits and requires that they receive at least an equal share in any benefits . . . Avoid abuse of local resources to the detriment of local communities, e.g. water, energy . . . Aim to ensure nothing is done which may drive local communities towards ecologically insensitive activities or the desperation of violent protest&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/35">It is easy to stir up violent protest against people. In some parts of the world, that is a cheap way to develop a political career. Those demands are stated because there is a high amount of foreign investment in India and it is important that the situation is addressed. The support of the global companies that are investing in India is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/36">Dalit Solidarity Network UK produced a solid report on caste discrimination in the private sector. It lays down a number of demands that should be made of the private sector companies that invest in India. It has started talks with HSBC bank, Lloyds TSB, Standard Chartered and Barclays about their investment strategies. We have also sought to put what pressure we can on the International Labour Organisation to do far more to protect Dalit people and those who suffer caste discrimination around the world, and to support the activities of the Dalit Solidarity Network.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/37">This matter has also been brought to the attention of the United States Congress. A submission was made to it in which the following points were made:</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/38" class="indent">&quot;The Indian government 'condones, ignores and in some instances, has even promoted . . . massive catalogues of human rights violations . . . All too often, enforcement of laws protecting human rights has been weak or non-existent' . . . While most Dalits lived in extreme poverty . . . Hindu extremists resented gains made by this oppressed group which benefited from education and medical programmes launched by Christian missionaries.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/39">That leads to further violence against individuals. The report continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/40" class="indent">&quot;Amnesty International's Asia advocacy director T Kumar told the hearing that the Indian government should fully enforce laws against discrimination on the basis of caste and descent, and rein in groups, including the police, which he said had discriminated against Dalits.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/41">So the problem has been brought to the attention of western Governments, the European Union and the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/42">There is a point that I hope the Minister will address. The subject has been raised at the United Nations. India is required to report to the UN on what it has done in terms of anti-discrimination activities since 1998 to eliminate systematic discrimination against the scheduled castes and the poorest people in India. So far as I am aware, India has yet to report.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/43">The British Government have raised the matter at least once with the Indian Government during bilateral discussions, and I would be interested to learn what further contact the Minister has had with the Indian Government and what requirements are placed on our representatives at the UN Committee on Human Rights and at anti-discrimination conferences of the UN to ensure that we take the problem seriously in terms of implementing the UN charter on human rights and our anti-discrimination undertakings, and of our overseas aid policies and strategy and our investment strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/44">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-24">24 October</phrase>, Dalit Solidarity Network UK sent a letter to the Minister for the Middle East, which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/45" class="indent">&quot;As far as we can understand what is happening, the Study&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/46">the study that the UN required&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/47" class="indent">&quot;has not yet got underway. This appears to be due to a combination of bureaucracy and lack of resources. We are hearing that the necessary Consultation Workshops, to be held in Africa and Asia, cannot go ahead until the Commission has agreed the necessary resources next March/April. This will be a year into the life of the Study, and such Workshops could not then be arranged presumably for another six months&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/48">We must have far more action far more quickly and far more vigorously to ensure that that dreadful situation is addressed properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/49">I should also be grateful if the Minister outlines the Government's thinking on the possibility of amending race relations laws to make caste discrimination illegal. There is some evidence&mdash;quite hard to collect&mdash;that although the degree of caste discrimination in India is extreme, it exists in other parts of the world, such as communities in western Europe, including this country. We must address that problem, uncomfortable and difficult though it may be. Discrimination is wrong, period, whichever group or community and whomever suffers from it. We would do the world and those poor unfortunate people who suffer caste discrimination a good service if we took a more vigorous attitude towards discrimination and led on those matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/50">In 2004 I had the great privilege of attending the World Social Forum in Mumbai. It was attended by more than 100,000 people. They were mostly from south Asia but, as a world forum, there were also delegations from elsewhere. The opening coincided with the completion of a Dalit rights march throughout India. The people recreated the great marches of Gandhi and demanded justice. Their joy, the sense of recognition that those people received, and their sense of liberation when they got to the forum is something that will always live with me. Some of the same people attended the conference in Durban, and they travel around the world doing their best to bring about justice for those people. It is up to us to do what we can.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/51">One Indian President, Narayanan, made it to President despite being a Dalit&mdash;an untouchable. He did so by good luck, brilliance, force of circumstances and the incredible generosity of one or two individuals who helped him throughout his life. After he ceased to be President, he gave an interesting interview in which he was asked what he thought about the Dalit people. After describing the horrors that they faced, he was asked how their situation could be changed. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/52" class="indent">&quot;Revolution has to come from below&mdash;through education and through protest from the oppressed people. We need to gather much more momentum, from world opinion, human-rights groups, etc. We need to give up the bitterness and move on. To be proud of being Dalits. Learn from the Black Panthers, the Black is Beautiful movement. Assert Dalit pride. Only then will we learn to express and assert ourselves. I believe that ultimately we will overcome.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/53">That is a brilliant statement from a man who has been to the top of the mountain and become the President of his country.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/54">I hope that the Government, the House and the country join in that campaign to end the scourge of discrimination based on caste which afflicts 300 million people throughout the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.375.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has achieved what I was not able to, and I am delighted to be discussing this important issue in front of a number of people who have come along to listen to our debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/2">I shall start with a quotation from my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade, who has responsibility for trade promotion and inward investment at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in addition to his ministerial role at the Department of Trade and Industry. In a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-31">31 August</phrase> to the Rev. David Haslam, who, as chair of Dalit Solidarity Network UK, of which I am a member, is listening in the Chamber today, my hon. Friend said:</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Caste-based discrimination is a contemporary form of slavery.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/4">He is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/5">We fought hard to get rid of slavery 150 years ago. Slavery is a moral outrage, and there is a material-analysis reason for getting rid of it. As well as the moral outrage and the destroyed lives, slavery is an economically inefficient way of organising a society. That is what the American civil war was about: morals and a materialist analysis. We should bear that in mind when we campaign against caste-based discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/6">A year ago, I had the great pleasure of visiting Punjab state in India on a private visit, where 55 per cent. of the population is Sikh. There is still caste discrimination in Punjab state, as there is across India and Nepal, and in Africa, and so on. I am chair of the all-party group on UK Sikhs. We have to recognise that one of the tenets of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, was to get rid of caste-based discrimination. He has not succeeded yet. Sadly, there is still caste-based discrimination, even in Sikhism.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/7">We have caste-based discrimination here in the UK. Those who know the UK south Asian community quite well, and I count myself as one of those, can sometimes see, by looking at south Asians and those from a south Asian background, from what caste they have come&mdash;because of systematic discrimination for 2,500 years. Dalit people look different. That is reproduced in this country. Sometimes, sadly, here in the UK, it is possible to get a sense of which is a Dalit and which is a Jat temple, or gurdwara, on visiting them. Caste exists in this country, as well as in south Asia and Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/8">The Dr. Ambedkar memorial committee in my constituency has a large community hall. I am familiar with the doctor's work. He was born in the late 19th century as a Dalit, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North said, and obtained a PhD through patronage. He was an economist, philosopher, sociologist, member of the London Bar and one of the most distinguished Indians who ever lived; he was a brilliant man. He was chair of the committee that wrote the constitution of India and rose, through patronage, from being a Dalit. However, like President Narayan, he did not forget whence he came. In fact, in 1956, in the final year of his life, after decades of frustration with the reactionary elements of Hinduism&mdash;although I stress that by no means all Hindus are reactionary on caste&mdash;Dr. Ambedkar, with thousands of others, led a mass conversion to Buddhism, as my hon. Friend may know. His touchstone was &quot;Educate, agitate and organise&quot;&mdash;and he did that all his life on the part of the downtrodden of India, before partition and afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/9">Education is one of the keys, but it has to be backed up by resources, a will to act and more than just fine words. United Kingdom companies operating in the subcontinent have a particular responsibility, because of the history between the United Kingdom and south Asia, for the way that they operate and how they treat Dalit scheduled castes. My hon. Friend said that he would not read all the Ambedkar principles, and I understand that. They are contained in a handy book called &quot;Caste Discrimination and the Private Sector: Employment Principles for Foreign Investors in South Asia&quot;, published this year by the Dalit Solidarity Network UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/10">There are 10 calls to action at the conclusion of the Ambedkar principles. I shall paraphrase them. An employer should have a statement of employment policy, including a reference to the unacceptability of caste discrimination and a plan of affirmative action; they should avoid any form of bonded or indentured labour; they should use fair recruitment selection and career development processes and take full responsibility for their work force, evolve comprehensive training opportunities, designate a manager at an appropriate level to monitor the issue and have effective monitoring. They should also publish an annual report on progress and ensure that all corporate support to community development programmes includes the participation of Dalits. That is the call to action under the Ambedkar principles. United Kingdom companies that operate in India and Nepal in particular should sign up to those principles and that course of action.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/11">I am fortunate enough to be a member of the Trade and Industry Committee, which has announced that, in this Parliament, we will conduct an inquiry into trade and investment opportunities between India and the United Kingdom. That is not surprising, in terms of globalisation; it is such an important country, and such a long-standing friend of the United Kingdom. One of the things that I wish to look into is what UK companies investing in India are doing in terms of corporate social responsibility and the Ambedkar employment principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/12">As we know from what our Government have done to assist the most disadvantaged in our society&mdash;they are incomparably more advantaged than the most disadvantaged in India, Nepal and Africa who face caste discrimination&mdash;the dignity of employment, employment opportunities, and education and skills training to get into those jobs are absolutely central. United Kingdom and European developed-world companies that invest in India have a particular responsibility to try to assist the most downtrodden: the Dalits.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/13">My hon. Friend referred to the difficulties that the United Kingdom faces when the Department for International Development offers aid support, and when UK-based charities try to assist in India after natural disasters there. He also mentioned the issue of unequal distribution of aid, and who loses out. One reason why Dalits lose out is that often they have been denied the educational opportunities that would allow them to hold positions of responsibility and to hand out the money. So, the old caste-based discrimination reinforces itself again.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/14">Sometimes, but not always, those of higher caste who are handing out the money&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;do not take enough trouble to ensure that the most disadvantaged, the Dalits, get the aid. That was the case with the distribution after the recent tsunami, the Gujarat earthquake, and, before that, the Orissa hurricane. That happens all too frequently. I am delighted that DFID has moved on that issue, in terms of both what it says and what it demands when handing out development moneys in India after such disasters.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/15">I am also pleased that DFID has a programme, worth &pound;27 million over nine years, to provide funding to civil society organisations in the 100 poorest districts in India. That programme is addressing discrimination against Dalits and supporting marginalised peoples. I salute DFID and the Government for taking that line.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/16">I have some questions for the Minister, as is traditional in these Adjournment debates. First, what have our Government done to address allegations of discrimination based on caste in the recruitment of Gurkhas from Nepal? What have they done about the experiences of Dalits who have joined that wonderful band of armed fighting men and women? There have been serious allegations of discrimination, as regards both recruitment and what happens to those recruited, in terms of their career progression&mdash;or, according to the allegations, lack of career progression.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/17">I reinforce what my hon. Friend said about the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. As I understand it, the report is eight years overdue. India&mdash;understandably, given its size, maturity and importance in the world&mdash;wishes to gain a seat on the UN Security Council. However, if in eight years it cannot produce a report on this fundamental issue, which covers a quarter of its population, for the moment at least, it would not be appropriate for India to be on the Security Council. We are not talking about a report on discrimination against a couple of thousand people, important as that might be; we are talking about discrimination against a quarter of the population of what may now be the most, or at least the second most, populous country in the world. Yet it cannot do a report in eight years. What are our Government doing to encourage the Government of India, through the United Nations, to come up with that report?</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/18">I salute the fact that the UK, during its presidency of the European Union thus far&mdash;there are another five or six weeks to run&mdash;has gotten the EU to appoint two special rapporteurs to prepare a detailed study on discrimination based on work and dissent. However, I would like to know what steps the Government, through the EU, have taken with the Government of India to ensure that those rapporteurs have full access. I know from my work with the all-party parliamentary group on UK Sikhs and, during the previous Parliament, the all-party group on Panjabis in Britain, about the lack of access to the Punjab state for the UN special rapporteurs on human rights who, 21 years after the appalling events of 1984, the storming of the Golden Temple, the pogroms in Delhi and so on, are still blocked out and not allowed in to investigate. Will the two EU special rapporteurs be allowed to investigate caste-based discrimination in India and to do a proper job there?</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/19">To reinforce what my hon. Friend said, I would like to know what the UK Government are doing to encourage UK companies that invest and operate in India to follow the Ambedkar principles.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-22a.378.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" speakername="Nicholas Clegg" colnum="378"  time="011:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051122/halltext/51122h02.htm#51122h02_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.378.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on securing a debate on such a crucial topic.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/2">A question that I asked myself&mdash;it might be worthy of ventilation here&mdash;is why such a grotesque and systematic abuse of human rights on such a huge scale is so little known about and so little debated. I confess that when preparing for the debate, the scales fell from my eyes as I appreciated the reality of a problem. I was not fully aware of it&mdash;I have not visited India and it is not a part of the world that I know well&mdash;and my experience may show why.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/3">I studied social anthropology at university and pored over textbooks about the caste system in the Asian subcontinent. We were asked to reflect on the history of the caste system through a prism of moral relativism, which implicitly, if not explicitly, suggested that the caste system and the abuses suffered by the victims of the system were so ingrained in the complex history of society in India and other Asian nations as to be somehow beyond the reach of moral or political judgment or influence from outside. That moral relativism towards something that undeniably exists is complex and has profound religious, historical, social and cultural antecedents. It has prevented the political class in this country and elsewhere from turning the spotlight on a problem as fully and sustainably as it deserves to be. The reticence to deal with the issue as forcibly as it clearly requires is no longer sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/4">As the hon. Gentleman eloquently illustrated, the scale of the abuse is perhaps without historical precedent. There has been appalling human rights abuse at specific times and in specific places, but for that abuse to take place on such a scale, covering almost 300 million people over such a long period, is almost unique. I am not aware of any other cruelty that has been so durable. The grotesque nature of the abuse cannot be ignored any longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/5">I challenge everyone to read the Amnesty International report submitted to the hearing of the US Congress. I dare not read out the section on the scale, nature and cruelty of the abuse suffered by Dalit women in particular. The descriptions of rape and gang rape are about as grotesque as anything one could possibly read.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/6">It is, perhaps, politically important that that abuse is illegal under India's own legislation. That is crucial, and I shall refer to it later. I do not underestimate the difficulty of shifting patterns of behaviour that are inseparable from the social and political history of India, and the cultural patterns and prejudices involved. Nor do I underestimate the sensitivity of external voices, here or elsewhere, seeking from afar to influence conditions on the ground. However, as the hon. Member for Islington, North and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase> made abundantly clear, the need for urgent action is now overwhelming.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/7">In addition to the excellent points already made, I want emphasise the ways in which fruitful activity could be undertaken. Given that the nature of the abuses suffered by the Dalit community are intimately associated with long-standing prejudices shared by many millions of Indians from other castes, the need to tackle in the classroom the nature of some fundamental prejudices is of paramount importance. Again, I do not underestimate how difficult it is to do that from the outside, but every effort should be taken by the Department for International Development, the European Union and all other donor organisations&mdash;they provide assistance to the tune of several hundred million pounds for the Indian education system&mdash;to associate aid closely with the requirement to tackle underlying cultural and social prejudices that sustain that level of human rights abuse over such a long period. I am keen to hear whether the Minister thinks that anything can be done, through bilateral and multilateral aid, to influence the way in which the problem is tackled in classrooms in schools in villages and cities throughout India.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/8">It is worth reiterating how clear and unambiguous India's legislation is on that point. The Library briefing&mdash;excellent, as ever&mdash;says:</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Article 17 of the Constitution of India states that the practice of 'untouchability' is abolished and forbidden.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/10">Legislation to criminalise abuses against so-called scheduled castes and tribes began in 1955 with the Protection of Civil Rights Act. That was supplemented by the enactment of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in 1989 and, most recently, the rules of 1995, which extended the scope of abuses that were criminalised and provided for ever graver penalties.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.0/11">The protection afforded to the Dalit and scheduled castes and tribes in those Acts is extensive&mdash;I would even use the word &quot;progressive&quot;. They include, for instance, the provision of legal aid and travel expenses for witnesses and victims attending trials. However, the fact that the legislation, which stipulates the constitutional requirement and prohibits the abuses suffered by the Dalit community, is ignored by the police and courts is of legitimate external concern. We even have the perverse example of other laws&mdash;the National Security Act, the Explosives Act and sections of the Indian penal code&mdash;being invoked to override those protections. Given that the abuses are taking place and that they fly directly in the face of the legal protections incorporated in the constitution and Indian law, it is right that the moral outrage that we all feel, because of the nature of the abuses suffered, is also directed at the simple failure to abide by the rule of law, which is one of the founding principles of all mature democracies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-22a.384.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe"  colnum="384"  time="012:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051122/halltext/51122h02.htm#51122h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.384.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> for calling this debate. Let me begin by placing on the record my personal admiration for his efforts over several years on this issue. He has been supported by the Rev. David Haslam, the Dalit Solidarity Network and, as a colleague recognised, a growing number of British Church people who, quite reasonably, are greatly concerned about the injustice. Their campaign has been worthwhile. This is one of several Adjournment debates on the subject and I regret and fear that it will not be the last, as we face an enduring challenge. None the less, it is right to recognise the campaigners' considerable efforts to bring the issue to the attention not just of the Government but of the wider audience in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> challenged me to offer specific measures. I hope that he will exercise some forbearance and allow me to set out some general points before I address the wide range of questions that were put to me by each speaker in turn.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/3">The Government firmly believe that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out in the universal declaration of human rights, without discrimination of any kind. Discrimination based on descent, to give it the title used by the UN convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination, encapsulates discrimination based on forms of social stratification&mdash;caste or similar systems of inherited status&mdash;that impair a person's equal enjoyment of their human rights. Caste discrimination of the type found in India, which has featured prominently in this debate, is the most well-known example of discrimination based on descent. In that system, in which social mobility is severely limited and status is completely ascribed, the Dalits, or untouchables, about whose plight we have heard so much this morning, suffer multiple forms of discrimination and are typically assigned tasks or occupations that are considered filthy or polluting.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/4">However, it is not only in south or south-east Asia that caste-like practices, including discrimination based on occupation and descent from slaves, are found. As we have heard today, they are also found in other parts of the world such as Africa. The discrimination suffered by such communities takes the form of a variety of human rights violations, including the lack of ability to alter inherited status; restrictions on marriage outside the community; private and public segregation in housing, health and education, and in access to public spaces, places of worship and even sources of food and water; inability to renounce inherited occupations or degrading or hazardous work; subjection to debt bondage; subjection to dehumanising references such as &quot;polluting&quot; or &quot;untouchable&quot;; and a general lack of respect for their human dignity and equality.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/5">Discrimination based on caste or descent determines an individual's position in the social and economic hierarchy, not on the basis of merit but of heritage. It perpetuates social exclusion and reduces the rate at which poverty reduction can be achieved, as the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire said. The framework of international covenants and national legislation outlawing discrimination based on descent is an important step towards its elimination, but it has not been enough, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" name="Nicholas Clegg">the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg)</phrase> pointed out.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/6">As we all know, such practices remain all too entrenched despite the many international commitments made by the countries in question. It is therefore important that the international community engages at a more practical level to help to implement such commitments. One example of engagement is the child health programme: the Department for International Development has worked with the Indian Ministry of Health to develop targets for including Dalit and Adivasi women and children in the programme. It has worked hard with other donors to develop a monitoring system and incentives to ensure that such women are included. DFID supports similar initiatives in education and other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/7">It is clear that deep-rooted social attitudes and customs must also change. Of course, that is a much more difficult task, as was recognised by some of the speakers this morning. We welcome the fact that that is beginning to happen through natural social change. Migration, urbanisation, greater contact with other societies and new forms of employment all have an effect, but we can and must do more. We must encourage states, for example, to be proactive in tackling prejudice and changing behaviour to ensure that socially excluded groups benefit from public expenditure and have access to services such as health care and education.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/8">Some hon. Members raised the question of tsunami relief in that context. The British public gave to that cause in record numbers almost a year ago, as did the Government. Unfortunately, media reports suggest that Dalits have experienced discrimination and difficulties in gaining access to emergency aid, but the Foreign Office's assessment is that that has been localised and complex, rather than universal. For DFID, I understand that emergency funding and first-stage rehabilitation require a demonstration of an appreciation of social issues and a strategy for addressing the issue of caste discrimination when targeting aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/9">The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire brought to the attention of the House the full range of countries where the practices we have been discussing exist, and my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North spoke about Senegal. We understand that there is a form of caste system in that country based on occupation, affecting blacksmiths and griots&mdash;traditional troubadours&mdash;in particular, and that marriage outside the caste system is strongly discouraged. An offer that I can make to my hon. Friend is that I will ask our desk officer in the relevant embassy to raise his concerns and write to my hon. Friend about the specific matter that he raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/10">I was asked what action we are taking through the United Nations or European Union. We and our EU partners are of course committed to the promotion of all people's human rights and we continue to raise the subject of discrimination based on work and descent in our meetings with the Governments of the affected countries. The Prime Minister, as president of the EU, led the EU-Indian summit at Delhi on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-07">7 September</phrase>. During the summit an EU-India joint action plan was agreed, identifying key areas in which the EU and India agree to work together, and one such area, I am glad to say, is human rights. The UK presidency is planning to take that human rights dialogue forward before the end of the year and is consulting EU partners and the Government of India on the form, content and date of the dialogue. The British high commission in New Delhi has also discussed the issues with the Indian National Commission for Minorities and National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, as well as state level authorities, drawing their attention to British parliamentary and public concern. It will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/11">My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North raised the Ambedkar principles. We are aware of the work that the International Dalit Solidarity Network has undertaken. I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1937" name="Rob Marris">the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris)</phrase> for raising the specific challenge to British business that was contained in the documentation provided. I should be grateful, however, if the network provided the Foreign Office with a comprehensive outline of the proposals, as we have only the summary document that my hon. Friend mentioned.</p>

	<p pid="a.387.1/1">The challenge is complex. I do not claim that the complexity of British government quite matches the scale of that challenge, but as my hon. Friend will know, the Department of Trade and Industry leads on the issue of corporate social responsibility. There is a locus for the Trade Minister in the Foreign Office, who is not present in the Chamber today. I shall certainly pass on my hon. Friend's request. I am aware that in the past Ministers have raised the question of foreign investors' corporate social responsibility and I shall offer my hon. Friend's suggestion to my colleagues.</p>

	<p pid="a.387.2/1">I apologise for asking the Minister a question that I did not raise in my speech; I shall understand if he needs to confer with ministerial colleagues before he replies to me. We have heard a few examples today suggesting that caste discrimination is being practised in the UK. Given that the Equality Bill is before the House at the moment, will the Minister undertake to raise the issue with his colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry so that we can be absolutely sure that if caste discrimination is occurring in the UK, an amendment covering that issue can be tabled?</p>

	<p pid="a.387.3/1">The hon. Gentleman anticipates the more general point to which I was coming about the evidence that would need to be produced. To add further to the layers of complexity, I think that the Home Office would be involved in what he suggests, given its responsibility for the single equality commission. I happily undertake to make my colleagues in the Home Office aware of the points raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.3/2">Of course we are concerned by reports of discrimination against Dalit and other minority communities in India&mdash;as I said, the British high commission in New Delhi has raised them on various occasions. During the meeting of the Commission on Human Rights, the European Union expressed concern about discrimination based on caste and supported the decision to appoint two special rapporteurs to prepare a detailed study on discrimination based on work and descent.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.3/3">The fight against racism, xenophobia and discrimination against minorities and indigenous people is a priority for funding under the European initiative for democracy and human rights. A call for proposals was launched in January 2005. The projects selected will provide a concrete follow-up to the Durban declaration and programme of action of 2001, and activities to combat caste discrimination are eligible for support. Oxfam, along with other local partners, is already running one such project in Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.3/4">Let me respond to a couple of the other points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North about how the United Kingdom Government contribute to persuading the Indian Government to make their report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Race Discrimination. As we heard this morning, that report is now eight years overdue. A prompt submission of reports to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Race Discrimination by all state parties is a key part of the international framework to combat discrimination, and we are therefore concerned about the delay in India's reporting. It is right that we encourage authorities to submit prompt and comprehensive reports, including on the situation of scheduled castes. Together with our European Union partners, we will continue to take every suitable opportunity to make clear our collective concerns on this and related matters. We aim to discuss that with our European Union partners when putting together the proposed human rights dialogue, of which I spoke a few moments ago, and we anticipate that that will take place towards the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.3/5">I was asked whether there had been any follow-up to the UN Commission on Human Rights study in 2004 and whether the United Kingdom could encourage that to be brought forward. At the Commission on Human Rights, the European Union expressed concern about discrimination based on caste and supported the decision to appoint two special rapporteurs of the sub-commission, about whom we heard from the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire, to prepare a detailed study on discrimination based on work and descent. Since then, the experts have been working with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on what they are permitted to do under their mandate. In particular, they would like, I understand, to hold regional consultations&mdash;ideally in the Indian subcontinent, Japan and west Africa, and possibly Senegal. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has told them that it does not think that they can organise UN consultations, given that that was not explicitly provided for in the mandate. Strictly speaking, from a financial perspective, that may be correct, as no consultations were provided for in the budget approved for the study, but the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is considering whether to hold such consultations and fund them from some other part of the budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.389.0/1">The first priority is to make sure that the special rapporteurs are able to do their work. Although I shall certainly bear in mind my hon. Friend's suggestion, it seems to me that the first priority is to support the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in its efforts to make sure that if there is an alternative means by which that work can be undertaken in the meantime, that should be a priority. For the time being, the rapporteurs have been working on a questionnaire on the issue to distribute to all missions, which I understand should be ready for distribution by the end of November.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/2">The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam raised a related question: what has the United Kingdom done on caste discrimination during its presidency of the European Union? It is right to recognise that the Prime Minister, as president of the European Union, took part in the summit in Delhi on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-07">7 September</phrase>, during which an EU-India joint action plan was also agreed. One of the areas under question was human rights. The form, content and date of the dialogue is still under discussion with our European Union partners, but it is possible that the reporting and access for the special rapporteurs could form part of that consultation. I will reflect on the points that have been put to me today as we take forward our discussion with European Union partners on that human rights dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/3">More generally, the hon. Gentleman said that there was a challenge in working with the Indian Government to ensure not only that the international pressure is felt, but that domestic action is taken. One specific issue that was raised was the need for access to justice, and I am glad to say that specific action is being taken in that respect. The Department for International Development is making good progress on its partnership with the United Nations Development Programme and the Indian Government in developing the access to justice programme, which has recently been approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs and is now awaiting final approval from the Ministry of Finance to move to full design.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/4">To assist and to inform colleagues, I will say that the aim of the programme is to achieve real access to justice for poor and vulnerable groups in India, including Dalits. To that end, DFID India has contacts at various levels in the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, and also with other groups and institutions that work on Dalit issues. The views and issues of poor and vulnerable groups, including Dalits, will be the driving force behind the design and implementation of the access to justice programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/5">I was asked what the Indian Government were doing to help Dalits to get a better education, as well as access to the system of justice. One of the preceding contributions recognised that under the reservation provision India's quota system reserves approximately 26 per cent. of Government jobs in India for Dalits and other tribal groups. The aim is to bring them into the political and social mainstream. I understand that there are also reserved places in the education system for the same groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/6">The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam will appreciate that his specific point on conditionality of aid extends far beyond one country or one specific issue. I make an offer on behalf of my colleagues in DFID: perhaps they can write to him to deal with the general issue of conditionality in light of today's specific suggestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/7">The problem of caste-based or descent-based discrimination manifests itself in a range of thematic areas, including contemporary slavery, racism, religious discrimination, poverty reduction, and social exclusion. That means that there are many angles from which to raise, and to tackle, this issue. Wherever poverty adversely affects people's enjoyment of their rights, we support country-led development agendas. We also encourage partner Governments to develop policies to take into account the needs of all groups in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/8">A striking feature of caste discrimination is its intersection with bonded labour, where a person is required to give their labour as security for a loan. With literally nothing else on offer, that person is open to exploitation and is trapped into working for little or no pay until the debt is repaid. Sometimes, entire families are bonded or debts are passed down through generations. I say that with some personal feeling, given that when I was the Minister in the Foreign Office with responsibility for south Asia I had the privilege of visiting a DFID-funded project in Nepal. It provides land and a means of sustenance for former bonded labourers through the freed Kamaiya food security programme. It has supported a number of activities including income generation, scholarships and access to drinking water and sanitation, in partnership with international, national and local non-governmental organisations. The work continues through a number of smaller-scale projects under the community support programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/9">Mention of Nepal reminds me of the earlier point that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West raised in respect of the Gurkhas. I am aware that recruitment takes place in Nepal, but I was unaware of the specific issue that he identifies. I give an undertaking that I will raise that matter with the relevant Minister in the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/10">I can assure hon. Members that the Government take this issue seriously. It is an issue on which, not least on the basis of the discussion that we have had today, there is great strength of feeling in this House. I know of the concern that is felt not only by Members of this House but by the many campaigners outside the House who have brought the issue to the attention of parliamentarians. That is why I offer this assurance: we will continue in our efforts to address the poverty, injustice and discrimination to which this issue contributes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-22a.393.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry"  colnum="393"  time="012:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051122/halltext/51122h03.htm#51122h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.393.0/1">I am tempted to begin by saying that we must stop meeting like this, Miss Widdecombe. I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship and all the more so because I know of your keen interest in the rural post service. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" name="John Thurso">the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> on doing exactly what a constituency MP should do: representing the needs and concerns of his constituents in a matter that is exceedingly important to them. He has done that clearly and set out proper concerns about mail deliveries in his constituency. I hope that I shall be able to address all his points.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/2">It might be helpful if I begin by setting out the background to the restructuring of Royal Mail over the last four years, the universal service obligation, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, and the framework for UK postal services. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1676" name="Patricia Hewitt">the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt)</phrase>, then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, made two statements in the House in March 2002 and June 2002 following the announcements by Allan Leighton, the chairman of Royal Mail, then known as Consignia, about the company's three-year plan to restructure its postal services.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/3">Nobody could have disputed that restructuring of Royal Mail was needed. The company was showing a pre-tax loss of &pound;1.2 billion in 2001&ndash;02. Even allowing for exceptional costs from restructuring, there was still an underlying loss of &pound;318 million on day-to-day operations. The company was losing more than &pound;1 million every working day. The aim of the company's three-year renewal plan was to reduce costs by &pound;1.4 billion a year, wipe out these losses and return the business to profit by April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/4">I am pleased to say that Royal Mail has returned to profitability and the management have got to grips with costs and reduced overheads. The latest figures published last week for the half year to <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase> show that Royal Mail Group made an operating profit of &pound;159.3 million. These interim results show a 20.5 per cent. improvement on the previous year's figure. As hon. Members will have seen, that performance was tempered by the 1.2 per cent. fall in mail volumes and by the size of Royal Mail's pension deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/5">Nobody should underestimate Royal Mail's achievement. The chairman, board, management and particularly the work force should all be congratulated on their efforts to turn the company around. However, Royal Mail still faces a huge challenge to build on this success and secure long-term sustainable profitability in a liberalised postal services market.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/6">It was unfortunate, although perhaps not surprising, that Royal Mail's quality of delivery dipped for a while during the implementation of the renewal plan. There was a lot of media interest and justifiable concerns were expressed by customers about the poor performance they were receiving. However, it was a period of great change for Royal Mail&mdash;certainly the largest in its recent history and one with few parallels in British industry. Major changes were made simultaneously across Royal Mail's huge operational infrastructure&mdash;transport, sorting and delivery. Allan Leighton and Adam Crozier, Royal Mail's chief executive, held up their hands and apologised for the dip in service. Both gave personal assurances to the Government that they would give quality of service top priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/7">The quality-of-service figures for the first half of the year were published last week and they are very encouraging indeed. The delivery of first class stamped and metered mail stands at 93.9 per cent. and is thus running at record levels. That performance beats the newly increased target of 93 per cent. as well as any performance that Royal Mail has ever achieved in the past. In northern Scotland, the figures for the most recent period indicate that Royal Mail delivered more than 96 per cent. of first class letters the day after posting. Royal Mail believes that 11 of its 15 quality targets are achievable this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/8">We welcome those figures, which show a continued improvement in Royal Mail's quality of service results. Royal Mail and, in particular, the dedicated postmen and postwomen up and down the country, should be congratulated on their performance. However, the company recognises that it still needs to do a great deal. Market developments and changing customer needs continue to stimulate service improvement. Put simply, Royal Mail cannot take its customers for granted. Quality of service remains the board's top priority, because it cannot compete in a fully liberalised market if it does not get that right. The Government are confident that the company remains committed and determined to raise the quality of its service and that it will continue to focus special attention on those areas of the UK where local problems still undermine customer confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/9">The Government believe that they have established the right framework for the postal services market and Royal Mail. We have given Royal Mail greater commercial freedom in the public sector, established independent regulation as required by the EU postal services directives, and strengthened consumer representation. That policy was clearly set out in the White Paper &quot;Post Office Reform: A World Class Service for the 21st Century&quot;, which was published in 1999 and implemented through the Postal Services Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/10">Underpinning the framework is the continued provision of the universal service at affordable prices. That is my first assurance in response to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. That is why the obligation is enshrined in primary legislation in the Postal Services Act&mdash;the first time that any Government had done that&mdash;and why Postcomm's only statutory duty is to ensure the provision of a universal postal service at an affordable uniform tariff.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/11">The universal service as written into the law&mdash;in section 4 in part I of the Postal Services Act&mdash;guarantees the following: a delivery every working day to homes across the UK, a collection every working day from access points throughout the UK, and a uniform and affordable price for posting letters and parcels up to 2 kg. In layman's terms, the universal service means that anyone in the UK can post letters and parcels to any other part of the country at the same affordable rates. It guarantees one delivery of mail for every UK household and business six days a week and one collection of mail six days a week. The Government aim to ensure that all UK postal users have access to postal services that are efficient, innovative and responsive to their needs. As the only licensed universal service provider in the UK, Royal Mail has the universal service obligation written into its licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/12">There are exceptions to the universal service daily delivery, but exceptions can be allowed only in very specific and restricted circumstances. The Postal Services Act states that the universal postal service is provided</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/13" class="indent">&quot;except in such geographical conditions or other circumstances as the Commission&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/14">Postcomm&mdash;&quot;considers to be exceptional&quot;. The reason for building that exception into the Postal Services Act is clear. The Act recognises that there are or will be some circumstances in which it may be impractical to deliver and collect mail daily. The responsibility for determining those circumstances was conferred on Postcomm as part of its overall responsibility for operating the regulatory regime. It has approached the issue with proper diligence and care with a view to balancing the needs of the customer and the service provider&mdash;Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/15">Following a wide-ranging consultation, Postcomm published a policy statement in January 2003, in which it explained the circumstances in which Royal Mail would be exempted from its licence requirement to deliver letters to all homes or premises every working day. The new direction specified two categories for long-term exceptions to the universal service daily delivery obligation: health and safety, and difficulty of access. Long-term exceptions apply to addresses on islands serviced by regular but not daily ferry or air services. In those instances, Royal Mail should provide deliveries on the days on which a ferry or air service is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/16">Fewer than 1,100 addresses receive mail on fewer than 6 days a week, and three quarters of those are on islands without a daily ferry service. For the few islands and other locations accessible only by boat and without a ferry service, Royal Mail has to provide a postal delivery service not less than once a week, by boat, using local agents. Mail is available to pick up free of charge from the local delivery office on other days, for those customers who can get there. Customers are able to request a temporary suspension of the universal service&mdash;for example, if they want delivery only on particular days of the week.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/17">Royal Mail has a legal duty to protect the health and safety of its staff. Where that is put at risk&mdash;because, for example, access to addresses is possible only across difficult terrain or over treacherous paths on mountainsides&mdash;the addresses concerned will be considered for exemption from universal service on health and safety grounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/18">Royal Mail cannot unilaterally decide not to fulfil its licence obligations on an ongoing basis. Any exceptions to the universal service obligation require authorisation from Postcomm. Postcomm has ensured that there is a four-stage formal process by which potential and ongoing exceptions are carefully scrutinised by the regulator. It involves the attention of the consumer watchdog, Postwatch. The first two stages of the process involve risk assessments carried out by Royal Mail. At stage 3, Postwatch, the Consumer Council for Postal Services, takes a view on the case for exception. At stage 4, Postcomm carries out its own evaluation of the site before making a final decision on the case. The process is rigorous and inclusive and it ensures that all exceptions are properly justified.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/19">Postcomm's exceptions policy is designed to ensure that the number of homes or premises exempt from delivery every working day is kept to a minimum. I understand that just over 3,000 addresses out of the 27 million in the UK&mdash;about 0.011 per cent., or 1 in 9,000&mdash;are exemptions from the universal obligation.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/20">The hon. Gentleman has expressed his concerns about the situation facing some of his constituents on the peninsula. I understand that Postcomm has received &quot;stage four&quot; universal service obligation delivery exception appeals from the residents of the crofting township of Ardmore, and from Royal Mail</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/21">The Ardmore residents and Royal Mail have asked Postcomm to reach a final decision on the debate, following the company's decision based on health and safety reasons to suspend daily deliveries to Ardmore. Royal Mail is, as I have mentioned., required by law to provide a safe working environment for its employees. As part of the exceptions appeals process, it has carried out two health and safety risk assessments of the track conditions in the area. On both occasions, it found the track to be unsafe. Postwatch, the consumer watchdog, also came to this conclusion at stage three of the appeals process.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/22">Postwatch subsequently proposed a compromise solution: the positioning of a mailbox halfway along the track that Royal Mail had been using to make deliveries, at a point before the track reaches its most dangerous point. Royal Mail has argued that on this occasion, the compromise solution does not eliminate the health and safety risk to its employees, as the delivery officer will still be required to walk along the first part of the track to deliver mail to the box. I understand that the residents' appeal is based on a view that the track is not so dangerous that their addresses should be exempted from the universal service obligation of delivery direct to their doors.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/23">In accordance with the agreed process for determining appeals, Postcomm has arranged to visit the site at Ardmore. The visit is scheduled to take place on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December</phrase>. The aim is to gain a first-hand account of the background to the appeals case and to take a view on the specific conditions affecting delivery. In line with its policy on determining USO exception appeal cases, Postcomm will be accompanied by an independent health and safety consultant who will be required to carry out a health and safety assessment of the access track used by Royal Mail to deliver to the properties in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/24">In due course, the consultant will produce a report summarising the findings from the site visit and recommend what can be done to reduce any identified risks to an acceptable level so that Royal Mail can resume daily delivery. Postcomm will consider that independent health and safety advice and any other relevant facts before a fully informed decision can be taken on the future delivery of mail to these addresses. I am confident that the process that Postcomm has put in place is rigorous, inclusive and robust enough to produce the right decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.397.1/1">I shall talk about the 15-minute rule in a moment. First, let me respond by changing things around slightly. Postcomm, not the Royal Mail, designated the 15-minute rule and decided that there should be no limit on the additional road distance travelled by a postal delivery vehicle to reach an address over a public or a private road that is maintained in good condition. There is a round-trip limit of 15 minutes on the extra time that the Royal Mail must spend on delivering mail on foot or by the vehicle used for the delivery route along a private road or track where access conditions are poor but not so poor that they the address is excepted on health and safety grounds.</p>

	<p pid="a.397.3/1">I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I was simply stating the conditions under which the 15-minute rule applies, while making the point that the 15-minute rule was designated by Postcomm, rather than by the Royal Mail as he implied. If the track is public&mdash;he has told the House that it is&mdash;the 15-minute rule as I understand it clearly does not apply. I believe that Postcomm has conceded that already, but that the focus of stage four of its investigation is on health and safety. Those are the matters on which we should focus.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.3/2">The hon. Gentleman also asked whether this was simply a cost-cutting exercise. I do not believe that a minor incident has been exaggerated so that costs can be cut in rural deliveries. Royal Mail has been working very hard to improve its safety record, and the number of accidents has decreased considerably in recent years. Most accidents that occur when someone is accessing customer premises do not result in a suspension of delivery, and cost is certainly not a consideration in assessing whether a situation is safe. The process put in place by Postcomm is robust enough to ensure that any exceptions are properly justified under its long-term categories.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.3/3">I am confident that this is not a case of people simply saying, &quot;Wouldn't it make life simpler and cheaper for us not to have to deliver to these rather remote addresses?&quot; Royal Mail delivers regularly to such addresses throughout the country and it is happy and proud to maintain the universal service obligation, so I do not believe that we are talking simply about a cost-cutting exercise. I am advised that the postman who suffered the accident was a mountaineer. I have not travelled the track as the hon. Gentleman has.</p>

	<p pid="a.400.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity at this my first Adjournment debate to raise an issue that is of real importance to my constituents and to our district. It is about how we can boost levels of enterprise in Normanton and the Wakefield district, and help more young people to fulfil their dreams while making our economy stronger and fairer. I am also grateful to the Minister for agreeing to the debate. His commitment to the area was testified when he toured Yorkshire on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-04">4 November</phrase> to see our local progress in enterprise, skills and technology. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/2" class="indent">&quot;It is evident that the Yorkshire and Humber region is breaking through in a number of important enterprise areas where others could follow.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/3">My right hon. Friend shares my belief, as do my hon. Friends the Members for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) and for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett), that enterprise and skills are critical for the future economic success of not only my Normanton constituency, but the Wakefield district and Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/4">Last week was national enterprise week, a campaign backed by the Government as well as the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors, chambers of commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses, Business in the Community and the Prince's Trust, which organised 2,000 events throughout the country&mdash;twice as many as the year before&mdash;that involved young people in enterprise. It focused, in particular, on women's enterprise and social enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/5">The make your mark campaign is about bringing together an unprecedented coalition of businesses, charities and education bodies to make enterprise a reality for young people aged 14 to 30. In my constituency, many school pupils and college students were involved in enterprise activities last week, not least at Wakefield college, where on Friday an enterprise fair was organised at which I was interviewed by music students from the college who were learning how to run their own radio station. The interview was tough, but fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/6">The Minister might ask why I chose this week to debate enterprise in the Wakefield district, when last week was national enterprise week. Last Friday, an important announcement was made that could have profound and historic implications for the district. The national enterprise campaign decided that, over the next two years, it will run and fund local enterprise campaigns throughout the country that can act as demonstration hubs of what can be done locally. It chose four areas for the hubs: Liverpool, Coventry, Lowestoft and, of particular importance to me and my colleagues, the Wakefield district.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/7">The national enterprise campaign plans to invest &pound;500,000 over the next two years in a local campaign to promote enterprise among young people. It will work with schools, local businesses, youth organisations, the local council and Members of Parliament. It will be based on the same principles that inspired the national campaign over the past few years&mdash;to motivate young people, to inform them and to allow them to make connections, and to influence local bodies to come together and support them. The same will happen locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/8">The Minister might wonder why the Wakefield district has been chosen as the place to demonstrate to the rest of Britain how successfully a local enterprise campaign can be run. Our district has been chosen for three reasons. First, it has great economic potential. It is a great location in which the M1, the M62 and the A1 all intercept. It is truly the crossroads of Britain. We have a good industrial, mining and manufacturing tradition. There are many fine local companies, but new investors have also come into our district, such as Asda, Coca Cola, Next, Pioneer and Xscape, the second indoor ski centre in Britain. We have great skills and a hard-working work force. Over the past few years, unemployment has fallen below the national average as employment has risen.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/9">At the same time, everyone in our district accepts that we have not yet taken proper advantage of our potential. Levels of adult skills in the work force lag behind the Yorkshire national averages. Too many young people still leave school at 16 without going to college, undertaking an apprenticeship or staying on in some form of education and therefore obtaining skills for the future. We have lower levels of business creation than other parts of the country. We have only 29 new businesses per 10,000 residents. In Yorkshire and Humber, the number is higher at 32 new businesses, while the United Kingdom average is 38. The highest number of start-ups in our region is 49, which is almost twice as many as in our area. Therefore, the second reason why our areas was chosen is that we have the potential to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/10">The third reason is the determination in our district to turn around statistics and to take advantage of our location and potential, and for Wakefield to lead again in the economy of the future, just as the north of England and our district led industrialisation in the 19th century. In our district, we are determined that we should lead again in the new industrialisation of the 21st century, not only closing the north-south divide, but allowing Wakefield to catch up with and even surpass our neighbours. That is not just my view. A year ago, our local authority decided, in response to the northern way initiative, to set up what we call the Wakefield way, to work out how our district should respond economically to the regional and national challenges, and look, for example, at how we can tackle the numbers of people on incapacity benefit and boost skills in the adult work force, regenerate our town centres and boost levels of enterprise in our community.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/11">We also have regional support. Yorkshire Forward, our regional development agency, is a member of the Wakefield way and has backed the local make your mark campaign. Many local businesses are actively involved. I have had commitments in the past week from a number of businesses, not least from Coca Cola, whose bottling plant in my constituency is the largest in the world, actively to engage in our local enterprise campaign and visit district schools, and many other companies are willing to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/12">We also have interest from schools, where head teachers are enthusiastic about the new opportunities that our make your mark campaign can bring, and from young people. To give one example of the commitment in our area to tackling these issues, only last week Connexions organised a careers fair for modern apprenticeships, which took place on a rather cold Thursday evening last week, and between 100 and 200 people were expected to attend. In fact, the queue looped round the streets of the Wakefield district as more than 500 people came to find out about apprenticeship options and see how they could take up those opportunities. There is a real desire among young people to engage.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/13">Last week I visited Sheridan, a company in my constituency that was started in Leeds by two Normanton residents to make bespoke table tops and work surfaces for kitchens and bathrooms. Their company now employs more than 150 people and it is relocating from Leeds to Wakefield with a &pound;4 million new investment, because they decided that if they wanted the business to expand and grow, with the space to do so, an authority that would back them, and the available skills, it was better for them to come to Wakefield. That is another sign of local commitment to enterprise, the strengths of our area and also the strengths of young people who have made their mark and started businesses that are now flourishing in our district.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/14">Two weeks ago, in a local school, I met a young former pupil from Freeston school, who is now playing professional rugby at Warrington, and a 16-year-old from my constituency called Leeanne Newton, who, while studying for A-levels, is the number one in England at karate and the number three in the UK, with the potential to win a gold medal, if we can persuade the International Olympic Committee to allow karate at the 2012 Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/15">As well as commitment from young people, we also have real commitment from the wider community. Our make your mark campaign is backed not just by the <i>Yorkshire Evening Post</i> and Ridings FM, our local radio station, but also the <i>Wakefield Express</i>, which is a high-selling local newspaper with some of the best regional business and enterprise coverage of any local newspaper that I have ever seen. So, we have a real commitment to make the initiative work. The national enterprise campaign was inspired by our potential, the gap and the ground that we need to make up, and also by the local commitment across the community to make it work.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/16">I am sure that the Minister agrees that building an enterprise culture is critical if every young person in our district and throughout the country is to fulfil their dreams, whether they want to get an apprenticeship, go to university, write a film script, start a rock band or run their own business. If we in Wakefield could raise our game to the Yorkshire average, 1,500 new businesses would be created every year, and if we could raise that to meet the UK average, 3,000 more businesses would be created every year. Our target for the next few years should be to raise our game to the Yorkshire and then the national levels. As well as encouraging more young people to start businesses, if we can find in our district the next Kaiser Chiefs, and make sure that they come not from Leeds but from Wakefield, we will be putting Wakefield on the map for culture, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/17">I thank the Minister in advance for replying to this debate. Can he assure me and my colleagues that the Government will continue to support enterprise among young people, the national enterprise campaign and the four local campaigns over the next two years? Will he encourage our regional development agency to give strategic support to our area, so that we can fulfil our potential, and the potential of our young people? Will he encourage his colleagues at the Department for Education and Skills to throw their full weight behind the initiative in order to boost enterprise and education in the curriculum? Also, will he encourage all schools to back the campaign, and in particular ensure that all teachers have the training and resources to back enterprise in the curriculum?</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/18">Finally, will the Minister come and visit our district in the next two years to see how we are doing, to encourage us in our efforts to boost local investment and jobs, and to back us as we fulfil our ambition to make Wakefield district the enterprise capital of not only Yorkshire but Britain?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-22a.403.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1627" speakername="Jon Trickett" colnum="403"  time="013:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051122/halltext/51122h04.htm#51122h04_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.403.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" name="Edward Balls">the Member for Normanton (Ed Balls)</phrase> on securing this debate and on the role that he has played in encouraging enterprise, both as part of his present duties as a Member and in his previous role in the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/2">If I may reflect on my own life for a moment, I left school with no qualifications; in fact, the head teacher said: &quot;Trickett, perhaps you shouldn't return for the exams, since you're clearly not going to be too successful.&quot; For a while, I wondered what to do, and eventually I joined my father and grandfather in the building industry. I became self-employed and ran a business for a number of years during the Conservative Administration. That was a time when small businesses such as mine suffered from a surfeit of regulation, but that is another story.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/3">Wherever I go in Wakefield&mdash;I represent the south-east of the district&mdash;I encounter people with similar life histories to mine. They have a dream and they have skills; all that they need is a little advice and support to realise their dream of running a small business that will perhaps one day grow into a larger one. We very much welcome the initiative and thank the Government for making it possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/4">I want to reflect on another aspect of enterprise. We can define enterprise as someone having a dream, and then making that dream happen. Wherever I go in the 22 small villages and towns that I represent, I encounter people who have a dream, and who, occasionally, are struggling to make it happen. I describe those people as social entrepreneurs. They tend to invent a whole series of mechanisms to achieve what they want. I will briefly describe some of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/5">In Upton there is a piece of land worth &pound;2 million. It belongs to the local parish council. If it can be developed, that money would be used to develop sports facilities for the local rugby club, but there is no mechanism to achieve that at the moment. In Moorthorpe, St. Luke's church has created a cr&egrave;che providing care for very young children whose mothers need to go out to work. A small surplus generated from that was used to open a shop selling second-hand clothes to very poor people in the area. Ten per cent. of the profits from those two enterprises go immediately to Romania, of all places, to help women who have fallen into prostitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/6">In Featherstone, a range of local sports clubs have joined with the Featherstone Rovers in an attempt to build a sporting village. The village is badly in need of regeneration, and people there have very poor health. It would be wonderful to encourage sport and exercise, and to achieve our ambitions to create a healthier community. The facilities are very run down, but the land is there, as are the buildings, although they need investment. People of the area now understand that they need some sort of corporate vehicle in order to take their ambitions forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/7">In Hemsworth, there is the Spring Life group, a small, church, faith-based group. It has created a healthy living centre. Again, we are talking about an area of very poor health. That now employs one person. There are a number of volunteers working there, in a local shop right in the middle of Hemsworth. Again, some small employment is being achieved, which gives assistance to those living in hell as a result of the long-term effects of the mining industry, in which all the villages that I represent were involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/8">All those and many other schemes have been started by people who are not motivated by profit, but want to create something in their community, having recognised a need. Another scheme was started in Fitzwilliam. Kinsley, a former pit site, was in a shocking state, with the land derelict and poisoned. Two women, Anne and Margaret, got together and found the money, which, through their initiative and entrepreneurial skills, they converted into a wonderful park. What those entrepreneurial people need most frequently is a corporate vehicle&mdash;a not-for-profit company, co-operative or some other mechanism&mdash;to help them to achieve their objectives. I hope that, as well as stimulating private entrepreneurs, we do not forget that our communities need social enterprises of that kind. If we are to define enterprise as having a dream and then making it happen, I hope that that kind of initiative will help all those people and many others.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-22a.409.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="409"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051122/halltext/51122h05.htm#51122h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.409.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to have a short debate on flooding in London. I thank the Minister for attending and for his continuing interest and expertise in these matters. I look forward to a response.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/2">I have asked for the debate now because of three interconnected issues. First, in my borough&mdash;although, as it happens, not in the part that I represent, but in Dulwich&mdash;significant flooding was caused last year by the drainage system not being able to cope. That was in April, when severe thunderstorms happened periodically across the city. The local authority, together with Lambeth, the authority next door, has completed its investigation and made recommendations as to what might be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/3">Secondly, I represent a riparian constituency, which is nearly all extremely low lying. Indeed, almost nothing is above sea level and many homes and commercial properties in north Southwark and Bermondsey have below-river-level basements, living accommodation, cellars and storage places. There is general concern that we plan to ensure that the floods of yesteryear are not repeated in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/4">Thirdly, a comprehensive study was undertaken by the London assembly and completed, as the Minister will know, a month ago. It was chaired by Darren Johnson with the participation of colleagues across the parties, including my colleague Mike Tuffrey, and has made some recommendations about what we should do for the future. It would be helpful to flag up what it suggested was the responsibility of the Government and of public agencies, and how there ought to be a response.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/5">In the month that I was elected for the first time&mdash;February 1983&mdash;the Thames barrier opened for business. A year later, it was formally opened. I remember going to the event. It was an extremely cold day in what can be a fairly bleak bit of the Thames estuary in Woolwich. The Thames barrier has been a huge benefit to London. Ever since it opened, it has helped to prevent some of the flooding that we used to have in the part of London upstream of the barrier. Between Teddington lock, which I formally visited for the first time this summer, and the Thames barrier, there is a much greater sense of security than there used to be. Happily, the Thames Gateway has not been severely affected since the 1950s, when the whole of the east coast was severely affected by flooding.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/6">The design and construction of the Thames barrier was based on projections up to 2030. Although it will be able to function after that, planning is now beginning to ensure that it will meet demands beyond that. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> submitted a written question not many months ago in which he asked the Secretary of State on how many occasions</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the Thames Barrier has been closed in each year since its inception&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/8">it is obviously closed to deal with the tidal surges&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/9" class="indent">&quot;and what estimate she has made of the number of occasions when it will be closed in (a) 2010, (b) 2020, (c) 2050 and (d) 2100.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-06-16.564"><i>Official Report</i>, 16 June 2005; Vol. 435, c. 564W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/10">It traces a pattern, which we would have expected, that shows that the climate is changing and the water level is rising. We need protection more than we used to and will need it even more in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/11">To select figures from the answer, the barrier was closed for tidal reasons once in the year it started, in 1982&ndash;83. A decade later, in 1993&ndash;94, it was closed seven times. In the last year for which we have figures available, 2004&ndash;05, it was closed three times. In 2000&ndash;01, it was closed 24 times and in 2002&ndash;03, 20 times. The Environment Agency expects 10 to 12 closures a year until the end of this decade, 20 to 35 by the end of the following decade, anything up to 75 closures a year by the half century and 325 a year by the end of the century. That is because, as the Minister will accept, the combination of climate change, heavy rains and rising sea levels causes the agency rightly to anticipate that it will be used much more.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/12">There is another consideration to add to the list of concerns, which includes local issues relating to the capacity of the current sewerage system infrastructure to take away surplus rain and other water, and the safety of areas upstream from the Thames barrier. We must consider how we will cope with the projected house building and development in the Thames Gateway. Although it is welcome, it which needs to be done in a way that gives people security.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/13">When preparing for the debate, I noted that the Association of British Insurers estimates that the further investment in defences that will be needed for the whole of greater London is between &pound;4 billion and &pound;6 billion over the next 20 years&mdash;if development is allowed north and south of the river in the boroughs along the Thames in east London&mdash;if we are to do what Government planning, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and others want done.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/14">I received an unsolicited but helpful note from the London borough of Barking and Dagenham. I am conscious that the riparian boroughs consider and plan for these things, and that they are on the case&mdash;as they should be. I hope that it is appropriate to get some of the planning work out into the open. Will the Minister do that in his reply?</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/15">I shall address the considerations that I listed in turn, starting with the lack of capacity in the sewerage or drainage system. Occasionally, we in London see how much pressure the system is put under when there is heavy or continuous rain. What does the Minister consider to be the ability of the responsible authority&mdash;Thames Water, under the regulation of Ofwat&mdash;to respond to the need for significant investment in drainage in London? Thames Water says that if it is to do that, it needs much more than Ofwat will allow it to raise. The Minister and I know that there is perfectly reasonable consumer pressure from our electors, who do not want their water bills to go through the roof, so there will always be tension between the water companies, which say, &quot;Give us the money and we can do the work; we can make the drains work,&quot; and the regulator, which says that that is unreasonable.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/16">Some parts of the drainage and sewerage system are old, and there is sometimes feedback of sewage into the Thames when there is flooding. That is highly undesirable. I do not detect any particularly political debate on that, and there is a general desire to get the infrastructure in place as soon as is practicably possible, so that there is capacity around the London boroughs to process normal or frequent heavy rainfall without a significant number of homes being flooded.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/17">The number of homes flooded as a result of the flash floods in Southwark in April 2004 was just short of 1,000, and there was considerable inconvenience and cost to those concerned. That could happen anywhere. It happened to be there on that occasion, but Dulwich is not the most low-lying part of the city. It would help if the Minister said where the Government envisage their role to be in working with the water industry and regulator to ensure that the capital city functions well in terms of its capacity to deal with flooding. I know that local authorities such as mine would be happy to collaborate with him and his officials in future, as they have in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/18">By and large, people are happy to accept the reassurance that, barring the entirely unexpected, the area between Teddington lock and the Thames barrier should be safe from flooding. It would help if the Minister confirmed that and told us what is being done by his Department, the Environment Agency and the ODPM to deal with the small areas of the river bank where defences are weaker and need to be replaced. They are often perceived as crisis points, at which there is a confluence of small rivers coming into the Thames and with the Thames itself. It would also help to know that where there has been significant additional building on what used to be wharves&mdash;they became empty and are now residential homes, businesses and offices on the Thameside&mdash;those boroughs will be secure and people will know that they can plan ahead. That is the second issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/19">On the Environment Agency's helpful website, on which people can type in their postcode to see what the flooding risks are, there is a map of London, showing where the risks are and fanning out as one looks downstream. I thank the agency for proactively and informatively trying to ensure that the public are informed. In the north of boroughs such as mine, we are, in theory, at risk. The Minister's assessment and analysis of what can be done, will be done and, with the Environment Agency, is planned to be done, would be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/20">The third issue is the big one. If London is to expand as the Government anticipate it will, if there is to be the additional population for which the Mayor of London is planning, and if there are to be the additional homes that we need&mdash;we need a significant number of extra homes&mdash;it would be helpful to hear what the Government think about the policy for ensuring that development is reconciled with pressures on the land. I understand that some sensible strategies have been accepted and proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/21">I should like to put on the record the relevant recommendations from the London assembly investigation, which, having finished just a month ago, was timely. I understand that 120,000 new homes and 250,000 new jobs are proposed in the Thames Gateway. I am told that the evidence to its committee stated that 5 per cent. of defences were in a poor or very poor condition. That is not a huge amount, but it is significant and the defences must be dealt with. Some 1.25 million people are in the area and, were things to go wrong, they could be adversely affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/22">The London Climate Change Partnership made the following projections for our changing weather during the next 70 years: winters will become wetter by up to 30 per cent.; heavy winter rainfall will occur twice as frequently; the number of storms each winter crossing the UK could increase from five to eight; relative sea level in the Thames estuary will continue to rise, reaching between 26 cm and 86 cm by the 2080s, with extreme sea levels experienced more frequently; and, finally, without flood defences, 15 per cent. of London's homes will suffer a 0.1 per cent. chance of tidal flooding each year. It is only 0.1 per cent., but it is significant, and that percentage will increase as the sea level rises.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/23">Those are the pan-London figures, and the committee made the following recommendations. First, it recommended that the Government, the Minister's Department and the Environment Agency work out the funding mechanisms to ensure that the Thames estuary 2100 project, which will take safety beyond 2030 to the end of the century, is secure, can go ahead and can be planned with collaboration from other public authorities. It is early days, but I know that the project is in the sights of the Department and of London's government.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/24">The second recommendation was that not only the tidal defences, but the other defences along the river are surveyed so that the survey is complete and up to date. The proposal is to complete it by the end of next year, so that any necessary work can be done in the few years after that. It would help if the Minister said whether the Government see themselves having any indirect or direct or role in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/25">Thirdly, are the Government's strategic plans for housing in the Thames Gateway going to leave up to 40 per cent. of the land undeveloped to provide the capacity with which to take up any flooding or water need? One way to deal with the pressures of the build is to leave a lot of open space with the capacity to soak up any flooding. It would be reassuring to know that the Minister's Department was fully engaged with those plans so that we did not overdevelop. Overdevelopment would mean that many people who might have been encouraged to go to that part of the world will not or might not go, having been told by their insurers that it is a bad risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/26">Fourthly, what are we doing to ensure that the new and old infrastructure of our roadways can cope? I am no engineer, but I understand that the surface of the road determines its effectiveness. The assembly committee recommended involving Departments, as well as others, to ensure that we have roadways that reduce surface water and serious flooding. Fifthly, are there proposed changes to the planning guidance to ensure that we build in the right place and in the right way, and that we do not over-pressurise the natural capacity of the river and the river defences to do their job properly, particularly along the Thames Gateway, but and also further upstream?</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/27">Lastly, how do Ministers plan to respond if anything untoward happens? Obviously, the principal responsibility in London lies with London government, but the central Government have rightfully asked whether they can assist in Carlisle, in Yorkshire and in other parts of the country, as we have seen. We would all rather not have to ask them to assist after the event. We would prefer people to say, &quot;Thank goodness everything was in place and we were all secure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/28">I do not mean to suggest that there is huge alarm and panic; quite the contrary. I want this to be an opportunity for the Minister to assure people that things are in hand, that we are learning from past mistakes and experience, and that plans are in place, whether at borough level, at London level or at Government level, to ensure that London is as safe from flooding in the next 25 years as we have been in the 25 years since the Thames barrier was built.</p>
