	<p>I am pleased to be opening this extremely important debate, and I thank Mr. Speaker for giving me the opportunity to do so.</p>
	<p>Last week, in Sofia, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe ratified its Berlin declaration on combating anti-Semitism. The declaration recognised for the first time the link between events in the middle east and attacks on Jews in European countries. Two weeks ago, the United Nations General Assembly passed its first resolution opposing anti-Semitism.</p>
	<p>Those events are significant and highlight the fact that today's debate is taking place in a context of reawakening global hostility towards Jews. My focus will be on the impact of that hostility in the United Kingdom and on identifying what should be done to halt the growth of what the Chief Rabbi, Dr. Jonathan Sacks, calls</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;the virus of anti-Semitism&quot;.</p>
	<p>That virus mutates, but as the Chief Rabbi says, it can be cured.</p>
	<p>I do not generalise about any faith or any community, and it is important to remember that during our discussion. My comments refer to the disproportionate impact of the words and actions of a minority&mdash;often, a very small minority&mdash;of individuals who claim to act on behalf of their faith. Muslims and Jews have much in common: they work together against racism and face major issues of common concern, including the threats to halal and shechita&mdash;their methods of animal slaughter. It is important that Islamic extremists are not allowed to drive a wedge between the two communities.</p>
	<p>The hostility towards Jews from parties of the far right, such as the National Front and the British National party, is familiar, but all too often, those who challenge the hatred emanating from the right flirt with extremist Islamic groups that espouse the very same bigotry. Often, that is linked with antagonism to Zionists&mdash;those who believe in the Jewish people's right   to self-determination in the state of Israel. The word &quot;Jew&quot; is replaced by the word &quot;Zionist&quot;, and it then appears legitimate to view Jews as all-powerful, devious international conspirators whose influence is disproportionate to their minuscule numbers. In saying that, I should make it clear that criticism of the policy of the Government of Israel is, of course, not necessarily anti-Semitic.</p>
	<p>Using their extensive state apparatus, the Arab media incite vicious hatred of Jews to this very day. In this internet and satellite age, such poisonous messages do not remain in their countries of origin, but are widely disseminated to the homes of people in this country. That is why they are such a grave threat for us. They include Holocaust denial&mdash;the rejection of the fact that the Holocaust ever happened. For example, the Egyptian state-controlled newspaper, al-Akhbar, called the Holocaust</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;a huge Israeli plot aimed at extorting the German government.&quot;</p>
	<p>The Arab media promote the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, a tsarist forgery proclaiming that Jews are engaged in an international conspiracy to rule the world. The Nazi version of the protocols can be viewed here in   the United Kingdom on the Hamas website, courtesy of a commercial provider based in Frith street. In the introduction to the protocols, the terms Jews and Zionists are used as though interchangeable. Viewers of the website can also read at their leisure the Hamas charter, of which article 7 states:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The day of Judgement will not come until the Muslims kill the Jews&quot;,</p>
	<p>and article 22, referring to Jews, reads:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;With their (Jewish) money they stirred revolution in various parts of the world, they were behind the French revolution, the Communist revolution&mdash;with their money they formed secret societies such as Freemasons and Rotary&quot;.</p>
	<p>Surely, by any standards, that is incitement. The Nazis' favourite book, &quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot;, is required reading for Hamas activists, and I am told that copies of that book, and &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, are readily available on the streets of most major cities in this country.</p>
	<p>Arab media, to this day, embrace mediaeval blood libels. The lie that Jews use the blood of non-Jewish children to bake their Passover matzahs first appeared in Norwich in 1144, but it is very much alive today in the Arab world. Earlier this year, the Hezbollah station al-Manar, operating from south Lebanon, beamed its series Al Shatat to its worldwide audience of 10 million. That series depicts Jews as avaricious global conspirators. I have viewed some of it; indeed, a dish can be purchased for &pound;200 enabling one to watch it in any home in this country. I saw two episodes, one of which&mdash;episode 20&mdash;will stay in my mind for ever. It contained a scene showing Jews&mdash;we knew that they were meant to be Jews because they were men with big black beards, big black hats and long cloaks&mdash;kidnapping a gentile child and taking him into their home, where the child cried out for his mother. These so-called Jews held the child by the wall, slit his throat&mdash;there are graphic details in the programme; the blood is seen to drip into a bowl&mdash;and then used the blood to bake the Passover matzahs. The same &quot;Jews&quot; were then seen eating the matzahs, proclaiming how tasty they were.</p>
	<p>That is, of course, absurd. However, the story is not just projected in Lebanon but beamed across the world, and easily accessible in this country. The horror of it is that it is believed. The director of the series stated clearly that it was &quot;nothing but the truth&quot;. Again, surely that is incitement and surely it should horrify all of us.</p>
	<p>The impact of such vicious anti-Semitism, of which I have given very few examples, is to inject unpleasantness and fear here in the United Kingdom. It is undoubtedly harming community relations. It is an outrage that incitement to hatred and violence is going unchallenged. Last year, people dressed as suicide bombers paraded in a float on the streets of   London. They were participating in an anti-Iraq war   demonstration, part organised by the Muslim Association of Britain. That organisation presents itself as a mainstream community organisation. On 6   November, Hezbollah flags were seen flying at a central London demonstration organised by the pro-Iranian Islamic Human Rights Commission. All of those things lead to an atmosphere of concern for Jews and non-Jews.</p>
	<p>We should all remember the atrocities at Mombassa, Istanbul and Buenos Aires, which killed both Jews and non-Jews but are part of the result of the incitement to hatred.</p>
	<p>The feting of Sheikh Qaradawi in London has helped to legitimise anti-Semitism. Qaradawi opposes discourse with Jews and has called for them to be killed, describing them as having &quot;incomparable iniquity&quot;. His sermons in June of this year made a plea:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;O God, deal with the treacherous usurper and unjust Jews. O   God, revealer of the Book, O mover of the clouds and O vanquisher of the infidels, defeat them and grant us victory over them.&quot;</p>
	<p>That was broadcast live on television. It did not stay in the Arab state in question but was beamed around the world through the technology that is now available and was viewed by people in this and other European countries. The sheikh's other causes include supporting gays being put to death&mdash;he has said that the question is only about what method of execution should be used&mdash;and approving a husband's right to beat his disobedient wife in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p>In extremist Islamic texts, Jews are repeatedly referred to as apes and pigs. The Palestinian Authority broadcast of the Friday sermon by Sheikh Ibrahim Mudeiris on 5 November 2004, referring to the late President Arafat's illness, said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;We are absolutely certain that the party responsible for the assassination attempt against the president is the Zionist government . . . Those accursed, those apes and pigs&mdash;when they heard the president had died they began to sing and dance.&quot;</p>
	<p>That is outrageous. Unfortunately, it is not an isolated incident, and further examples of the reference to Jews/Zionists as apes and pigs appears to be a common message in extremist Islamic circles.</p>
	<p>I do not want to give the impression that all is disaster. Indeed, there are some opportunities for positive thinking. For example, on 3 December, the Palestinian preacher Muhammad Jammal Abu Hunud preached a sermon, broadcast on Palestinian Authority television, in which he called for the development of a modern Islamic discourse to recognise the other, to treat him with tolerance and to avoid extremism and violence. The    sermon was broadcast from the Presidency mosque in Gaza in the presence of Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman Abu Mazen. Again, no doubt, that sermon was available here in the United Kingdom. There are some positives, and considering the impact of that on community relations in the UK, we remember the positive as well as the negative.</p>
	<p>However, extremist preaching in the minority of mosques can have a disproportionate impact. The two British men&mdash;Asif Hamif and Omar Sharif&mdash;who travelled to Mike's bar on Tel Aviv beach to blow up civilians were influenced by the groups al-Muhajiroun and Hizbar Tahrir. According to <i>The Times</i>, two British men fighting in Najaf in Iraq boasted that they had considered killing Jews in London.</p>
	<p>The most recent figures from the Community Security Trust&mdash;the defence agency of the Jewish community, which monitors anti-Semitic incidents&mdash;shows an increase in attacks on Jews. I know that the Home Office regards the report as extremely authentic; indeed, it is one of the official organs that they take note of in assessing what is happening to community relations. The trust's last report showed an increase in attacks on Jews. Its next report will be ready in the new year, and there is no reason to believe that the upward trend in incidents will be reversed.</p>
	<p>It is certainly clear, whatever the specific statistics show, that hate messages and incitement have an impact on Jewish-Muslim relations in the United Kingdom. Jews feel threatened in a growing atmosphere of intolerance, in which anti-Semitism is increasingly legitimised under the cloak of anti-Zionism. Even the <i>New Statesman</i> felt able to produce a front cover worthy of <i>Der St&uuml;rmer</i>, depicting the star of David piercing a Union jack under the headline &quot;A Kosher conspiracy?&quot; The journal apologised and stated that it was not aware that the front page reflected Nazi imagery.</p>
	<p>What should be done to deal with these matters and their impact on community relations in the United Kingdom? I recognise the Government's good work in addressing anti-Semitism. They take the issue seriously and have supported calls for action at the United Nations and elsewhere. When I have raised this problem before, my points have been taken very seriously indeed, and I thank the Government for that. However, further action is required from a wider group than the Government acting alone.</p>
	<p>Incitement to hate should stop. It is propagated by a small minority of Muslims who are speaking in a perversion of their faith. I am conscious that many Muslim leaders speak out against incitement, and I hope that they will continue to do so, because it is extremely important that moderates do not feel that they are standing alone. The actions of the 2,500 Muslim intellectuals from 23 countries who complained to the United Nations Security Council about extremists have set a good precedent, which I hope will be followed worldwide, including in this country.</p>
	<p>Anti-Semitism must be challenged, whatever its source. Messages of hate should not be tolerated, whether their source is the British National party or Islamicist groups, and the left must end its dangerous flirtation with Islamic extremism. I congratulate the police on arresting the British National party leader, Nick Griffin, as reported yesterday. It is encouraging to know how seriously they are taking this problem.</p>
	<p>At a recent Foreign Office Eid celebration, the chairman of the Muslim Council of Britain made a statement suggesting that the Iraq war was started to serve the interests of Zionists. There are many perfectly legitimate views on the war with Iraq, including strong opposition to it, but that sort of statement is unacceptable. The implication is that British and American foreign policy is dictated by the Jews&mdash;a tiny proportion of the world's population. Do the Government intend to challenge the statement if they have not already done so?</p>
	<p>The recommendations of the European monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia must be followed, and incitement from the media must be monitored and controlled. Its report entitled &quot;Manifestations of Anti-Semitism in the European Union&quot; demonstrated that a correlation exists between anti-Jewish violence and rhetoric in the United Kingdom and events in the middle east.</p>
	<p>An investigation into al-Manar, conducted by the French broadcasting authority on 19 November, resulted in an agreement allowing it to stay on the airwaves provided that it did not broadcast any hate messages that depicted violence towards civilian populations in a favourable light. After al-Manar continued to broadcast anti-Semitic programmes, the French Prime Minister called for a total ban. Only yesterday, France's highest administrative court ordered the French-based satellite company, Eutelsat, to stop broadcasting al-Manar within 48 hours. That followed a broadcast in which Israel was accused of deliberately disseminating AIDS in Arab nations. Predictably, al-Manar issued a statement claiming that the ban was the result of Israeli pressure following a political campaign by the Zionist lobby.</p>
	<p>I applaud the example that was set in France. Our Government are considering monitoring incitement, and I ask them to look closely at what happened in France and to follow its very important example by banning anti-Semitic incitement and stations that incite violence.</p>
	<p>Our existing laws on incitement should be enforced, and purveyors of hate, such as Sheikh Qaradawi, should not be admitted to this country. I ask the Home Office to examine more closely some of the applications that are submitted to it and to stop people coming to this country who are likely to incite.</p>
	<p>I secured an Adjournment debate on this issue on 31 January 2003 as a wake-up call to urge people to recognise the pernicious phenomenon of Arab anti-Semitism, which goes largely unchallenged. Too many people still refuse to recognise this cancer, despite the mounting evidence. It draws on anti-Semitic imagery from the crusades to Nazi Germany. The deadly fusion of 1930s-style anti-Semitism, with its demonisation of the Jewish community, is now moving beyond the realm of polemics and is manifesting itself on the streets.</p>
	<p>I called this debate to bring all this to the attention of hon. Members. It is time to drain this poison from our body politic.</p>

	<p>It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman). I warmly congratulate her on securing a very important debate. It is tradition on these occasions for Opposition Members to say that we agree with much of what has been said. In this case, I agree with every word that the hon. Lady said, and I strongly support her calls to the Government, particularly in respect of satellite broadcasting, al-Manar and individuals such as Sheikh Qaradawi who are admitted to this country.</p>
	<p>The hon. Lady tackled the subject in an appropriately sensitive way. It is a sensitive subject, but one that calls on us to face facts. For the record, I share her approach. Although the Jewish community is facing particular pressure at the moment&mdash;there is, as she said, a rise in anti-Semitic attacks&mdash;other communities also face those problems. I share her sentiments about the Muslim community. I recognise the pressures faced by Muslims in this country, and I deplore some of the things that I have read recently about the Muslim faith, which are careless or, even worse, misrepresent that faith and are highly offensive. I share the feelings of many Muslims when they read and hear some of the comments that are made.</p>
	<p>In that spirit, I was concerned, immediately after September 11th, that the dreadful events of that day might spill over into the lives of ordinary Muslims and that, by extension, it might be taken out on them in some way. Thankfully, that did not happen, but I certainly shared their concern.</p>
	<p>As a member of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, which is taking evidence on community relations, I was interested recently to listen to the evidence of Gerry Gable, the well known proprietor of <i>Searchlight</i> and a well known figure in these matters. He made the entirely reasonable point that there was a risk of the Muslim community being victimised after September 11th:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;If you look at the immediate period after 9/11, certainly in the Metropolitan Police area, there were far fewer incidents involving the Muslim community than any of us expected, but there was a rise in attacks on the Jewish community. I think we have a problem here.&quot;</p>
	<p>He then set out what he believed the problem to be. I agreed with much of what he said.</p>
	<p>We must recognise that the Jewish community is vulnerable, particularly to the sort of international tensions that the hon. Lady described. We can all have our views on the middle east and the different Governments and authorities there but, whatever our views, wherever they are on the spectrum, we should not extend them so far as to victimise individuals and to import the conflict into everyday life with incitement, attacks and victimisation of individuals as a proxy for the dispute itself.</p>
	<p>We should not allow that to happen on any side, but there is clear evidence that it is happening at least in some countries in Europe. We have to face facts. The OSCE report to which the hon. Lady referred was right to recognise that and to see the facts as they are. Others have carried out investigations that have come to the same conclusions. We all know about the problem of the extreme right wing. We cannot be complacent there. We must recognise that there is the other problem of the importation of the middle eastern conflict and consequent anti-Semitic attacks on communities and individuals.</p>
	<p>I saw some of what is happening elsewhere in Europe when, in the company of Lord Janner, I visited Paris earlier this year. I saw with my own eyes almost   unbelievable evidence of the harassment and persecution that ordinary people in the Jewish community, particularly young people, face every day. We visited a school that had been burnt down and met school children who suffer a daily torrent of abuse and bullying on their way to school. They hear the words &quot;sale juif&quot;. We heard that they were frightened to wear their religious signs&mdash;to wear a kippah&mdash;and that they take steps to disguise their appearance. When Lord Janner asked how many of them saw their future in France, the vast majority replied that, although they were French in culture and language, they wanted to leave France and to make their future elsewhere because of what they experience every day.</p>
	<p>That is not just the case in France. I am afraid to say that there are other countries in Europe where similar experiences are being suffered by young people in schools and universities. Children are victimised. There are some instances of grave attacks on individuals. It is a problem. Having mentioned France, I should give credit to the French Government for the way that they have faced up to that. They have not tried to sweep the problem under the carpet. They have set a lead and mobilised the resources of the state. As the hon. Lady said, they have been particularly strong on banning inflammatory broadcasts from abroad. I hope that we are prepared to follow the French Government down that route.</p>
	<p>The problem is not of the French Government's making. The explanation for it may lie in the origins of the communities in France, but it is repeated elsewhere in Europe. Although it is not repeated to anything like the same extent in this country, there are no grounds for complacency. It is worrying that anti-Semitic attacks in this country have increased. We need to watch that very carefully. When individuals and communities are being victimised in order to extend the middle eastern conflict, it is particularly worrying that, in this country today, in perhaps some of the most sensitive places of all&mdash;our universities&mdash;some academics are coming dangerously close to encouraging something similar.</p>
	<p>Of course, academics can have vigorous views about Israel. They can hold conferences about it. They can hold a wide variety of views and they should have the freedom to express those views as far as they wish to express them, but it goes a worrying stage further when academics, including those at some of our most prestigious universities, call for a boycott of individuals because they happen to come from the state of Israel. I suspect that it is not far from that to encouraging individual victimisation.</p>
	<p>Academics who have been going along that path should exercise their consciences, to say the least, and think about where it may lead. I say that it is worrying; it is also counter-productive. In one case, an academic dismissed two contributors to her journal purely because they were Israeli. However, they were also critics of the Government of Israel's policy and very much on the left wing in Israeli terms.</p>
	<p>That is worrying and I do not want it to happen in our universities. It is not fair and it damages our academic reputation internationally. It is also worrying from the point of view of individual Jewish students in universities, who from time to time have had problems of their own, particularly when dealing with organisations such as al-Muhajiroun.</p>
	<p>I do not know whether the Minister can comment on what I have said, but I hope that she will respond in some way. Although we must preserve freedom of speech in our universities, we do not want academics to give the wrong lead and to go down a road that could be very worrying indeed.</p>
	<p>I join the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside in all the sentiments that she expressed and I support her calls for action, particularly on satellite broadcasting. We must consider that carefully. She was right to say that some of the material is horrific. It is fair to say, as she did, that there are those in the Muslim community who have taken a stand and acted in accordance with what are the true tenets of the Muslim faith. However, it is very worrying when a stream of filthy propaganda, possibly affecting impressionable minds, is coming through a medium that people take seriously and give credit to. I hope that the Minister will respond in a way that meets the seriousness of the problem.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-12-15.272.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1155" speakername="Linda Perham" colnum="272"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041215/halltext/41215h01.htm#41215h01_spnew2">
	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) on securing the debate. She is a staunch defender of Jewish people and often speaks up for Israel in the media. I should declare that I am on the parliamentary executive of Labour Friends of Israel and I am the secretary of the all-party group on Israel. I represent a constituency in the London borough of Redbridge that is home to 15,000 Jews and has a growing south Asian population of Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans, who are of the Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist and Christian faiths.</p>
	<p>We had an excellent debate here on 20 April, led by my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell), in which thoughtful contributions were made. On that occasion, I and other hon. Members said that the debate was timely because of the rise of anti-Semitism. There were 375 anti-Semitic attacks last year&mdash;a 7 per cent. increase on 2002. Somewhat depressingly, discussion of anti-Semitism always seems to be timely, because it continues to exist, as it has done for hundreds of years in this country and beyond.</p>
	<p>When I take people on tours of the Palace of Westminster and we come to Westminster Hall, I tell them about its history. It often comes up that coronation banquets used to be held there. The first was held in 1189 for the coronation of Richard I. On that occasion, Jews bearing handsome gifts were denied entry to the Hall and pelted by mobs. The story was circulated that the king wanted them exterminated, so a series of massacres ensued. The following year, 150 were massacred in York. Throughout the 13th century, various cities and towns mounted attacks on Jews or expelled them. In 1218, the wearing of a Jewish badge was introduced. In 1290, an edict by Edward I expelled England's 16,500 Jews, who did not return as a community until the time of Cromwell in 1656. There is a long history of anti-Semitism in this country.</p>
	<p>We all know and condemn the worst example of anti-Semitism: the holocaust. My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside spoke about holocaust denial, and the comparison of Jews to Nazis is also common. The star of David is often linked with the swastika in cartoons and the suggestion is made that the Jews engineered the holocaust to secure a Jewish state. As recently as 28 August this year, the Egyptian television station al-Mihwar broadcast a group of politicians and journalists discussing the connection between Zionists and Nazis and drawing parallels between the Nazi genocide and Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.</p>
	<p>I shall never forget my visit five years ago to Auschwitz-Birkenau with 200 school students, including some from two of my local schools. More people should visit that place, especially young people, to be reminded of the obscenity and evil of that most extreme manifestation of anti-Semitism, and to learn about the unacceptability of tolerating it.</p>
	<p>I cannot emphasise enough the role of education in combating and challenging anti-Semitism. That is why I   praise the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust and the efforts of such organisations as Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting&mdash;FAIR&mdash;and Palestine Media Watch, which monitor the publication and propagation of anti-Semitic literature in the UK and elsewhere.</p>
	<p>As has been mentioned, the media's influence has    grown over the years and, recently, satellite communication has been used more to propagate anti-Semitism. Those who control the media have a huge responsibility to achieve balance and fairness in reporting. My Jewish constituents often complain to me about anti-Semitic bias, particularly in television reports about the middle east conflict.</p>
	<p>Television and films, with their powerful imagery, can achieve widespread impact. I therefore welcome the recent release of Michael Radford's version of Shakespeare's &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, with the distinguished actor Al Pacino, who gives a sensitive portrayal of Shylock, and the debate that the film has provoked about anti-Semitism today, as well as in the Shakespearean era.</p>
	<p>As I mentioned, I represent racially and religiously diverse communities in London that, through the hard work and good will of community groups, the safer communities partnership and individuals, manage to coexist peacefully and to thrive. We have a local three faith group of Jews, Muslims and Christians, a council of Christians and Jews that has been in existence for 62 years, and an annual Hanukkah-Eid-Christmas event celebrated at the Ilford community centre and organised by members of the League of British Muslims. I shall be attending that event tonight and telling the people there about this debate. I shall be there with community and religious leaders from other communities.</p>
	<p>Despite the real and continuing challenges in the UK posed by the resurgence of anti-Semitism and the dangers that it raises, as well as post-9/11 Islamophobia, I am hopeful that the example of my community is not an isolated one and that people of good will of all races, religions and cultures will see their futures and that of the country as based on a foundation of tolerance and understanding of other people, regardless of creed or colour. However, I should like the Minister's reassurance that the Government will be vigilant about anti-Semitism, monitor it and take robust action to combat and to challenge it wherever it rears its ugly head. As I have demonstrated, anti-Semitism has a long history. We all need to make the effort to fight such evil, otherwise it will continue to poison race and community relationss in this country and elsewhere and be a lasting obstacle to peace in the middle east.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) on securing this important debate on anti-Semitism. I also congratulate her and others on emphasising the need for balance by stressing that hatred of any race, any religion or any group is abhorrent. I declare an interest, as a member of Labour Friends of Israel and as a regular participant in activities with Palestinian groups.</p>
	<p>At the outset, it is important to declare as a universal principle the opposition of any right-minded people to discrimination, bigotry and irrational hatred of any group of people, whether on the grounds of religion, ethnicity, colour of skin or the colour of money&mdash;economic means. The confluence of agreement of all Members of Parliament must be to abhor actions or words that lead to derision, damage or the death of individuals or groups.</p>
	<p>Today, we are challenging anti-Semitism, yet all the words that I have spoken could equally apply to Islamophobia. Since 11 September 2001, Islamophobia has become a major concern and it must be condemned in the strongest terms. Equally, however, anti-Semitism is an insidious poison that pollutes rational discourse in the media and in the street, and hampers understanding between people as individuals and between groups. It can lead to violence in words and action against Jews.</p>
	<p>It is of grave concern that anti-Semitism, a phenomenon that many people thought had been confined to history&mdash;rendered impossible by the horrors of the holocaust&mdash;seems to have a nasty habit of coming back. It is like some perennial weed; it does not necessarily come back in the same place or in the same form, but it has the power to reproduce itself seemingly endlessly.</p>
	<p>This morning, it has been shocking to hear some of the examples that have been given, and to hear that many anti-Semitic myths, which trace their lineage from mediaeval Europe to tsarist Russia, persist&mdash;that Jews are conspiratorial, or that they have disproportionate control over world events. Even the bloodthirsty fantasies regarding Passover bread, which I find too abhorrent to mention again this morning, are repeated often abroad and, regrettably, closer to home as well.</p>
	<p>That is not to suggest that any criticism of the Israeli state or the Israeli Government is out of bounds. Such criticism should be made, but it should never be wrapped up in terms that could be construed as anti-Semitic.</p>
	<p>The fact that such poisonous ideas can be circulated and, moreover, that they have transmuted to some within the Arab world&mdash;a culture in which, until very recently, such ideas were completely alien&mdash;is the example par excellence of the ability of fear and ignorance to overcome reasoned and rational thought. Those deviant ideas are espoused only by a minority, but their power lies not in the numbers that espouse them, but in their sheer toxicity and perniciousness.</p>
	<p>In this era of globalisation, as we have heard, that discourse of hate can cross borders at literally the speed of light. The incitement to violence shown on television and on internet sites from Lebanon or Saudi Arabia can quickly find its way on to computers and television screens in the UK. It is even more worrying when local extremist groups, which are by no means representative of the majority, pick up that message and echo it through the media and institutions in the UK.</p>
	<p>Fortunately, however, we are not powerless to act in that area and it is imperative that we do so. Lasting peace between Israel and the Arab world and between their peoples will be impossible without a recognition of the role of incitement in generating hatred and enmity in the public at large.</p>
	<p>The quest for harmonious relations in the UK cannot be separated from the way in which we approach international affairs. In suggesting ways of engaging with the problem, I shall refer, first, to the declaration of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and, secondly, to the role of the G8 as we approach the transfer of its presidency to the UK.</p>
	<p>The OSCE has become the chief international organisation active in the field of anti-Semitism in Europe. As hon. Members may know, a landmark conference took place in Vienna in spring 2003 and it was followed by another in Berlin in April 2004. The Berlin conference produced the Berlin declaration, which compelled all member states to undertake eight   commitments to combat anti-Semitism in their countries.</p>
	<p>Those commitments include provisions such as ensuring that legal systems foster an environment safe   from anti-Semitism&mdash;something from which I am sure the UK does not suffer&mdash;and collecting and maintaining   reliable information and statistics about anti-Semitism and other hate crimes. That is an area where I believe there could be some improvement. Effective implementation of those commitments would contribute enormously to the struggle to eradicate anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and racism of all kinds. The United Kingdom must stay at the forefront of that battle.</p>
	<p>I should be grateful to hear from the Minister what   action has been taken by the Home Office to act on the commitments signed by the OSCE. In particular, I should be interested to know to what extent the Home Office has co-operated with the Foreign Office on the issue. As we have heard in this debate, the problem of anti-Semitic incitement in the UK cannot be detached from the international perspective, nor can it be tackled without taking a global perspective. Therefore, what can the Minister tell us about the co-operation between Departments on monitoring the flow of incitement and on taking action to stem it? As we know, the resolution of the middle east peace process is high on of this Government's agenda, which is a great tribute to the Government and to the Prime Minister in particular. I should be interested to know what place on the agenda tackling incitement has.</p>
	<p>With regard to the G8, clearly, reform in the Arab media and the desire to stem the rhetoric emanating from a minority of Arab states regarding Israel and Jews are not isolated issues. There are many in the Arab world who seek reform of all kinds&mdash;political, social or economic. Political reform and a positive approach to the west is naturally coupled with a reconciliation of the existence of a Jewish state in the middle east and acceptance of the peace process.</p>
	<p>However, certain parts of the Arab world seem to be faced with a choice between embracing reform and remaining where they are. The status quo is tied up with the view that the values of the west and of the state of Israel are not to be accepted. So long as that view exists, the underlying cause of anti-Semitic incitement will remain. I do not underestimate the challenge that that poses for progressive Arab nations and leaders, let alone those who may be more reluctant to confront radical ideologies that deny the existence of Israel. However, that challenge must be met.</p>
	<p>Over the past two years, the G8, the EU and NATO have placed political reform and democratisation on the middle east agenda. Currently, Israel and Turkey are the only democratic states in the region. There has been internal pressure for reform and democracy from nationalists, secular liberals and some Islamists, but they have not yet generally met with major reform.</p>
	<p>The G8 Sea Island summit in June 2004 resulted in a G8 plan for reform, which included supporting efforts to develop democracy and to ensure free and transparent elections; assisting the region in judicial reforms; supporting efforts to reinforce freedom of expression and independent media; supporting countries interested in reform of education; supporting efforts to expand women's participation; and strengthening the role of civil society and non-governmental organisations.</p>
	<p>The pressure for long-term reform must, we all acknowledge, come from within, from Arab people and Arab leaders. It must be reform that reflects the culture and priorities of the region, but reform there must be. With a view to tackling a major source of anti-Semitic incitement, will the Minister impress on colleagues in all    Departments, including the Foreign Office, the importance of reform in the Arab world, which will assist in the campaign to stem the flow of anti-western, anti-Israel and anti-Semitic rhetoric at home? The Palestinian Authority are currently setting a fine example to the rest of the Arab world about the value of democratically electing a leadership with public support and public accountability. It is no coincidence that that has coincided with a dramatic and positive change of tone in referring to the west and Israel in official media. That is to be applauded. It signifies a clear willingness to challenge anti-Semitism and in so doing to work towards greater mutual understanding and a peaceful accord among the people of the region.</p>
	<p>In conclusion, I call on the Minister to tell us what monitoring is being done and what action is being taken at home in line with the OSCE Berlin declaration, and to say what co-ordination there will be with the Foreign Office to ensure that, in forums such as the G8, that aspect of the need for reform is not passed over.</p>

	<p>I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) on securing the debate and the hon. Members for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), for Ilford, North (Linda Perham), and for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) on their well informed and extremely pertinent contributions. This debate is a natural continuation of a similar debate on 20 April, and it is all the more valuable for that.</p>
	<p>Hon. Members stressed the domestic context of a worrying rise in anti-Semitic behaviour and activity, which, although it is not yet of epidemic proportions, is something we should be very aware of. They also put it in an international context. That is equally worrying, because the anti-Semitic activity in this country is mirrored by similar events in our near neighbours in western Europe. I am extremely pleased that at last there is international recognition that we have a problem that needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p>The hon. Members for Liverpool, Riverside and for Ogmore mentioned the OSCE declaration. I am a representative on the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE and I am extremely proud of what it has done on the issue. It takes its remit of security and co-operation in Europe extremely seriously in recognising that this is an internal threat that needs to be addressed if we are to maintain the security of our continent. The United Nations resolution was mentioned; it is a first in that respect and it is very welcome.</p>
	<p>There is also the historical context. We like to think that we are a broadly tolerant country, and it is sometimes useful to remind ourselves that it was not always so and that tolerance may have had its limitations. Undoubtedly, there have been some appalling acts against certain communities in this country, and the Jewish community has regularly been the victim of such attacks through the centuries. It is valuable that we remind ourselves of that.</p>
	<p>There are probably three elements to the anti-Semitic attitudes that have been displayed in this country over recent years. First, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside stressed the threat from elements&mdash;it is important to say &quot;elements&quot;&mdash;within the Muslim community. That is a relatively recent but serious development in our community relations.</p>
	<p>Secondly, there is what might be described as the &quot;traditional&quot; far right&mdash;those who base their politics on prejudice, hate and ignorance. They have been with us for a long time, but they never represent mainstream political thought. Nevertheless, they can be extremely damaging in their activities and in the thoughts that they instil in others.</p>
	<p>Thirdly&mdash;this is the most reprehensible group&mdash;some elements, who would describe themselves as being of the left, are prepared to go along with that degree of anti-Semitism because it suits their present political purposes. Again, it is not entirely new. When I was a student union president in the 1970s, university student unions tried to deny Jewish societies a platform. Those of us who spoke out against it often found ourselves isolated. It is not new, but it has become more prevalent, particularly in the context of the Iraq war and of the   situation in the middle east. It has achieved a respectability that it does not deserve, and we must confront it and challenge it at every opportunity.</p>
	<p>The link with the middle east is entirely spurious. Of course, people have strong opinions about the world situation and what is happening in middle eastern politics. Some may be critical of the Government of Israel, but not for one moment do they have an excuse&mdash;and no cause or pretext&mdash;for extending their criticism to expressions of hatred against people who happen to be of a certain ethnic origin.</p>

	<p>The hon. Lady is absolutely right. I shall be making that point in categoric terms. Either we are talking about respect for all communities and all faiths, or we are talking about respect for none. That is a key part of the argument.</p>
	<p>Several hon. Members have already said that it is possible to be politically critical of the actions of the state of Israel and not be anti-Semitic. We need to make that important distinction. However, it is easy to blur the edges of expressions of political opinion into a wider area of discrimination. We must be careful that it does not happen. Those who talk blithely about a Jewish lobby, whether in America or here, are pandering to that expression of anti-Semitism, rather than genuinely engaging with the political argument.</p>
	<p>It is a truism, but it needs to be restated, that all forms of hatred and discrimination must be challenged and confronted wherever they occur. Those of us who, on occasion, express views critical of what is happening in the middle east need to be particularly careful of those with whom we share platforms, discussions or demonstrations who extend that criticism in a way that indicates discrimination against the Jewish community. We must say that they are wrong and must withdraw their remarks, or they will be no friend of ours.</p>
	<p>What can we do to combat anti-Semitism? Some suggestions have already been made. Education is a key factor&mdash;it always is. The best way to fight discrimination is to educate and to debate. It should not be swept into the corner as an embarrassment that should not be discussed; it should be confronted full-frontedly. We must take a robust attitude. We must come together to address the problem.</p>
	<p>The cant saying after 9/11 was that we should stand   shoulder to shoulder with the Americans. Yes, we   should. I have huge criticisms of the American Government and the way in which they have prosecuted their foreign policy. Nevertheless, we stand shoulder to   shoulder with them on terrorism. Similarly, we should stand shoulder to shoulder with any community in this country that feels threatened by discrimination or   prejudice. That is what brings our communities together.</p>
	<p>Then there is the legal framework. I sometimes worry that existing powers are not sufficiently used. I know that the power to prosecute has been used, and that some prosecutions have been well publicised. However, as hon. Members have said, violently anti-Semitic posters have been displayed at demonstrations, with no evidence that anybody has been prosecuted for depicting such views. When that happens, people will be concerned, and there should be no need for them to be. As the Minister knows, my party urged&mdash;before the event&mdash;that an aggravated crime be associated with racially and otherwise motivated hatred, and we should make use of such provisions frequently.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Ogmore asked whether we keep records of such incidents outside the Metropolitan police area. My hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael) raised the same point in a previous debate. The Metropolitan police have been particularly good at keeping such records, but does the   practice extend to other police force areas? Are there similar arrangements in Merseyside, Greater Manchester, the west midlands and other areas with significant Jewish communities? Do they, indeed, extend to areas without significant Jewish communities? That is equally important.</p>
	<p>I will not say that my constituency is mono-ethnic, because we are either little Saxons or little Celts, but we   do not have large immigrant communities that are   identified by virtue of their religion or race. Nevertheless, isolated individuals may still be subjected to discriminatory behaviour. We must all ensure, therefore, that we are vigilant in areas where the potential to lose sight of such issues is that much greater. I should be grateful if the Minister told us what has been done to record hate crimes and racially or religiously motivated crimes.</p>
	<p>As regards incitement to hatred, the hon. Member for Ogmore and others talked about the internet and the media. As we know, it is difficult to regulate the internet, because the legal framework is weak. As regards the media, nobody in this country wants proper discourse to   be censored, but we are entitled to look at the accreditation of media sources whose broadcasts spew out hate. We can then see whether they are indeed welcome guests on these shores, or whether there is evidence of their having produced material that would constitute criminal behaviour had it been produced in this country. The Home Office needs to consider that.</p>
	<p>We shall have a complicated debate on religious hatred in the context of the Serious and Organised Crime Bill, and there are all sorts of pros and cons. The Minister knows that, although I have sympathy with what the Home Office is trying to do, I shall want to ensure that we have the freedom to profess faith and to engage in critical discourse, even about the activities and modus operandi of different faiths. That is proper in a civilised country&mdash;just as it is to ridicule faith, on occasion. We must, however, be careful to ensure that those who use religion as a cover for incitement to racial hatred are not allowed to prosper.</p>
	<p>There was mention earlier of the difficulties experienced by Jewish people in France, and the French Government have issued one of the strongest messages on the issue. They have really taken it seriously, and I should like to think that we could do the same. If we do, however, all political parties will have to come together, excluding those who will have none of it. We shall have to make common cause with those elements of the media that are prepared to take our message forward. We must clearly state that we are talking about not only anti-Semitism, but hatred based on race or religion. An attack on any community on the basis of faith or race is an attack on all our communities, and all our communities need to stand together.</p>

	<p>The hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) has done us a service in raising these issues. She was right to do so, because they are difficult issues for all the main political parties. We are rather too hesitant about confronting some aspects of anti-Semitism and other general expressions of hatred in our society.</p>
	<p>The point was well made that anti-Semitism has a long history in Britain; it goes back to mediaeval times. There is the evidence of pogroms, as the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Linda Perham) said. However, we should not get carried away with history. From the late 18th century onwards, this country has provided a tremendous haven for Jewish people. My Jewish forebears came here in the early 19th century, and most   of them prospered. The Jewish community has prospered to such an extent that, as we know, it is the only community in Britain that has never asked for ethnic monitoring. It has always accepted that its success within British society is so great that it is not necessary.</p>
	<p>The evidence is overwhelming. Anti-Semitism, which was present in some forms in the 19th century and right through our history, was on the decline, particularly after the second world war, but it has started to rise again in recent years. We also know that, because of assimilation, the choice made by my Jewish forebears in the middle of the 19th century, the Jewish community in Britain is shrinking as an identifiable group. That is a matter of concern to the Chief Rabbi. We must hope that it does not disappear, because we would lose an important cultural asset in our society. The idea, therefore, that the Jewish presence in Britain constitutes some conspiracy or subversion towards others is laughable.</p>
	<p>Of course, there are some who are anti-Semitic&mdash;one comes across people with all sorts of contorted psychological perspectives in all communities&mdash;and I fear that we will never get rid of them, but the blunt truth is that the rise of the current anti-Semitism, about which the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside rightly expresses concern, appears to have an Islamic perspective to it. We cannot get away from that. It seems to have been fuelled by a growing hatred and anger towards Jews, Judaism and the state of Israel, which has grown over a 20-year period with tremendous corrosive force and is principally manifested within the Islamic community.</p>
	<p>That is a bit of a challenge for all of us. The mainstream political parties represented in this Room are all making efforts to integrate members of the Islamic community in Britain into mainstream political life. As my party's diversity spokesman, I spend a great deal of my time visiting mosques and seeing the Muslim Council of Britain. I meet large numbers of people who treat me with infinite courtesy and kindness. However, I have to face up to the fact that some of the underlying problems identified by the hon. Lady are not confined to   mad extremists who manifest themselves in the street   outside Finsbury Park mosque. They extend rather further&mdash;to an atmosphere of such frustration and, if not necessarily hatred, concern about events, particularly in the middle east, that it colours the viewpoint of a larger section of the Islamic community, which provides a moral cushion and justification in which the extremists can live. That is a problem for us.</p>
	<p>That problem was highlighted when Sheikh Qaradawi came to this country. His visit, as the hon. Lady may remember, was authorised by the Government, who could have taken steps to exclude him. After the leader of my party expressed concern that he had been let in, I was struck by the number of phone calls I received from Muslims whom I had dealt with over the previous two years expressing concern about what the leader of my party said. They said that Sheikh Qaradawi was a force for good and was not calling for the extinction of the state of Israel. However, one has to look only at what he has said to see that he is part of the corrosive process by which hatred is put into the hearts of large numbers of people and warps all their judgments and sensibilities.</p>
	<p>Exactly the same thing happened in Nazi Germany in the 1920s, 1930s and even before the Nazis came to power, when grievances real and imagined entered the hearts of individuals and were fomented by propaganda into raw hatred of other classes of people. That phenomenon is not confined to the middle east; it can be achieved in any human society if the conditions are right.</p>
	<p>Are we confronting the problem? Of course, we do not want to offend people, but I sometimes think that we are failing to engage in a sufficiently robust dialogue. The Mayor of London, a member of the hon. Lady's party, had no difficulty sharing a platform with Sheikh Qaradawi. I do not suggest in any way that he wants to foment hatred, but he seemed to have a distorted sense of priorities and understanding about what Sheikh Qaradawi had been saying.</p>

	<p>Of course, I am well aware of the stand that the hon. Lady took, which was absolutely right. I   am not trying to condemn the Mayor of London outright, because I suspect that he was well intentioned. However, I am worried that, in our efforts to be well intentioned and to appeal to communities, saying, &quot;We understand you, so please get involved with us&quot;&mdash;after all, the three parties represented here are in competition&mdash;we are in danger of missing the point. Unless we are prepared to engage in robust discourse about what constitutes the foundations of democratic society, we are encouraging the notion that people can participate in democratic society while holding views that are positively incompatible with it.</p>
	<p>That is one of the big challenges that all three parties must face up to. It is difficult because none of us wishes to be discourteous or to isolate people, but that is the raw reality behind the points made so tellingly by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) about what goes on in the Jewish community and how even academics jump on the bandwagon and join the corrosive process of encouraging hatred. Responsibility lies with us.</p>
	<p>I do not want to get involved too much in the question of the law. I may be shadow Attorney-General as well as diversity spokesman, but this is a debate on incitement to religious hatred. However, the laws to protect the Jewish community, which the Government want to extend to other faith groups, already exist, yet have not prevented the problems that the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside identified. Indeed, some messages that arrive by broadcast media from abroad are completely outside the control of prosecution, unless the person responsible happens to arrive in this country.</p>
	<p>The attempt to get around such problems through legislation will not work; in fact, although it may be well intentioned, I believe that it will make things worse. Many of the things that the hon. Lady identified, even leaving aside incitement to racial hatred, are already serious criminal offences, but enforcement of the law is difficult. Although enforcement of the law should undoubtedly be emphasised, it is not the entire solution to the problem.</p>
	<p>The solution must lie with us, as a political class. Are we prepared to confront such issues properly? Mindful of the competition between us, are we willing to engage, to say what we consider acceptable and unacceptable and to make it clear what participation in a democratic society involves? If we are prepared to do that, we may turn the tide; if we are not, we will face serious and growing problems. As individuals, we cannot solve the problems of the middle east. The problems are largely outside our control, although we may try to contribute to a solution.</p>
	<p>That is the challenge for us. It will require us to ask difficult questions of ourselves and of those towards whom we would in other circumstances wish to be conciliatory. The point was well made that the French Government have been extremely proactive, at an official level, in challenging such matters. I am not yet sure that we have done the same. More can be done.</p>
	<p>Finding a solution is a matter not of legislation, but of us all coming together to make it clear that the achievement of the common good in this country requires a foundation of tolerance and that we will not pander to those who wish to express intolerance simply because we might think that that intolerance may have some rational foundation. The foundation may be rational but, if we go down the road of intolerance, we will be responsible for creating the people who put graffiti on buildings, try to burn down schools or attack synagogues. Of course, exactly the same applies to Islamophobia. I therefore hope that the Minister will provide as much help and guidance on those issues as on legislation.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) on securing this debate. I also welcome the presence of my hon. Friends the Members for Ilford, North (Linda Perham), for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), for Rochdale (Mrs. Fitzsimons) and for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy), the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and the two Front-Bench spokesmen, the hon. Members for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) and for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), in this interesting and constructive debate on an important issue.</p>
	<p>To pick up a point that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield made, I would not say that the law is the    only answer in tackling anti-Semitism in our community, but just one measure. We must first acknowledge what is happening out there in our communities. That has been clearly illustrated today. Sometimes, we have to specify particular offences that are to do with particular outrages and instances of discrimination against certain groups. Only in that way can we have a discussion about exactly what anti-Semitism means, how it manifests itself and what its impact on communities is. Sometimes, general offences of incitement do not necessarily allow for the exposure of that debate or for clarity about what we are talking about.</p>
	<p>The Government have a strong record. I hope that people agree that we use a combination that includes a strong legal framework, which we keep under review. The solution is tackling extremism and educating young people. I remind hon. Members that there is now a statutory requirement, as part of the school curriculum, to teach about the holocaust. We cannot be complacent. As each new generation is born, we must ensure that we reinvest in their knowledge and understanding of what has happened, what is happening and the dangers that might happen unless we deal with these serious matters.</p>
	<p>The Home Office is encouraging inter-communal and inter-faith dialogue and supports the annual holocaust memorial day. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside has recently been selected as a trustee of the trust. I congratulate her on that and I know that she will play a constructive and important role.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore raised the international situation. We are active at international level. He mentioned the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe conferences on anti-Semitism; the relationship between racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic propaganda on the internet and hate crimes; and racism, intolerance and xenophobia. We support the conferences' recommendation that three personal representatives should advise on intolerance issues, and we plan to donate to the joint fund to make that a   reality. The Home Office is an official part of the Foreign   and Commonwealth Office-led delegation that participated in those conferences.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend talked about democracy as well, and that was picked up by other hon. Members. Democracy is, of course, important and I was pleased that he acknowledged that we are making progress in relation to, for example, the Palestinian elections. I understand that there was a positive atmosphere at the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee meeting in Oslo on 8 December, attended by Palestinian and Israeli representatives, who all spoke of encouraging political signs and an emerging opportunity. We also hope to have democratic elections in Iraq before too long, which will allow that country, after years of dictatorship, to have a democracy. That is very important.</p>
	<p>At home, we are developing within the Home Office, in discussion with other Departments and non-governmental organisations, our emerging race equality and community cohesion strategy, which will set the direction for further Government action to develop a    cohesive British society that is characterised by integration, celebrates diversity, looks at what shared values we have across race and religious backgrounds, believes in equal opportunities and rejects extremism, racism and anti-Semitism.</p>
	<p>We must have tough legislation, too. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced nine racially aggravated offences. Offences such as assault and criminal damage attract a higher maximum penalty if they are racially motivated. Since 2001, increased penalties have also applied to religiously aggravated offences. Hon. Members will be aware that incitement to racial hatred is an offence under Part III of the Public Order Act 1986. That makes it unlawful to use threatening, abusive or   insulting words or behaviour with the intention or likelihood of stirring up racial hatred. The offence applies to incitement of hatred against Jews and Sikhs, because case law has established that they constitute racial groups under the law.</p>
	<p>In 2001, we increased the maximum penalty for incitement from two to seven years and extended the incitement offence to include hatred of racial groups abroad, which would include inciting hatred of Israelis.   There have been convictions, such as that of Mr. El-Faisal, who was sentenced to two years for racial incitement, plus seven years for incitement to murder. We are now proposing to extend protection against incited hatred of other religious groups, and we think that that will build on the measures currently available under the racial hatred offences that I have just mentioned.</p>
	<p>I know that we shall debate that in the Committee that considers the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill, but the Association of Chief Police Officers made it clear that it felt that, despite the legislation currently available, the police were unable to act against the sort of hate where religion was a factor, such as the disturbances in northern towns in 2001 directed against Muslims. That formed part of their evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Religious Offences.</p>
	<p>There are other ways in which the Government are actively addressing extremism. Ministers of religion have a crucial role in helping minority communities to engage with British society, combating distortion of religion and strengthening community cohesion. To fulfil that role, ministers of religion need to be able to communicate with their congregation, especially the younger generation, and to understand British society and our values of tolerance. That is why in the summer we introduced a requirement for people who wish to come to the UK from abroad to work as a minister of religion to speak basic English. We are also consulting about whether, post-entry, they should have a minimum level of civic knowledge and community engagement.</p>
	<p>In addition, we are committed to supporting leadership training for faith leaders already settled here. That will build on the expertise developed in the faith leaders management training programme for imams and community leaders piloted in 2004 by the Learning and Skills Council. However, it is important to understand that the Government make a clear distinction between extremist individuals and the faith that they might claim to be associated with or to represent.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside and the hon. Member for Hertsmere spoke about issues and views relating to the state of Israel. Expressions of hatred of Jewish people, let alone attacks on persons and property, are simply unacceptable. Criticisms of a foreign Government's policies cannot be used to justify such behaviour. Many communities in this country have strong affiliations with states overseas, which is quite proper, and there is a place for legitimate democratic debate about domestic and international affairs, including those relating to Israel and the middle east. However, it is completely unacceptable if such criticism manifests itself in a discriminatory, threatening, harassing or violent form that is directed at people because they are Jews. I agree that boycotts on grounds of nationality in academia are objectionable and contrary to academic freedom.</p>
	<p>In respect of exclusion, we consider all cases on their individual merits. Exclusion is a prerogative power exercised personally by the Home Secretary on behalf of the Crown. There is no right of appeal, although any decision to exclude is subject to judicial review. Exclusion is used sparingly, only after considerable thought and largely on the grounds of national security, relations with a third country and public order, although there is nothing to prevent us from excluding a person for another &quot;non-conducive&quot; reason.</p>
	<p>Much has been said on broadcasting and I welcome the French decision that was taken yesterday. With regard to joined-up government, we have made specific representations to the relevant authorities in a number of cases, including that of the al-Manar television station. On a state visit to Syria in December 2003, Baroness Symons, Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, called on President Bashar to deal effectively with the worrying presence of anti-Semitism in official media and schools in Syria.</p>
	<p>As we have heard today, it seems that the television station in question was not prepared to keep to an agreement with the French authorities that was announced in November. As a result, the French courts ordered Eutelsat to stop transmitting al-Manar altogether within 48 hours as of yesterday afternoon. We are content that the French authorities have taken proportionate action against that television station. Eutelsat is the only satellite receivable in Europe that carries it, so if Eutelsat stops transmitting the channel, it will not be receivable in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p>The international obligations that would apply if Ofcom recommended proscription of al-Manar are principally those of the EU television without frontiers directive. If Ofcom advised that there were grounds to take action against al-Manar and that the French authorities had failed to respond adequately, the Secretary of State could consider proscription.</p>
	<p>As regards the internet, what is illegal offline is illegal online. In other words, material placed on net servers based in the UK that is illegal can be taken down. We will work with the police and the Internet Watch Foundation to that effect. There are, of course, problems with internet service providers that operate outside our jurisdiction. That involves not only anti-Semitism but other forms of hate that are spewed out on the internet. I have dealt with that in relation to animal rights extremism too, so it is a big issue.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North made important points not only about what we can do nationally in Parliament and what the police can do, but about what we should do in communities to ensure that we have a partnership, work together and celebrate the good interfaith and interracial work that is being done   in many communities up and down the UK. Anti-Semitism is a problem not only for the Jewish community but for all society, and we should strive for solutions collectively. We shall continue to liaise with the Community Security Trust to monitor anti-Semitism and to inform policy. Where the police also collect data, they fit with the CST figures. It is important to have engagement between the figures from the voluntary sector and what we collect on a statutory basis.</p>
	<p>My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will continue to meet regularly the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, as he does the general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain. This is not a situation in which we can say that we have done our job. We must constantly be vigilant, and I assure everyone that that will continue to be the case.</p>

	<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue here, although this is a debate that I would have preferred not to hold. I have asked for the opportunity to discuss these issues because I have run into a brick wall when I have tried to obtain answers from British Transport police. First, I pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells). He was as helpful and sympathetic as he could be and I am sure that I will receive just as positive a response from his successor.</p>
	<p>This is a very complicated case and I do not have time to go into every single detail, so I will try to highlight the main points. It began on 25 August 2000 when my constituent, Ms Fiona MacKay, an off-duty officer of      British Transport police, was travelling on the 23.10   Glasgow to Newton train. She intervened to break up a fight that had broken out between two passengers and was consequently assaulted by Raymond McDevitt, a schoolteacher, who was subsequently found guilty of police assault and fined &pound;500.</p>
	<p>Ms MacKay sustained a scaphoid fracture and severe ulnar nerve trauma, and eventually had to retire on grounds of ill-health. While the train was stationary at Crosshill station and the fight was going on, the train crew made a 999 call to BTP requesting urgent police assistance for an off-duty officer. As there was no response a further 999 call was made. Again there was no response. Ms MacKay has reason to believe that both calls were received at BTP's headquarters in Glasgow. Four years and four months later, she is still waiting for BTP to respond, which must surely qualify for the world's worst response rate from an emergency service.</p>
	<p>No BTP assistance was dispatched even though the BTP duty officer was advised of both calls. When Ms   MacKay's colleagues asked him directly whether they should attend they were told to stand down. Ms MacKay wrote a number of letters to the BTP chief constable, Ian Johnston, requesting an explanation as to why officers did not attend. That was four years ago. She is still waiting for a reply.</p>
	<p>In May 2003 she contacted me and I wrote to BTP in Glasgow on 14 May. I received no reply. I wrote again on 15 July. I received no reply. At this point a pattern was beginning to emerge. On 24 July I wrote to the chief constable about my concerns. That time I did receive a reply. On 1 August Mr. Johnston wrote:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Having had the opportunity to look into the important issues you have raised, you should be aware that we have recently received correspondence from solicitors acting on behalf of Miss MacKay&quot;.</p>
	<p>No such instruction had been given by my constituent. The advice to which Mr. Johnston referred had been given the previous November, since when Ms MacKay had dismissed her solicitors. I then received another letter from Mr. Johnston apologising for the fact that he had been given wrong information and had passed it on to me, but I still got no explanation about why BTP officers did not attend to help a colleague in difficulty on 25 August.</p>
	<p>This is the crux of the matter. Time and time again BTP has tried to hide behind a veil of pretended observance of the law. It has pretended that in some way this is an ongoing legal case. If that were so, I should not have applied to hold this debate. It is not an active legal case, but time and again BTP has tried to obfuscate and to delay responses on the basis that at some point in the future a legal case may begin. That may well be the case, but when a constituent is in such circumstances the possibility of a legal case being activated at some point in the future is no excuse for not being completely fair and upfront.</p>
	<p>A number of other points have to be addressed. The most important is the BTP accident book. The incident was not recorded in the accident book and BTP refused all Ms MacKay's requests for the accident to be recorded. In the letter sent to me on 11 August 2003, Chief Constable Ian Johnston wrote:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The incident should have been recorded in the Force Accident Book, but was not because officers believed the event was 'off duty' and did not have to be recorded. They were wrong.&quot;</p>
	<p>Ms MacKay has also objected to remarks included in her personnel file, made by Police Inspector Graham, who described her as</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;immature, unpopular, craved attention, and lacked credibility, that she suffered from some kind of disorder.&quot;</p>
	<p>Ms MacKay made several attempts to have those remarks removed from her file. The chief constable eventually described them as remarks which &quot;challenge her medical history&quot; and refused to take any action over them. However, Dave Stacey, the employee relations manager at BTP, has since advised that the remarks are &quot;no longer relevant&quot; and that they will be destroyed. There has been no explanation of that sudden change of opinion.</p>
	<p>It has been suggested to me that one of the reasons why Ms MacKay has not received the level of support to which she was entitled as an employee of BTP is that she had a poor sickness and absence record prior to that incident. I do not dispute that she had a poor record in that respect. However, I do not believe that any officer of BTP or any employee of any public organisation should expect a lower level of support from his or her employer simply because of a poor absence record. If BTP felt that that was a way of dealing with a poor absence record, that is a very poor employee relations policy.</p>
	<p>There is also an important issue with regard to benefits. The files supplied by BTP show that it advised the Benefits Agency that Ms MacKay was acting outwith her duties of employment and was not authorised to take action with regard to the fight. That is factually incorrect. All off-duty police officers, whether they work for BTP or for any other force, are expected to intervene in incidents that affect public disorder, and Ms MacKay was no exception to that. As a result of that claim made by BTP, Ms MacKay's application for benefits was refused at a time when her wages had been stopped, which caused her severe financial difficulties.</p>
	<p>In that context, there is another issue that is very relevant. If BTP was correct&mdash;if Ms MacKay was acting outwith her duties&mdash;the arrest of the thug McDevitt would have been illegal. If Ms MacKay was acting outwith her duties, why was McDevitt charged with police assault? If McDevitt's offence was not police assault, if Ms MacKay was simply a member of the public and a have-a-go hero, and not covered by the authority of BTP, his conviction for police assault would have been a miscarriage of justice, which it certainly is not.</p>
	<p>One further point must be made regarding the accountability of BTP in Scotland. BTP as a whole&mdash;throughout the United Kingdom&mdash;is, as far as I am aware, ultimately accountable to the Department for   Transport and to my hon. Friend the Minister. Unfortunately, although in England and Wales BTP is accountable to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, I have found out over the past 18 months that that is not the case in Scotland. I have yet to perceive any intervening authority between BTP in Scotland and the Department for Transport; perhaps that is the case because rail safety is still a reserved issue in Scotland and therefore still the responsibility of Westminster rather than the Holyrood Parliament. There seems to be an issue of public accountability. To whom is BTP in Scotland accountable other than the Department for Transport? Is there an organisation&mdash;a public body&mdash;that can authorise investigations into complaints made by members of the public against BTP in Scotland? I should be grateful if my hon. Friend could elucidate that point.</p>
	<p>I have a small amount of time left to me, and would like to go into some of the more technical aspects relevant to the debate, although I do not expect my hon. Friend to be able to comment in detail on them.</p>
	<p>Since February 2004 there have been a number of investigations into this incident by BTP. In February and March 2004, Richard Hemmings, the clerk to the British Transport police authority committee, stated that there would be a full investigation into Ms MacKay's allegations, carried out by Joe McGonagall-Napier and Steve Thomas. A meeting took place on 3 March at the Holiday Inn, Glasgow. Joe McGonagall-Napier advised that the points for discussion would be based on issues contained in the document sent to Ian Johnston, the chief    constable, dated 15 August 2003. However, Mr. Johnston refused to answer the points made in that document when he originally received it in August 2003, claiming that all the information was legally privileged. It was not, because there was, and is, no legal case.</p>
	<p>On 28 April 2004, Steve Thomas was advised that the British Transport police complaints and discipline sub-committee had reviewed his investigation and, as a result, Assistant Chief Constable David McCall in Scotland had been appointed to conduct another review. At a meeting at my constituency office with me, Steve Thomas and David Stacey, the employee relations manager, Mr. Stacey agreed to respond to questions about defamatory comments that he had refused to remove from Fiona's personnel file&mdash;comments to which I have already referred.</p>
	<p>On 16 June, Hemmings advised me by letter of Mr.   McCall's decision to conduct another internal investigation, and in June or early July this year, a new internal investigation by Superintendent Gareth Byron was launched. Assistant Chief Constable McCall tasked him with meeting Miss MacKay to obtain a full statement of her complaint. Subsequently, Miss MacKay was assured that she would receive a full copy of his investigating officer's report.</p>
	<p>On 12 July 2004, Steve Thomas contacted me to offer me the opportunity to inspect all files held by British Transport police on Fiona. He told me that all files, such as copies of all internal inquiries to date, will be available for inspection. That offer was subsequently withdrawn, and I was not given the opportunity to read those files.</p>
	<p>In an e-mail sent to me on 1 September, Mr. Thomas told me that he could not find any internal inquiry reports relating to Fiona's complaints, thereby implying that they are not there. After four years of inquiries, letters and complaints, they cannot find any information about her complaints.</p>
	<p>I worked fairly closely with British Transport police in Scotland in my previous employment with the Strathclyde passenger transport executive. I was always impressed by its professionalism and commitment to the task of keeping our railways safe, and that remains my view. It does a fantastic job, and the railways have never been safer in Scotland. Frankly, however, the behaviour of a few men at senior levels of British Transport police in Scotland and in the rest of the United Kingdom has cast a shadow over the organisation. I have had to navigate through a jungle of misdirection, obfuscation, dissembling, half truths and incompetence. We have before us a classic case of people in positions of responsibility accepting the position but not the responsibility that comes with it.</p>
	<p>My constituent's treatment by British Transport police has been an utter disgrace. I hope that the time has finally arrived for British Transport police to stop hiding behind procedures and loopholes and to do what is right. I am not entirely convinced that they are even capable of doing so in this case. I hope that they will not make the mistake of believing that this debate is the end of my involvement in this case. So long as Ms MacKay is my constituent and British Transport police continue to run from their responsibilities&mdash;a characteristic that one would not normally want in those charged with upholding the law&mdash;I will continue to press her case to this House.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Harris) on securing the debate, and thank him for his kind words about British Transport police, which I echo, and about my predecessor, our hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells).</p>
	<p>I extend my full sympathy to Ms MacKay for the injury that she received while intervening in the altercation involving three men on a train. I am sorry to learn that she did not return to duty as a result of the injury that she sustained, and that she subsequently retired on the ground of ill health. Before I address the points made by my hon. Friend, it would help the Chamber if I explained the role of Ministers in BTP.</p>
	<p>At the time of the incident involving Ms MacKay, the employer of British Transport police was the Strategic Rail Authority, a body directly accountable to the Secretary of State for Transport. The BTP committee, appointed by the SRA, had a statutory duty to secure the maintenance of an adequate and efficient police service for the railways. As my hon. Friend will know, responsibility for BTP has now passed formally to the new British Transport police authority, and there is now a direct link to the Department for Transport rather than through the SRA. The authority and its new chairman, Sir Alistair Graham, are directly accountable to the Secretary of State, who appoints the chair and other members.</p>
	<p>Although the Secretary of State for Transport is ultimately accountable for BTP, the BTP authority has a statutory duty to maintain an effective and efficient police force for the railways. It also makes regulations for the governance and operation of BTP based on equivalent regulations made by the Home Secretary in respect of Home Office police forces. The chief constable of BTP has responsibility for the direction and control of all BTP police officers and civilian employees employed for the provision of policing services.</p>
	<p>It would not therefore be appropriate for Ministers to become involved in the details of disputes between BTP and individual officers. However, I want to be assured that cases such as that of Fiona MacKay are conducted in a manner appropriate to a public body such as British Transport police. For that assurance, I look to the BTP authority as the employer of BTP, and I have asked it for its comments about BTP's handling of the case.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend has already set out the main points of Ms MacKay's complaints about BTP. It may help if I    run through the key points and summarise the response that I understand that the force and the authority have made so far and the action taken to address Ms MacKay's complaints.</p>
	<p>The authority informs me that Fiona MacKay's complaints have been considered very seriously by the force, which has made strenuous efforts to investigate what happened on the night of the incident and the subsequent actions by the force. Where appropriate, it has also admitted its mistakes. I understand that Ms MacKay's initial complaint related to the apparent lack of response by BTP at the time of the incident. Ms MacKay said that despite two phone calls made to    BTP to the effect that a BTP officer had been assaulted on the train, no BTP officers attended the scene. Understandably, Ms MacKay therefore felt considerably let down by her colleagues.</p>
	<p>I do not want to dwell on the detail, but let me say that a subsequent inquiry by a BTP detective superintendent with no previous knowledge of the case revealed that Ms   MacKay was mistaken in what she perceived happened that night. No evidence was found of two calls having been received at the BTP control room. The records show that only one call was received and that BTP was informed that an off-duty Strathclyde police officer had been assaulted on the train and that Strathclyde officers were already at the scene and had arrested the assailant. On that basis&mdash;wrongly, as it turned out&mdash;the BTP duty inspector decided that there was no need to send BTP officers to the scene as the situation had been resolved by Strathclyde colleagues.</p>

	<p>Without going into any detail, would my hon. Friend agree that in future it would be appropriate if the recordings of calls made to British Transport police on the emergency line were not discarded before a reasonable period of time had passed? We have found that the calls made on the night of 25 August were mysteriously and unhelpfully deleted.</p>

	<p>I would not disagree with my hon. Friend. In fact, once we have reached the stage of the final report to the relevant committee of the BTP authority, I want to ensure that all the lessons of the   case, including that one, are learned and, where necessary, that processes are changed to reflect that. That will mean that the mistakes to which BTP has admitted will not happen again, and a colleague in such a position will not be left with some dispute about the support that they receive.</p>
	<p>The duty inspector and a constable made their way to the Strathclyde police station where Ms MacKay had initially been taken, and on learning that she had been conveyed to hospital, they made their way there and joined her. After she had been treated, the inspector made sure she was conveyed home.</p>
	<p>The initial misunderstanding was unfortunately compounded by BTP officers mistakenly deeming Ms MacKay to be off duty at the time of the incident on   the train. I think everyone accepts that when she boarded the train she was off duty, but as my hon. Friend implied, when she intervened in the incident, like any off-duty police officer, she automatically became on duty. That should have been made very clear; as any officer would be expected to do, she put herself on duty. Clearly, she acted in a professional and responsible way. However, the mistake by the force meant that the incident was not recorded in the force accident book, which was a cause of further complaint by Ms MacKay, since it resulted in her not being able to claim overtime and had an impact upon her being placed on half pay.</p>
	<p>BTP subsequently confirmed that it was wrong not to record the incident. Once the status of an off-duty police officer being involved in such an incident had been clarified, the accident book was duly completed and the force apologised to Ms MacKay and repaid any monies incorrectly held. My hon. Friend mentioned the data protection point about Ms MacKay's personal records not being provided within the due deadline, but with the best will in the world I will pass over that. However, I understand that BTP has admitted and accepted that a   number of Ms MacKay's complaints were fully justified, and the force has taken appropriate remedial action. Where appropriate, BTP has apologised to Ms MacKay.</p>
	<p>In addition, the complaints and discipline committee of the former BTP committee commissioned a procedural review of how BTP dealt with the various complaints made by Ms MacKay. The remit of the review was to ensure that all Ms MacKay's concerns had been answered and her complaint thoroughly investigated, and that policies and procedures had been correctly followed. The outcome of that review was reported to the professional standards committee of the BTP authority on 7 December. I understand that the committee has asked for further clarification of a specific issue and work on that is currently under way. Once the committee is satisfied that all has been done to address the various complaints and allegations of Ms MacKay, a full and comprehensive response will be sent to her to record the remedial actions taken.</p>
	<p>At that stage, I shall also ask for a full pr&eacute;cis of such a report, and once it is in the public domain I will be more than happy to meet my hon. Friend, with or without his constituent, to see whether crucial lessons can be and have been learnt in full.</p>

	<p>I thank my hon. Friend for his kind words.</p>
	<p>I am confident that the allegations and complaints have been properly addressed by the force. BTP has admitted to making certain mistakes for which it has apologised to Ms MacKay and, where appropriate, has reviewed its procedures. I am also confident that the   BTP authority is exercising properly its role of scrutinising the effectiveness and efficiency of the force and, through its professional standards committee, is ensuring that a comprehensive and thorough review of Fiona's case is being carried out. As I said before, it is absolutely imperative that we learn from Fiona's case and that the lessons learnt are embedded throughout BTP so that these mistakes do not happen again, and that the lessons learnt are reflected in BTP's procedures.</p>
	<p>While I have a moment, Mr. Deputy Speaker, may I speak briefly about the new BTP authority? I have been amazed at the speed and effectiveness with which the authority has come into existence. Sir Alistair Graham and his colleagues have taken the bull by the horns and I am very encouraged by how the new authority has operated in its first six months. Rail safety   is a very important issue to the Government, as it is to the travelling public. In general, I share my hon. Friend's comments about BTP; it is an industry-specific authority and in the main it does a very professional and committed job in difficult circumstances at stations and throughout the rail network, for which we should all be grateful.</p>
	<p>As I said, once we have a full and comprehensive report I shall be more than happy to sit down with my hon. Friend and his constituent and go through it. I shall relay any remaining concerns to BTP, probably through the chief constable, Ian Johnson. I firmly believe that BTP is a super police force, and I do not want any incident or set of mistakes, or any lack of procedure, to mar what is otherwise a strong, professional and dedicated police force.</p>

	<p>I am sorry that I cannot stay for the whole debate because I am sitting on a Select Committee. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that another way of looking at unmanned level crossings is to ask whether the road passage across the railway is necessary? Research that I have undertaken demonstrates that Network Rail&mdash;to be fair to it for once&mdash;has had no success when it has applied to have roads blocked. It is important to consider the road as well as the railway.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-12-15.295.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1345" speakername="Richard Younger-Ross" colnum="295"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041215/halltext/41215h03.htm#41215h03_spnew2">
	<p>Network Rail has undertaken a great deal of work to reduce the number of crossings&mdash;we have fewer than France, where there are 17,000 crossings and far more car accidents on crossings. There will always be crossings, and I am not sure how many of the 31 could be removed, although some could be upgraded. However, if the crossing is to be upgraded, it is up to the road authority as well as the rail authority because both services are involved. Perhaps joint funding should be used to improve crossings&mdash;that may be the cost of a bridge or an improvement to the crossing itself to improve safety. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point.</p>
	<p>On the roads there are three deaths per billion kilometres travelled compared with only 0.4 on railways. The figure for air travel is 0.01. Would those who argue that we should put extra money into safety on the roads rather than the railways because the accident rate is low also say that we should not invest in safety in air travel because the figure is only 0.01? No, we would not and should not reduce air safety. It is up to the Department for Transport to work out what can be done to deal with the fact that the rate of deaths on roads is higher. We are making unfair comparisons.</p>
	<p>I shall quote just two elements of the argument. Rob Gifford, executive director of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety, said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Money spent on rail safety would save many more lives on roads. We seem to want absolute safety on the railways but we are prepared to tolerate a level of risk on the roads.&quot;</p>
	<p>Dr. Alan Sefton, the head of the railway inspectorate, responded to that by saying:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;It is apples and pears, because railways are a closed system on which everything is managed, while the roads are a free for all.&quot;</p>
	<p>I hope that the Minister's response will not be to say that we need to spend the money elsewhere. That argument has been made to me by one or two hon. Members, and I reject it totally.</p>
	<p>There are ways in which level crossings can be upgraded, as we heard in an intervention. We could put in detection systems or CCTV. Part of the difficulty on high-speed train lines is the stopping distance of trains and warning times. The gates are closed at crossings in time for the vehicles to clear, and remain closed for a period, after which the train could stop. If a vehicle is stopped on the track a minute before the gates close, a train has very little chance of avoiding impact with it. That leads one to ask whether longer times are required. However, if we were to lengthen the time during which the gates were down, local residents and those trying to cross would complain. That being the case, we must balance road safety and usage in order to find a solution. We come back to the need to seek help from the road authorities, such as the construction of alternative routes or bridges, or to find other ways of dealing with the issue.</p>
	<p>One option that was highlighted by the Liberal Democrats in the debate on the Railways Bill was dedicated high-speed rail lines. That solution would improve passenger comfort as well as resolving many other issues. However, it is unlikely to happen immediately.</p>
	<p>I have concerns about the Government's response so far. The Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), was quoted in a local newspaper as having said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Bullet trains do not have seat belts.&quot;</p>
	<p>Bullet trains run on dedicated lines in Japan, and I think that the hon. Gentleman rather missed the point about them. The Japanese authorities spent vast sums on computerising the system, and ensured that there were no level crossings. There are bridges everywhere. The system is very safe for other reasons, which have been built in to it.</p>
	<p>Several years ago, a company called Elite, which had pioneered seat belts on coaches, thought that, having done so, it would be a good idea to take them on to trains. It made inquiries but nobody was interested. It bought a carriage and fitted it out to show how it could be done, and invited the rail operating companies to visit and have a look. I understand that nobody bothered to turn up. It also tried to engage with the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, both of whom declined; they said that they did not have time to look into the matter any further.</p>
	<p>One of the arguments used against seat belts on trains is, &quot;What is to be done with the passengers who are left standing?&quot; There was a question on the issue in another place on 28 October 2004, when Lord Smith of Leigh asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Who is responsible for the health and safety implications of the overcrowding on passenger trains allowed by some train operators.&quot;</p>
	<p>Lord Davies of Oldham, who was replying on behalf of the Government, replied:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The responsibility for the day-to-day safety, welfare and convenience of passengers using the railway rests with the train operating companies. The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for enforcing health and safety law on the railway network, but it does not limit the number of passengers that can travel on trains.</p>
	<p class="indent">HSE participates in a working group led by the Rail Safety and Standards Board (responsible for improving health and safety performance), that is currently carrying out research into the health and safety effects on rail passengers of crowding on trains. They are expected to report on their findings later this year.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>28 October 2004; Vol. 665, c. WA148.]</p>
	<p>There are only about two weeks before the end of this year, so it will be interesting to see whether the HSE actually publishes that report.</p>
	<p>On 15 July 2004, the Government published a White Paper on the future of the railway industry, which proposed transferring the responsibility for safety from the HSE to the Office of Rail Regulation, and intend to legislate for that in due course. The implication is that safety would be the responsibility of the rail operating companies. I had a meeting with the Association of Train Operating Companies, which I shall come to in a moment, but the rail operating companies made it clear in my discussions with them that it would not be within their remit to implement a policy on, say, standing on high-speed trains. That would be deemed a major safety issue, rather like train warning systems. They would require Government intervention to legislate on it and would not be expected to implement such a policy themselves. The same is almost certainly true of seat-belt legislation, should we reach the conclusion that seat belts should be fitted.</p>
	<p>Much research has been undertaken on seat belts and lap belts on trains. By and large, it has shown that they should be fitted. In their very technical report on the safety of high-speed, ground-guided transportation systems&mdash;that has to be American&mdash;the United States Department of Transportation and the Federal Railroad Administration set out various difficulties and highlighted the particular safety issue of the impact on carriages. They state:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Some vehicles . . . contain selected seat configurations which face each other. This arrangement constitutes a particularly dangerous situation in a train-to-train collision because of the high possibility of occupant-to-occupant collision.&quot;</p>
	<p>They highlight several other safety issues on trains:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;It is of interest to note that current North American and European rail vehicle regulations, standards and industry practices fail to address most of the issues involved in protecting occupants in passenger cars from the effect of secondary collisions within the compartment.&quot;</p>
	<p>They conclude:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;As a minimum, option 1 would require that seated occupants be restrained by lap belts similar to those employed in transport category commercial airplanes or motor vehicles.&quot;</p>
	<p>Later, they say:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;3-point belt restraint systems . . . provide greater upper body protection&quot;,</p>
	<p>but they go on to say why there is a difficulty with such belts on aisle seats. They also say:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The use of a lap belt may engender strong resistance from passengers who wish to remain free of any motion-constraining devices around their body. It should be noted, however, that as more states enact (and enforce) mandatory automotive safety belt laws in the near future, such opposition would probably decrease to a minimal level.&quot;</p>
	<p>They also talk about other protection, about how one reduces impact by using soft materials in the carriage, and how one deals with standing passengers.</p>

	<p>I am interested in the idea of seat belts&mdash;I    have always supported them in most moving vehicles&mdash;but I do not want to lose the point about people who stand on trains. I am pleased to say that trains seem to be getting busier, with many more people on them. However, I travel on too many trains to the west country that are hideously overcrowded, and we talking not about going 20 or 30 miles, but about people sometimes standing all the way to Swindon and beyond. Under the previous Government's privatisation, there was no measure of an overcrowded train. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that this Government should consider that measure, because it is deplorable that people are being asked to put their lives at risk by having to stand on a train.</p>

	<p>I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman's points. I have been trying to find research into the Clapham rail disaster. I had a friend who was on the train, and I remember clearly that the number of standing passengers was a factor. The passengers were certainly a factor in the Paddington rail crash because they had been moving to the front of the train at the time of the incident. I have not been able to find that research, but it has struck me since Clapham that we allow too many people to stand on trains.</p>
	<p>I have shared trains to the west country and know   how hideously overcrowded they get. That is unacceptable, and it is questionable that in the 21st century we are still allowing railway transportation laws on tickets that say that they bear the passenger from A to B but do not guarantee a seat. Many other countries provide seats&mdash;people do not stand on bullet trains in Japan, although they may on others&mdash;and we should be moving to seats-only provision for high-speed trains.</p>
	<p>Others have also examined improved safety. The science service of the Technische Universitat Berlin stated in a document dated 1 September 2000:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The results of this research work have already generated interest among manufacturers, as one example in Berlin illustrates: The new series of underground and urban railway carriages . . . in Berlin will include the elastomer filled couplings. And politicians specialising in transport have . . . recently called for seat-belts to be made compulsory in all trains following a tragic rail accident in . . . Germany, in which eight pasengers were killed and 148 were injured.&quot;</p>
	<p>Likewise, research from Finland entitled &quot;Seat belts on trains. Acceptance and usage rates at initial phase&quot;&mdash;I shall not try to read the document's name in Finnish&mdash;concluded:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;These findings suggest that the possibility to use seat belts on trains should be considered as customer service, and the number of trains equipped with seat belts should be increased. Although the possibilities to increase the use of the seat belts only by informing the travellers are limited, some improvement can be gained by intensified advertising in trains and in ticketing offices. Finally, this issue can be brought to the public discussion by further experiment of seat belts in trains.&quot;</p>
	<p>As I mentioned earlier, Peter Webster and I had a meeting yesterday with George Muir of the Association of Train Operating Companies and Ray Ford from the Rail Safety and Standards Board. I must put on record our thanks to them&mdash;they gave Mr. Webster and me two hours of their time, and we went into great detail on a   number of issues. The RSSB highlighted how it considers safety, and it talked about seats that absorb the impact of the passenger. That is how it has examined the subject. It continued to say that if someone is restrained at the hip, there was a danger of their moving forward and hitting their heads. It quoted a case of a rail accident in Leicestershire where someone did not go into the brace position, hit their head on the seat in front and suffered neck injuries as a result.</p>
	<p>The RSSB went on to say that for the past 18 months it has been researching seat belts on trains. That is exceedingly good news. It is unhappy with the test dummies currently available and has been developing its own, and I understand that it will undertake tests with seat belts and dummies to ascertain what the impact is in different circumstances. I hope that that research is carried out as a matter of urgency, and I am sure that the Minister will gently persuade the board to do that. As I said earlier, I suspect that some things have not been done as a matter of urgency although they have been referred to in reports.</p>
	<p>In coaches, we currently have lap belts, and seat configuration in coaches is similar to that in trains: they are generally forward facing with a seat in front. Distances between seats may be slightly different, as might their construction, but we have legislated for seat belts in coaches. Not everyone wears them, but they are there.</p>
	<p>I want to put on record the research that Mr. Webster has undertaken. One argument that is advanced is that if we put seat belts in, no one will use them. That may be the case, but I would not make them compulsory, and that would overcome some of the objections. However, he asked 315 passengers to complete a questionnaire&mdash;probably on the same train that the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) and I use. He asked them how long their journey took. The average was one hour and 48 minutes, and times varied from half an hour to five hours. Some 59 per cent. of the passengers never left their seat during their journey, and the average time that anyone was away from their seat was two minutes and 22 seconds.</p>
	<p>When the passengers were asked whether they would use a lap belt if one were available, 75.5 per cent. said yes and 19.5 per cent. said no. To the question, &quot;Would you use one for your children?&quot;, 96 per cent. said yes and 4 per cent. said no. To the question, &quot;Do you believe seat belts would have any effect in reducing death or injury in event of a train crash?&quot;, 76.4 per cent. said yes, 21 per cent. said that they were not sure, and 2 per cent. said no. To the question, &quot;Do you believe seat belts should be available on high-speed trains?&quot;, 89.3 per cent. said yes, 3.8 per cent. said no, and 6.9 per cent. did not care.</p>
	<p>I hope that, concurrently with the research undertaken on seat belts, the Government will ask for research into passenger response, looking particularly at the examples from America and Finland. The quick answer that I get is that passengers would use them initially but not later. Use might decline over time, but that does not mean that they should not be provided. ATOC does not believe that it would be a major problem or cost to fit lap belts and, if instructed, it has indicated that it would do so. That is the impression that I got from my meeting with George Muir yesterday.</p>
	<p>I want finally to touch on some other issues that have been highlighted. It is clear that emergency lighting on   trains is inadequate. That is highlighted in the investigation into Ladbroke Grove and others incidents. The signage of how to use doors was also inadequate, and if we go back through the research and reports, we see time and again that people could not get through the doors because they were jammed. In the Ufton Nervet accident, people tried to use the hammers to break the windows, but the hammers broke, not the windows. People could not see the signage about how to use the hammers, which windows they should hit and where they should hit them. The means of escape are inadequate. That situation has been criticised time and again and must be addressed. I know that the RSSB is considering that, but there must be a little more urgency and investment.</p>
	<p>When we had a debriefing session yesterday after the meeting with ATOC and the RSSB, my constituent told me, &quot;That was quite a good meeting, but I don't want to be here in 12 months' time after another rail accident saying the same things, looking at the same reports and asking why.&quot; The question for the Minister is not why should there be seat belts on trains or why should emergency lights be standardised and independent of the train's main battery&mdash;the question is why not.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-12-15.300.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="300"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041215/halltext/41215h03.htm#41215h03_spnew5">
	<p>I    congratulate the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) not only on securing the debate, but on his continuing campaign for seat belts. I   say to him clearly: sign me up. I wholeheartedly support the campaign. He has proved his case in debate after debate with detailed research and the thoroughness of the consultations that he has undertaken as a result of recent rail accidents.</p>
	<p>We all come to the debate with our own experiences and concerns. One of my constituents, Brian Cooper, a well respected member of the local community and family man, was killed in the Paddington accident. He was a driver and a member of ASLEF, a professional who through no fault of his own was killed that day. The Southall crash occurred within less than a mile of my constituency, and many constituents and others were injured. In addition, I was in Camden town hall on the night of the King's Cross fire. That was a number of years ago, before I came to this place. I was involved as an officer in arranging emergency morgues for those who unfortunately lost their lives. We have all been sensitised to the issue of rail safety over the years, but most of us acknowledge that rail is one of the safest forms of transport. All our work is about supporting the continuing safety of the rail system.</p>
	<p>In addition to supporting the campaign for seat belts, I want to raise three issues briefly. The first relates to the Railways Bill, which is before the House. When the Bill reaches Report and at other stages, there will be limited time to emphasise some detailed points. I want to raise one matter now that I do not think will be picked up as a result of the Bill; I do not think that it will appear in it. I am referring to the transfer of responsibility from the Health and Safety Executive to the Office of Rail Regulation and the resulting transfer of the staff. Staff from the Strategic Rail Authority will be transferred to the Department for Transport.</p>
	<p>As hon. Members will know, the Bill makes it clear that the Government's policy is to transfer health and safety work to the ORR, despite the recommendation by Lord Cullen after the Ladbroke Grove crash that such work should be separate from any organisation that is responsible for the economic overview and regulation of the industry. A number of organisations have opposed the measure, including the Health and Safety Commission, the HSE, the TUC, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers and all the other trade unions that represent workers in the industry. The   matter needs careful consideration, because the one thing that we do not want is for economic considerations to impact in any way on the safety of the industry.</p>
	<p>The concern that I particularly want to raise, which I do not think will be picked up in the debate on the Bill, is about what will happen to staff who transfer from the HSE to the ORR and from the SRA to the Department for Transport. We must ensure that the number of staff is maintained and that we do not lose their expertise, as we have in some instances as a result of privatisation. The staff in the SRA are not just bureaucrats dealing with economic competition and other matters. They have within their remit the best running of the service, which includes health and safety. I am concerned about the potential loss of their expertise, too.</p>
	<p>My understanding is that, as yet, hon. Members and   others in the industry have not been consulted or   informed of the staffing structures that will be established under the Office of Rail Regulation or within the Department for Transport. It means that we cannot be sure whether the number of staff being transferred is adequate and necessary for the future maintenance of health and safety in the industry and, in addition, whether the right expertise has been maintained, developed and properly organised.</p>
	<p>I am especially concerned about some of the information from discussions that are going on within the Departments that there may be a loss of anything up to 200 jobs in the Department for Transport. I am not sure what the staffing numbers in the Office of Rail Regulation will be in respect of the staff transfer from the Health and Safety Executive. I hope that we can be assured today&mdash;if not now, perhaps in writing from the Minister&mdash;that there will be no loss of jobs or expertise as a result of that transfer and that reduction in staff transferring from the SRA to the Department for Transport will have no effect on overall transport safety in the industry.</p>
	<p>So far, we understand that there has been no offer of TUPE in respect of the transfer, so there could be a loss of staff and of professional expertise. In addition, it looks as though some of the staff on transfer from both organisations will be competing for jobs with existing staff in the Department for Transport. That has the potential to introduce turbulence in the organisation, which could&mdash;I say only &quot;could&quot;&mdash;result in staff taking their eye off the ball in terms of maintaining their responsibilities with regard to the health and safety legislation that they must ensure is implemented.</p>
	<p>I appreciate the dedication of the staff, but any reorganisation of this sort causes anxieties and insecurities, particularly if people feel that their job will not be the same, that it will not be in place for them when they transfer, or that they will be competing against others for new posts that have been established. I would welcome the Minister considering that issue. If he cannot comment on that issue today, I would appreciate his considering it and giving us the information at a later date.</p>
	<p>The second issue that I want to raise is the draft Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2004 on safety on London Underground. Earlier this year, the Government proposed reform of the Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989, which were made after the King's Cross fire. They set a basic minimum standard for fire precautions below ground on London Underground as a result of the Fennell inquiry into that fire. The draft order was brought forward, which would change the burden of proof. At present, the burden of proof is such that the   fire authority must be satisfied that a specific requirement at a particular location is inappropriate, unnecessary or not reasonably practicable if the fire safety order is not to be maintained at the current standards.</p>
	<p>However, under the Government's proposed procedure, it will be for the fire authority to demonstrate that the rail industry has failed to carry out a suitable, sufficient risk assessment. That reversal of the burden of proof is causing anxiety in the industry, particularly as the orders were developed as a result of the direct experience of the Fennell inquiry into what happened at King's Cross.</p>
	<p>As a result of intervention by the Select Committee on Regulatory Reform, the Government have agreed to review the order and to return after consultation about guidance. I place on record that we are anxious that that   consultation should start soon and should be as exhaustive as possible to engage all parties.</p>
	<p>The King's Cross fire was a shattering experience not just for the travelling public of London, but for all those engaged in fire safety below ground: the workers running the system as well as the firefighters. The Government need to be careful when they lift in any way the regulatory supervision of fire safety precautions below ground. In that respect, care must be taken about future consultation.</p>
	<p>I want to raise the issue of risk assessments. I do so with some care because, at the moment, it is difficult to pin down hard evidence; much of the evidence that is coming forward is anecdotal. I want to use this occasion to draw attention to the discussions that are taking place in the rail industry about the way in which fire risk and safety risk assessments are generally undertaken.</p>
	<p>A view is emerging&mdash;at this stage, it is only anecdotal&mdash;that when risk assessments are undertaken they are carried out on behalf of companies by a limited number of professional agencies, and that there almost seems to be a monopoly situation emerging among the professional advisers on risk assessments in the rail industry. There is also a view that companies are increasingly putting pressure on the professionals that undertake those risk assessments. Obviously, such matters would give us all cause for concern.</p>
	<p>I would like to put two things on record today. First, I invite anyone in the industry who has any evidence of    companies putting pressure on professionals undertaking risk assessments to come forward and to provide us with hard evidence. We can then discuss and debate that evidence with the Government.</p>
	<p>Secondly, the Government need to consult and to consider whether new guidance should be drawn up in conjunction with the new body that will be established&mdash;the Office of Rail Regulation&mdash;on how those risk assessments should be undertaken. We must ensure that the risk assessments are completely independent, that assessors are not at risk from pressure from the    individual companies concerned, and that the assessments are undertaken properly by professionally trained individuals and organisations. We must also avoid the situation in which a limited number of agencies or companies provide those risk assessments, leading to the emergence of a monopoly.</p>
	<p>Finally, I pay tribute again to all who work in the industry for maintaining its current safety levels. It is as a result of professional dedication that we have such a safe rail industry and rail system. However, the maintenance of that safety record is also a result of the eternal vigilance of hon. Members.</p>

	<p>I, too, begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) on raising this important subject for debate. I congratulate him also on his campaign to achieve the provision of safety belts in all coaches. I will not, however, speak on that subject today, although I wish to raise a number of other potential safety improvements later in my remarks.</p>
	<p>The crash at Ufton Nervet took place just to the south of my constituency&mdash;about 100 yd to the south of the border between my constituency and the constituency of Wokingham. The train that was involved in the crash was due to stop&mdash;it would have been its next stop&mdash;at Newbury, in the heart of my constituency. As soon as I heard about the crash, I realised that it was almost inevitable that a number of people who were on that train and potentially among the injured or dead would be among my constituents and, indeed, that I would probably know quite a number of them personally. That has turned out to be the case. Sadly, one of those who died was indeed known to me, as was her daughter, and I also knew quite a number of the injured. Many of my constituents have been greatly saddened by the accident and are keen to see that any lessons that can be learned from it are duly learned.</p>
	<p>I pay tribute to those in the emergency services, who did a wonderful job. I was with some of them on that night seeing the work that they were doing&mdash;I was, of course, not at the site itself, where I thought that it would be entirely inappropriate for me to be, because I could do nothing there. The emergency services did a fantastic job in getting people out as quickly as they could and in saving those who were injured from any further injury.</p>
	<p>I should like also to pay tribute to many of the local residents who, when they heard what had happened, voluntarily went down to the site and did a good job in helping those who were involved in the crash. I pay tribute also to the landlord and the employees of the &quot;Winning Hand&quot; pub, to which many of the walking wounded were able to go and be given help, succour, warmth and some sort of hope for the future, having been involved in such a traumatic accident. Many of the passengers showed a deal of heroism at the site. Having got out fairly quickly and without much injury, many went back in to help those who were left behind. That shows a terrific heroic spirit, to which it is well worth paying tribute. I send my condolences to the victims and the relatives of those who were so tragically killed on that night.</p>
	<p>There are a number of lessons to be learned from the    incident, some of which have been mentioned by my hon. Friend, who also brought up the subject of hammers. About two days after the crash, I received a call from someone who was not one of my constituent&mdash;I suppose because he had heard me on the radio or seen me on the television&mdash;who told me about his experience. He had been in one of the carriages that toppled over in the accident, after which he found that the doors at the end of the carriage seemed to be blocked, as one might expect in such a horrific accident. It was fortuitous that he later ascertained that he could unblock them and get out through them because, having found them apparently blocked, and having read the emergency instructions, which all too few of us do, he remembered where the emergency hammers were, and took out a hammer at one end of the carriage and hit the window correctly in the corner at its weakest spot, only to find that the hammer snapped at the end of the shaft, and the window did not break. Assuming that that was just bad luck and that the hammer was faulty, he used the emergency hammer at the other end of the carriage, but precisely the same thing happened there. It was only then that he made greater efforts to open the doors and found that he could get himself and his fellow passengers out through them.</p>

	<p>I was not aware of that. I am delighted that my hon. Friend has raised that point, because it shows that the incident may not have been a one-off and that there are serious faults in the manufacture of the    hammers, which make them pretty useless. The hammers are there to give people hope that they may be able to get out in an emergency. For people then to find that they cannot get out because the equipment is not up to its job is worse than anything. The knowledge that this issue has been raised before makes it even more important that railway services do something about hammers, and ensure that they are tested again and again to ensure that they can be used for their proper purpose.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend also raised the issue of emergency lighting. As I said, it is fortunate that the passenger of whom I spoke had read the emergency instructions beforehand. All too many of us do not read emergency instructions or update ourselves on them. If, in the event of a crash, we have not bothered to do so and there is no proper emergency lighting, we cannot possibly see what we are supposed to do, especially if one is lying on one's side. So, the importance of good emergency lighting is the second lesson to be learned from that accident. If there is none, we really are in trouble if we do not know all the things that we are supposed to do in such situations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-12-15.305.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1187" speakername="David Rendel" colnum="305"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041215/halltext/41215h03.htm#41215h03_spnew10">
	<p>That surprises me rather less. I have been aware for a long time that emergency lighting on trains is not very good, so it does not surprise me that the issue has been brought up before. I had not realised that hammers had broken before, but many of us have been aware of the lack of emergency lighting for some time.</p>
	<p>However, the train did have some light-sticks, which some people managed to use to give some light, but light-sticks would probably not give sufficient light for a person to read. They may give a vague glow to enable one to see a little of the carriage and where other people   and objects are, but they certainly would not be sufficient to give one a chance to read the emergency instructions.</p>
	<p>The third lesson that needs to be learned comes from the interesting point that in train crashes of the sort that happened at Ufton Nervet, in which a train runs into a vehicle on a level crossing, there are often no significant injuries or deaths among train passengers. I understand that it was the first time in 18 years that a train passenger has been killed in an accident of that sort.</p>
	<p>The reason why much greater damage was done to the passengers in the Ufton Nervet case was that the train continued for a long time along the top of the sleepers in an upright position after being derailed on the level crossing. Indeed, I understand that in a crash last year a train that was derailed after hitting something travelled upright for two miles. In the case in question, however, the train hit a set of points at a freight siding only about 200 yd beyond the point at which it was derailed, before it was toppled by the rail going off from the main rail.</p>
	<p>Damage was done to the passengers inside the train because the carriages fell on their sides and because some buckled. When the carriages fell over some of the   windows on the underside broke and, sadly, some people were either thrown out or injured by being dragged along as the train ran along the ground.</p>
	<p>That shows that the rail services and Network Rail should look into all level crossings that are close to a set of points, where exactly those circumstances might arise again. That is particularly so where there is a half-barrier crossing and therefore a greater likelihood&mdash;although not much greater&mdash;of an accident with a car derailing the train in the first instance.</p>
	<p>Half-barriers on high-speed lines should certainly be looked at again. There is not much chance of stopping a train travelling at even 100 mph&mdash;about the maximum speed across a half-barrier crossing&mdash;if a vehicle is on the crossing. It is relatively easy to get a vehicle on to the crossing, particularly if somebody is trying to commit suicide, as seemed to be the case.</p>
	<p>My fourth point, which has not been raised yet, but which the passenger who spoke to me mentioned, is that there seems to be no procedure for the emergency services to collect the names of those involved in such incidents after the event. In the case in question, the train company concerned received great credit for giving those who were uninjured every opportunity to reach their destinations, by coaches or other means, as quickly as possible after getting off the train. That is all very well for the passengers concerned, who want to go home and be with their loved ones after such a traumatic incident. However, if they are all taken away by the rail company quickly, before their details are taken, it is difficult to get   back in touch with them, to inform them of any available counselling services to enable them to get over   the trauma, for instance, except through general announcements on the radio or in the press.</p>
	<p>Another important reason why it might be important to get back in touch with passengers is because facts might come to light after the event that indicate that something was wrong with the train. It might be important then to get back in touch with the people who were sitting in a particular carriage, to ask whether they noticed anything&mdash;whether the brakes were squealing, whether the windows were cracked before the train left the station, and so on. It might be necessary to ask the passengers about many things to establish what was really wrong with the train and how the damage and injury to passengers could have been avoided. There ought to be a system that is known to all the emergency services for collecting the names and details of the passengers involved in such incidents before they leave the site and can no longer be properly traced.</p>
	<p>I want to reiterate that, in general terms, travel by rail is much safer than travel by road. I would hate anyone to think that the accident in question should prevent or deter people from travelling by rail. It is important that we should continue our rail services and encourage people to travel by rail. However, people will be encouraged more if they can be sure that the rail system is as safe as it can be. I therefore hope that some of the points raised in this debate will be properly considered by the Minister and by the rail services, to ensure that every rail passenger can be sure that they will arrive at their destination safe and sound.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross), as well as other hon. Members who have contributed to the debate, on speaking so knowledgeably and, at times, movingly on such a serious subject. I apologise for not being the usual Liberal Democrat transport spokesman; we are currently experiencing the same problem with transport spokesmen as Liverpool is with strikers. We wait with anticipation the January transfer window, and I am sure that the problem will be resolved. I was a member of the Transport Committee, but I apologise if some of what I   say reveals that my knowledge is like some of the track&mdash;a little rusty.</p>
	<p>Safety on rail is absolutely paramount, in the personal sense, for passengers, and in a commercial sense, for the companies. They wish to provide a safe service, and that is obviously crucial to the long-term financial viability of rail. Despite Hatfield, Potters Bar, Southall, Selby, Berkshire and Ladbroke Grove, basically people still feel safe on trains. Statistically, it would appear that, compared with a family car, they are safe. However, being safe is not the same as being invulnerable. The law of physics still applies, and when a train stops abruptly, passengers and the less restrained will continue to move at the same velocity as the train previously was. Accidents will happen, and passengers will be brought to an abrupt stop, along with parts of the train body. I am acutely aware of that phenomenon because I have been in an accident myself, where I did not have a safety belt&mdash;not a train accident but a car accident. My one recollection is not of actually hitting something&mdash;I never realised that I had done so&mdash;but simply of blood pouring out of my head. The accident had happened before I was even aware of it, and it was a relatively low-speed car accident. I can anticipate what a high-speed train accident must be like, and how horrifying it must be for the individuals involved.</p>
	<p>As with cars, the thrust is about design. Clearly, much thought goes in to the security of fittings on trains to ensure that they do not become displaced when accidents occur. Much thought also goes in to what sort of windows and glass should be installed, but clearly not enough thought has gone in to what sort of hammers are used to break the windows when people need to evacuate through them. Thought has also been given to the security of luggage&mdash;people have been seriously maimed by their own or misplaced luggage&mdash;and to how doors function in an accident. The overwhelming imperative, as with car safety, is to ensure that if an accident occurs, there is nothing obvious that will do immediate and dramatic damage to individuals. It was some time before car drivers realised that what was most likely to happen to them in the event of a front collision was that they were going to be pinioned by their own steering wheel.</p>
	<p>Much thought has been given to the positioning of fuel tanks, and to consider what might happen if one caught fire. Honeycombing layouts have been suggested that will mean that if one aspect of the fuel system starts to combust, the whole thing will not catch fire. Thought needs to be given to how people exit if the worst-case scenario happens, and what happens when they cannot exit, how the carriage will function and if there is enough survival space for the people involved to remain alive until they are rescued.</p>
	<p>Much of all this has been learned the hard way. People have not always anticipated, or been able to   anticipate, what might happen in every scenario. I   should therefore pay tribute to someone such as Mr.   Webster, who has experienced an appalling tragedy but who wishes to draw from such a tragedy lessons that ultimately will benefit other people. I am full of admiration for such people; we all know individuals in other contexts who, having had awful events overtake them, ensure that none of the same happens to other people. Mr. Webster is clearly a man of that ilk, and given the gravity of what happened to him, it is commendable that he took steps to bring information to my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge, who in turn has brought it to the awareness of the House of Commons.</p>
	<p>After any tragedy, people try to learn practical, sensible lessons, and seat belts are an obvious idea because they will save lives. There may be a dispute as to whether they should be mandatory or optional; there may be discussion about how they can be fixed and whether they can be fixed satisfactorily to existing carriages. There may also be operational considerations about how will people will use them. If people keep getting out of their seats, will there be discomfort for other passengers? It is worth talking about these issues, but if there is a prima facie case for saying that lives may be saved&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge has presented more than a prima facie case&mdash;there is, at the very least, a case for serious research and for train companies actively to consider piloting the use of seat belts.</p>
	<p>As the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) said, there is a balance to be struck between economic and safety considerations; that is almost inescapable. Of course, one could build a family car that could survive any sort of accident that might befall it, but the problem is that it would be prohibitive to produce and use. The same applies to all safety recommendations, right through even to the Cullen report. None the less, in the debate about economic and    safety considerations, priority must lie with safety,   which must not be sacrificed for short-term commercial gain.</p>
	<p>One other lesson that we can learn&mdash;it applies to the seat belt issue, too&mdash;is that problems invariably become more complicated the fewer the people on the train who are seated. We should not, therefore, countenance a system that presupposes that people will not be seated for most of the time. Given the way in which the railways work and passengers appear, there will inevitably be an element of overcrowding and some passengers will be unable to find seats, but we should not have scheduled or planned overcrowding. On the Virgin inter-city service that I often use, the four first-class carriages are usually unavailable to most passengers, and, at peak times, the four standard-class carriages are invariably full of standing passengers. Such situations are a known economic fact of life, which occur repeatedly on high-speed inter-city services and often lead to particular carriages being declassified. Such commercial practices are unacceptable because they compound safety problems.</p>
	<p>There is often a long lead-in time for safety improvements on public transport. It was known for some time&mdash;long before the Herald of Free Enterprise toppled over&mdash;that roll-on/roll-off ferries had a problem. The problems of carriage slam doors and inflammable seats were also known for some time. If rail is to become safer, we must think ahead quickly because the lead-in time for improvements means that it takes a while to design, commission and build new trains.</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend may be interested to know that some rolling stock companies are pressing for changes to be made quickly, because they are building stock now. Their economic concern is that they are not asked to retrofit carriages to new standards at a later date.</p>

	<p>I    congratulate the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) on securing the debate. As it follows the Ufton Nervet accident, the thoughts of all of us are with the families who have been affected by that tragedy, including that of the train driver, Stan Martin, who was just doing in his job, and with Peter Webster and others whose loved ones were killed. I also join the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) in paying tribute to the emergency services, which responded quickly and superbly in the difficult conditions that prevailed at the scene. Despite that tragic accident, we should not forget that rail travel continues to be one of   the safest forms of travel in the United Kingdom, as   the hon. Members for Hayes and Harlington (John   McDonnell), for Newbury and for Southport (Dr. Pugh) have said.</p>
	<p>The safety of our railways has always attracted a large amount of scrutiny, particularly in the media. It is right that we discuss openly the safety of the railways. However, it is equally important that we do not forget that rail is a safe form of travel&mdash;there was not one major incident on the railway during the whole of the year 2003&ndash;04, whereas 3,508 people were killed last year on the roads, a 2 per cent. increase on the previous year. That is nearly 10 people a day. We should recognise the rail industry's efforts to reduce risks even further.</p>
	<p>While comparisons show that rail continues to be the safest form of travel, that does not mean that there are not still improvements to be made, nor that we should become complacent about safety issues. The points made by the hon. Member for Teignbridge must be explored and considered. One of his suggestions&mdash;I have also heard him propose it on the Floor of the House&mdash;was to fit trains with seat belts.</p>
	<p>Hon. Members will know that it was a Conservative Government who made the wearing of seat belts in cars compulsory. It has been estimated that 50,000 lives have been saved and 590,000 serious casualties avoided as a consequence of that legislation. Therefore, I can say that my party recognises the benefits of using seat belts where appropriate. However, I have searched for examples of countries in which trains have been fitted with seat belts. The Health and Safety Executive has said that it is not aware of any such schemes in operation anywhere else in the world. I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister can provide us with any examples.</p>
	<p>I have found just one limited example of a trial of seat belts on a train&mdash;I understand that it is the only one that   has ever taken place. In 1999, the Finnish rail administration carried out the experiment of fitting seat belts in some of the carriages of a train. Over the course of a year, it gathered the views of 1,500 passengers, some of whom had had the chance to use the belts. It found that seat belts were used by just 1.1 per cent. of passengers who had the opportunity of using them. That is the difficulty with the idea; one of the main selling points of train travel has always been that, unlike in a car, one can wander around the train&mdash;perhaps to use the buffet or restaurant or to go to the lavatory&mdash;rather than being confined to one's seat. Therefore, seat belt wearing will not happen without a change in the culture of train travel. If the figures from the Finnish experiment are accurate, it is clear that seat belt wearing would have to be made compulsory to be effective. When we introduced the legislation to require those in cars to use seat belts, the seat belt was already regarded as acceptable, and something that should be used. It had widespread public support.</p>
	<p>Anybody who travels at peak times, especially on London-bound commuter trains, knows full well that the number of passengers is invariably greater than the number of seats. That often results in people standing in the gangways and in the door vestibule areas. Clearly, if seat belt legislation were introduced, train capacity would be greatly reduced. While that is not in itself an argument against seat belts, it is something to bear in mind.</p>

	<p>I am seeking further and better particulars of the Finnish experiment, and until I receive them I do not know how much weight we should give to it. It may have been a flawed experiment. Perhaps the Minister can give us more information; I would welcome any details. So far, I have found out that it was a fairly limited experiment on a long-distance train, but I do not know whether the train stopped frequently.</p>
	<p>It is important to take experts' views into account when considering safety matters. Her Majesty's railway inspectorate has commented on the idea of introducing seat belts. It is</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;not persuaded that the fitting of seat belts in trains is a reasonably practicable safety precaution.&quot;</p>
	<p>In reference to the Finnish experiment, it says:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;While some passengers may use seat belts voluntarily, there would be little point in fitting them without reasonable expectation that they would be relatively widely used. Compulsory use would, of course, require legislation, but before moving to that stage, HMRI would need to be very much more convinced about the overall benefits and also practicality on matters such as enforcement and the total prohibition on standing passengers.&quot;</p>
	<p>I agree with that and am not yet convinced that the fitting of seat belts is the answer.</p>
	<p>Another consideration is the cost. If a study showed an overriding case for seat belts, the cost would be a secondary consideration, as the hon. Member for Teignbridge said. However, if the case was ambiguous at best and usage was low, as in the Finnish study, there would have to be careful consideration of the best way to spend the money. For example, could the money be better spent improving luggage racks, so that in the event of a collision or sudden braking, the luggage stays secure and does not fall down and become a danger to passengers? Could the money be better spent improving means of escaping from an overturned carriage by perhaps providing an escape hatch or door to avoid the problems of windows not breaking when hit with the emergency hammer? Or, as the hon. Member for Newbury said, could the money be better spent on level crossings, where there is always a risk of a collision, perhaps to warn the signalman or at specific crossings where there are points near to the interface with the road?</p>
	<p>There has been a debate on introducing seat belts in the United States but, as far as I am aware, there have not yet been any experiments. The US Federal Railroad Administration has said that it does not believe that seat belts are necessary on trains</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;as they rarely stop suddenly from speed&quot;,</p>
	<p>so instances of passengers being thrown forward are far fewer than in a car. It concludes that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;seat belts would scarcely have reduced the numbers of people killed in train accidents.&quot;</p>
	<p>I do not know why it reached that conclusion, and I should like to see the evidence for that. One fear is that seat belts on trains might make them less attractive to users and drive passengers on to roads, which we do not want to happen.</p>
	<p>Does the Minister find it worrying that last week the survivors of the Paddington disaster expressed their concern that some measures proposed in the wake of the disaster are still to be introduced? We welcome progress that has been made on many of the problems outlined in the inquiry, but will the Minister comment on the specific concerns of the Paddington survivors group? What does he have to say about the increase in the number of signals passed at danger, which appears still to be happening, and the failure to install anti-collision systems in all 2,500 signals considered high risk?</p>
	<p>Accidents are not the only aspect to consider when debating health and safety. The personal safety of    passengers is also important, and everything reasonably possible should be done to ensure it. It is therefore disturbing that Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary has revealed an increase in the number of incidents involving personal attacks on the London tube and the national rail network. Its figures show that violent crime has increased by 14 per cent., and that sexual assaults have recently increased by more than 12 per cent. Could the reason for those increases be the underfunding of British Transport police? The Conservative party has supported calls earlier this year from the Select Committee on Transport for the funding of British Transport police to be included in the rail review. Will the Minister do that?</p>
	<p>Although funding and the numbers of police are important, we need to consider new ways of deploying them. One option would be for trains travelling late at night on services at risk from yobbish behaviour to have a designated police officer in one carriage. That would surely reassure passengers that they were safe travelling by rail at night.</p>
	<p>We look forward to the Minister's comments on these issues. The safety of all rail passengers should be paramount, and the Government need to continue to address this matter. We should always be prepared to make changes and improvements in the public interest where there is evidence that we should do so.</p>

	<p>I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) on securing this important debate on rail safety. I am grateful to those colleagues who prefaced their remarks by saying that rail is an extremely safe form of travel. That is no accident. Over successive years, many professional, dedicated and committed staff throughout the rail industry have sought to ensure, and have succeeded in ensuring, that rail is overwhelmingly a safe form of travel.</p>
	<p>I take this opportunity to offer my deepest sympathy to the families and friends of all those who were killed in the fatal accident at Ufton Nervet on 6 November. As   others have done, I thank the emergency services for   their swift and efficient response to the incident. Throughout that weekend, the speed, efficiency, commitment and professionalism of all involved, including Network Rail and First Great Western, were quite staggering. Often in the past, the wrangling between Network Rail, the train company and others about who was responsible for what added to people's discomfort in the wake of such incidents. In this case, however, Network Rail and First Great Western acted in an exemplary fashion.</p>
	<p>I also thank all those in the Bishop of Reading's office who organised last week's memorial service, which I attended. It was very moving, and a fitting tribute to those who died or were injured. Although I cannot begin to understand the pain and anguish of families such as the Websters, which they must continue to suffer, I can appreciate the desire of all those affected by the accident to ensure that measures are taken to prevent a similar accident from happening again.</p>
	<p>As people know, the Health and Safety Executive report, published on 10 November, confirmed that there were no faults with the level crossing equipment or the   train, and that the train driver was in no way to blame. In effect, there was no failure of the railway infrastructure. Indeed, all the lessons learned from the past were fed into the design of the train involved, which showed the robustness of those trains. I am no safety expert, but I believe that that robustness probably and mercifully prevented there from being more casualties and injuries. Many of the staff, the police and other emergency services personnel to whom I spoke who were working on the ground when they heard the first reports of what had happened at Ufton Nervet anticipated far worse casualties. They say that the design of the train and its crash worthiness were part of that robustness, which, as I said, meant that there were fewer injuries.</p>
	<p>If I have one small criticism of the tenor of today's debate, it is the notion that those lessons have not already been learned and that new features have not been built into the structure and design of trains. They have been. That is not to suggest that there are not lessons still to be learned, and I shall come to those shortly. It is no accident that we have one of the safest rail systems. It is the result of the successive iteration of the design, structure and other features of rolling stock. I do not fully accept that economies are fed into the process by ROSCOs and that safety, especially for new rolling stock, somehow falls down the agenda. That is not the case, and it is irresponsible to suggest that it is.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-12-15.313.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1082" speakername="Tony McNulty" colnum="313"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041215/halltext/41215h03.htm#41215h03_spnew18">
	<p>Absolutely not. My comments were about the crushability, crashworthiness and other elements of the sets. I freely said that there are lessons to be learned, as has been suggested, about such things as emergency lighting, hammers and windows. However, without over-speculating, and given the complexity of the accident, things could have been far, far worse with a frailer set of carriages.</p>
	<p>I know that there are lessons to be learned, and I   shall   come to those shortly. Not the least of them&mdash;it is one point among a host&mdash;is that the Rail Safety and   Standards Board is exploring in greater detail the   proximity of the points to the level crossing, a complexity that made things worse. That and all other dimensions of the derailment will be examined in a formal rail industry investigation by the RSSB, but it is right and proper that the investigation will consider the wider aspects of level crossing safety as well as the immediate cause of the accident.</p>
	<p>The points made about level crossing safety were well made, but they, too, need to be seen in context. The dangers of level crossings are not new, and the interface between rail and road presents particular problems. I   shall deal with the specifics in a moment, but all 8,000    level crossings are regularly risk-assessed. However, even with the greatest will in the world, one cannot risk-assess people's behaviour.</p>
	<p>There has been an array of various types of level crossing incidents. On the very night of the Ufton Nervet accident, at a half-barrier crossing not far away, a white van zig-zagged between the two barriers while they were down. We have had instances on crossings on farm land&mdash;they are unmanned, and crossing is entirely up to the individual&mdash;and an incident at a fully staffed full-barrier crossing in Lincolnshire. Crossings are always kept firmly under review. A national level crossing safety group is always considering how to improve things and make crossings safer. That group rightly includes highway authorities, the police, motoring groups, ramblers and others who might use level crossings.</p>
	<p>I shall dwell momentarily on the question of seat belts. It is true that the Secretary of State has asked the RSSB to consider the question of seat belts as part of its formal industry investigation into the Ufton Nervet derailment. We cannot say, as the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) suggested, that a prima facie case can be made that seat belts save lives. It is not that clear cut. Indeed, concern has been expressed that, in some circumstances, safety belts can cause damage by restraining passengers. However, all these areas need exploration.</p>
	<p>There has been a limited Finnish experiment. I am trying to find out more about it, but I believe that a train of three or four carriages had only 131 seat belts, so the outcome was limited and the results not terribly worth while. However, I think that the RSSB needs to consider that matter and we have made a commitment in that regard.</p>
	<p>When it comes to changing safety regulations, we take our steer from the Health and Safety Commission, and it is on record as saying that it is not convinced, in relation to the reasonable practicability guide relating to   health and safety legislation, that safety belts are appropriate. However, the matter needs exploring on an ongoing basis. Indeed, considering all issues and research on an ongoing basis is the key to our success in relative terms on rail safety. Safety hammers, laminated glass versus other types and emergency lighting&mdash;the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) is right that light-sticks were used in a limited way but to great effect at Ufton Nervet&mdash;will be explored in the context of Ufton Nervet and more broadly, as is right and proper. The hon. Member for Teignbridge will know that we are setting up a rail accident investigation branch along the lines of the marine and aviation equivalents, as per Lord Cullen's report. The legislation has been passed and the RAIB will be in place by next spring.</p>
	<p>Let me make a few points on the issues that hon. Members raised beyond Ufton Nervet and the consequences of that. I can assure my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) that there is no suggestion other than that all rail safety functions and staff currently at the Health and Safety Executive will move en bloc to the office of rail regulation. There is no question of any redundancies or anything other than everything going over to the ORR. The case of the Strategic Rail Authority and the Department for Transport is slightly different, in that about 100 staff at the Department are involved with rail   and there are about 500 at the SRA, and there is duplication in that pool of 600 staff. I am talking about central administration and backroom staff rather than railway experts. According to the high-level design that we have put out thus far for the DFT structure in respect of rail, we think that about 250, 280 or 300 staff will be a more appropriate number when the duplication and other elements have worked their way through the system.</p>
	<p>Having said that, we are not about to lose the expertise that the SRA provides in respect of rail. I have said time and again that the SRA's demise is not a function of a critique of how ineffective it has been over the past three or four years. The SRA has been very effective in many areas of expertise. That is what has got us to a position in which we can move on in terms of the model. All staff at the SRA and the DFT come under Cabinet Office provision and TUPE when it comes to transfer. That is a certainty.</p>
	<p>I shall take back to the Department my hon. Friend's concerns about consultation on fire safety below ground because I do not have sufficient knowledge of that. I am troubled by the point about economic pressures being brought to bear on professionals who conduct risk assessments. If there is any evidence to stand up such a claim, I would certainly like to see it. Underpinning all that we do on rail safety in terms of the public and private sectors is proper, professional and dispassionate risk assessment of danger, whether that relates to level crossings or other aspects. I share many of the concerns that hon. Members have, and they will be explored in relation to Ufton Nervet. Rail safety underpins everything that we do; it is paramount.</p>
	<p>I return to the starting point for many of the contributions that we have heard: rail safety is overwhelmingly good in this country. Very sadly, on the day of the Ufton Nervet accident, 10 people died on our roads, and 10 people died the next day. I agree with the hon. Member for Teignbridge about comparing apples with oranges; we must consider safety across all modes of transport. The hon. Member for Newbury is right to say that Ufton Nervet was the first time that there had been rail passenger casualties because of a level crossing incident for the best part of 18 years, and the incident before the one 18 years ago happened 20 years before. We must learn the lessons of Ufton Nervet and keep a strong focus on what is happening in relation to level crossings, but all hon. Members can be assured that safety in the rail industry will remain paramount in our focus. I appreciate that our deliberations have been largely non-political and non-partisan, as they should be. The people who travel on our railways would expect no less.</p>

	<p>I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to raise what is not   only an important issue per se but one that is rapidly escalating as a political issue in many of our constituencies. I know that the Minister understands that only too well and that he has spoken to many other right hon. and hon. Members about the difficulties of dealing with the unauthorised development of Travellers' sites on private land. Indeed, it is a pressing problem that has been evidenced by the amount of questioning and debate in the House in recent months. Even today, an opportune question was put to the Prime Minister, and it was interesting to note his response.</p>
	<p>The debate has already benefited from extremely valuable contributions by hon. Members introducing private Members' legislation and securing Adjournment debates, and by the careful consideration of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Committee. I hope that, in raising the debate, we are all seeking to do two things: first, to make planning law work more effectively for all concerned; and secondly&mdash;this is one of my principal motivating forces&mdash;to prevent a heightening of tension between the settled and travelling communities.</p>
	<p>I see that tension developing in many of the communities that I represent because of the effect of the   developments, and I am afraid to say that I have examples throughout my constituency. There is a problem down in the south Somerset area and a long-standing difficulty in the East Lambrook area. In the north of my constituency near Frome, we have ongoing issues at Trudoxhill and Rudge. I see the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Flook), who has a well publicised and difficult issue developing in North Curry, which is close to my constituency boundary. He seeks to intervene, and I am happy to let him.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-12-15.316.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" speakername="David Heath" colnum="316"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041215/halltext/41215h04.htm#41215h04_spnew2">
	<p>It is not the patience of hon. Members but the patience of communities that we represent that is being tested. There is a degree of urgency. I want to be as constructive as possible because the Government are wrestling with some difficult issues, but nevertheless we have reached the point where we need to see changes in the basic structure of the relevant regulations.</p>
	<p>The difficulty arises from what was the utmost folly in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 of repealing the relevant sections of the Caravan Sites Act 1968. When I was leader of a county council, I could bore for Britain on the provisions of the 1968 Act. It was at the forefront of our minds, not only because we were dealing with what might be considered the traditional Traveller communities, including the Romany people, but because back in the 1980s we were also dealing, particularly in Somerset and the west country, with a huge number of what were then described as new age travellers. They were attracted by not only the county of Somerset per se but the Glastonbury festival and other such events.</p>
	<p>We were wrestling on a day-to-day basis with the implications of the Caravan Sites Act 1968. However, all of us who were engaged with the issue could see that repealing that legislation would mean a dearth of caravan sites, the result of which would be not the disappearance of the Travellers, but more and more   engagement in what would prove to be illegal encampments, which in turn would cause more problems for local authorities and local communities rather than less.</p>
	<p>Concomitant with those changes to the law was the removal of the grant to local authorities to provide accommodation for sites. The responsibility was no longer there, so most authorities no longer felt that they had any locus in provision. The guidance that was issued at the time made the assumption that private sites could and would be developed and would be welcomed by local communities, but that proved to be far from the case. That guidance is extant and is still inadequate.</p>
	<p>It is therefore important to see the issue from both sides of the fence, as it were. I certainly do not want to lead any crusade against the Traveller communities. They suffer a high level of discrimination and it is no part of Parliament's activities to make that worse. Such communities will readily say that the number of sites available to them is hugely insufficient. That has been quantified and there is a significant shortfall of such sites against the number of people who would wish to use them.</p>
	<p>Such people would point to the fact that planning authorities do not accept their need to establish private sites, even in areas where doing so might be considered entirely appropriate, and the fact that they are far more likely to be met with rejection than acceptance. Such people would also argue that even the sites that are   provided under local authority control are often deeply inadequate, overcrowded and with insufficient provision. There is therefore a sense of aggrievement on the part of the Traveller community. The response to that, however, of buying land, irrespective of where it might be, and deliberately undertaking unauthorised development, secure in the knowledge that the processes of law are sufficiently dilatory and open to argument to enable such people successfully to develop where others would not be allowed to, is not the answer.</p>
	<p>That is where the views of the settled community come in. The settled community is enormously resentful, not about the fact that there might be a Travellers' site in the vicinity, but about the inequity, as it sees it, of the fact that the people who develop such sites do so in defiance of the planning law that governs its activities. The most common response that I have encountered, from people who I know do not have a discriminatory outlook, is that the situation is unfair. They wonder how on earth the law can allow such things.</p>
	<p>There is a feeling of inequity and of impatience with the prolonged proceedings, in which first a retrospective planning application must be considered, after which, if refused, comes the inevitable appeal and inquiry. If that process is unsuccessful, there is a renewed delay involving any eviction or enforcement activity. The result is a feeling of impotence that is shared by the members of local authorities who find themselves in the extremely difficult position of having to answer to their communities for the fact that they cannot do what they know they ought to be able to do in law.</p>
	<p>Many settled communities also feel imperilled&mdash;sometimes rightly. I do not accept for one moment that the existence of a Travellers' site is concomitant with antisocial behaviour or crime of any kind. That is an unacceptable equation. Nevertheless, it is one that is made by many communities, which makes it all the more important to ensure that the law applies equally to all our citizens in both positive and negative circumstances. There can be no no-go areas for our police, or areas in which antisocial behaviour is tolerated simply because it is not taking place among the settled community.</p>
	<p>Further concern is caused by other factors. Many constituents who have faced the situation have told me that they cannot for the life of them see how it can be that a development is unlawful&mdash;there are requirements for people to move&mdash;yet the utilities insist that they have a duty to provide in a way that they sometimes cannot do for people who have lived in their houses for a long time but cannot get a connection at a reasonable price. That causes a great deal of resentment, as does the incredulity often expressed at some of the issues that are pertinent at the point of a planning inquiry.</p>
	<p>What do we want the Minister and the Government to do? I do not have a perfect recipe any more than anybody else does. I understand the balance of interest that has to be achieved between making proper provision for the Traveller community and ensuring that the interests of the settled community are taken properly into account. I seek equity. I also understand that if we concentrate solely on cracking down on unauthorised development, we might produce a different problem&mdash;illegal encampment&mdash;as a result. That is something that the British Property Federation highlighted in its evidence to the Government.</p>
	<p>Local authorities need to have the essential tools. For instance, the temporary stop notices that came into being under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 need to be brought into force at the earliest opportunity. I hope that the Minister can say clearly when that will be; they are a critical tool for local authorities. We also need to consider adequate measures to ensure the restitution of sites. At the moment, we do not have appropriate remedy for the consequences of, for instance, concrete block houses that are built in a rural location&mdash;perhaps in an area of outstanding natural beauty or a site of special scientific interest&mdash;and remain when the people have gone, a lasting monument to an illegal development.</p>
	<p>Local authorities should have the capacity to impose wider injunction, or to threaten injunction, without incurring immense costs. That could be the appropriate measure to prevent some of the difficulties that are presently experienced. Clearly, guidance to planning authorities would be extremely helpful.</p>
	<p>We need to look at the pattern of instant overnight sites that has developed&mdash;the sort of thing that has been the problem in the constituency of the hon. Member for Taunton. They are not opportunistic; they are well planned and designed to create a permanence in a short space of time, often when&mdash;as was the case in Taunton Deane, I believe&mdash;the council offices are closed and nobody can make contact. I am not sure whether that   story is apocryphal or whether that was what happened in that case. That sort of thing is, effectively, a conspiracy to subvert the planning process. When it is done on that scale and in that way, I do not think that one can come to any other reasonable conclusion than that it is a deliberate attempt to overturn the normal process of planning law.</p>
	<p>Those are the areas of enforcement, but they must be balanced by reconsidering the duty to provide, so that we have sufficient sites. I suspect that the Government do not want to go back to the provisions of the Caravans Act 1968, for one reason&mdash;among others&mdash;that it was so often ignored by many of the local authorities that could not care less about whether they made provision or not, putting more and more pressure on those that took their responsibilities seriously. I remember that that was something that we felt strongly about at the time.</p>
	<p>However, it is simply not good enough to allow for the criteria for the development of the sites to be in the hands of district councils that are not prepared to provide sites. As part of the strategic approach to planning, we need to identify areas that are appropriate in terms of the effect on the settled community and local services such as schools. A lot of authorities are not very good at making adequate education provision for Travellers' children. Somerset happens to be rather good at it and takes it seriously, although others do not. We need those clear criteria at a national level; I do not often argue from that direction, but this is probably one area where the effect of not in my back yard is so strongly felt at local level that national guidance is needed.</p>
	<p>We need to identify whom we are catering for. I am not sure whether the old phrase &quot;residing in or resorting to&quot; still applies in terms of planning for provision of sites, but if it does, I am not sure that it is necessarily right. We need adequately to assess, perhaps in regional rather local terms, how many sites are necessary, and where they are to be provided.</p>
	<p>That brings me to the housing needs survey, which the Government have identified as one mechanism for dealing with problem. The more that we deal with it as a housing issue, rather than something completely outwith housing, the better. Empowering the Housing Corporation to act in this area, as well as registered social landlords to make provision, has the additional benefit of taking funding away from the local council tax payer, who often resents paying for that provision, and towards a more corporate view of the need to provide, and perhaps also to improve existing sites.</p>
	<p>If we get that balance right and have the proper planning and site provision regimes, any possible excuse for those who seek to ignore due process will be removed. The need to consider extensively article 8 of the human rights provisions is removed; if someone has undertaken a development in an area that they know by definition they cannot develop, that would remove the need for prolonged inquiries and retrospective planning applications. If Travellers know that the site is not in an area that is available for such development, that will enable an eviction process to take place at an earlier stage. Most importantly, it will restore the confidence both of the Traveller community and the settled community that the law&mdash;as well as the Government&mdash;is acting equitably, in the interests of both. There is a strong feeling, from both sides and for different reasons, that it is not.</p>

	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) on securing the debate, on what is undoubtedly an important issue in terms of how planning applies to Gypsy and Traveller communities. I suspect that not a single Member of the House has not had to deal with such issues. I also thank the hon. Gentleman for the way in which he approached the issue, because there is a need for a balance of interests and for both sides of the fence to be considered if we are to find a way through the problem and bring to an end the continual issues that our local communities face.</p>
	<p>All of us present would say that Gypsies and Travellers should enjoy the same right as everyone else in the communities that we represent to establish a decent place to live, as long as they do so within the law. Having said that, I acknowledge the problems that are often caused by unauthorised development and the deep concerns that that raises in the settled community. I particularly noted the hon. Gentleman's reference to wanting to prevent the heightening of tension.</p>
	<p>I am well aware of the issues that are currently being faced in North Curry. I understand that this Thursday night the local authority will be considering the retrospective planning application. I say to the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Flook) that I understand the frustration and concern about wanting things to be sorted out as soon as possible. However, it is important that we find solutions that help all in our communities, whether members of the Gypsy and Traveller communities or the settled communities that exist in our towns and country. It is also important that there should be equality of treatment for all the communities that we are considering, and it is correct for the issue of Gypsies and Travellers to be brought into the mainstream of local and national policy. We need to consider how we can address the underlying problem, which is the number of sites, and then how to deal with illegal operations that fall outside the planning laws. We need to find a way of providing more sites, whether publicly or privately owned. We also need to consider how we deal with the barriers that prevent us from providing those sites.</p>
	<p>As was said by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister earlier today, a thorough review of the Gypsy sites planning circular is being undertaken, and a new draft circular will soon be published for consultation. I am sure that hon. Members are well aware that that consultation process is necessary, if we are to have something sound that takes us forward.</p>
	<p>Hon. Members will also be aware of the difference between unauthorised development and unauthorised encampments. Unauthorised development applies to anyone within the community, and that is where we have the biggest issues. Whether it is Gypsies or Travellers or members of the settled community who purchase a piece of land and carry out development for which planning permission is required without receiving that permission, there is a breach of that planning control. That amounts to unauthorised development.</p>
	<p>As I am sure hon. Members are aware, the current planning policy is covered under the Department of the Environment circular 1/94. The circular encourages local authorities and the Gypsy and Traveller communities to discuss the requirements for sites and jointly to look at   sites. However, we are aware that in many areas the   circular is not working effectively, so sufficient appropriate sites are not being identified, and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome referred to some of the reasons why that is the case.</p>
	<p>We believe that there needs to be quantitative assessment of need, taking an approach from a housing perspective. Gypsies and Travellers have housing requirements, as do members of the settled community; broadly, that is how we should approach the matter. We should then tie that assessment in with proper spatial planning and the identification of specific sites and achievable criteria that will offer some certainty that planning permission will be granted.</p>
	<p>As the hon. Gentleman said, the problem, and the frustration that arises as a result, is that people are now taking well-planned steps. To use the hon. Gentleman's phraseology, it is an effective conspiracy against the planning laws. That is one reason for the review, and why we have already taken certain steps to meet the requirements. The hon. Gentleman referred specifically to the temporary stop notices; the introduction of the temporary stop notice powers in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 arose from the planning enforcement review.</p>
	<p>Draft regulations have been published and the temporary stop notice will provide local authorities with the ability immediately to freeze development on any unauthorised caravan site while they consider what further action to take. That gives them 28 days and there is no right of appeal for further consideration of steps to be taken. The matter has been put out to consultation, subject to which we would expect the provision to come into force by the spring of next year. I hope that that is helpful and worthwhile.</p>
	<p>On the subject of moneys for sites, there are existing   sites that we want to keep going and we want them to be of an acceptable standard. The Gypsy site refurbishment grant helps in that respect. In the 2005&ndash;06 grant round local authorities will be able to bid for about &pound;8 million to provide new permanent residential sites. In addition, we have to ask what is the requirement. The hon. Gentleman rightly referred to the requirements under the Housing Act 2004, which takes in the housing needs assessment; it includes Gypsies and Travellers, and the current provision of sites. The revised Gypsy caravan count that is being put into place will give us a more accurate picture of the issue.</p>
	<p>Time is short, and I want to cover the issue of making provision for others to provide sites. Provision can be    made by extending the permissible purposes of registered social landlords, for example. I hope that that will help us to provide a greater number of sites, reduce unauthorised development and thus prevent the heightening of tension.</p>
	<p>I mentioned the planning enforcement review that is in progress and the temporary stop notices that have arisen from it. The hon. Gentleman referred to clear   guidance; in February this year we issued revised   guidance to local authorities on dealing with    unauthorised encampments, which was widely welcomed by the authorities. The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 introduced new police powers to enable police to remove people more quickly from unauthorised encampments.</p>
	<p>I have already mentioned the Housing Act 2004 in terms of the housing needs assessment. The most successful, lasting and sustainable way forward will be to take a genuinely different approach to dealing with parts of the community that want a nomadic lifestyle. Proper sites in a proper setting would ease the tension between travelling people and the settled community. That is our intention; we are well on the way to being able to consult on several other matters and I look forward to our resolving many of the problems that hon. Members face in their constituencies.</p>

	<p>I thank Mr. Speaker for allowing me this debate, the purpose of which is to seek clarification from my hon. Friend the Minister on the current status of the project to build new coastal defences at Newbiggin-by-the-Sea.</p>
	<p>The history of the erosion of Newbiggin bay is well documented. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Newbiggin was an important trading centre for shipments of corn, and the bay appears to have been very stable. The first reports of erosion in the bay were made at the turn of the last century.</p>
	<p>In the 1920s, major erosion was noticed at Church Point. That erosion was due to a combination of mining subsidence and increased wave movement. From the 1920s to the 1950s, the northern part of the bay suffered mining subsidence of more than 2 m, and the southern part of the bay subsided by more than 1 m. Major storms in the 1950s caused significant erosion of up to 15 m in some places, rapidly lowering sand levels between Bridge street and Church Point.</p>
	<p>In the 1960s, the lower clay levels below the sand were exposed in the centre of the bay during very bad storms. During major storms in 1972 and 1973, the promenade foundations were exposed. Again, in 1978, major damage was caused to Newbiggin promenade. Serious flooding occurred at Bridge street in the 1980s, culminating in severe damage in 1988.</p>
	<p>Between 1989 and 1992, a major sea wall defence system was completed. It became apparent soon after the sea defences were built that even they were not adequate, and a major study was commissioned by Wansbeck district council. W.S. Atkins, the engineering company chosen to conduct the study, produced its first report in 1996. It identified that the northern part of the bay had subsided by more than 2.4 m, and that the southern part of the bay had subsided by 1.2 m. It also carried out a review of the existing defences at Bridge street and the south-west promenade. It concluded that the sea wall was operating within its designed values, but that beach levels were giving serious cause for concern.</p>
	<p>Continued erosion would result in the exposure of up to 2 m of the sea defence foundations, increasing the wave energy and thus accelerating further erosion. W.S. Atkins concluded that the risk of collapse would be very high if no further works were done. At that time&mdash;this was 1996&mdash;it estimated that, on the basis of predicted erosion rates, the Bridge street works would have a residual life of no more than 10 years.</p>
	<p>W.S. Atkins also examined the rock armour at the south-west promenade and concluded that it was successful in reflecting wave energy but that the rocks used in the armour were too small to provide long term protection. There is evidence that the rock is being displaced by frequent storms. The combined effects of undersized armour stone and continuing erosion will, without major remedial works, lead to early failure. W.S. Atkins estimated the life of the armour stone to be only five years. In its conclusions and recommendations, it stated that mining subsidence had caused a lowering of the seabed of between 1 m and 2.5 m, which had altered the wave propagation into the bay. The bay is not stable, erosion continues, and the bay is changing shape.</p>
	<p>Most of the beach sand has been lost as a direct result of mining subsidence. There has been a permanent loss of beach height due to the erosion of the clay that underlies the sand. Erosion will cause a further reduction in the beach level by an estimated 2 m in the next 10 years.</p>
	<p>The Bridge street sea defences have an estimated residual life of less than 10 years, and the south-west promenade has an estimated residual life of approximately five years. As I said, that was in 1996. W.S. Atkins recommended that the technical feasibility and economic viability of the options be examined in detail, including an evaluation of the ground stability for predicted reduced beach levels; that beach levels should be monitored regularly to identify trends and to assess the stability of sea walls; and that the scheme's proposals be considered in the future development plans of Newbiggin and the forthcoming shoreline management plan.</p>
	<p>On receiving the report, Wansbeck district council sought counsel's legal opinion as to whether it could seek compensation for subsidence from the Coal Authority. As I recall, the advice received was that because the subsidence was below the high water mark, and therefore technically offshore, it did not fall under the responsibilities of the Coal Authority, and that it would be difficult to obtain evidence confirming the extent and timing of the under-sea subsidence. The local authority was advised that it would be expensive to pursue High Court action, and that the outcome was doubtful. Wansbeck did, however, at great financial risk, pursue the original engineers who were responsible for the sea defence scheme, and received a substantial out-of-court settlement, which was returned in full to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
	<p>Since the 1996 study, the local authority has been required to obtain a further six expensive and time-consuming studies in order to get to the position in which we find ourselves today. The second study was a feasibility study into coast protection options, which was completed in 1998, the conclusions of which were similar to those in the 1996 study. Its recommendations covered several options, including beach recharge and offshore breakwaters. The engineers thought that those options would restore the amenity value to the beach, and that beach nourishment would provide a useable sandy beach with crest levels similar to those with the existing sea wall, thus allowing direct access on to the beach from the promenade. It was also felt that restoration of the sand beach would greatly enhance the potential for recreation and tourism and would undoubtedly be a significant aesthetic improvement, and that a lower-crested breakwater would be less visually obtrusive. Of several options put forward, those formed the basis of what was expected to be an excellent coastal protection scheme at Newbiggin-by-the-Sea.</p>
	<p>DEFRA then requested a pilot valuation study, which was completed in 2000, after which it asked for a fuller valuation study, which was completed in 2001. An options appraisal report and a report on the Newbiggin bay coast defence strategy were completed in 2003, and an appraisal of the Newbiggin beach recharge scheme was completed in 2004. Before the debate, I met Mr. Trevor Straker, who is Wansbeck district council's senior engineer, to whom I am indebted for his help and advice on the scheme. I suggested to him that if the scheme does not get final approval from DEFRA, we could cement together some of the reports that have been compiled&mdash;they would certainly make a high sea wall.</p>
	<p>The scheme has been developed with extensive community consultation and engagement. Detailed planning consent has been obtained, and it was formally submitted for DEFRA grant approval in October, with a view to proceeding to construction in 2006&ndash;07. The estimated cost of the scheme is &pound;10.5 million, and it has a priority score of 13.8.</p>
	<p>Eight years of hard work was, at last, about to deliver a first-class scheme, which would provide a new, restored beach, and substantial coastal protection, but, on 18 November, a letter from the head of DEFRA flood management arrived, which stated that the priority scoring had changed, and that only schemes with a score of 19 would now be given the go ahead for 2006&ndash;07, whereas those with a score of 15 could start in 2007&ndash;08. I understand that engineers are reworking the numbers for the Newbiggin bay scheme with a view to reaching a new score of 15, but there is a significant risk that the project will be left stranded and unable to obtain formal DEFRA approval. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to reassure me and the 7,000 people who live in Newbiggin-by-the-Sea that that will not be the case.</p>
	<p>Newbiggin Life is a public-private partnership set up to deliver a wide range of initiatives, and it is bringing together the whole community to regenerate the village. Newbiggin was subjected to the same economic and social changes faced by all coalfield areas. The dramatic run-down in the mining industry in the 1980s and 1990s affected employment levels, housing, shops and the very fabric of the village. It became difficult to let some local authority houses, and parts of the village began to take on a look of dereliction and decay. That is no longer the case and Newbiggin faces a bright future.</p>
	<p>Recently, I had the privilege to open the new Gateway project in Newbiggin, in which for the first time in nearly 50 years private sector housing developers are queuing up to build new homes. The local authority is working with traders, and they have ambitious plans to restore the shopping areas to their former Edwardian glory. New play areas, car parks and village parks are planned. Walkways, cycleways and even a sustainable forest at   the end of the village are now at or beyond the planning stage.</p>
	<p>A sea defence system that provides access to the beach would complement the environmental schemes already under way. The beach at Church Point unfortunately has a problem with fine coal deposits, making the area unsightly. I recently brought together a number of interested parties with a view to finding a long-term solution to that problem. Although it was not possible for the engineers to model the movement of coal, it is felt that a beach recharge scheme could help significantly in reducing those unsightly fine coal deposits.</p>
	<p>The beach and promenade at Newbiggin are used mainly by the residents, but plans to expand an adjacent    caravan park and provide bungalow-style accommodation will bring many more day visitors into the village. The Sandy Bay and Church Point caravan parks allow thousands of visitors to enjoy the excellent facilities available each year. Completion of a new sea defence system that will also allow the restoration of the beach will encourage further much-needed investment.</p>
	<p>Newbiggin-by-the-Sea sailing club provides an excellent facility for the whole community. Both able-bodied and disabled people are taught the enjoyment of sailing in a safe environment, and it is constructing an extension to its clubhouse, which is situated on the seafront. That is being financed mainly from the coalfield regeneration trust. That facility and many others will be at risk if the sea defences do not go ahead.</p>
	<p>I have the utmost respect for the traders in Newbiggin. They have demonstrated their commitment to the village and the people by continuing to trade during sometimes difficult periods. Every business will be put at risk if sea defences are not constructed.</p>
	<p>The entire community supports this project, which will protect Newbiggin from the severe storms that batter the north-east coast and restore the beach to its former glory, providing residents and visitors with a first-class facility. I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify the status of the project and reassure the residents of Newbiggin that their village will be protected and enhanced. I ask of him only two things: first, that the scheme be given the go-ahead; and secondly, that it will commence on the previously agreed date of 2006.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Mr. Murphy) on securing this debate and apologise for the fact that my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment is unable to respond personally&mdash;he is abroad on Government business. I shall set my hon. Friend's points in a wider context before dealing with his specific concerns and those of his constituents in Newbiggin.</p>
	<p>Improvement projects funded by DEFRA must meet specified economic, technical and environmental criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score to be eligible for funding. DEFRA neither builds defences nor directs the operating authorities on what specific projects to undertake. The works programme to manage risk is driven by the operating authorities.</p>
	<p>The Government are strongly committed to reducing flood and coastal erosion risk. We have increased investment significantly, and total Government expenditure will be &pound;478 million this year, rising to &pound;570 million next year and the following two years&mdash;an increase of more than &pound;250 million per year against the 1997&ndash;98 level.</p>
	<p>The criteria that we use in deciding which projects will be funded are published and transparent. The scoring system is objective and based on the benefits to be gained from defences as compared with their cost. The aim is to ensure that the improvement programme will deliver maximum benefit for the nation as a whole for a given total cost. We give the greatest priority to projects that protect people and important environmental assets.</p>
	<p>To be eligible for DEFRA grant, all proposed projects must achieve our priority score threshold for the year in which they are due to start. The threshold is set each autumn for the following financial year and is based on operating authorities' forward plans, as notified to us in an annual exercise. At the same time as the firm threshold score for next year is confirmed, we announce indicative scores for the following two years. The aim is to indicate to authorities the minimum score that the projects are likely to have to meet in order to be funded.</p>
	<p>In order to increase the certainty of the delivery of the improvement programme, we encourage authorities to apply for grant as early as possible and have made it clear that we are willing to consider projects for start in later years against the indicative thresholds applying in those later years. There is a strong incentive for authorities to do that, as once a project has been approved, future changes to the threshold will not affect an approval already given.</p>
	<p>Our intention is to set the priority score thresholds for grant as low as possible and also for the indicative threshold for a given year, once announced, not to increase in subsequent years. However, we have to base the indicative thresholds on operating authority forecasts of spend against fixed funding levels. That means that thresholds often change from one year to the next, to reflect changes in the forecasts when authorities refine their plans, increase their forecast spend or identify further works of which they have not previously notified us. It is unfortunate that, for just those reasons, the thresholds for future years in this autumn's review have had to increase significantly. That has caused the problem at Newbiggin bay.</p>
	<p>In April 2004 we announced that the indicative priority score for 2005&ndash;06 would have to rise from 10 to 15, but that the threshold for 2006&ndash;07 would be 10, meaning that the project at Newbiggin would remain eligible for approval to start in 2006&ndash;07. Wansbeck district council therefore had the opportunity to submit its application for grant for the scheme, which has been in gestation for many years, as my hon. Friend said. Such approval would have secured funding, as changes to the thresholds do not affect projects that have already been secured. As the council will have been aware, there is always a distinct possibility that the threshold priority score will increase in the autumn, which means that schemes that were previously eligible for consideration may no longer be so.</p>
	<p>We have made it clear to authorities that applications will always be considered for grant against the thresholds that apply at the time of consideration. It is clear that that must be so. Considerations of fairness as well as optimum use of our grant allocation mean that we could not exceptionally allow certain projects to gain approval under thresholds that we know we can no longer afford for all. That would be an unacceptable departure from the principles of objectivity and openness, as well as not being the best use of taxpayers' money.</p>
	<p>Although we might make an exception in cases where a scheme has already been submitted to us and we are well advanced in our consideration of it when thresholds change, that did not apply in the case of the Newbiggin bay proposal. The application for the scheme was not received until towards the end of October, only three weeks before we announced the revised threshold scores, and too late for us to approve before the announcement. Indeed, Wansbeck district council was advised in August that any application would have to be considered against whatever thresholds were set in the autumn.</p>
	<p>Of course it is unfortunate that increased thresholds meant that, under the currently assessed score of 13 points, the Newbiggin bay project was no longer eligible for approval, whereas it probably would have been had the council been able to submit its application some months previously. I know that that was unwelcome to the council and to hon. Friend.</p>
