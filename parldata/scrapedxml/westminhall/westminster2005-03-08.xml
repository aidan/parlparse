<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-08.367.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1172" speakername="Mark Prisk" colnum="367"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050308/halltext/50308h01.htm#50308h01_spnew0">
	<p pid=".367.3/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate on the impact of the Government's policies along the M11 growth area and on my constituency in particular. For those who do not have the pleasure of knowing where my constituency is, Hertford and Stortford is in East Hertfordshire, which is the only rural district left in the county. As I shall explain, the Government's planning and development policies represent the greatest challenge in a generation to my constituents' environment and quality of life.</p>
	<p pid=".367.3/2">Indeed, the east of England plan, which puts those policies into practice, is currently out to consultation. For my constituency, it would mean 20,800 new houses or a 36 per cent. rise in population. We would have 47,000 extra people, using up to 28,000 more cars. The plan would mean 2,500 more peak-time commuters on a railway service that is already overstretched, as most hon. Members who use the line will know. It would also create the need for 3,700 extra school places, which would mean 300 more pupils for every secondary school in my constituency. Just as importantly, perhaps, the plan would mean the destruction of thousands of acres of green fields and the wildlife that lives in them. For those and other reasons, the plan is opposed by the overwhelming majority of my constituents. We believe that it is unnecessary and unsustainable, and that the process driving it is, frankly, undemocratic.</p>
	<p pid=".367.3/3">No one is suggesting that there should be no development; of course, there is a need to provide more housing for those on lower incomes. Yet the scale of the developments proposed is far in excess of the need in our area. Indeed, my constituents are not the only people withholding their support from the plan. Somewhat bizarrely, the sponsoring body itself, the East of England regional assembly, has withdrawn its support for the plan. Thus, we have the nonsense of a plan being promoted by a body that does not support it to a community that does not want it.</p>
	<p pid=".367.3/4">Underlying the regional plan are the Government's policies on the green belt and on what they like to call sustainable communities, and I want to examine those policies further. About two years ago, in, I think, February 2003, the Deputy Prime Minister proudly announced the launch of his sustainable communities plan. It was an ambitious statement, but it had some rather fundamental flaws. First&mdash;this may seem somewhat strange to hon. Members&mdash;there was no definition of what a sustainable community actually is. Secondly, the policy failed to incorporate the understood and accepted principles of sustainable development. Indeed, as the Environmental Audit Committee put it in its recent report,</p>
	<p pid=".367.3/5" class="indent">&quot;environmental considerations remain a bolt-on rather than a primary concern.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".367.3/6">Two years on, in January 2005, after much labouring on the issue and, no doubt, thousands of consultants' studies and investigations, the Deputy Prime Minister finally came up with a definition:</p>
	<p pid=".367.3/7" class="indent">&quot;Sustainable communities are places where people want to live and work, now and in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".367.3/8">Wow! What a lot of money was well spent. I can see that we got good value for money and incisive thinking, but what does it mean in practice? What are the key determinants that make up a community that is deemed to be sustainable? How do we balance growth against protecting our environment? What does all this mean for my constituents and the constituents of my right hon. and hon. Friends in the plan's growth areas? For a sustainable communities plan to be worthy of its name, surely it should be founded on the environmental principles of sustainable development. Yet these policies lack that foundation. As the Government's own Environment Agency put it, the housing plans for the south-east and my area are &quot;an environmental time bomb&quot;. Those are its words, not mine.</p>
	<p pid=".367.3/9">I shall talk briefly about green-belt planning. Ever since it was introduced by Duncan Sandys back in the 1950s, green-belt policy has been accepted across the House as a great success. It has contained communities and helped them to renew, and it has allowed us to prevent urban sprawl. In 2003, however, the Government changed the rules as part of their new plan. That went largely unnoticed by the experts, let alone the public. The Deputy Prime Minister announced that the Government would</p>
	<p pid=".367.3/10" class="indent">&quot;maintain or increase green-belt land&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".367.3/11">&mdash;and this is key&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".367.3/12" class="indent">&quot;in every region in England.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-02-05.275"><i>Official Report</i>, 5 February 2003; Vol. 399, c. 275</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".367.3/13">In other words, the policy has changed from protecting specific sites and is now based on the total acreage, but as hon. Members will know, the essence of a green belt is that it is the permanent prohibition of development in a specific location. For example, the metropolitan green belt in my constituency should be permanent to prevent London and towns and other areas in my constituency from becoming one large urban mass. Yet the Government's policy is that they could release such land if they were to re-badge land somewhere else in the region as green belt. I assume&mdash;perhaps the Minister will clarify this point&mdash;that if the Government were to de-designate a couple of hundred acres in East Hertfordshire from the metropolitan green belt, they could redesignate land around Peterborough and claim that they had fulfilled the policy. However, people would regard that as nonsense.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-08.374.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/948" speakername="Oliver Heald" colnum="374"  time="009:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050308/halltext/50308h01.htm#50308h01_spnew16">
	<p pid=".374.0/1">This disastrous development is a catastrophe for the Hertfordshire countryside. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1172" name="Mark Prisk">the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk)</phrase> on securing such an important debate. All our local newspapers are running campaigns against the proposals. I suppose that the most common way in which to describe matters is that local residents are saying no to Prescottshire.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/2">My constituency is the second largest in the home counties. The neighbouring constituency is that of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/943" name="Alan Haselhurst">the Member for Saffron Walden (Sir Alan Haselhurst)</phrase>. He is also extremely worried about the proposals and has attended meetings with my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford, the East of England regional assembly and others. We want to conserve the precious countryside in our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/3">Hertfordshire is already the most populated county. The villages and the small market towns that are threatened by the proposals are genuinely rural. They are the lungs of the county. Once we start fiddling about with the green belt to enable large developments to take place, we damage a precious and much-loved resource for local people throughout Hertfordshire. Let us consider the area of Cole Green and its five greens in the south of my constituency. Those areas have already had to put up with a great deal of gravel extraction over the years. To add on top of that the threat of extra housing development seems extremely unfair.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/4">In Thundridge, we have recently secured the bypass, which makes that area much quieter for residents. The village is no longer divided by the busy A10. However, does it really have to tolerate extensive extra housing development? Standon and Puckeridge are other historic centres on the junction of the A10 and the A120. Are they expected to take hundreds of extra houses?</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/5">The Pelhams are also affected. The House should have great respect for Furneux Pulham because when Lord Monteagle lived there, he gave the alarm about the gunpowder plot. We could all have been blown up&mdash;well, not us but our predecessors&mdash;if it had not been for Lord Monteagle of Furneux Pelham.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/6">Little Hadham is another small, but beautiful village. Then come Buntingford and Royston, both ancient market towns. Royston has a history of the Templars and the Royston cave is the only historic monument of its type in Hertfordshire. Down the A505 towards Letchworth, one goes through the historic market town of Baldock and on to Letchworth Garden City, the world's first garden city. Planners come to Letchworth from across the world to see how a garden city can be developed and matured properly. Along the way are the villages of Therfield, Sandon, Ashwell and Weston, which are all beautiful places with lovely countryside around them.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/7">The Environmental Audit Committee considered the Government's so-called sustainable communities plan and found that it had not been thought through at all. No evidence had been taken of the environmental impact. The Committee wrote an incredibly critical, savage report attacking the Government's ignorant approach. I want to ask the Minister whether any serious thought has been given to the plans as they relate to one to another. The growth area that we are talking about&mdash;the M11 corridor&mdash;is next to, or quite close to, the growth area for Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/8">It is worth recording that the north of the M11 corridor has some large cities and towns, such as Peterborough and Cambridge, which are surrounded by sparsely populated areas. However, the south of the corridor, in Hertfordshire, is quite the opposite. It is made up of small market towns and villages, quite close to one another, and they are not large places. They have populations of 20,000 or 30,000.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/9">The Government seem to think that we have got it wrong in Hertfordshire and that we ought to have large towns with sparsely populated areas around them that could be developed. That is exactly what they propose for Harlow and Stevenage&mdash;that Stevenage should have 14,400 extra houses tacked on the side. Interestingly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford said, they will not be under the flight path for Stansted this time, but the flight path for Luton. Why should we change Hertfordshire from what it has always been&mdash;a tracery of lanes with small market towns and villages&mdash;into something like Cambridgeshire?</p>

	<p pid=".375.0/1">As always, my hon. Friend highlights both the beauty of his constituency and why that should be preserved. There is another difference between us and Cambridgeshire; we are abutting London. The metropolitan green belt is the essence of why the pattern of communities that we have now is right. Does my hon. Friend share my view that if we were to follow the diktat of the reports presented by the Government, the danger is that we will not get a Cambridge with a sparse population around the edge, but one large urban mass from the Thames all the way up to Stansted airport?</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-08.375.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-08a.375.1" matchtype="changes"/>

	<p pid=".375.1/1">That is exactly the point, and my hon. Friend puts it very well. If we develop the most densely populated county as though it were not, we will end up with something unbearable. As with the Harlow scheme, the scheme for Stevenage is to build the houses in the North Herts district rather than the Stevenage district. We will therefore end up with half of Stevenage in North Hertfordshire.</p>
	<p pid=".375.1/2">At the same time as the plan to develop Stevenage is the plan in the Milton Keynes growth area to develop Luton, which is the second largest conurbation in the eastern region. It needs development&mdash;no one could argue with that&mdash;but what will happen if we develop both Stevenage and Luton, given that they are only about five or six miles apart? We will end up either with the two merging or with competition that is damaging to one or the other.</p>
	<p pid=".375.1/3">Did anybody think about what will happen on the border between the growth areas? It is silly to try to develop Stevenage and Luton in that way, side by side. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford said, there is a danger that we will end up with a conurbation that I would call &quot;Hevenage&quot;&mdash;Hitchin and Stevenage&mdash;but it could also be &quot;Bevenage&quot; if Baldock is included, or &quot;Levenage&quot; if Luton is included. There could be a massive conurbation in North Hertfordshire, which would impinge on the areas that are the lungs of the county. The villages that I have mentioned, which are also supposed to take extra housing, would be threatened. We would end up with a massive conurbation and every village and small community would have large numbers of houses tacked on to it. The area, which people value, would be spoiled not only for the people who live in the villages, but for those who go to the rural areas to walk and enjoy the countryside.</p>

	<p pid=".376.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that there is illogicality at the heart of the Government's proposal? People want to go to districts such as East Hertfordshire and North Hertfordshire because of the quality of the environment, so is it not ironic that the plan that seeks to respond to that demand will destroy the very reason why people go there?</p>

	<p pid=".378.2/1">I was tempted by the new name of the county, which I had not heard before, so you were right to pull me up on that, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid=".378.2/2">There is no doubt that, although some demolition in the city of Liverpool was accepted by the community, the Deputy Prime Minister has pushed ahead with a much higher number of demolitions, which goes against the wishes of the community. It seems absurd, as the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire has said, that we should force homes on areas that clearly do not want such a high number, and demolish them in areas that have the potential to attract more people; they are quality homes, and it sometimes costs &pound;60,000 to demolish a home in pathfinder scheme areas. The Government have the overall balance of the sustainable communities plan wrong, particularly with respect to the M11 corridor and cities such as Liverpool.</p>
	<p pid=".378.2/3">To focus on the M11 corridor, some of the greatest concerns that have been expressed to me by council leaders such as Lorna Spenceley of Harlow or Alan Dean of Uttlesford are about lack of local democratic involvement. Hon. Members have this morning talked about the need for elected representatives and local communities to have a real say, so that the decisions are local ones, not imposed ones.</p>
	<p pid=".378.2/4">It is bizarre that we spent 18 months passing the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, which the Government told us would set up new local development frameworks, with community involvement statements and so on, but that at the same time a plan is being pushed forward to override all that. It is nonsense. A different approach would be to persuade and incentivise people and to involve them in planning.</p>
	<p pid=".378.2/5">For example, it is clear that there are small villages and market towns in parts of the M11 corridor that are prepared to accept some housing. There is no doubt about that. The people there see a need for local housing and regeneration and a need to make vulnerable rural settlements sustainable. However, that is a matter of an affordable housing programme&mdash;one that is diffused, not focused in one or two areas.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-08.380.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/840" speakername="Edward Davey" colnum="380"  time="010:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050308/halltext/50308h01.htm#50308h01_spnew31">
	<p pid=".380.0/1">The hon. Gentleman was kind enough to describe me as an expert earlier, but he was in danger of going beyond my detailed knowledge of parts of the proposal. I am afraid that I cannot address the quandary that he raises. I do not know whether he was asking a rhetorical question, but I take the point about the kinds of homes that are needed in such areas.</p>
	<p pid=".380.0/2">One of the problems with the sustainable communities plan is that we have adopted a top-down, predict-and-provide approach towards the homes that are needed. There has not been a bottom-up linking with the question of who will live there, what types of homes people actually want and what is the housing need there now.</p>
	<p pid=".380.0/3">The evidence that I have seen suggests that there are problems in rural communities and market town communities with people who are hidden homeless&mdash; adults still living at home and older people wishing to downsize yet facing a lack available properties. A sustainable approach that worked with the community would be based on a different way of thinking about the types of houses that are needed and where they should be sited. That is why local government should be involved. If the decisions are taken based on a report by Professor Barker or some analysis by the ODPM, we are likely to get things wrong, because we will not be focusing on local needs and the local situation.</p>
	<p pid=".380.0/4">I have talked to local councillors in the region and it is interesting that some say that there are small villages crying out for a little bit of affordable housing&mdash;on exception sites, for example. There is huge local support in some places for perhaps half a dozen or a dozen homes, to support the local services&mdash;the post office, pub or school. Some services in such areas are not overstretched and need more people to support them.</p>
	<p pid=".380.0/5">If the Government had taken that approach&mdash;building up from little pockets&mdash;they could probably have provided a solution that did not extend to the 500,000 homes proposed in some of the plans that hon. Members have mentioned. The Government could have dealt with the need in those areas and provided real sustainable community planning.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-08.382.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/946" speakername="John Hayes" colnum="382"  time="010:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050308/halltext/50308h01.htm#50308h01_spnew40">
	<p pid=".382.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1172" name="Mark Prisk">the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk)</phrase> on bringing this important issue to the attention of the House. This is a debate about the environment and protecting the green belt; about local democracy and what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/767" name="Simon Burns">the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)</phrase> described as the need for a bottom-up, rather than a top-down approach to deciding such important matters; and about developing genuinely sustainable communities and the missed opportunity for urban and suburban regeneration.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/2">My hon. Friends have made a convincing case. Could there be any better representatives of their respective constituencies than the three who spoke from the Conservative Benches? I doubt it very much. They have described the Government's plans as a savage attack on the character not only of the countryside, but of existing settlements. The figures that they quoted were stark. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford spoke of a 36 per cent. growth in population in his constituency, with 3,700 extra school places needed. My hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford spoke of 14,000 new homes in his constituency and described the plans as unsustainable, unwanted and unfair.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/948" name="Oliver Heald">the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> painted a dreadful picture, and the Minister will have been as shocked by it as you will have been, Mr. Deputy Speaker. He spoke of a sprawling, ugly, soulless conglomeration of hastily built properties, which will damage for ever the character of the beautiful part of our country that he represents. He told us that his constituency would require 300 more doctors over the next three years. I was appalled at the prospect of people in that part of Britain being in desperate circumstances but not being able to access the medial care that they needed.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/4">Conservative Front Benchers share the views expressed by my hon. Friends. We also share those expressed by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/943" name="Alan Haselhurst">the Member for Saffron Walden (Sir Alan Haselhurst)</phrase>, who has been mentioned in the debate, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1216" name="Andrew Selous">the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase>, who, in the interests of his constituents, is fighting a vigorous campaign against the Government's proposals to concrete over much of his constituency. Indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister wants to bulldoze the north of England and concrete over the south.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/5">Resistance is not limited to the Opposition Benches, however. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Committee has considered the matter, and its damning indictments of the Government are worthy of amplification here. The Committee said that</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/6" class="indent">&quot;the impact of such a housing programme on the environment could be unsustainable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/7">It also said:</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The impact of developing so many homes in the South East, one of the most densely populated regions in Europe, has not been fully assessed . . . The additional homes could place excessive demands on the environment, leading to the loss of green-field sites and excessive pressure on the water supply and other natural resources . . . The Government . . . has yet to estimate the costs of providing the transport links, health care, education and all the other facilities which new neighbourhoods require.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/9">The Environmental Audit Committee was equally critical of the Government, saying that</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/10" class="indent">&quot;the principal loser will be the environment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/11">It added:</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/12" class="indent">&quot;we deplore the absence of any reference to environmental protection&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/13">It said that the Government had yet to produce a definition of sustainable communities. Imagine a sustainable communities plan with no real definition of sustainability or what such communities comprise.</p>

	<p pid=".384.1/1">Indeed. I am hoping to visit Braintree and many of those other communities in the next couple of weeks to look at the work being done there.</p>
	<p pid=".384.1/2">There are alternatives, and they have been teased out of me by my hon. Friends. Of course, Conservatives believe that the provision of new housing could play an important part in building, regenerating and sustaining genuine communities, but for that to happen we must ensure that we have the right homes in the right places. An agreed settlement between central and local government on housing growth should balance the need for extra houses with a consideration of landscape and the character of existing settlements. That balance would lie at the heart of a genuinely sustainable housing and planning policy.</p>
	<p pid=".384.1/3">I shall pose a series of questions to the Minister. The Conservatives will scrap the communities plan and focus on incremental development of existing settlements. We will protect the green belt more than the Government have done&mdash;we could hardly protect it less; my hon. Friends have rightly identified abuse of the principle of the green belt&mdash;by putting in place more and tighter green belts. Why do the Government not reappraise the designation of brownfield sites? If 50 per cent. of all brownfield sites in the south-east that are intended for employment purposes were instead used for housing, it would yield 27,000 extra homes at current density levels.</p>
	<p pid=".384.1/4">As I said last week, Barratt Homes tells me that 80 per cent. of its new houses are already built on brownfield land. In the south and south-east, that figure is 90 per cent. The truth is that many more houses could be built on brownfield sites. We could help developers by: reforming the planning system sensibly; making more land available through re-designation; freeing-up public sector land; and lifting some of the burdens and regulations that hamper good practice and enterprise as only Labour Governments can.</p>
	<p pid=".384.1/5">Why do the Government not streamline the planning process for regenerative brownfield development by standardising the processes for gaining planning permission under section 106 agreements? Why will they not put in place fiscal incentives to bring empty homes back into use&mdash;there are 700,000 empty homes across the country, according to the Empty Homes Agency? Why will the Government not scrap the prescriptive bureaucratic standards that stifle innovation, hamper brownfield development and promote monotonous, uniform housing estates? We should emphasise quality of design, rather than compliance with Government diktats. Local authorities should be encouraged to acquire the skills to devise in communion with local communities and developers plans that satisfy the need for housing development without compromising the local environment and quality of life.</p>
	<p pid=".384.1/6">Why will the Government not establish more and tighter green belts, and redefine suburban back gardens so that they are protected from undesirable development&mdash;town cramming, as it has become known under this Government? Why will they not extend the rural exceptions policy to allow small-scale expansion of villages with a mix of new homes, market housing cross-subsidising the social homes that can play such a useful part in servicing local needs? We must focus development where infrastructure can support it, so why will the Government not ensure that local authorities make infrastructure capacity a key factor in the development control process?</p>
	<p pid=".384.1/7">Today's debate has highlighted a Government policy that is undeliverable, unsustainable, unneeded and unwanted. Britain needs the right homes in the right places. It needs development on a human scale&mdash;incremental, organic, inspiring and shaped by local people. Britain needs to support house builders to regenerate urban and suburban Britain, and it needs to value the land and safeguard our countryside. There is a shining light at the end of this dark Labour tunnel, and the people of Hertfordshire, Essex and other communities across Britain will be able to bask in that light when this Government are driven from office and an enlightened housing and planning policy is put in place.</p>

	<p pid=".390.3/1">The hon. Gentleman will know that I cannot comment on specific constituency issues and areas in this debate, because of the regional planning process that we are going through. I have made it very clear that our commitment to the green belt across the region remains important. We should be aware that the green belt has increased as a result of Government policies, in contrast to substantial green-belt reductions in many places under the previous Conservative Government. We should not forget that.</p>
	<p pid=".390.3/2">Hon. Members asked specific questions about funding for services. Funding allocation for public services such as health and education must respond to housing growth. We are already announcing substantial new funding packages for growth areas. For example, there is funding to enable the NHS to increase local service capacity and to ensure that the Department for Education and Skills responds to planned housing growth in forecasting pupil numbers. That is in addition to substantial extra investment in those services&mdash;investment that Opposition Members would cut across the board, not only for the growth areas, but throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid=".390.3/3">The Opposition need to recognise the need for additional housing and for economic prosperity. It is a shame that they still refuse to understand the importance of economic prosperity and of the links between the housing market and the regional economy. That shows that their approach would be not simply to cut houses, but to cut economic growth.</p>

	<p pid=".391.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate on British Cellophane in Bridgwater. Its name is, in fact, Innovia Films, but it is known to all and sundry as British Cellophane. I wish, unusually, to thank a few people before I start my speech, the first being the Labour candidate for the constituency of Bridgwater at the next general election, Mr. Matthew Burchell, which may seem slightly strange. He works for the Leader of the House of Commons, and without his help it would have been a lot harder to reach the point at which we are today.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/2">I wish to thank the Transport and General Workers Union for its help, especially Mel Dando. I wish also to thank John Blomfield, the managing director of Innovia Films, Bridgwater. He has supplied an enormous amount of information. When the news was announced, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry was incredibly helpful and made it clear that she would do all that she could to help.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/3">British Cellophane has a long and honourable history. It has an enormous background of industrial muscle and might in Bridgwater. It came there more than 50 years ago. I suspect that members of the community did not mind about the smell and were not worried about it environmentally, but just wanted manufacturing capacity. Bridgwater is the only industrial town in the west country. Over the long term, the work force at British Cellophane has been reduced, but it has always had an outstanding productivity level and an outstanding relationship with its employees and given outstanding help to the town at all levels. I believe that there has only been one industrial dispute and not once throughout its time in Bridgwater has Cellophane been anything other than a massive asset.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/4">Thirty or forty years ago, Cellophane produced about 500,000 tonnes of cellophane. Cellophane is on everything. In fact, you are probably drinking out of a cellophane container at the moment, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is a massively important commodity throughout the world. However, over the years, its production level has reduced from about 500,000 tonnes to 60,000 tonnes. The commodity has to be produced in highly productive, motivated and profitable plants.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/5">Believe it or not, 124 different types of cellophane are made in Bridgwater. There are an enormous amount of different ways to use the film. That shows the level that cellophane has reached. It is a film that can be used for almost anything and it is now in use every day, almost without parallel. However, problems have occurred. Over many years, there have been changes of company and ownership and, in the past few years, the company has changed dramatically. It was bought by Candell Investments. I want to talk about three of its five plants. Two plants are in Britain and one is in America. The two in Britain are productive, motivated plants&mdash;one is in the north and one is in Bridgwater.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/6">I wish to dwell on the plant in Kansas. Over the past few years, Cellophane has felt the strength of the pound. I do not expect the Minister to be able to solve that problem overnight. We know that it is a problem for all manufacturing companies in the United Kingdom. I know that the Minister agrees that manufacturing matters strongly in this country. The problem is something that successive Governments have wrestled with and not always been able to solve because of outside forces, such as the strength of the pound, dollar and euro, but manufacturing should be protected at all times. We cannot allow it to disappear.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/7">Last year in Bridgwater, we lost Federal Modal; 400 jobs went to Poland because we could not compete. The Government were helpful and, although we have ongoing problems with the pension fund, I cannot fault what happened. However, I am greatly worried about the situation in Kansas. I hope that the Minister can help. Kansas state legislators have passed an enormous amount of money to the plant in Kansas&mdash;we are talking about millions of dollars, not a few hundred thousand. They voted publicly to give public money to a plant to enable it to undermine us in the United Kingdom. It does not stop there. The plant is unproductive and does not make a profit. Why would one give money to a plant that does not make a profit and is not productive, whether it is in China, Australia or America?</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/8">I hope that the Minister agrees that it is worrying that British jobs in a profitable, highly productive plant are being put under threat by a plant that is not profitable, not productive and makes about half the types of cellophane that we do. It cannot even keep up with our production levels, yet we are losing to that plant money that should come to us.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/9">Today at 3.30 pm, a deputation from the Transport and General Workers Union and Glyn Ford, the MEP for the south-west, are meeting Peter Mandelson in Europe to discuss this matter. I know that the Minister is fully aware of that, and I am sure that she has been fully briefed by her staff. The subsidies are unfair trade, unfair dumping and the use of unfair competition against profitable plants, and we should not allow that to happen. I hope that the Minister will give some assurance that, in this world of free trade, the World Trade Organisation should be asked to consider this matter, either through the EU or the British Government&mdash;ideally both.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/10">Innovia Films has started a 90-day consultation. Last night we had a meeting with Sedgemoor district council, which was attended by all the political parties&mdash;well, both of us, there were not any Liberals present&mdash;the chief executive of Innovia Films, Mr. David Beeby, and Mr. John Bloomfield, the managing director at Bridgwater, at which they laid out their stall as to what they need. This is the crux of the matter, and why we are here today. The Minister is aware that we have a meeting in just over a week to try to move the matter on.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/11">One of the biggest costs at the plant is the production of power. There is a power station on site, as there has always been. If one drives down the M5, one will see the chimney of the power station. However, the power station is old. I am sure that the Minister knows that a few years ago British Cellophane paid 12p a therm for gas whereas today it pays 116p a therm. That gives some idea of the difference in the cost of the energy that it needs to produce.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/12">I have here some figures from John Hall Associates, which show the difference between Dutch and French production and levels of cost as of today. Ours are enormously higher&mdash;about a third. I am happy to give the Minister those figures after the debate. That shows that Innovia Films, or British Cellophane, is finding it hard to compete in the market. In yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i>, there was a quote&mdash;it has just dropped off the desk, so I will not hunt around for it&mdash;saying that energy costs are making it so hard for companies in this country to compete that they are considering moving abroad for that reason alone.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/13">I will return to the issue of the power station, but there is also a problem with water. The plant uses a massive amount of water in its production process. Last year, the cost of water at the plant went up by &pound;200,000 in one year. If one takes 2000 as a base year, the cost of water for British Cellophane has gone up by 25 per cent. in four or five years. It gives some idea of the cost to the company that it now hopes to buy in its energy services. Never mind the actual cellophane itself&mdash;we are talking just about production costs.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/14">What can I ask the Minister to do to help? We need a new power station. Sedgemoor district council has a proposal on the table for a wood-burning power station. That would not only create 20 jobs but create enough power to look after British Cellophane, put 15 per cent. back on to the grid, use 145,000 tonnes of wood that normally goes into landfill and help the Government to hit their targets on biodiversity, biofuels and renewables. I say that with four nuclear reactors down the road at Hinkley Point.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/15">We have the opportunity to do something special in Somerset. The power plant is there, and there will be no change of use. If we could get the permission, it could be done. However, we need an indication from the Government, either through the regional development agency or directly, or from Europe on energy production, that that could happen. The company needs to know that we are listening and doing what we can&mdash;I mean all of us&mdash;to help.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/16">It will be an enormous challenge. Every year, &pound;20 million goes into the economy from British Cellophane&mdash;in wages and direct and indirect goods. It has been the lifeblood of Bridgwater in many ways. Going down the M5, it can be smelt at every turn. However, that is British Cellophane; that is what we are proud of. On Saturday, on the march organised by the Transport and General Workers Union, I marched with Matthew Burchell together with hundreds of people, from all walks of life, in Bridgwater, a manufacturing town whose lifeblood is making things. We need Government help.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/17">It is rare that an MP pleads with the Government, but I am doing so on behalf of Bridgwater. I have laid out a stall of what we need. We have deputations going to Europe and people who are prepared to sign petitions in their hundreds, and I hope that the Minister will listen. I give another pledge to the Government; we will do what we have to. Sedgemoor district council has cut business rates to the plant straight away. Although it can give no direct money, the county council has passed a resolution to do what it can to help. Last night, at the meeting, the RDA said that it would do everything that it could to help via government, directly and indirectly.</p>
	<p pid=".391.1/18">The challenge, Minister, is to look after manufacturing per se&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-08.394.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1234" speakername="Jacqui Smith" speakeroffice="The Minister for Industry and the Regions"  colnum="394"  time="011:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050308/halltext/50308h02.htm#50308h02_spmin0">
	<p pid=".394.2/1">I start by congratulating the hon. Gentleman, not only on obtaining this debate but on the obvious passion that he has shown and the action that he has already taken in talking to my right hon. Friends and pressing the case very strongly.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/2">I also thank him for the deserved and well-natured credit that he gave to Matthew Burchell, the Labour prospective parliamentary candidate in Bridgwater and to the T and G, which has also strongly lobbied the Government on the issue.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/3">I would like to start by expressing my sympathy for the position in which the hon. Gentleman's constituents find themselves. It is certainly the case that the company's recent decision to begin consultations with a possible view to closure of the Bridgwater site is disappointing and distressing news to those people who, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, have in many cases put a lifetime of commitment into the plant. It is because we understand the seriousness of the issue and the impact on the local community that as soon as we learned that Innovia was considering the future configuration of its manufacturing operations, officials from my Department and from the South West of England Regional Development Agency immediately visited the company to understand the background and to explore what assistance might be available.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/4">The hon. Gentleman emphasises the importance of manufacturing, as I frequently do. The company has received assistance from the Process Industries Centre for Manufacturing Excellence, an organisation that promotes the development of lean manufacturing, and was established with financial aid from the Department of Trade and Industry. However, we wished to see whether there was anything further we could do to assist the company. We also wanted to understand the background to any decisions that might be made. Part of the background is the current situation for cellophane production. Although the hon. Gentleman made a strong case for the continued importance of cellophane, cellophane production has been in decline for many years, as alternative products have been developed to meet the needs of the market. At the peak of demand, there were 23 production units in Europe and 15 in the United States, and they were operated by a number of different companies. Today, Innovia supplies 70 per cent. of the world market&mdash;outside Japan&mdash;of cellophane products from only three manufacturing sites. As the hon. Gentleman said, one of those sites is in the USA, another is at Wigton in north-west England, and the other is at Bridgwater. Despite that, we understand that Innovia's production capacity is currently 50 per cent. higher than demand for the product. Put simply, there is a continuing decline in worldwide demand for cellophane products, and no company can continue producing more than the market requires. It is that dramatic change in the market that is forcing the company to consider rationalisation of its production capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/5">Of course, the company will need to base its decision on any rationalisation on sound commercial grounds, including the relative strength of the remaining markets, product range, proximity and time to the markets served, plant condition, and operating costs. As the hon. Gentleman points out, account will also have to be taken not only of specific financial assistance but of the whole framework of support that may be available in different areas. Alongside the support that is already provided, the local community, the local authority&mdash;Sedgemoor district council&mdash;and local agencies are making major efforts to find a solution that retains the manufacturing jobs in the area. I understand that the district council is exploring whether the company could pay less in business rates.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/6">As recently as last night, the regional development agency&mdash;the prime agency in the region for economic development and business support&mdash;met with the hon. Gentleman, and senior representatives of the company and the community. Today, the hon. Gentleman raised important points about power and the power plant. He also mentioned the pressure that manufacturers are currently feeling in respect of energy prices. I do not dispute that that is a considerable challenge for manufacturers, but I slightly dispute the angle that the hon. Gentleman took. He put us in a very bad position in respect of international competition, but the DTI estimates that UK gas prices remain below the EU median in 2004. However, it is an important issue. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry met representatives of energy-intensive users last December, and why my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and E-Commerce has had meetings to discuss the issue with some of the most affected companies. It is also why I discussed it recently with the Engineering Employers Federation. We are determined to find ways both to make sure that the market operates effectively to maintain competitiveness in energy prices and to ensure support for manufacturers.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/7">The hon. Gentleman made a specific point about the development of a new power plant at Bridgwater. I want to look carefully at the figures that he and the company have forwarded to us about that challenge. I also want to set that in the context of the considerable support that the Government have already provided for alternative sources of energy, including exemption from the climate change levy for fuel inputs and electricity outputs from good quality combined heat and power, eligibility for enhanced capital allowances, and a reduction in VAT to 5 per cent. for certain grant-funded domestic micro-CHP.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/8">More recent developments include securing the future of the community energy programme until at least March 2008 with a total funding of &pound;60 million, creating incentives to develop innovative products and putting in place shortly revised guidance for power station developers, obliging them to consider fully the options for CHP and community heating.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/9">I also understand that within that framework the particular situation in Bridgwater is important. While I cannot give the hon. Gentleman any undertakings this morning, I can ensure that across government we will carefully examine the issue and see whether or not further support is available.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/10">Let us be clear about one important point. We are not discussing a company that is deserting the UK&mdash;far from it. The company has its group headquarters in Wigton in the north-west, where it employs 850 people in both manufacturing and research and development. In 2002, it invested &euro;12 million in a new global research and development centre at Wigton. That was in addition to more than &euro;100 million invested in production facilities at the Wigton site during the past decade. There is a commitment to UK manufacturing, although that is not, I accept, a comfort to the hon. Gentleman, who is rightly concerned about the Bridgwater site in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/11">The hon. Gentleman raised the particular issue of the funding that, it is argued, the US authorities and local authorities in Kansas are providing to the American plant. He rightly highlights the fact that the route for identifying whether or not that complies with World Trade Organisation rules is through the European Commission, which, of course, negotiates for the European Union on such issues.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/12">I was pleased to hear about the meeting that is taking place with the Commissioner for Trade, Peter Mandelson, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I can also assure him that my officials have been talking to the Commission to confirm whether the US support complies with WTO rules. We want to maintain that contact so that we can interrogate the facts about the extent of the support in the US and whether it constitutes unfair trade under WTO rules.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/13">So, while it is hard for those involved, this is, in some ways, a story of change and of companies in the UK responding to such change. In manufacturing&mdash;even manufacturing within this particular area of support&mdash;one of the difficulties with the market is that as we innovate and develop new products that compete with cellophane, there is a change in the way such manufacturing happens. There is not, incidentally, a shift of manufacturing out of the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".394.2/14">Other companies in the UK are producing the new alternatives that are replacing cellophane. For example, last September, my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade and Investment formally opened a new &pound;65 million investment by the Japanese company Nippon Gohsei at Saltend, near Hull. That plant uses cutting-edge technology to produce a new environmentally-friendly polymer used in the food packaging industry, 90 per cent. of which is exported to Europe. That, once again, creates new jobs in the UK.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-08.397.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1234" speakername="Jacqui Smith" colnum="397"  time="011:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050308/halltext/50308h02.htm#50308h02_spnew4">
	<p pid=".397.1/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, which is why I said two things. We need to investigate the extent of the aid being offered in the US and ensure that we do everything possible to assist the UK plants, particularly the Bridgwater plant. However, we also need to do that with an understanding of the market. Where there is massive overcapacity, rationalisation is needed. The hon. Gentleman is quite right to argue the case for the plant in his constituency. I certainly hope that we can create and maintain jobs in the sector in the UK. As a Government, we will do what we can to support that, but in the end those decisions must be taken by the company, taking into account the market situation and a range of commercial factors.</p>
	<p pid=".397.1/2">We will continue to provide support for manufacturing, through the manufacturing advisory service and the investment that we are putting into science and innovation. For example, in the 2004 spending review we provided an extra &pound;515 million in new money to boost science and innovation. Those incentives are being provided at a time when the UK is enjoying the longest period of sustained low and stable inflation since the 1960s, with interest rates close to historically low levels.</p>
	<p pid=".397.1/3">The effect of that is obvious. Gross domestic product has grown strongly over the past year, as has manufacturing output. As the hon. Gentleman said, we need to put in place the framework to enable UK manufacturers to compete. We need to add specific financial assistance to that, whether it is for innovation or is put into those areas that have been identified for selective investment.</p>
	<p pid=".397.1/4">We must ensure that local economies are doing as well as possible. I know that the hon. Gentleman will share my satisfaction that the economy of Somerset is now performing better than the national average. For example, unemployment is 1.3 per cent., which is relatively low compared to regional and national averages. More specifically, in Bridgwater more than 1 million sq ft of new factory space is being built at the recently opened 100-acre Express Park, less than a mile from the Innovia site.</p>
	<p pid=".397.1/5">At the end of last year, a planning application was submitted for an additional 50-acre employment site just two miles south of Bridgwater. Further from Bridgwater, there are two new development sites, at Glastonbury and Taunton. The Glastonbury development alone is expected to create 850 jobs, on a 35-acre site. To help with training, the South West regional development agency has assisted in the establishment of an &pound;11 million training programme through the Somerset skills alliance, as well as a single regeneration budget programme and a &quot;Building Communities&quot; pilot project in Bridgwater.</p>
	<p pid=".397.1/6">My argument is that, although the Government cannot always influence or determine commercial decisions about rationalisation and plant closure, we can provide support where possible and maintain the macro-economic framework to allow the hon. Gentleman's constituency to flourish and ensure that there are jobs for local people. That is not to diminish in any way the painful position in which Innovia's Bridgwater work force find themselves, through no fault of their own. However, in that specific case a number of both local and national agencies are already engaged in seeking ways of assisting those who will be affected if&mdash;I stress &quot;if&quot;, because I do not think that the decision has been taken yet&mdash;a decision is taken to close the Innovia plant.</p>
	<p pid=".397.1/7">I know that the cellophane plant in Bridgwater has been a key feature of the area for several generations. The announcement that it is being considered for closure was bound to be sad news for the employees, their families and the local community. I can only give the hon. Gentleman and that community my assurance that officials at local, regional and national levels will continue to explore what assistance might be provided.</p>

	<p pid=".399.1/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I also thank Mr. Speaker for selecting this issue for debate. The non-proliferation treaty review conference is due to be held in New York in May.</p>
	<p pid=".399.1/2">First, I should declare an interest. Before everyone gets too excited, I should say that I do not have shares in BAE Systems, Boeing or anything like that. I am, however, a lifetime member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. I am also the chairman of the parliamentary group on CND, although it is not yet been declared an all-party group, and we are awaiting Tory Members to make up the numbers. Finally, I am a vice-chairman of CND and a member of its national council.</p>
	<p pid=".399.1/3">The issue could not be more important for the future of the world. Nuclear weapons have been a cloud over us all throughout my lifetime and the lifetimes of everybody in the Chamber, and that has been the case ever since the first bombs were exploded in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Efforts were constantly made to obtain some degree of disarmament through controls, test bans and the various arguments that were put forward internationally. The non-proliferation treaty of 1970 was seen as an enormous step forward and a way to get us out of the dangers of a nuclear holocaust. The five declared nuclear weapons states&mdash;the United States, the then Soviet Union, Britain, France and China&mdash;all agreed to the treaty, which would do two things. First, it would prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology outside the five nuclear states. Secondly, those five states would, in the longer term, disarm. In other words, we would begin to see the end of nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid=".399.1/4">The conference this May is part of the five-yearly review process, and this debate is intended to allow hon. Members to express their views about it. Above all, however, the Minister will be able to tell us what stance the Government will take at the review conference and whether we shall see a development of the exciting statement that was made after the 2000 conference.</p>
	<p pid=".399.1/5">Before I go into that, however, we should reflect for a moment on the proliferation that has taken place since 1970. Several states now have nuclear weapons; some of them have a delivery capability, and many would have the ability to manufacture many more nuclear weapons if they were minded to do so. This year's conference is therefore not simply a five-yearly review: it is an important watershed. Are we to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons by following the two pillars of the 1970 treaty&mdash;disarmament by the five states plus disarmament by non-declared nuclear weapons states?</p>
	<p pid=".399.1/6">We should remember that one pariah state developed nuclear weapons and gave them up. Under apartheid, South Africa developed nuclear weapons, but with the end of apartheid and the installation of the African National Congress Government under Nelson Mandela, it renounced them and helped to make the continent of Africa nuclear-free. We should applaud South Africa for that and recognise that the moral stature that it enjoys in the world is the product not only of the end of apartheid, but of the fact that it is not threatening anybody.</p>

	<p pid=".400.1/1">Absolutely; that is a good point, which I endorse. Argentina, too, was developing a capability, although I do not think that it had got as far as South Africa. However, it gave up that capability.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/2">Other states have been less promising in that respect. We know that Israel has developed nuclear weapons and that it has a delivery capability and an advanced missile system. We know that because Mordecai Vanunu had the courage to tell the truth about Israel's nuclear weapons and subsequently spent the best part of two decades in prison as a result. He is still under control orders in Jerusalem, which we hope will be lifted on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-21">21 April</phrase>. He will then be free to come to the House and tell us the truth about the nuclear threat in that region.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/3">Of the other countries that have nuclear weapons, India and Pakistan are in negotiation about no first use and, I hope, possible long-term disarmament, although when President Musharraf addressed a meeting in the House, which I and many colleagues attended, I was not encouraged by his remarks about nuclear weapons. Given the poverty in India and Pakistan, it is unconscionable that either country would spend the resources that are required for developing a nuclear delivery system when they should be developing education, housing, health and all the necessary social developments in their countries.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/4">Clearly, North Korea has developed nuclear weapons and, tragically, has withdrawn from the NPT system. I hope that the negotiations by all the countries involved will bring North Korea back. The Minister's colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1179" name="Bill Rammell">the Member for Harlow (Mr. Rammell)</phrase>, is not here today, but he went to North Korea to engage in that discussion. I hope that his efforts will be redoubled, so that there is no prospect of another war breaking out on the Korean peninsula.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/5">The issue of Iranian nuclear weapons is discussed loudly, principally by the Pentagon and others, although Mohamed el-Baradei, the United Nations weapons inspector, has made several visits to Iran and has confirmed that he thinks that it has ceased the development of enriched uranium that could lead to the development of weapons-grade material and that it is taking part in negotiations. I hope that, when the Minister replies, he can tell us that he supports that process, too, and that we will continue engagement with Iran to ensure that there is no development of nuclear weapons in the area, and that we will have no more of the bellicose statements from either President Bush or Secretary of State Rice in which they seem to be overtly threatening Iran. Surely enough life has already been lost in Iraq, without threatening Iran. Disarmament must be the order of the day.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/6">Mohamed el-Baradei, the UN weapons inspector, made some interesting comments in the run-up to the NPT. He said:</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/7" class="indent">&quot;It is clear that recent events have placed the NPT and the regime supporting it under unprecedented stress, exposing some of its inherent limitations and pointing to areas that need to be adjusted&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/8">He then proposed seven steps that would strengthen the NPT regime and, with it, world security. He said:</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Some of the needed fixes can be made in May, but only if governments are ready to act.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/10">Those steps, which would not require amending the treaty, include a five-year moratorium on building new facilities for uranium enrichment, plutonium separation and materials that can be used for nuclear weapons production. He went on:</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/11" class="indent">&quot;There is no compelling reason for building more of these proliferation-sensitive facilities. The nuclear industry already has more than enough capacity to fuel its power plants and research facilities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/12">We should listen carefully to Mohamed el-Baradei because he has important things to say, more so because he was not listened to properly about Iran and has put a huge effort into Iraq and North Korea. He is a force for good in the world and a force for peace. He should be treated with the respect that he deserves.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/13">Item 6 of the final document that was referred to at the 2000 conference states:</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/14" class="indent">&quot;An unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament, to which all States parties are committed under article VI.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/15">That was a very welcome statement. The declaration put forward a series of proposals that included:</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/16" class="indent">&quot;Further efforts by the nuclear-weapon States to reduce their nuclear arsenals unilaterally; increased transparency by the nuclear-weapon States with regard to the nuclear weapons capabilities . . . reduction of non-strategic nuclear weapons, based on unilateral initiatives . . . Concrete agreed measures to further reduce the operational status of nuclear weapons systems; a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies to minimize the risk that these weapons will ever be used and to facilitate the process of their total elimination&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/17">and</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/18" class="indent">&quot;The engagement as soon as appropriate of all nuclear-weapon States in the process leading to the total elimination of their nuclear weapons.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/19">Those are important items, and important to remember as we go to that conference, which will take place just a few weeks before the 60th anniversary of the explosion of the world's first nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/20">In some ways, the conference ought to be held in Hiroshima. Those who believe that nuclear weapons provide security, safety or a solution of any kind to the world's problems should think for a moment of all those who died in 1945, of all the resources that have been wasted since then on developing nuclear weapons and of those who continue to die from the cancerous fallout from those explosions or from nuclear tests that have taken place since 1945.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/21">The British Government have to face up to some serious, very important questions; any British Government would have to. We are signatories to the 1970 treaty, therefore we should not be developing any new nuclear weapons. I understand that the Trident submarine system is coming to the end of its usable life. I should like to hear a declaration from the British Government that when that happens, the system will not be replaced and that we see it as our obligation under the 1970 treaty, to which we adhered, to get rid of our nuclear weapons at that stage.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/22">Work is going on at Aldermaston on what I believe to be the preparatory development of a new generation of nuclear weapons. I should like to hear from the Government about that work, about what weapons are being developed and about the United States' participation in that process. We are required by the treaty to pursue a nuclear-free world, so are we developing a new generation of nuclear weapons and prepared to start the development of a new delivery system or are we going to play our part in nuclear arms reduction? It is all very well for us to lecture the rest of the world on the danger of nuclear proliferation and on how bad nuclear weapons are&mdash;it is a danger, and they are appalling&mdash;yet we ourselves are developing them and continuing to develop and hold them.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/23">I recognise that the number of nuclear warheads has been reduced. However, I also recognise that under the NATO umbrella we have our own weapons that are theoretically independent of the United States. Under the NATO treaty system, nuclear weapons are also held in non-declared countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, because they are part of the NATO command structure. We need to be clear about how that fits with what we are trying to achieve.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/24">I want others to take part in this debate, so I shall conclude by drawing attention to the preparatory work for this year's conference in New York, which gives us an enormous opportunity to move forward. There was a great deal of hope around after the 2000 conference. In his contribution to that conference, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/931" name="Peter Hain">the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain)</phrase>, then a Foreign Office Minister, made it clear that he saw Britain as on the fast track towards disarmament and as playing our full part in that.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/25">We have not heard such welcome statements from the Secretary of State for Defence or any Defence Ministers since 2001. Indeed, the Secretary of State for Defence indicated that there were circumstances in which he would be prepared to authorise the use of nuclear weapons by this country, ending the no first use policy. I hope that we will hear something clear to the effect that that is no longer the case and that we would not be prepared to use nuclear weapons under such circumstances. I also hope that, given all the insecurities that have existed in the world from September 2001 onwards&mdash;the wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq and all that has gone with them&mdash;we will ask ourselves the obvious question: what good are nuclear weapons in any of those circumstances? Do they not just threaten the destruction of this planet and eat up valuable resources that could be better used on something else, and should we not say that we intend to get rid of them? I hope that the British Government are prepared to take that step.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/26">This subject has dominated the Labour party for a long time, and as we move towards the NPT conference and the possibility&mdash;I hope that it is only a possibility&mdash;of the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons, I suspect that it will become much more of a centre-stage political issue. It is up to this House to declare its views on the matter before the conference. I get the feeling that the majority of the public in this country have had enough of the losses brought about by the wars in which we have recently been involved, and have no stomach or wish for getting involved in preparation for the destruction of this planet, which is what nuclear weapons could bring about.</p>
	<p pid=".400.1/27">Many people have campaigned on the issue with great principle and verve for many years. Many have given up lives and careers to do so. Mordecai Vanunu is only one; many others, including Joseph Rotblat, have done a great deal. We should listen carefully to what they have to say, and use this opportunity to move in the direction of a more peaceful globe, not a world at war.</p>

	<p pid=".403.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/819" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>, who, as he says, has had a lifelong commitment to the cause of the abolition of nuclear weapons. I have had almost as long a commitment to the cause of nuclear deterrence and this country's retention of nuclear weapons. We have debated the subject many times. Although it was styled as a debate on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference, when I saw that he was fortunate enough to have obtained this debate&mdash;on which I congratulate him&mdash;I knew that I could rely on him to go into the broader issues of whether Britain, in particular, should continue to possess nuclear weapons. I hope to follow his example of not out-speaking my allotted time, so I shall straight away address some of his points.</p>
	<p pid=".403.0/2">The hon. Gentleman asked us to think about Hiroshima and all the lives that were lost, but one point that is often overlooked is that Hiroshima was probably the first ever example in the atomic age of a nuclear-free zone. The western allies faced the question of what they were going to do to end the war; the bloody campaign was scheduled to continue, and a full-scale invasion of Japan would have cost many more lives than the bombing of Hiroshima did. When that was being considered, what would the allies have had to think about if the Japanese held atomic weapons of their own? I am not saying that I would have wanted the Japanese to hold atomic weapons, but the fact is that when one side has atomic or nuclear weapons, it completely alters the situation if its actual or potential adversary possesses them too.</p>
	<p pid=".403.0/3">The hon. Gentleman referred to wars such as in Afghanistan, and others that are undoubtedly below the nuclear threshold. I can recall debating these matters with the CND 20 years ago, and in those days the argument was, &quot;What on earth does Britain want nuclear weapons for? They didn't do us any good in the Falklands.&quot; My response now is what it was then: just because a given antidote to a particular deadly disease does not work against all sorts of other diseases, that is no good reason to throw it away. Nuclear weapons are not a deterrent to all forms of aggression, but the nuclear deterrent undoubtedly works against certain forms of aggression that exist when one country has weapons of mass destruction and another does not.</p>
	<p pid=".403.0/4">Let us consider the question of our treaty commitments under article 6 of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. That is often said by unilateral nuclear disarmers to commit us to a nuclear-free world and to the abolition of our nuclear weapons. Well, yes it does, but only in a way that encompasses such ideal goals as the abolition of all weapons worldwide, and of war in particular. If there were a practical policy to which we could all sign up, and if we could all march up to the lectern and raise our hands and vote one thing out of existence, I am sure that we would all agree that war was top of the list. We would love to vote conflict out of existence, we would love to vote nuclear war out of existence and we would love to vote conventional war out of existence. However, if we cannot do it all at once, we have to ask ourselves whether we are making the world a safer or a more dangerous place by voting one of those elements out of existence before the others. The case of those of us who have argued for 20 years or more in favour of the nuclear deterrent, is that in a world in which wars continue to happen, the abolition of nuclear weapons in the hands of the democracies and in those of worldwide society, would make the world a safer place for conventional warfare.</p>
	<p pid=".403.0/5">Let us return to the example of Hiroshima. Did the fact that nuclear weapons did not exist until 1945 make the world a safer place? Possibly, the 50 million people who were killed on both sides, including victims of the holocaust and other innocent civilians, would, if they but had a voice, disagree with the proposition. In reality, nuclear weapons can sometimes make the world more dangerous, and sometimes they can make it safer. Who would really argue now that in the situation that we faced for half a century&mdash;confrontation between the totalitarian Soviet bloc and the western democracies&mdash;the prescription of the CND should have been followed; the west and NATO should have abandoned the nuclear deterrent and left the Soviet Union with a monopoly of nuclear weapons? I remember the great debates about the deployment of Cruise and Pershing missiles, when it was said that we were five minutes from Armageddon, four minutes from Armageddon, a minute and a half from it or whatever time the nuclear clock was supposed to be ticking off; I remember all those apocalyptic statements. However, in the end what got rid of the nuclear weapons was multilateral negotiations, compounded by a change in the political system in the Soviet Union.</p>
	<p pid=".403.0/6">They say that all simple speeches should have a single main point, and I have come to the single main point of this one. That is that it is not the weapon systems per se that matter, it is the nature of the political systems of the countries that possess them.</p>
	<p pid=".403.0/7">Look what happened when we came to the end of the cold war. Did the Russians suddenly abolish all the nuclear weapons that we had been so fearful about for so many years? Of course they did not. But we suddenly stopped being anything like as fearful of them as we had been for such a long time. That was because Russia took great strides towards democracy. The only reason why subsequently&mdash;so long as Russia remains, as we hope that it will, on the democratic road&mdash;we are fearful of the Russian nuclear arsenal is the danger that those weapons could somehow leach out from Russian control into that of other societies and groups with no commitment to democratic principles. Then we would be concerned once again.</p>
	<p pid=".403.0/8">Therefore, the real answer to the question is not to ask, in some false egalitarian way, how we can lecture the dictatorships of the world that they should not have nuclear weapons when we keep our own. The answer is simple; I certainly do not have a problem with it. It is that they are dictatorships and we are a democracy. Nuclear weapons are good in the hands of democracies faced with dictatorships in the world; they are bad in the hands of dictatorships, as are other potential means of waging war. I have no difficulty at all in saying that Britain giving up nuclear weapons would not make a scrap of difference to whether a dictatorship continued to possess them. In those debates for so many years, I challenged again and again those who said that we should give up our nuclear weapons with the simple question: &quot;Who are you saying would follow our example? Name a specific country.&quot; Nobody ever did.</p>

	<p pid=".405.1/1">I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is falling into precisely the trap that, as I was saying, people who subscribe to his point of view continually fail to avoid. I do not need to advise North Korea. North Korea will do what it considers to be in its best interests. If it genuinely believes that it is at risk from being invaded by the United States, and if it has nuclear weapons, which apparently it has, nothing on earth&mdash;certainly no advice from the likes of me or, dare I say it, from him&mdash;will persuade it to abandon them.</p>
	<p pid=".405.1/2">I return briefly to what the non-proliferation treaty actually says. Article VI states:</p>
	<p pid=".405.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".405.1/4">Most people would say that we have done that. I do not believe that most people would say that we, at any rate, are involved in a nuclear arms race, given the reductions that have been made. The article continues:</p>
	<p pid=".405.1/5" class="indent">&quot;and to nuclear disarmament, and on a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".405.1/6">The article therefore commits us to a disarmed world in the same breath as it commits us to a nuclear disarmed world. I long for the day when we have worldwide disarmament of every sort, because that will imply that there has been a revolution in the minds of man and that we no longer want to kill each other when we have the chance. Unfortunately, as we know from our own history and from present-day conflicts, the minds of man have not undergone that revolution. Until they do, people who do not want to be killed will have to defend themselves and deter attack.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-08.406.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1257" speakername="Gavin Strang" colnum="406"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050308/halltext/50308h03.htm#50308h03_spnew8">
	<p pid=".406.2/1">We all agree that we are discussing an important subject, and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/819" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on initiating this debate. As he reminded us, the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons&mdash;the NPT&mdash;came into operation in 1970. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1045" name="Julian Lewis">The hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> also referred to the treaty, which originated during the cold war. Looking around, I see other colleagues who took part in similar debates during that period; some of us had most of our adult political lives during the cold war.</p>
	<p pid=".406.2/2">I wish to make a simple point, which is not intended to be a response to the previous speaker. At the time when the SS20s and the cruise missiles were being deployed, we were justified in being very worried that there might be a nuclear exchange. It might first occur at the theatre level, but most of us were convinced that, if such a nuclear exchange occurred in Europe, it could quickly escalate to a major all-out nuclear attack. Of course, that would have been Armageddon; the survivors really would have envied the dead. It is worth acknowledging that we are now free of that threat, which is a tremendous advance. Whatever the problems facing us&mdash;I shall refer to them shortly&mdash;the fact is that that threat and fear is behind us, because the cold war is over.</p>
	<p pid=".406.2/3">New problems have arisen since the end of the cold war. Recently, there was the 9/11 attack in the United States of America in 2001. As a result, there has been a huge focus on the need to counteract international terrorism. Our Government and other western Governments, including that of the US, have certainly taken such a focus. Furthermore, this week is the first anniversary of the Madrid train bombing. I shall not be drawn into some of the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for New Forest, East, but I point out that there is an issue in relation to the possibility of a terrorist organisation eventually getting its hands on weapons of mass destruction; in the long term, there must a risk of al-Qaeda or another such organisation getting hold of a dirty nuclear bomb. In that context, I simply wish to make reference to the proliferation security initiative, which is intended to interdict the movement of WMD-related materials. Importantly, the group of 11 states involved includes the United States, France and the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".406.2/4">I was quickly going to list some of the pluses and minuses of the period since the NPT came into operation, and particularly the '90s and beyond. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North covered some of them, and I shall not repeat what he said, but I was glad that he referred to the achievement of the African National Congress in South Africa; we should always acknowledge that that incoming Government made a tremendous decision.</p>
	<p pid=".406.2/5">It is not all gloom; we also have the strategic arms reduction treaties, START 1 and START 2. It is fair to say that START 2 has not yet fully delivered. Instead of START 3, we have the strategic offensive reduction treaty or SORT, on which I know that some Members might wish to comment, because in several respects it does not offer as much as we would have liked. The particular treaty I wish to highlight is the comprehensive test ban treaty or CTBT, which the United Nations General Assembly adopted in 1996 and which France, Russia and the UK have ratified. That is important, because the five official nuclear states must ratify it before it comes into operation. It has not yet come into operation because neither China nor the US has ratified it, but it is an important treaty, and I hope that it will come into force.</p>
	<p pid=".406.2/6">My hon. Friend referred to the minuses. There are lots of them; not least, they include the fact that the five official nuclear states&mdash;those that existed when the NPT was established&mdash;have been joined by what they official call nuclear-capable states: Israel, India and Pakistan. In the context of Pakistan, there was the worrying revelation that AQ Khan, who was a senior scientist and manager of the Pakistani nuclear programme, was part of a network that was involved in selling nuclear weapon know-how and materials to other countries. It is a negative development when any new country develops nuclear weapons, and it is a positive development when any country gives up nuclear weapons, as South Africa did. I could touch on Iran and North Korea, as my hon. Friend did, but I will move on, because I know that some of my colleagues want to take part in the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".406.2/7">Given the run-up to the last two NPT conferences in 1995 and 2000, I think that there is a feeling in many countries, which is shared by many people, that the world has not delivered sufficiently and that nuclear weapon states in particular have not delivered enough. The treaty was a bargain struck in 1970 between nuclear weapon and non-nuclear weapon states that nuclear weapon states would be allowed to keep nuclear weapons on the basis that they would get rid of them and help non-nuclear weapon states to develop nuclear power peacefully.</p>
	<p pid=".406.2/8">As a reflection of many non-nuclear countries' frustration with the lack of progress, the new agenda coalition of eight states was set up in the 1990s. That was an important development, as the coalition is a positive force for nuclear disarmament. In 1999, at the General Assembly of the UN, it called on nuclear weapon states to</p>
	<p pid=".406.2/9" class="indent">&quot;make an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the speedy and total elimination of their nuclear arsenals and to engage without delay in an accelerated process of negotiations, thus achieving nuclear disarmament to which they are committed under article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".406.2/10">That resolution was carried by 111 votes to 13, with 39 abstentions.</p>
	<p pid=".406.2/11">The new agenda coalition has called for the negotiation of a general convention banning all nuclear weapons, using the model of the 1983 chemical weapons convention. As hon. Members recognise, there is currently an implicit understanding that France, the UK and China will be let off the hook a bit until the US and Russia further reduce their arsenals. Much as we want those arsenals to be reduced, we may well have to consider other ways in which to get better responses from nuclear weapon states and to have more impact on the situation.</p>
	<p pid=".406.2/12">I look forward very much to hearing what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has to say. I have no doubts about his personal commitment to ensuring that the British Government do their best to achieve progress. Indeed, I think that we all recognise that the present Government have made some progress. The British permanent representative to the UN conference on disarmament, which is the main disarmament body and is based in Geneva, set out some the things done in the preparatory committee for the fourth conference last year. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will add to what he said, but I point out that the UK has provided working support for a fissile material cut-off treaty, which would be an important advance if we could achieve it.</p>
	<p pid=".406.2/13">We have a long way to go. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North has a long-standing, consistent interest in this matter, and there is a general consensus on the Government side, even if it does not extend to the other side of the House, that we need to give this matter high priority and that more needs to be achieved, not least at the conference. It is remarkable that the 1995 and 2000 conferences came out quite well in the end, although there was a lot of pessimism in the preceding years. The same might happen with the next conference; I certainly hope that it will be successful, but as important, if not more so, is what happens afterwards.</p>

	<p pid=".409.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/819" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on securing the debate, on his thought-provoking speech and on the work that he has done over many years in raising this highly important issue.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/2">There is common agreement that the British Government are right to want to use their presidency of the G8 and the European Union to tackle two of the great world problems: climate change and global poverty. However, it could be said that proliferation is possibly an even more crucial issue facing us this year. The recent report of the UN high-level panel warned us that</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/3" class="indent">&quot;We are approaching a point at which the erosion of the non-proliferation regime could become irreversible and result in a cascade of proliferation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/4">It said that&mdash;despite the fact that, in some ways, one could say that until now the non-proliferation regime has been remarkably successful at limiting proliferation. Indeed, ironically, the invasion of Iraq showed that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty plus containment diplomacy were much more successful than most of us had expected. Iraq had probably abandoned its nuclear weapons programme and abolished its weapons of mass destruction by the mid-1990s.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/5">Some apologists for that war claim that it has been successful in putting pressure on countries such as Libya. I find that a difficult argument to follow, because I think that Libya was already showing signs of constructive engagement since the negotiations on Lockerbie. It could at least as easily be argued that countries such as North Korea and Iran might see the risk of a US invasion as a reason for wanting to develop a nuclear deterrent.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/6">Iran and North Korea reflect one of the weaknesses of the existing treaty. First, the treaty assumed that civil nuclear production and military nuclear production can be separated. In practice, there is an increasing possibility of dual use. The same centrifuges that are used to enrich material up to civil nuclear use might further be used to achieve the enrichment to weapons-grade material. That is so even when one is applying the additional protocol. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1257" name="Gavin Strang">the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang)</phrase> said, Iran and Libya also illustrate the tremendous danger that was represented by the A.Q. Khan network and the possibility of nuclear weapons coming from a nuclear black market and their being used not only by states but by terrorists.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/7">The second great weakness in the treaty is the situation of the de facto nuclear weapons states&mdash;India and Pakistan, and particularly Israel, because it is a catalyst to proliferation in the middle east.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/8">In the eyes of many countries, the third great weakness has been the position of the nuclear weapons states. There has been a perceived lack of commitment on their part to pursuing nuclear disarmament and particular concern about the position of the Bush Administration. One must have considerable sympathy for the leaders of the new agenda coalition states when they said that the Bush Administration seem to be treating the treaty more as if it were an &agrave; la carte menu from which they could pick the bits that they liked than a proper international treaty.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/9">The review conference of 2000 was a considerable success, not least because Britain played a very constructive role in bringing together some of the nuclear weapons states and the non-nuclear weapons states. There was an action plan, which contained 13 steps. Various people are to blame, but I must say that the Bush Administration are particularly to blame for having virtually discarded that. They have abolished the anti-ballistic missile treaty and are refusing to make any progress towards the comprehensive test ban treaty. They share blame with China for the fact that the production of fissile materials ban has been stalled in arguments over the possibility of weapons in space. The Moscow treaty is widely perceived as not doing nearly enough to produce irreversible and verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/10">Then, of course, there is the worrying talk about producing new nuclear weapons systems, including ones that would make nuclear weapons more usable, thus breaking the nuclear taboo that has been common to all states for several decades. There is also talk of breaking the negative security assurances that we give to non-nuclear weapons states. That is also worrying, because it gives the impression that there is something arbitrary and capricious about the way in which the Administration regard not only bits of the treaty but the designating of states as to whether or not they are entitled to nuclear weapons. We need not an arbitrary but a fair system of international rule of law by treaty if we are to build a stable world.</p>

	<p pid=".410.0/1">My hon. Friend speaks eloquently and with a great deal of knowledge on the subject. He has come to the crux of the problem. Even the Government's strategic defence review of 2004 discussed ending nuclear weapons. They have said that if it is possible</p>
	<p pid=".410.0/2" class="indent">&quot;to include British nuclear weapons in any negotiations, without endangering our security interests, we shall do so.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".410.0/3">Part of the problem is that, despite the fine words said in 1995 and 2000&mdash;and possibly again in 2005&mdash;the crux is the enforcement and the signals sent out to countries in between those words. What does my hon. Friend propose that we can do to ensure that many of the things that he has talked about are put into place on the ground between the conferences, rather than just having the fine words every five years?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-08.414.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1119" speakername="Michael Moore" colnum="414"  time="014:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050308/halltext/50308h03.htm#50308h03_spnew19">
	<p pid=".414.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/819" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".414.1/2">The exchanges during the opening contributions lifted the debate on to a philosophical plain, although the picture painted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1045" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> was rather depressing. I hope that his analysis is wrong. He might be in danger of drawing the wrong conclusions from the recent Iraq war and its effects on democracy in the middle east. I do not intend to get drawn into that issue, as I would be out of order; perhaps we shall debate it on another occasion.</p>
	<p pid=".414.1/3">The non-proliferation treaty is the cornerstone of efforts to rid the world of the dangers of nuclear weapons. In the 1990s, there was a great deal of confidence that substantial progress was being made in eliminating the threats of nuclear war, but the growth of international terrorism and the exposure of the international nuclear bazaar run by A.Q. Khan dented that optimism somewhat and shook any complacency out of the system.</p>
	<p pid=".414.1/4">The review conference comes at a crucial time; not only has the context of nuclear weapons discussions changed, but the activities of key states such as North Korea and Iran are giving us cause for concern. It would be inappropriate for us to ignore some of the important steps in nuclear disarmament that have been taken in recent years. The UK Government deserve continued recognition for the serious steps that have been taken: the withdrawal of the RAF's freefall nuclear weapon; the reduction to a single nuclear weapons delivery system in Trident; and a 70 per cent. overall reduction in the explosive power of the UK's military capabilities. The Government also signed up to the comprehensive test ban treaty in 1998, and they have undoubtedly played a significant and leading role in international diplomacy, not least in their work with France and Germany in relation to Iran.</p>
	<p pid=".414.1/5">Elsewhere, as others have said, South Africa renounced its illegal nuclear weapons programme, setting an important precedent a decade ago, and Libya's more recent disposal of its capability was a welcome step forward. Against those welcome developments, there are some real difficulties to consider. At the heart of the NPT is the tension between the five nuclear weapons states that wish to prevent proliferation in other states and, increasingly, non-state actors and the remaining 184 signatories that are willing to thole being outside the club on the understanding that real disarmament among the five will proceed.</p>
	<p pid=".414.1/6">Previous review conferences have experienced all the difficulties associated with that basic problem. In 2000, the conference eventually made some progress with the agreement to the so-called 13 steps. That highlighted, among other things, the need to bring the comprehensive test ban treaty into force, preserve the anti-ballistic missile treaty and adopt new verification procedures. The United States of America has rejected the first of those propositions and has withdrawn from the second, and we still await details of how the verification capabilities are to be enhanced. Meanwhile, states such as India, Pakistan and Israel continue to be weapons capable and are showing few signs of volunteering their systems for disarmament. North Korea taunts the world about its intentions, and Iran is engaged in a dangerous game of bluff.</p>
	<p pid=".414.1/7">Whatever historical perspective is taken on the possession and usefulness, or otherwise, of nuclear weapons, there can be no escape from the central deal at the heart of the NPT. The non-weapon states will allow the five nuclear states to possess their weapons on the basis of article VI, which demands the cessation of the arms race at an early date, and of a treaty on general and complete disarmament. Alongside that central issue are the security concerns, legitimate or otherwise, real or imagined, of those who possess or aspire to possess nuclear weapons; allusion has already been made to Iran. Equally, the nuclear weapon states themselves and others have a common interest in enhancing the verification procedures in order to ensure that non-state actors, as the jargon has them&mdash;international terrorists, as we might fear them&mdash;do not gain access to the technology and capability. The existence of AQ Khan's network suggests that we might be a bit off the pace, and real progress is needed on all sides at the conference to help us all catch up.</p>
	<p pid=".414.1/8">I hope that the Minister will tell us what he believes are the main features on the agenda at the conference. There is no doubt that we need to see some progress on the CTBT. We also need to see whether there is any prospect of a fissile material cut-off treaty. The welcome nuclear arms reductions of the early 1990s have been mentioned, and we need to ensure that they continue. We must also recognise that the anti-proliferation efforts of the United States and others will gain enhanced credibility if those countries are seen to participate in the whole nuclear disarmament process and not just in the bits that concern them most.</p>

	<p pid=".416.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman would not mind, I would like to conclude my comments.</p>
	<p pid=".416.1/2">Alongside those issues, some serious institutional matters must be addressed; we see them day in, day out in the international press. The most important point, however, is surely that the political will exists to ensure that the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency and others are not undermined.</p>
	<p pid=".416.1/3">I have always believed in multilateral nuclear disarmament and I retain that view very strongly. My concern is growing, however, that the process is stalled. Without further progress on disarmament, we shall not only fail to achieve the ultimate objective of a nuclear-free world, but increase the risks of proliferation and fail to equip ourselves to verify the state of nuclear capabilities throughout the world. As a nuclear weapons state, this country bears a particular responsibility and must take a lead at the conference in re-establishing some momentum in the disarmament process. The stakes have rarely been higher.</p>

	<p pid=".419.0/1">I welcome the debate, and thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/819" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> for initiating it. As others have said, he has a long and distinguished record of interest in this most important issue. We have seen a number of familiar faces today, and heard a number of familiar arguments, but they are no less interesting for having been heard before. As my hon. Friend said, these arguments are fundamental to the future of the human race, and it is right that we should be debating this subject.</p>
	<p pid=".419.0/2">I believe that we have a good story to tell, as I think hon. Members on both sides have acknowledged. I shall try to set out a bit of it in a moment, but my hon. Friend asked one or two questions, so I shall try to deal quickly with those first. He asked about our policy towards Iran. It is well known that our policy is to continue engagement, along with two European Union Foreign Minister colleagues. In fairness, President Bush has said that he supports this approach.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-08.420.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1127" speakername="Chris Mullin" colnum="420"  time="015:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050308/halltext/50308h03.htm#50308h03_spnew27">
	<p pid=".420.1/1">My hon. Friend asked about our plans for replacing Trident. As I am sure he knows, no decision has yet been taken, but we are keeping our options open. A decision will need to be taken during the next Parliament. He asked what is going on at Aldermaston and whether it is consistent with the NPT. My advice is that what is happening is consistent with the treaty and that the modernisation of facilities at Aldermaston and the decommissioning of those no longer required, of which we have made no secret, is an ongoing programme of work to meet safety, regulatory and operational requirements. Were there to be significant developments, we would, of course, inform Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1224" name="Mark Simmonds">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mr. Simmonds)</phrase> asked about the comprehensive test ban treaty and the position of the United States and China. I do not speak for the Governments of the US or China, but I am not aware of any change in their position. We believe that they should both ratify.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/3">The nuclear non-proliferation treaty is the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime. We remain fully committed to the treaty and we participate actively in the review process. The treaty is strong; it has the widest membership of any arms control treaty and retains the wholehearted support of the United Kingdom and the majority of the international community. We want universal membership, although that may not be achievable in the current circumstances. We are also committed to strengthening the treaty to face new challenges.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/4">Several hon. Members have asked what we want out of the review conference that will take place soon. The UK's main goal will be to emphasise the need for greater efforts in the non-proliferation and compliance parts of the treaty. Recent events have shown that a number of states continue to seek clandestine nuclear weapons programmes and also that individuals are willing to assist them in the proliferation of sensitive materials and technology. The treaty must therefore be strengthened and the political will generated to prevent such action.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/5">The treaty remains at the core of our nuclear counter-proliferation policy. It has proved successful in limiting the number of countries deciding to develop nuclear weapons. It provides the essential underpinning to maintain international cohesion when addressing the challenges posed by Iran and North Korea, as it did recently in respect of Libya's nuclear programmes. It also serves to strengthen the controls on the transfer of sensitive technology, without which progress in the International Atomic Energy Agency and other forums would become more difficult.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/6">During the review conference, we will outline the considerable progress that we had made on nuclear disarmament. It says in my briefing document that that was not often acknowledged, but the main Opposition party, the Liberal Democrats and Labour Members have acknowledged today that the UK's record on disarmament is good. The United Kingdom has made considerable progress on the 13 practical steps towards nuclear disarmament that were agreed at the previous review conference five years ago. For example, we are working on a programme to develop UK expertise in verifying the reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons internationally. It is a three-part exercise, which sets out the methodologies for the verification of nuclear disarmament.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/7">We will focus at the review conference on monitoring the nuclear warhead complex. We shall also summarise the range of technologies and approaches that have been researched during the five-year programme. The work will provide the basis for methodologies that could be used in a verification regime for a future disarmament treaty. We will publish a consolidated paper on that work at the conference. The United Kingdom remains fully committed to all aspects of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, including global and verifiable nuclear disarmament. We have a good record of fulfilling our NPT obligations on nuclear disarmament. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1119" name="Michael Moore">The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore)</phrase> spelt out some of the measures that we have taken, but I shall describe them in slightly more detail.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/8">We have withdrawn and dismantled the RAF's freefall bomb, so Trident is now our only nuclear weapons system. We dismantled the last Chevaline warhead in 2002. We have reduced our operationally available stockpile to fewer than 200 warheads, which is a reduction of more than 70 per cent. in the potential explosive power of our nuclear forces since the end of the cold war. We have reduced the readiness of our nuclear forces: only one Trident submarine is now on deterrent patrol; it carries 48 warheads. The submarine on patrol is usually on several days' notice to fire and its missiles are detargeted.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/9">We have signed and ratified the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and continue to promote its early entry into force. We have placed fissile material no longer required for defence purposes under international safeguards. All enrichment and reprocessing facilities in the United Kingdom are now liable to international inspection. We have continued to press for negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. Indeed, we announced in 1995 that we had stopped the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/10">We have been more transparent about our stockpiles of nuclear and fissile materials, and have begun a national historical accounting study for fissile material produced. We have signed and ratified the relevant protocols of both the treaty of Rarotonga, which is the south Pacific nuclear weapons-free zone, and the treaty of Pelindaba, the African nuclear weapon-free zone. We are also engaged in negotiations on nuclear weapon-free zones in central Asia and south-east Asia.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/11">The Government's policy on nuclear weapons remains as set out in the 1998 strategic defence review and the 2003 defenceWhite Paper. We are committed to working towards a safer world in which there is no requirement for nuclear weapons. We continue to play a full role in international efforts to strengthen arms control and prevent proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. However, the continuing risk from the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the certainty that a number of other countries will retain substantial nuclear arsenals means that our minimum nuclear deterrent capability, currently represented by Trident, is likely to remain a necessary element of our security for the foreseeable future. We continue to support multilateral negotiations towards mutual balanced and verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons worldwide. When we are satisfied that sufficient progress has been made to allow us to include British nuclear weapons in any negotiations without endangering our security interests, we shall do so.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/12">It has been suggested that the non-signatory status of India, Pakistan and Israel fundamentally undermines the non-proliferation treaty. Those countries are not subject to all international non-proliferation norms. As has already been suggested, such a lack of control might, in the case of Pakistan, have contributed to the serious case of proliferation of nuclear technology through the A. Q. Khan network.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/13">The UK continues to call on all non-signatory states to become signatories to the NPT, as non-nuclear weapon states. We are additionally pressing them to sign up to other agreements that control nuclear proliferation. We want them to join early negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty; we would like India and Pakistan to become party to the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, and Israel to ratify its accession to that treaty. We have been encouraging negotiations on a weapons of mass destruction-free zone in the middle east and look forward to the proposed conference on the issue in the near future.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/14">We live in an uncertain world. The non-proliferation treaty faces challenges from states such as Iran and North Korea. We believe that the global community needs to strengthen the treaty by ensuring full compliance by such states. For our part, the UK is continuing to work in collaboration with the international community to ensure that Iran operates within its obligations under the treaty. We have also worked with the United States to secure Libya's agreement to renounce its clandestine nuclear weapons programme. Both of those efforts demonstrate our clear commitment to strengthening the non-proliferation regime. As part of the work, we also want to see a strengthened International Atomic Energy Agency. We are committed to spending up to &pound;400 million over 10 years through the global partnership to help tackle the weapons legacy of the former Soviet Union. It is also intended that the work should be expanded to cover states such as Libya and Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".420.1/15">I hope that those efforts, and others that time does not permit me to enumerate, demonstrate our commitment to building a secure and peaceful world, free from nuclear weapons. We are working towards creating a future in which the UK is secure enough to be able to disarm completely.</p>

	<p pid=".424.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate on planning applications at Port Sunlight village. It presents an opportunity for me both to highlight the importance of the village to our heritage and to represent the concerns of residents, which I substantially share. This self-contained residential area is hugely significant, not only to the region, not even solely to the country as a whole but internationally, as I hope that a short history will help to illustrate.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/2">Port Sunlight was born of a most laudable combination of human qualities, which is often found in the throes of the industrial revolution&mdash;the entrepreneurial spirit and philanthropy. English Heritage has said that Port Sunlight is arguably the finest remaining example of the so-called workers' village and a forerunner to the garden city movement. In common with Bourneville, the home of the Cadbury brothers' chocolate factory, and Saltaire, established by the wool baron Sit Titus Salt, Port Sunlight was founded in order to provide self-contained, clean, modern and sanitary accommodation for workers employed at the adjacent factory. William Hesketh Lever, born in 1851, expanded his father's already prosperous enterprise, before beginning to specialise in the marketing of soap in 1884. Business boomed and, to cater for demand, construction of new premises began in 1888. In the following two years, land was purchased to allow for 28 houses to be built.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/3">The architect of the initial round of construction was William Owen but, subsequently, a plethora of people lent themselves to design homes, which has resulted in the creation of the unique mix that we enjoy at Port Sunlight today. Uniquely, and in contrast to Bourneville, Lever and Owen married the philanthropic endeavour of improvement of the working class with the visual tradition of the sylvan suburb. By the turn of the century there were 400 houses, and the village continued to expand; today, there are nearly 1,000 dwellings. Port Sunlight possesses a character which it has preserved well; my constituency, the community and the country are richer for it.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/4">A rich tapestry of features contribute to making Port Sunlight what it is. The Lady Lever art gallery contains one of the most beautiful collections of fine and decorative arts in the country, and the recently refurbished Gladstone theatre is a gem. They are but two such institutions, and they are not merely minor curiosities&mdash;they are part of our cultural heritage. The importance of Port Sunlight was recently recognised, when a project of &pound;1 million, to construct a heritage centre befitting its status, received funding partly from the Heritage Lottery Fund and partly from the European Union objective 1 programme for Merseyside.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/5">Port Sunlight is also a living place, with a pub, a school, a church, a bowling green, and, until recently, a post office&mdash;the Post Office, with a shortage of sensitivity, recently announced it closure. In addition, there have been places of work in the village&mdash;a garden centre, offices, and a gardeners' compound. The village also has its own railway station. It needs to be a living and working place, not a &quot;Disneyfied&quot; dormitory.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/6">However, there is a problem. After Unilever&mdash;as the company became&mdash;set up a new company to manage the village at arm's length in the 1960s, a process began that eventually led to housing being sold, either to residents whose tenancies had expired, or on the open market. In 1999, management of the village passed to an independent charitable organisation established for the purpose, the Port Sunlight village trust. Its declared responsibilities include to preserve</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/7" class="indent">&quot;and maintain the Port Sunlight Conservation Area . . . in Merseyside for the benefit of the nation at large, the present character and amenities of that area and whatever of the historical, architectural and constructional heritage may exist in the Port Sunlight Conservation Area aforesaid whether in the form of buildings . . . open spaces or otherwise which are of particular beauty or historical, architectural or constructional interest.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/8">I regret that the proposals made jointly by the trust and Miller Homes, which I will outline shortly, threatened those terms of reference and the character of the village. The trust appears by omission tacitly to admit that the plans do not fit with the mission statement I have quoted, by referring to it as setting out what</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/9" class="indent">&quot;the trust may do and does not in any way determine what the Trust must do.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/10">It is not the fact of the proposed developments per se that cause me and many of my constituents concern, although by their nature plans for development in conservation areas with listed status such as Port Sunlight should be treated with the utmost caution. Any development, no matter how it fits in with existing designs, can alter a village&mdash;in this case a village of 1,000 dwellings already&mdash;if it is of sufficient scale.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/11">New homes have been constructed in the past decade or so, but have not presented a particular problem. However, they were designed in the traditional arts and craft style and blend in with the village as it stands. Rather, it is the background to the trust's insistence on recent proposals that requires close attention, for the justification is claimed, substantially, to be financial.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/12">The village trust says that the planning permission that it seeks is essential to its needs if it is to comply with the covenant established with the trust's inception. The trust says that, for various reasons, it needs to develop and raise money by selling new properties for capital and by building properties to rent. Accordingly, the trust and Miller Homes submitted six applications, which could have provided 296 new dwellings, apparently on the questionable basis that if enough applications were submitted for enough dwellings, at least some would get through. By themselves, 296 dwellings would change Port Sunlight village, whatever their design.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/13">From that swathe of applications made to the Wirral borough council planning department, for dwellings of varying design and location, two were accepted on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-11">11 January 2005</phrase>. Just for the record, they are for 21 apartments on Water street and 62 apartments on Wharf street. The two approved applications may involve the least offensive of the designs proposed and at least one is in the arts and crafts style, but the development of 62 apartments raises the greatest concern, because those apartments represent a deviation from the character of the village.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/14">The trust's financial predicament, which is claimed to be the cause of the development, has two elements. First, prior to the establishment of the trust a financial audit was undertaken with a view to making the trust self-sufficient in building and public space upkeep, with the aid of an annual income provided by Unilever as part of a &pound;25 million settlement with which the trust was established. Even now, Unilever does not accept that that dowry was insufficient for the purpose. Moreover, it was for the trustees who first joined the trust to establish that it was adequate&mdash;including, in my view, by showing due diligence in relation to it. In the light of further studies conducted after the trust's inception&mdash;and, effectively, by the trust itself&mdash;that sum was claimed to be insufficient to cover the costs of maintaining and refurbishing the complex.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/15">Secondly, the trust's finances were hit by losses suffered as a result of the stock market downturn in 2000. That the stock market has declined is beyond question, but it seems to me that what goes down must eventually come up. In any event, although consistently prayed in aid of what is proposed, finances should not be a material issue in such planning matters. Before any account is taken of the finances, I would need to be satisfied that the trustees had done all that they could through, for example, benchmarking with other model villages and learning from them, responsible tourism, exploiting the grants regime and so on. After all, Merseyside is an objective 1 area.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/16">Many other aspects of the consideration of the applications were questionable, not least the consultation with residents. The problem is that, although only two applications were approved, they were particularly open to debate. For the residents, it appeared that the council may have been acting against its own planning guidance, which states that local planning authorities should reject poor design where decisions are supported by clear planning policies, and that</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/17" class="indent">&quot;special regard should be had for such matters as scale, height, form, massing&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/18">in respect of</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/19" class="indent">&quot;the traditional pattern/frontages . . . and detailed design.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/20">Furthermore, it was felt that the consultation with the residents was somewhat unsatisfactory and not in the spirit of the code of conduct. Some of the residents' objections, for example, were not included in reports submitted for consideration by the planning committee.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/21">The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment has lodged objections to the designs themselves. Although the guidelines were not ignored, I cannot say without compunction that the designs are in keeping with the character of the village. Some of the proposed apartments would be three storeys high, but adjacent to two-storey existing buildings. The materials to be used would not be wholly sympathetic to the surrounding buildings. Moreover, there would be a high density of apartments, which would be at odds with William Lever's leafy suburban vision. The problem seems to be that the designs are confused; they are neither one thing nor the other.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/22">As part of the planning committee's consultation, CABE submitted the following comment:</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/23" class="indent">&quot;The footprint of the . . . proposal for Wharf street that has been implemented is extremely large and is completely out of character with the other buildings in Port Sunlight . . . CABE do not think any&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/24">I emphasise the word &quot;any&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/25" class="indent">&quot;of the schemes are of a high enough quality to receive planning permission.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/26">However, two did.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/27">When the applications were approved, the trust expressed its disappointment that the remainder were rejected. It said:</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/28" class="indent">&quot;We will have to go away and come up with some other plans about how we take things forward&mdash;whether that be appealing some of the decisions that haven't gone in our favour or coming up with alternative developments&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/29">The chairman of the planning committee said:</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/30" class="indent">&quot;The concept of conservation means to some that nothing ever changes. Others say that if anything does happen it must take on the spirit and flavour of the original architecture and form of an area. I hold the second opinion. I believe that so long as things are handled properly change and improvement can be achieved.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/31">I do not dissent from that, but the problem is that one wholly inappropriate design was recommended by the planners for approval. The very body entrusted with the protection of the village is now casting itself as a developer. Is the village properly protected in such circumstances?</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/32">As I said, the final word may not have been spoken. Decisions were taken on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-11">11 January</phrase>, but more will be sought. It is commonplace for developers who have had applications turned down to appeal, unlike protestors against proposals, who get no appeal. Developers can appeal ad infinitum, but I hope that they will be more responsible and that there will be pause for thought.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/33">Before any further steps are taken or any proposals are made, I ask that certain items are considered. First, full account should be taken of those for whom the development will form part of the fabric of their lives. I pay tribute to the Port Sunlight Conservation and Residents Society and its campaign group Save Port Sunlight, which have attempted to limit inappropriate development. Those involved have organised, deliberated, written letters and collected 2,200 signatures for a petition. None of those efforts should be underestimated, but it saddens me that they became necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/34">I am afraid that there seems to have been a lack of constructive dialogue between the residents on the one hand and the trust and Miller Homes on the other. I hope that that will be put right, because dialogue is essential. It should not be merely cosmetic, because, in the long run, no one will benefit, and there will only be losers. The refusal by the trust and, to some extent, Miller Homes to engage seriously undermined the consultation process. What consultation there was with residents consisted of a four-hour presentation in a pub. Now, four hours is a long time, but the residents felt that they were being talked at, not listened to. The trust and Miller Homes were either unable or unwilling to answer many of the questions put to them. If residents had approached the issue with the mind of a saboteur, I could understand the trust's reticence, but that was not the case.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/35">The second point that I would like the Minister to consider is that there needs to be a master plan before any planning decisions are taken. As part of Liverpool's capital of culture year in 2008, Port Sunlight is, rightly, being promoted as a major attraction. Visitors will come from all over the United Kingdom and around the world. They will all congregate on Merseyside, and many will come to Port Sunlight. With the capital of culture year, we on Merseyside have only one crack of the whip. The trust has cited long overdue maintenance and repairs that need to be carried out in advance of that as its overriding concern. Thus, there is a motivating factor for the cash-raising developments. It is right in so far as it recognises that work is needed and overdue. However, it is my belief and that of residents and other interested parties that not enough has been done to exploit other potential sources of funding.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/36">There should have been a greater focus&mdash;admittedly limited by inadequate heritage centre facilities&mdash;on attracting tourists and exploiting the tourist stay. The new visitor centre will help in that enterprise, but there are other initiatives to be taken. Some buildings may have lain idle for want of a realistic rental price being sought.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/37">Thirdly, a proposal for a conference on the future of Port Sunlight, put forward by English Heritage, is coming to fruition. It will bring together representatives from model villages across the UK in order to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, as well as for the development of best practice in respect of long-term management. That is well overdue and much to be praised.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/38">In addition, English Heritage has offered to provide advice and, possibly, financial assistance to help the trust come up with a sustainable vision for long-term upkeep of the village. That is to be welcomed. I am delighted to have been asked to chair the conference, which will take place at Port Sunlight&mdash;hopefully, in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/39">Fourthly, English Heritage will be producing an authoritative book on Port Sunlight in its Informed Conservation series and I hope that that will act as a reference point for any future steps that might be taken in the village.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/40">Fifthly, we need to take account of the potential for world heritage site status. If Saltaire and New Lanark can qualify, some would say, surely Port Sunlight could qualify&mdash;perhaps even more so. Lord McIntosh of Haringey, the Minister for Media and Heritage, has told me that the earliest that it could be included on a tentative list for nominations is 2006. We therefore have an opportunity to help Port Sunlight to get the best possible chance of being judged a site of &quot;outstanding universal value&quot;, which I think it is, as is required by the criteria for eligibility. I hope that when we move forward with that, we can get more support than we have had in the past from Wirral metropolitan borough council.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/41">Sixthly, and finally&mdash;you will be glad to learn, Mr. Deputy Speaker&mdash;I urge Unilever to use its good offices to ensure that any future development that is necessary at Port Sunlight is responsible. Not only does Unilever still have a vibrant factory as part of the Port Sunlight site&mdash;as a consequence, it objected to the proposals that were put before the planning committee&mdash;but that vast international company has, after all, Port Sunlight as its birthplace. It is a key&mdash;possibly the key&mdash;element of the Lever heritage. Unilever has a vested interest in the success of the village and I hope that it will do all that it can to stress that.</p>
	<p pid=".424.1/42">Let us hope that on the basis that I have outlined, all the parties concerned will reflect long and hard before making any further proposals for development at Port Sunlight.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-08.437.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1339" speakername="Anthony D Wright" colnum="437"  time="016:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050308/halltext/50308h05.htm#50308h05_spnew3">
	<p pid=".437.2/1">Yes. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I shall be brief because I respect the fact that this is the debate of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1032" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase>; I simply want to make a few pertinent points. The hon. Gentleman has made all his points admirably and I agree with many of them.</p>
	<p pid=".437.2/2">As far as the coastline is concerned, my responsibility for my constituents is from Winterton down to Hopton. Some issues affecting that area may be different to those raised by the hon. Gentleman, but I want to raise one or two relevant issues with the Minister, some of which have been touched on by the hon. Gentleman. The first such issue has been raised by my constituents. Responsibility for different parts of the coastline falls to different agencies. In one area in Winterton, it is probable that Great Yarmouth district council is responsible for one part and the Environment Agency for another. We should consider making one agency responsible for the whole coastline.</p>
	<p pid=".437.2/3">Property blight, on which the hon. Gentleman touched, will probably affect many areas along the coastline. There is also the issue of planning blight. Most planning legislation looks only 20 years ahead. Development is already under way in areas that could be lost. What should we tell people when issuing land searches?</p>
	<p pid=".437.2/4">Important wildlife habitats could be under threat should the shoreline management plan go ahead. We have limited or no resources to fund coastal defence work through the borough council strategy. New sea walls would cost around &pound;10,000 a metre; one groyne would cost around &pound;30,000. Are more resources available? Is there a relationship with offshore dredging? The report says conclusively that there is no scientific evidence; I call again for the immediate cessation of at least the export of aggregates, which would reduce the need for dredging by 40 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".437.2/5">The SMPs were prepared using guidance and methodology provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Perhaps that is why issues such as social justice are not considered. In nature's terms, the coastline is totally interrelated; what is taken from one part must affect another. If North Norfolk district council invests in defences and we further south do not, the coastline lower down will suffer accelerated erosion.</p>
	<p pid=".437.2/6">Will the Minister consider our proposal for an underwriting scheme under which the Government may pay the market value for properties that are lost? That would enable them to withdraw from sea defence expenditure in certain areas without punishing those who live in affected areas. Will they take control of all coastal protection issues in order to give consistency, put resources in place and deal with defence?</p>
	<p pid=".437.2/7">I shall end now as I realise that the hon. Member for North Norfolk needs to receive a response. I simply wanted to put my points forward as the MP for a constituency with a substantial amount of coastline.</p>
