<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-27a.77.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="77"  time="009:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070627/halltext/70627h0002.htm#07062779000462">
	<p pid="a.77.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1475" name="Shailesh Vara">the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara)</phrase> on securing the debate. For once, I find myself in total agreement with what he says. It is a unique occasion. I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase>, because I agree with him, as I have on other occasions. I also agree with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" name="Louise Ellman">my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)</phrase> said.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/2">I have the honour of representing the constituency with the largest Jewish population of any in the country, and the matter is of great concern to them. The fat file in front of me contains just some of the correspondence that I have received on the issue from my constituents. Indeed, it was one of the first issues that was raised with me after I was elected. I see from my file that within weeks of the 1997 election I was receiving correspondence on the matter and took it up with the late Derek Fatchett, who was the Minister responsible in the summer of 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/3">As far as I can see, the Government have engaged with the issue from the very beginning. Derek Fatchett told me that he had participated in a link-up with members of the Knesset on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-20">20 May</phrase> to mark Ron Arad's 40th birthday and raised the issue on his visit to Damascus on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-28">28 May</phrase>, within a month of the 1997 election. It is important to recognise that while the debate has focused on the recent hostages, some people have been missing for well over 20 years with no information about their fate. Derek Fatchett wrote to me in February 1998 to say that he had met the families of some of those people when he visited Israel a few weeks earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/4">On the first day after the 2001 election I tabled parliamentary questions on the matter. By then, of course, we were trying to track down information on other hostages. In March 2002 we had a debate on the 500th day that Elchanan Tenenboim had been held by Hezbollah, and we should not forget his name or what happened to him and the others kidnapped at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/5">So it went on. Throughout the years we have had debates and parliamentary questions on the issue. I have raised it with a succession of Ministers: the late Derek Fatchett, as I have mentioned; Brian Wilson, when he was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the Minister responsible; my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" name="Mike O'Brien">my hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, and of course I and many others have raised it with the present incumbent. When President Bashar al-Assad visited the UK soon after he took office, it was raised with him by the Government. Unfortunately, that has all been to no avail. As has been said, we have had no information to speak of about any of the people involved, going back well over 20 years. It is important to recognise that some kidnappings go way back, not just to Ron Arad but before. Zachary Baumel, Tzvi Feldman and Yehuda Katz have been missing since 1982, 25 years ago. So I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some comfort that pressure is being put on not just Hezbollah and Hamas, with whom we may have little influence, but on other Governments in the area, particularly Syria and Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/6">Mr. Gale, you will know from your own work on Cyprus how distressing it is for relatives simply not to know the fate of people who are missing. In Cyprus, the situation has gone on for longer and a greater number of people have been involved, but the pain of Israeli families is no less than that of those who suffered in Cyprus. Since I was elected 10 years ago, I have met various relatives and families on many occasions. Their pain does not lessen with the length of time that they have waited for news. In fact, if anything, it gets worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/7">What is absolutely cruel about the situation is the lack of information. It may well be that some of those who are missing&mdash;some for up to 25 years&mdash;are dead, but the relatives should at least be told that that is the case: give them closure. The lack of information is the worst part of all of this&mdash;the cruellest thing. Hezbollah knows what has happened to those people, and the Iranians probably know as well, yet they are using the lack of information about what has happened to loved ones as a weapon of terror, not against Israel, although the whole of Israel sympathises with the families, but against individual mothers, fathers and siblings. To focus the problems of the middle east on a small handful of people is utterly cruel, inhumane and wrong. If Hezbollah has a conscience&mdash;I very much doubt that it does&mdash;it ought to reflect on that fact.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/8">As has been said, Israel has a large number of Palestinians in detention for whatever reason, and we can argue about the rights and wrongs of that, but at least the prisoners' relatives know what has happened to them. They know that they are safe, and that they are being looked after and fed. The relatives are not subject to a lack of information about what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/9">There is no doubt that this is hostage taking&mdash;there is no question about that. Hostage taking is a feature of modern conflict, but this is hostage taking of the worst kind. Alan Johnston is very much in the news. The BBC&mdash;quite rightly, as he is a BBC employee&mdash;nearly every day and certainly every week runs stories about the efforts being made by our Government, the BBC and non-governmental organisations to free him. We do not hear every day or every week about the fate of the missing Israeli service personnel. I suspect that our media have quietly forgotten about them, but they have not been forgotten in Israel or in my constituency, and they certainly have not been forgotten by their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/10">I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us what efforts we are making at least to get some news of what is happening to these individuals, even if we cannot secure their release, which obviously we would want to do. When I met the Prime Minister last autumn, he was optimistic that we might at least be able to make some progress in respect of Corporal Shalit. Unfortunately, those efforts seem to have run into the sand. Let us hope that now, after what has been happening in Gaza, we will see some progress in his case. I very much hope that intervention by other states such as Egypt will result in progress being made, but something must be done to give closure, comfort and hope to the families.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-27a.80.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" speakername="Nick Herbert" colnum="80"  time="010:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070627/halltext/70627h0002.htm#07062779000466">
	<p pid="a.80.0/1">I, too, join in paying tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1475" name="Shailesh Vara">my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara)</phrase> for securing this debate. We might have been expected to seek a debate to draw attention to the situation of Alan Johnston. Indeed, my hon. Friend took particular care to mention his abduction on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-12">12 March</phrase>&mdash;more than 100 days ago&mdash;by the Army of Islam, and an enormous amount of attention has rightly been focused on his continuing captivity. The video that we were subjected to two days ago was a particularly grotesque example of what other hon. Members have described as the cruelty of such abductions.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/2">There is a double crime in abducting a journalist. First, abducting anyone in this manner and holding them must be wrong, but to do that to the BBC's Gaza correspondent&mdash;a journalist who works for an organisation that is committed to reporting impartially the events in the middle east&mdash;challenges the essential importance of the freedom of the press, and severely undermines the Palestinian cause. It is not surprising that journalistic organisations from around the world have united in condemning the abduction and mistreatment of Mr. Johnston.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/3">This debate was called because the abductions of the three Israeli soldiers have not commanded the continuing attention in this country that the fate of Mr. Johnston has. That is partly because the time period has been longer. The three soldiers were abducted nearly a year ago&mdash;in fact, in Gilad Shalit's case, over a year ago. I joined my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire on a visit to Israel about a month ago and, like him, I met the parents of the abducted soldiers. I was struck by the fact that as time has moved on in this country the attention given to their plight has inevitably faded away. That is why it is so important that hon. Members discuss these issues and why I am particularly grateful to my hon. Friend for securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/4">It could be argued that soldiers are in a different position from journalists, who seek to report news impartially in a country, or from other civilians, and that they are legitimate casualties of conflict. I believe that that is entirely wrong and that abducting people in such a manner involves a special kind of cruelty. Throughout the history of conflict in the middle east there has been enormous loss of life and suffering on both sides&mdash;no one can deny that&mdash;but to remove soldiers or any individual in such a manner, not to inform their parents or relatives about what has happened to them, and to hold the families in a state where they simply do not know whether their sons are alive or dead, involves a special kind of cruelty. Indeed, in a sense, it is a form of torture.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/5">It was immensely moving to meet the parents involved and to be reminded that the parents of two of these young men still do not know whether they are alive or dead. We now have information about the fate of Gilad Shalit and know that he is alive, but we should remind ourselves that this young man is only 20 years old. The anguish of those parents was particularly difficult to confront.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-27a.83.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" speakername="Mark Hunter" colnum="83"  time="010:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070627/halltext/70627h0002.htm#07062779000473">
	<p pid="a.83.3/1">Of course I do. The debate is specifically about the three Israeli soldiers, as the Order Paper shows clearly. Although I think that it is right, as I said, to refer to the situation affecting the BBC correspondent Alan Johnston, I am certainly not planning in the short time that I have available to concentrate more on that than on the subject raised by the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire&mdash;that of the Israeli soldiers. However, of course I accept that difference, and I think that I have explained the context in which I made my earlier point.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/2">I want to mention the Egyptians. The Egyptian Government have been working to negotiate the release of Corporal Shalit and in late October of last year the Popular Resistance Committee announced that an agreement for prisoner exchange had been reached, under which Palestinian prisoners held in Israel, including women and children, will be released in stages, and Israeli soldiers handed over to the Egyptians. In fact, in December, Egypt's President Mubarak declared that a deal was in its final stages. Reports now state that the names of specific prisoners to be swapped are yet to be finalised. I should be grateful if the Minister would inform the Chamber on how those Egyptian-led negotiations are progressing and perhaps on what the UK Government are doing to facilitate those negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/3">Not surprisingly, there is considerable debate about the current situation in the Gaza strip and the resulting increased levels of tension, which make the ongoing negotiations for prisoner exchange even more difficult than they might have been. I ask also that the Minister gives us his Department's up-to-date assessment of how the current situation in the Gaza strip affects the chances of Corporal Shalit being released in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/4">In answer to a parliamentary question from Lord Turnberg in March of this year, Lord Triesman mentioned an unnamed facilitator working with all parties to secure the release of the two Israeli soldiers being held by Hezbollah. That facilitator was mentioned also in the UN Secretary-General's report on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 in March 2007. I should be grateful if the Minister would advise the Chamber on what, if any, progress the facilitator has made and on what the UK Government are doing to help.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/5">The report on Security Council resolution 1701 stated also that Hezbollah were not only stalling the release of prisoners but placing</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/6" class="indent">&quot;prohibitive demands for proof that the two Israeli soldiers were still alive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/7">In December 2006, <i>The Independent </i>reported that at least one of the Israeli soldiers had been injured during the cross-border attack on <phrase class="date" code="">12 July</phrase>, but Hezbollah have refused to allow access to the International Committee of the Red Cross or to the UN facilitator. It seems to me that the refusal of that basic humanitarian act by Hezbollah stands in marked contrast to the stance of Israel, which has allowed the Red Cross access to Lebanese citizens captured by the Israeli defence force and authorised that prisoners be allowed to write to their families. As other hon. Members have said, that makes a significant difference to the treatment of the respective captives. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell the Chamber whether any negotiations are taking place to encourage Hezbollah to allow the UN facilitator and the Red Cross access to the imprisoned Israeli soldiers, and whether he can report on any progress in those negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/8">In addition to calling for the release of the captive soldiers, Security Council resolution 1701 calls for the disarming of militant groups such as Hezbollah. I understand that the stand-off in the refugee camp of Nahr El Bared between the Lebanese Government and the Fatah rebels continues. Although we respect the work of the Lebanese Government and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon to disarm militias, we of course join international aid agencies in calling for a temporary ceasefire so that civilians and those who are wounded can be evacuated from the camp.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/9">With regard to the disarming of militias, the UN Secretary-General, in the report on resolution 1701, stated that he is still waiting for the Lebanese Government to define a political process by which Hezbollah and other militias should be disarmed. Perhaps the Minister would inform us whether, during recent discussions with the Lebanese Government, that issue was raised, and whether they are close to creating such a political process. Will he also give us his assessment of how the disarming of militias in Lebanon is progressing?</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/10">The Minister for Trade, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase>, in answer to a question on <phrase class="date" code="">5 July</phrase> last year, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/11" class="indent">&quot;Israel has the right to take steps to secure the release of Corporal Shalit. Any military steps taken should avoid civilian casualties, abide by international law and observe the principle of proportionality.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July 2006</phrase>; Vol. 448,c. 1152W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/12">However, for many Members on both sides of the House, it is a matter of great regret that, during the Israeli bombing of Lebanon last summer, the Government refused to join other European countries in calling for a ceasefire. In the light of the tragic loss of life and property that ensued, does the Minister still believe that military action was an appropriate step to take last summer? Does he agree that any attempts to free Israeli soldiers now should be made through wholly diplomatic and peaceful means, not through the use of force?</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/13">I sincerely hope that all three Israeli soldiers return safely in the near future and that the militant groups that abducted them are disbanded. The Government need to ensure that, through the UN and the EU, we play an active role in encouraging engagement between Israel and Palestine, because unless they continue talking, a peace settlement will be impossible. I look forward to the Minister's reassurance that the Government will continue to do all that they can to secure the release of those prisoners and to work for a lasting peace in the middle east.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.0/1">I am grateful to have caught your eye in this important debate, Mr. Gale. I pay great tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1475" name="Shailesh Vara">my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara)</phrase> for securing it and giving us the benefit of the first-hand knowledge that he and a number of my other hon. Friends have acquired from recent visits to Israel. In particular, they were able to meet and have discussions with the families of two of the kidnap victims and they have described poignantly the extreme anguish and hurt that their families are suffering. We urge all those close to Hezbollah and Hamas, which may be holding the three hostages and, indeed, Alan Johnston, to release them as quickly as possible. Many hon. Members have said that what is needed is at least some news of those four victims. It would provide huge reassurance if their families could be told that they are alive and well and being treated well. That would be a great step forward, and I urge all those holding them to do just that.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/2">I am filling in for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase>, who, sadly, cannot be here today, although he normally deals with middle eastern affairs for the Opposition. The situation that we are discussing is particularly complicated, and this debate has been wholly constructive and almost completely unpartisan. The work of the House is often not viewed in that positive spirit.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/3">We have repeatedly called for the release of the four hostages. I welcome the Minister's statement in a press release of <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June</phrase>, remembering Gilad Shalit's captivity. I join him when he states:</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Today marks one year since Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was captured by Palestinian militants. Likewise, the fate of Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, captured from Israel by Hizballah on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-12">12 July 2006</phrase>, remains unknown. Our thoughts are with these men's families, as they continue to deal with the daily uncertainty over the fate of their loved ones. We also condemn the release of today's audio tape of Gilad Shalit which can only add to the anguish of his family.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/5" class="indent">We call for the immediate, unconditional and safe release of all three men. Violence only serves to further increase the tension and frustrate efforts to find lasting peace.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/6">We would all totally agree with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> rightly said that kidnapping is beyond all the norms of international behaviour&mdash;all the norms that we would expect of a civilised society and under international law. We ourselves have taken prisoners in war situations, but we always treated them in accordance with the Geneva convention, and I urge all parties holding these people to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/8">We deeply regret the recent attack on UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, which killed six Spanish and Colombian soldiers. The attack underlines the difficulty and danger of the work undertaken by UNIFIL&mdash;the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. We must do everything that we can to ensure that Lebanon remains as stable as possible. We call on all parties to abide by UN Security Council resolution 1701, which, among other things, refers to</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/9" class="indent">&quot;the need to address urgently the causes that have given rise to the current crisis, including by the unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/10">That refers to Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. We must give every possible encouragement to the Siniora Government to try to ensure that Lebanon remains as stable as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/11">In relation to all four cases, the Opposition urge the Government&mdash;perhaps the Minister is prepared to say something about this today&mdash;to keep all channels of communication open to all the parties. Those channels may be official or unofficial. We always did that in Northern Ireland and it produced results. Will the Minister say something about that? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1854" name="Richard Spring">My hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring)</phrase> made the particularly important point that Turkey has a role to play. Indeed, any other countries that may be interlocutors should also be involved in the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/12">Hezbollah appears to have increased its activity recently, particularly after the soldiers were kidnapped. We have seen the disturbing rise of Islamic militantism in Lebanon in the form of the Fatah al-Islam group. What efforts has the Minister made, along with colleagues in government and our American allies and EU partners, to secure the release of Israeli soldiers held captive by Hezbollah, and for the full implementation of resolution 1701? In particular, what impact have UK efforts to rebuild Lebanese security forces had on their capability to keep order in that country, enforce resolution 1701 and uphold the authority of the Lebanese Government?</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/13">There are disturbing reports that Hezbollah is succeeding in rearming by way of shipments from Iran over Syrian territory. That is in direct contravention of resolution 1701, which both Iran and Syria signed. What is the Government's latest assessment of Hezbollah's military capability and what action is being taken to secure Lebanon's border with Syria? What progress has been made in Government efforts, beginning with the visit by the Prime Minister's envoy to Syria last year, to persuade the Syrian Government to clamp down on such activity? Will the British Government make further contact at a high level with the Syrian authorities? What representations has the Minister made to our EU partners about the kidnapped soldiers and what action is the EU taking to secure their release?</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/14">The Opposition's view is that, to achieve real results and the release of the kidnap victims, we should open up all channels. I have asked the Minister a complex series of questions in that respect. We should also, as part of our complex relationship with Iran, bring pressure to bear on Iranian financial support for Hamas, which was estimated last year at a staggering $250 million. Indeed, former Hamas Foreign Minister Mahmoud Zahar was quoted telling a German news magazine that he had personally carried $42 million in cash from Iran across the Gaza-Egypt border&mdash;thereby increasing the instability in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/15">The Opposition support the Government's efforts to ensure that the Sharm el Sheikh summit this week involving Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Mahmoud Abbas and leaders from the Palestinian Authority brings about a further settlement and, in particular, the release of the kidnap victims. What action have the Government taken to prevent further divisions between the differing groups in the Palestinian Authority?</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/16">The Opposition warmly welcome&mdash;if it is to happen&mdash;the Prime Minister's appointment as an envoy to try to bring about further stability in the middle east. That is obviously critical. If the appointment comes about, we wish him well.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/17">This debate has been very constructive. I hope that, in the very, very near future, the kidnap victims will be released. The Opposition call wholeheartedly for all those who have information that could in any way lead to their release to come forward and act now with the authorities to secure their release and stop the ongoing anguish of the families.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-27a.126.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1698" speakername="Margaret Moran" colnum="126"  time="016:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070627/halltext/70627h0009.htm#07062779000538">
	<p pid="a.126.1/1">We are here at a transformational moment in history. I am of course referring to the fact that the debate is an extreme rarity in the House&mdash;it is only the second debate on transformational government that I can remember from the past three or four years. There is, by the way, another little event going on elsewhere involving a new Prime Minister which, I guess, means that the assembled masses are elsewhere. I shall perfectly understand if the Minister has to respond to a pager message from No. 10, because he is extremely worthy of aggrandizement and I would not deny him a move up the greasy pole, but I hope that some of our Cabinet Office Ministers will remain in post for some time because one issue with transformational government is the need for continuous leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/2">The masses are not here for this debate on transformational government, because it is not a sexy subject but a techie, geeky subject. Far too often, the debate concerns IT and technology, rather than the real purpose of transformational government, which involves outcomes for people. That is what I want to focus on, because transformational government is about using IT as a tool to achieve the best outcomes in public service delivery for all our people, but particularly those who need public services most. The issue is fundamental to all MPs, and we must get that message across.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/3">I know that the new Prime Minister is committed to this agenda. He commissioned David Varney's report, and I am sure that he will implement it with all speed when he gets his feet under the desk at No. 10. I want to speculate beyond Varney, and on where the transformational government agenda should go next. I am chair of EURIM&mdash;the European Informatics Market&mdash;which you know well, Mr. Gale, as one of its founder members and a great supporter. We are doing a Select-Committee-style inquiry into transformational government, which is a subject that crosses Departments and sometimes falls between the cracks of Select Committees. In my short contribution, I want to say a few words about some of the policy strands that need to be brought together, and which we will explore in that inquiry. I also want to ask the Minister some questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/4">Transformational government is about using technology to achieve the best outcomes for our communities, particularly those who need our public services most. It is an intensely political debate. People have told me that there is consensus on what transformational government is about, and there is to a degree. We all want our public services to provide greater value for money and greater efficiency, and we all want to ensure that we can use technology to free up resources for greater front-line working and to ensure more streamlined service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/5">However, I believe passionately that politics is about trying to ensure two things. First, those who need our services most should receive excellent quality public services. That is hard to provide in a joined-up way. Secondly, we should create confidence in our public services so that everyone has a buy-in to them. In the modern world, people expect 24/7 services from the private sector. They want services when they want them and where they want them. They expect efficiency, value for money and technology. Public services should deliver no less, and preferably greater excellence, so that there is a buy-in from the big tent&mdash;the middle classes&mdash;while enabling more resources to go to those who need them. I do not want to aggrandize the subject too much, but the agenda is about the future of public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/6">What issues should we address? First, there are a couple of myths and legends. Too much of the debate about transformational government focuses on failed Government IT projects. One can look at &quot;Government weekly&quot; every week and find a litany of disasters, but that is not the whole story. There are excellent examples of what works both in central Government&mdash;in the Department for Work and Pensions I cite pension credits&mdash;and in local government. A recent exhibition by EURIM and SOCITM&mdash;the Society of Information Technology Managers&mdash;exemplified some of the good work, particularly in local government, to join up service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/7">I heard from a carer who was over the moon that the help that her father received from social services and the national health service was linked seamlessly with help from carers with one point of contact, so that she did not have to run around. More important, her father did not have to run round to a number of agencies to receive the care and support that he needed. There are some good examples, but too often we hear about the failed examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/8">Let us be clear. There are failed examples in the private sector, and many of the largest and most complex IT projects are in the private sector. Some work extremely well&mdash;for example, Voca for financial services and BT for commission billing. Some projects are immensely complex, but we do not hear so much about the many private sector projects that fail.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/9">We must learn. Many EURIM reports and a recent Public Accounts Committee report picked up some of the lessons that we still have to learn after all this time. First, IT skills are scarce in the public sector, and we must nurture and retain them. There is concern in the private sector about the skills shortage in information and communications technology, which must be addressed urgently. Secondly, continuity at the top is required at both ministerial and senior civil service levels. Thirdly, we must look at projects involving incremental changes rather than a big, centralised bang. In that context&mdash;dare I say&mdash;are identity cards, although I support them, and we need clarity of outcome. Those are some of the lessons to be learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/10">In terms of where the agenda goes next, I want to suggest three strands that should be integrated if we want to transform&mdash;I emphasise &quot;transform&quot;&mdash;Government and public services. The first is social inclusion. All the strands fall neatly within the Cabinet Office's remit, which is a happy coincidence. If we are to transform, we must have social inclusion at the heart of everything that we are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/11">We have had processes, e-envoys, tsars and so on to look at life episodes and the equivalent of the moose licence&mdash;let us go online and do whatever is easiest, whether it is relevant or not. We must be more sophisticated, and look at services that need to be joined up, but which are complex and include the most difficult problems. I chair the all-party group on domestic violence, and a social enterprise within the equalities network that I am involved with is an online domestic violence project. In a crisis, a domestic violence survivor must contact between eight and 10 different agencies, which often give the same information over and over again. Survivors may have to cope with losing their home and the whole terrible situation while trying to care for their children. If we target such a complex problem rather than picking on the easiest subjects, and make the technology work for that person, everything else will follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/12">The digital divide or social exclusion in technology has been written and talked about for what feels like millennia. The issue is not lack of hardware&mdash;certainly not in my constituency. Hand-holding rather than hardware is needed. We proved that again in the womenspeak project with the Hansard Society and Women's Aid in 1999. We targeted the hardest to reach&mdash;domestic violence survivors. The first people online were Irish women travellers in the north-west of England and Bangladeshi mums in my constituency, neither of whom would normally go anywhere near public agencies or talk about their situation. They were online using technology, and the Bangladeshi mums are still using that technology to learn online. We were able to reach out. It was said that those people would never go online and never participate, but they did because they had support and we ensured that that was available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/13">We must target the hardest to reach and ensure that we have genuine joined-up service delivery for those with the most complex problems. Of course, we must get certain services online because we need to shift the easy services online. Forty per cent. of people now do their tax online, which is great because it releases resources for the front line and those most complex problems. Social inclusion is one strand.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/14">Diversity and choice in public service delivery is another policy imperative that we must discuss, involving appropriate service deliverers to meet the needs in the community. Social enterprise is another Cabinet Office priority. Do we have models that enable us to ensure that social enterprises can deliver those services? Are IT suppliers and projects geared to dealing with that mixed economy? That is a question to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/15">A third strand is democratic delivery. In any private sector company, people build up relationships&mdash;R2R&mdash;and get feedback on their services. That is basic. It should be integral to transformational government, and I believe that it is coming. However, we should do more than that if we want to build up public confidence, which means that we should involve people who use our services online not only in helping us to maintain the excellence of public service delivery, but in designing and having a say in those services.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/16">Again I quote Womenspeak, because in a legislative and parliamentary context, the evidence that we received undoubtedly helped to influence at least seven pieces of legislation, not least the domestic violence legislation itself. We could use it as a model to think about ways of engaging people in designing public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/17">I pose some of those questions to the Minister. Are we geared up to tackle the issues that I have raised? We still have issues about data sharing, largely because of ignorance about the Data Protection Act 1998. However, there are some good examples, so why do we not learn from them and spread them? There are in public service delivery too many nay-sayers who use the Act to prevent joined-up services.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/18">We must also consider ways in which we can ensure that when cost savings are delivered through IT projects, and the cost is attributed to one Department but the benefits are shared throughout several, we have models that enable us to evidence that situation, so that it can be built into the comprehensive spending review process. I understand that it does not happen now, but it will be fundamental if we are to join up service delivery and end departmental-itis.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/19">We must also have some resource&mdash;a small pot somewhere&mdash;to encourage innovation and democracy in public service delivery. I hoped that digital challenge would be part of that process; I was involved in the early discussion with the Institute for Public Policy Research. Sadly, however, it is not, as we hoped it would be, a pot for innovation, experimentation, learning and the rolling out of good practice. There is excellence in some of those areas, particularly at a community level. I hope that even if the Minister has a very brief life left in the Cabinet Office before he goes on to greater things, he will take some of those messages back with him.</p>
