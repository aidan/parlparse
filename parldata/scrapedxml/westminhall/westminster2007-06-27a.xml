<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-27a.83.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" speakername="Mark Hunter" colnum="83"  time="010:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070627/halltext/70627h0002.htm#07062779000473">
	<p pid="a.83.3/1">Of course I do. The debate is specifically about the three Israeli soldiers, as the Order Paper shows clearly. Although I think that it is right, as I said, to refer to the situation affecting the BBC correspondent Alan Johnston, I am certainly not planning in the short time that I have available to concentrate more on that than on the subject raised by the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire&mdash;that of the Israeli soldiers. However, of course I accept that difference, and I think that I have explained the context in which I made my earlier point.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/2">I want to mention the Egyptians. The Egyptian Government have been working to negotiate the release of Corporal Shalit and in late October of last year the Popular Resistance Committee announced that an agreement for prisoner exchange had been reached, under which Palestinian prisoners held in Israel, including women and children, will be released in stages, and Israeli soldiers handed over to the Egyptians. In fact, in December, Egypt's President Mubarak declared that a deal was in its final stages. Reports now state that the names of specific prisoners to be swapped are yet to be finalised. I should be grateful if the Minister would inform the Chamber on how those Egyptian-led negotiations are progressing and perhaps on what the UK Government are doing to facilitate those negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/3">Not surprisingly, there is considerable debate about the current situation in the Gaza strip and the resulting increased levels of tension, which make the ongoing negotiations for prisoner exchange even more difficult than they might have been. I ask also that the Minister gives us his Department's up-to-date assessment of how the current situation in the Gaza strip affects the chances of Corporal Shalit being released in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/4">In answer to a parliamentary question from Lord Turnberg in March of this year, Lord Triesman mentioned an unnamed facilitator working with all parties to secure the release of the two Israeli soldiers being held by Hezbollah. That facilitator was mentioned also in the UN Secretary-General's report on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 in March 2007. I should be grateful if the Minister would advise the Chamber on what, if any, progress the facilitator has made and on what the UK Government are doing to help.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/5">The report on Security Council resolution 1701 stated also that Hezbollah were not only stalling the release of prisoners but placing</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/6" class="indent">&quot;prohibitive demands for proof that the two Israeli soldiers were still alive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/7">In December 2006, <i>The Independent </i>reported that at least one of the Israeli soldiers had been injured during the cross-border attack on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-12">12 July</phrase>, but Hezbollah have refused to allow access to the International Committee of the Red Cross or to the UN facilitator. It seems to me that the refusal of that basic humanitarian act by Hezbollah stands in marked contrast to the stance of Israel, which has allowed the Red Cross access to Lebanese citizens captured by the Israeli defence force and authorised that prisoners be allowed to write to their families. As other hon. Members have said, that makes a significant difference to the treatment of the respective captives. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell the Chamber whether any negotiations are taking place to encourage Hezbollah to allow the UN facilitator and the Red Cross access to the imprisoned Israeli soldiers, and whether he can report on any progress in those negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/8">In addition to calling for the release of the captive soldiers, Security Council resolution 1701 calls for the disarming of militant groups such as Hezbollah. I understand that the stand-off in the refugee camp of Nahr El Bared between the Lebanese Government and the Fatah rebels continues. Although we respect the work of the Lebanese Government and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon to disarm militias, we of course join international aid agencies in calling for a temporary ceasefire so that civilians and those who are wounded can be evacuated from the camp.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/9">With regard to the disarming of militias, the UN Secretary-General, in the report on resolution 1701, stated that he is still waiting for the Lebanese Government to define a political process by which Hezbollah and other militias should be disarmed. Perhaps the Minister would inform us whether, during recent discussions with the Lebanese Government, that issue was raised, and whether they are close to creating such a political process. Will he also give us his assessment of how the disarming of militias in Lebanon is progressing?</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/10">The Minister for Trade, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase>, in answer to a question on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-05">5 July</phrase> last year, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/11" class="indent">&quot;Israel has the right to take steps to secure the release of Corporal Shalit. Any military steps taken should avoid civilian casualties, abide by international law and observe the principle of proportionality.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-07-05.1152"><i>Official Report</i>, 5 July 2006; Vol. 448,c. 1152W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/12">However, for many Members on both sides of the House, it is a matter of great regret that, during the Israeli bombing of Lebanon last summer, the Government refused to join other European countries in calling for a ceasefire. In the light of the tragic loss of life and property that ensued, does the Minister still believe that military action was an appropriate step to take last summer? Does he agree that any attempts to free Israeli soldiers now should be made through wholly diplomatic and peaceful means, not through the use of force?</p>
	<p pid="a.83.3/13">I sincerely hope that all three Israeli soldiers return safely in the near future and that the militant groups that abducted them are disbanded. The Government need to ensure that, through the UN and the EU, we play an active role in encouraging engagement between Israel and Palestine, because unless they continue talking, a peace settlement will be impossible. I look forward to the Minister's reassurance that the Government will continue to do all that they can to secure the release of those prisoners and to work for a lasting peace in the middle east.</p>

It would have been an obvious place to include. As a hub station, it could have relieved Clapham Junction and allowed people to move around the London overground more easily.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-27a.126.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1698" speakername="Margaret Moran" colnum="126"  time="016:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070627/halltext/70627h0009.htm#07062779000538">
	<p pid="a.126.1/1">We are here at a transformational moment in history. I am of course referring to the fact that the debate is an extreme rarity in the House&mdash;it is only the second debate on transformational government that I can remember from the past three or four years. There is, by the way, another little event going on elsewhere involving a new Prime Minister which, I guess, means that the assembled masses are elsewhere. I shall perfectly understand if the Minister has to respond to a pager message from No. 10, because he is extremely worthy of aggrandizement and I would not deny him a move up the greasy pole, but I hope that some of our Cabinet Office Ministers will remain in post for some time because one issue with transformational government is the need for continuous leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/2">The masses are not here for this debate on transformational government, because it is not a sexy subject but a techie, geeky subject. Far too often, the debate concerns IT and technology, rather than the real purpose of transformational government, which involves outcomes for people. That is what I want to focus on, because transformational government is about using IT as a tool to achieve the best outcomes in public service delivery for all our people, but particularly those who need public services most. The issue is fundamental to all MPs, and we must get that message across.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/3">I know that the new Prime Minister is committed to this agenda. He commissioned David Varney's report, and I am sure that he will implement it with all speed when he gets his feet under the desk at No. 10. I want to speculate beyond Varney, and on where the transformational government agenda should go next. I am chair of EURIM&mdash;the European Informatics Market&mdash;which you know well, Mr. Gale, as one of its founder members and a great supporter. We are doing a Select-Committee-style inquiry into transformational government, which is a subject that crosses Departments and sometimes falls between the cracks of Select Committees. In my short contribution, I want to say a few words about some of the policy strands that need to be brought together, and which we will explore in that inquiry. I also want to ask the Minister some questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/4">Transformational government is about using technology to achieve the best outcomes for our communities, particularly those who need our public services most. It is an intensely political debate. People have told me that there is consensus on what transformational government is about, and there is to a degree. We all want our public services to provide greater value for money and greater efficiency, and we all want to ensure that we can use technology to free up resources for greater front-line working and to ensure more streamlined service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/5">However, I believe passionately that politics is about trying to ensure two things. First, those who need our services most should receive excellent quality public services. That is hard to provide in a joined-up way. Secondly, we should create confidence in our public services so that everyone has a buy-in to them. In the modern world, people expect 24/7 services from the private sector. They want services when they want them and where they want them. They expect efficiency, value for money and technology. Public services should deliver no less, and preferably greater excellence, so that there is a buy-in from the big tent&mdash;the middle classes&mdash;while enabling more resources to go to those who need them. I do not want to aggrandize the subject too much, but the agenda is about the future of public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/6">What issues should we address? First, there are a couple of myths and legends. Too much of the debate about transformational government focuses on failed Government IT projects. One can look at &quot;Government weekly&quot; every week and find a litany of disasters, but that is not the whole story. There are excellent examples of what works both in central Government&mdash;in the Department for Work and Pensions I cite pension credits&mdash;and in local government. A recent exhibition by EURIM and SOCITM&mdash;the Society of Information Technology Managers&mdash;exemplified some of the good work, particularly in local government, to join up service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/7">I heard from a carer who was over the moon that the help that her father received from social services and the national health service was linked seamlessly with help from carers with one point of contact, so that she did not have to run around. More important, her father did not have to run round to a number of agencies to receive the care and support that he needed. There are some good examples, but too often we hear about the failed examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/8">Let us be clear. There are failed examples in the private sector, and many of the largest and most complex IT projects are in the private sector. Some work extremely well&mdash;for example, Voca for financial services and BT for commission billing. Some projects are immensely complex, but we do not hear so much about the many private sector projects that fail.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/9">We must learn. Many EURIM reports and a recent Public Accounts Committee report picked up some of the lessons that we still have to learn after all this time. First, IT skills are scarce in the public sector, and we must nurture and retain them. There is concern in the private sector about the skills shortage in information and communications technology, which must be addressed urgently. Secondly, continuity at the top is required at both ministerial and senior civil service levels. Thirdly, we must look at projects involving incremental changes rather than a big, centralised bang. In that context&mdash;dare I say&mdash;are identity cards, although I support them, and we need clarity of outcome. Those are some of the lessons to be learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/10">In terms of where the agenda goes next, I want to suggest three strands that should be integrated if we want to transform&mdash;I emphasise &quot;transform&quot;&mdash;Government and public services. The first is social inclusion. All the strands fall neatly within the Cabinet Office's remit, which is a happy coincidence. If we are to transform, we must have social inclusion at the heart of everything that we are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/11">We have had processes, e-envoys, tsars and so on to look at life episodes and the equivalent of the moose licence&mdash;let us go online and do whatever is easiest, whether it is relevant or not. We must be more sophisticated, and look at services that need to be joined up, but which are complex and include the most difficult problems. I chair the all-party group on domestic violence, and a social enterprise within the equalities network that I am involved with is an online domestic violence project. In a crisis, a domestic violence survivor must contact between eight and 10 different agencies, which often give the same information over and over again. Survivors may have to cope with losing their home and the whole terrible situation while trying to care for their children. If we target such a complex problem rather than picking on the easiest subjects, and make the technology work for that person, everything else will follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/12">The digital divide or social exclusion in technology has been written and talked about for what feels like millennia. The issue is not lack of hardware&mdash;certainly not in my constituency. Hand-holding rather than hardware is needed. We proved that again in the womenspeak project with the Hansard Society and Women's Aid in 1999. We targeted the hardest to reach&mdash;domestic violence survivors. The first people online were Irish women travellers in the north-west of England and Bangladeshi mums in my constituency, neither of whom would normally go anywhere near public agencies or talk about their situation. They were online using technology, and the Bangladeshi mums are still using that technology to learn online. We were able to reach out. It was said that those people would never go online and never participate, but they did because they had support and we ensured that that was available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/13">We must target the hardest to reach and ensure that we have genuine joined-up service delivery for those with the most complex problems. Of course, we must get certain services online because we need to shift the easy services online. Forty per cent. of people now do their tax online, which is great because it releases resources for the front line and those most complex problems. Social inclusion is one strand.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/14">Diversity and choice in public service delivery is another policy imperative that we must discuss, involving appropriate service deliverers to meet the needs in the community. Social enterprise is another Cabinet Office priority. Do we have models that enable us to ensure that social enterprises can deliver those services? Are IT suppliers and projects geared to dealing with that mixed economy? That is a question to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/15">A third strand is democratic delivery. In any private sector company, people build up relationships&mdash;R2R&mdash;and get feedback on their services. That is basic. It should be integral to transformational government, and I believe that it is coming. However, we should do more than that if we want to build up public confidence, which means that we should involve people who use our services online not only in helping us to maintain the excellence of public service delivery, but in designing and having a say in those services.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/16">Again I quote Womenspeak, because in a legislative and parliamentary context, the evidence that we received undoubtedly helped to influence at least seven pieces of legislation, not least the domestic violence legislation itself. We could use it as a model to think about ways of engaging people in designing public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/17">I pose some of those questions to the Minister. Are we geared up to tackle the issues that I have raised? We still have issues about data sharing, largely because of ignorance about the Data Protection Act 1998. However, there are some good examples, so why do we not learn from them and spread them? There are in public service delivery too many nay-sayers who use the Act to prevent joined-up services.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/18">We must also consider ways in which we can ensure that when cost savings are delivered through IT projects, and the cost is attributed to one Department but the benefits are shared throughout several, we have models that enable us to evidence that situation, so that it can be built into the comprehensive spending review process. I understand that it does not happen now, but it will be fundamental if we are to join up service delivery and end departmental-itis.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/19">We must also have some resource&mdash;a small pot somewhere&mdash;to encourage innovation and democracy in public service delivery. I hoped that digital challenge would be part of that process; I was involved in the early discussion with the Institute for Public Policy Research. Sadly, however, it is not, as we hoped it would be, a pot for innovation, experimentation, learning and the rolling out of good practice. There is excellence in some of those areas, particularly at a community level. I hope that even if the Minister has a very brief life left in the Cabinet Office before he goes on to greater things, he will take some of those messages back with him.</p>
