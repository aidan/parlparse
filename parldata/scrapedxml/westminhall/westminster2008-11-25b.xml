<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-25b.165.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" speakername="Anne Main" colnum="165"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081125/halltext/81125h0001.htm#08112562000618">
	<p pid="b.165.1/1">I completely concur with the observations of my hon. Friend. As I shall mention later, I have had contact with people who work in the operational field and who have drawn exactly that conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/2">Will the Minister tell us whether he intends to remedy that deficiency? Crucially, we need to learn from when incidents go wrong. For example, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-02">2 February 2005</phrase>, two Hertfordshire firefighters died at a fire in a block of flats at Harrow court, Stevenage. Bravely, the firefighters had rescued one victim and were attempting to rescue another when they were both killed. The report into the incident found that the deaths would almost certainly have been prevented, if Hertfordshire fire and rescue service had ensured that adequate procedures, training and resources were systematically in place. The report also found that adequate procedures, training and emergency response resources would have significantly reduced the life-threatening risks that faced the firefighters who attended the incident. There is a need for centrally-issued, substantial, safety-critical national guidance on the issues that have arisen from recent fatalities.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/3">We need rigorously to assess the concerns about the distress signal unit that firefighters raised with hon. Members when they met at the recent lobby. As I am sure that the Minister is aware, that unit is worn by firefighters with breathing apparatus and emits a loud sound if the firefighter does not move for 20 seconds or so, which provides a warning and a location for firefighters who are lost, trapped or injured. The battery has lower temperature resilience than the unit&mdash;55&deg; C compared with 75&deg; C. Yes, the battery was tested in isolation and not within the unit, but firefighters are deeply unhappy about the uncertainty surrounding the reliability of that equipment in the event of a serious hot fire. It should be fully appraised as a matter of urgency, if we are to ask people to use it, and I hope that the Minister will ensure that that happens.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/4">The FBU believes that there should be guidance for initial attendance, risk assessment, incident command, breathing apparatus, compartment fires, high-rise fires, backdraught, flashover and heat stress. That is a long list, but as I am sure the Minister is aware, firefighters' anger is growing about the lack of urgency surrounding those matters. Relevant training courses should also be provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/5">Will the Government consider imposing a duty on employers, landlords and other responsible persons at selected high-risk premises to submit in writing their fire risk assessments to the local fire and rescue service? The public find it somewhat strange that that does not happen. Such a move would provide more information for risk mapping and identify potential areas for enforcement action and operational planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/6">Our local branch of the FBU is anxious that Hertfordshire learns lessons from fire-related deaths and has made a number of recommendations to Hertfordshire fire and rescue service. It recommends that all firefighters receive regular training in all aspects of active fire safety measures. I shall go on to say why the FBU believes that that is not happening. We should ensure that there are sufficient firefighters on the initial attendance, so that one firefighter can be detailed as forward commander.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/7">I have been told about a worrying situation in which there were not enough firefighters. The firefighters were expected to wait outside a property until the second engine arrived. In the event of a blaze, the public would not understand why firefighters were waiting for the correct numbers. Of course, firefighters do not wait in such circumstances, which puts them in danger. We should ensure that all firefighters receive regular training in all aspects of compartment fires and ventilation, particularly in high-rise buildings. We should ensure that all firefighters receive regular training and monitoring in all aspects of high-rise procedures and that initial crews take the correct equipment up to the bridgehead. Will the Minister consider those requests?</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/8">We also need to address the issues relating to hot fire training. Before 2006, Hertfordshire had a single real fire training unit that burned wood and chipboard. In 2006, Stevenage borough council placed an abatement notice on that facility, because of the pollution, and mobile units were purchased to take its place. Those units came into service in 2008. However, concerns have been expressed to me and other hon. Members that the units are used only to train new recruits and not to train existing firefighters, some of whom have told me that they have received no hot fire training at all since 2001. That was put down to financial constraints, but whatever the reason, does the Minister believe that the situation is satisfactory?</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/9">I particularly want to talk about retained duty firefighters, who experience a particular set of issues relating to training and safety. I was contacted by a retained duty firefighter, Mr. Bill Liggins of Wheathampstead, who works part time with Hertfordshire fire and rescue service alongside his full-time job. Believe me, we need retained duty firefighters. Mr. Liggins is concerned because whole-time duty system firefighters do 18 weeks training, whereas retained duty system firefighters do only four weeks. The WDS firefighters do a 42-hour week in which they are expected to train for eight hours; the RDS firefighters do only a three-hour drill night. He asserts, quite logically, that those cannot and do not equate, but when the two types of firefighter turn out to fires, the dangers that they face are the same. He believes that the RDS firefighters need more training on weekends and at drill nights by specialists.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/10">The service has introduced national vocational qualifications to recognise competency, but they are not paid for, and RDS firefighters have to pay for them themselves. WDS firefighters do qualifications at work, but the service says that RDS firefighters should do them during drill nights. As an RDS member, Mr Liggins is concerned that they just do not have enough time both to train and to study for qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/11">RDS firefighters have historically had hand-me-down equipment from the WDS. Bizarrely, firefighters who met hon. Members the other week told us that uniforms go missing in the abyss of the cleaning systems and that they rarely get the same one back. The RDS has been allocated some new fire engines, but they do not carry full equipment&mdash;disc cutters, chemical suits and air mats. Again, that has to do with training implications and is principally driven by cost. As I have said, Hertfordshire county council is hard-pressed financially, and it has asked Hertfordshire fire and rescue service to try to cut &pound;1.1 million every year for the next three years, which must have implications for training budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/12">The Minister must accept that there are huge concerns about the levels of financing and training offered to serving WDS and RDS firefighters. If the regionalisation of our fire services were scrapped, that funding could be better spent. Why are the Government pressing ahead with regional fire control centres? I have a deep unease about moving services further away from local expertise and knowledge. Conservatives have consistently argued that that scheme should be scrapped. It is a costly, wasteful and misguided approach to delivering local services dressed up in a cloak of so-called efficiency savings.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/13">According to my local county council:</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/14" class="indent">&quot;The burden of the Regional Control Centre project on local Fire and Rescue Services is becoming an increasing concern. There are hopes that the project and financial management are an improvement on the management of the New Dimensions programme. The shortcomings of the New Dimensions programme were recently highlighted by the National Audit Office. Local workload and burden is not being met by sufficient New Burdens funding and the fear is that local priorities like Community Safety may have to be reduced to meet the workload of Regional Controls.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/15" class="indent">The East of England Regional Control Centre in Cambridge will be in the last operational wave, and far from providing greater financial efficiency is likely to cost the Hertfordshire taxpayer considerably more.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/16">Lesley Morris, who works in command and control in Hertfordshire, also wrote to me to make exactly that point. She said that</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/17" class="indent">&quot;sadly this project is not wanted by anyone within the fire service&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/18">contrary to what the Government say&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/19" class="indent">&quot;and we have real concerns that this will also be putting firefighters lives at risk due to losing the professional, highly trained personnel we have within control. This government says that with the new technology we will be able to mobilise the nearest appliance to an incident therefore creating a better service&mdash;well in Hertfordshire we already do that BUT with highly skilled professional people at the end of the phone who know the topography of Hertfordshire inside out.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/20">Lesley also told me that</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/21" class="indent">&quot;government says that with caller ID we will know exactly where the caller is calling from&mdash;but it's worth remembering that the person putting in the call is not always the person who is in trouble and they are not always in the same location. What about local dialects??&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/22">She was of the view that any delay, for whatever reason, in mobilising appliances puts more pressure on our firefighters once they are at an incident and therefore puts the public at risk. She asked that the Government consider her expert opinion:</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/23" class="indent">&quot;With the mobilising systems we have in Hertfordshire and many other brigades around the country surely it would have made sense to enable us to link to other brigades in...extreme busy periods but to keep the personnel in the locations we already have. This would have cost a fraction of what the project has cost and the money saved could have been put into frontline services and training&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/24">If regional control centres are so badly needed, how did Hertfordshire's control room cope with the biggest fire in peacetime Europe? During the Buncefield incident, Hertfordshire fire control coped professionally and comprehensively with hundreds of calls to that incident alone. The regional fire control project is officially three years late and the costs are 14 times the original estimates. The new centres were to start opening in November 2006, but are now not due to start opening until October 2009. Indeed, local rumour says that that date is optimistic&mdash;unless the Minister tells us differently. I hope that he will tell us that the centres are to be scrapped.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/25">In a written answer on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase> regarding the original cost estimates for regional fire control centres, the then Minister responsible for fire services, who is now the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>, said that consultants Mott MacDonald</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/26" class="indent">&quot;estimated project costs at &pound;100 million, comprising project management costs, technology costs, accommodation costs and redundancy.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-10-27.484"><i>Official Report</i>, 27 October 2005; Vol. 438, c. 484W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/27">That original estimate jumped to &pound;1 billion, with the latest Government answer confirming that the cost will rise to &pound;1.4 billion. It is worth noting that the entire UK fire service costs only &pound;1.7 billion a year to run, so the business case for the scheme certainly has not been made and, more importantly, the firefighters who are being asked to perform these tasks are left unconvinced.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/28">It is worth remembering, as my local force has pointed out, that during the floods of 2007 control rooms throughout the country were able to cope with the massive number of calls that they received. At times of emergency with spate conditions, many staff simply turn up at control rooms to help, which will not happen once controls are regionalised.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/29">The Government's answer is that neighbouring control rooms will take the overflow of calls. However, weather systems can travel the country quickly, so if one control is busy it will switch to the next and so on. Have the Government considered what will happen when nine rooms instead of 46 are busy? It could lead to a catastrophic failure where our fire control rooms cannot answer calls from the public when they are in trouble.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/30">The number of staff predicted to be working in these control rooms ranges from six to 12 covering six counties. The Hertfordshire control room has a minimum of four staff at any time. I therefore question the logic that the change will make our fire service more resilient. Why spend billions of pounds fixing a system that is not broken, especially in these difficult economic times?</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/31">Will the Minister tell us why the plans are so delayed? Will he confirm rumours that the project is still beset by technical problems? Given that front-line fire stations and firefighters are threatened by cuts, is he prepared to reconsider spending that money on front-line fire services, in order to keep it low-cost, efficient and&mdash;more important&mdash;local? Is it not time to scrap the project and revisit the closures that have dogged local services?</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/32">The Minister knows that there is no statutory obligation to respond to flooding, but he should try telling that to the public as they battle flood waters. Flooding has always been the sort of incident to which firefighters respond. In St. Albans on Saturday, firefighters rescued an elderly lady from a flooding incident in her flat. Two weeks ago in London Colney in my constituency, the fire service arrived promptly to pump out flooded areas. It was the first port of call for many residents. It is an ongoing problem in many constituencies beset by flooding.</p>
	<p pid="b.165.1/33">My constituents expect the fire service to attend, so why does the Minister not ensure that the Pitt review is implemented? The area-wide floods of 2007, and the possibility of more events like that, have changed the outlook. The Pitt review made a number of recommendations, including greater responsibilities for the fire service. Hertfordshire has firefighters trained in the use of boats and working in water, but fire services will need more resources to match the recommendations of the Pitt review and to meet the increased challenge. That includes national assistance from fire services across the country, which is already in place. Will the Minister finally commit the Government to recognising the additional pressures of dealing with flooding, and undertake to implement the Pitt review?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-25b.169.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" speakername="Oliver Heald" colnum="169"  time="009:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081125/halltext/81125h0002.htm#08112562000619">
	<p pid="b.169.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" name="Anne Main">the Member for St. Albans (Anne Main)</phrase> on securing this debate. After the lobbying of Parliament, a number of Members were keen that there should be such a debate, so that we could raise concerns, and I am delighted that my hon. Friend has succeeded.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/2">I pay tribute to the Hertfordshire fire and rescue service, which does a tremendous job. It did extremely well at Buncefield. I, too, benefited from its services when I had a small fire at home. The service does a good job on prevention and advising the public how to avoid fire; indeed, what it does to persuade people to use smoke alarms is particularly important.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-02">2 February 2005</phrase>, there was a tragic incident at Harrow Court flats in Stevenage. Two firefighters lost their lives there&mdash;Jeff Wornham and Michael Miller. I know the Wornham family&mdash;a popular local farming family, committed to public service. Jeff's father Robert is here today&mdash;Robert is chairman of the parish council. It was a tragedy that Jeff should have lost his life. He showed tremendous bravery in going into that building on that night. Everyone was proud that he was given the George medal posthumously. However, as his father said, we all wish that it had not been posthumous.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/4">It is against that background that I come to the debate. I fully accept that Hertfordshire fire and rescue service has made improvements. I understand that the number of property fires is down by 25 per cent., accidental dwelling fires have been reduced by 13 per cent., arson is down by 36 per cent., and fire fatalities are down. However, there is continuing concern as a result of what happened that night in 2005. The Fire Brigades Union inquiry into what happened was critical of the procedures, and the training and resources made available, and concern was expressed that there had been previous incidents elsewhere and that safety critical advice was somehow not being passed on to the firemen as it should.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/5">The FBU report, &quot;In the Line of Duty&quot;, was prepared by the Labour Research Department. It is notable that the 1996 incident at Blaina, in south Wales, is mentioned on page 30 of the report because what happened in 2005 showed similarities with what had happened nine years earlier. On both occasions, firemen attended in small numbers, managed to rescue one person and then went back in; it was a delayed backdraught that caused the fatalities. Our concern is that the sort of advice that should come from such occasions is not being spread around to the firefighters.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/6">The overall message of the FBU report seems to be that at the end of the 1990s relative safety had been achieved for firemen, as there were hardly any fatalities at that time, but that more recently, between 2003 and 2007, there were 21 fatalities. The situation seems to be getting worse. The report notes the poor recording of fatalities&mdash;not all loss of life being properly recorded&mdash;and the non-recording of near misses, which are often useful for learning lessons. It also mentions the lack of research into the causes of deaths and near misses; finally, it talks of inadequate risk assessment processes. The report says that there is no system at national level to ensure that lessons are learned and guidance is spread.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/7">I asked the Minister a parliamentary question on the subject, which he answered on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-18">18 November</phrase>. He said that</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/8" class="indent">&quot;a framework for the future development of operational guidance has been developed, including a priority programme of work...This programme has begun and includes the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders. As part of this framework, an additional four pieces of operational guidance has recently been published&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-11-18.381"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 November 2008; Vol. 483, c. 381W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/9">That seems to be a rather leisurely process.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/10">We seem not to be getting the sort of guidance mentioned by &quot;In the Line of Duty&quot;&mdash;something comprehensive that should be available quickly. It speaks of having</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/11" class="indent">&quot;safety critical national guidance on the issues arising from recent fatalities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/12">The report gives a long list of items that should be covered, including minimum standards on the initial attendance, which is particularly important to my constituent because that was the background to the incidents at Blaina and Stevenage. The report also mentions revising generic risk assessments, minimum standards for training and many other aspects.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/13">I therefore have some questions for the Minister. First, is the programme not rather leisurely, and could we not have what is recommended in the FBU report&mdash;something substantial, and soon? Secondly, on the question of how fatalities and near misses are recorded, is it so difficult to have a comprehensive national system that works? Surely, that is done in a range of other areas. Thirdly, what about proper investigation? One of the report's recommendations is that a new body should be set up to deal with investigations, to ensure that we understand why a fatality or a near miss occurred.</p>
	<p pid="b.169.0/14">The Minister might say, &quot;We're on to that already, but will deal with it slightly differently&quot;, which, if so, would be an acceptable answer. However, those three points&mdash;on recording deaths and near misses, investigating them properly and providing proper safety critical advice nationally&mdash;seem to be the nub of the proposals in the report and make obvious good sense. I wanted to press those points in my short contribution today. What will the Minister do about them?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-25b.176.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" speakername="Julia Goldsworthy" colnum="176"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081125/halltext/81125h0003.htm#08112562000635">
	<p pid="b.176.0/1">I absolutely agree that we need a fairer, more transparent system. That requires fundamental changes to how local taxation is raised and spent, which is why the Liberal Democrats have been talking about local income tax, which would make things clearer. I am not entirely sure how a one-off central grant, which is what the Government are claiming to offer, will achieve transparency. Council tax payers in Hertfordshire will rightly be annoyed about being net contributors, but, as the hon. Lady pointed out, they are concerned about resources for their public services. That is a balance that council tax payers have to strike, and they have to decide whether they are prepared for further service cuts, which Conservative Members say they do not want. There is a contradiction that must be resolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.0/2">The debate is not just about a local situation; there are national issues&mdash;not just of funding, but of the co-ordination of training, the establishment of standards, the making available of guidance and the collection of data. As to training, when firefighters came to see me at the national lobby, they pointed out that there has been a change of emphasis towards fire safety and away from training to deal with larger incidents. They explained that that makes it difficult for them to make time for such training to deal with large fires. They also talked about their great difficulty in obtaining training to understand the wide and widening range of equipment that they are asked to use.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.0/3">The most recent addition at my local fire station is an emergency response unit that can deal with chemical spills, for example. The firefighters said that it was difficult for fire stations with whole-time cover to make time available for training in using the hundreds of items of equipment for firefighting and for dealing with road traffic accidents, flooding and chemical spills.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.0/4">Things are even more difficult for retained firefighters. I spent a day with retained firefighters who were doing their initial training, and was gobsmacked when I learned how much ground they must cover in two weeks. As the firefighters at the national lobby explained to me, they are concerned that there will be a knock-on effect on their ability to turn out. There is a reliance on retained firefighters not just to turn out and man a tender; it is necessary also for them to be trained to use the equipment.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.0/5">Will the Minister comment on the number of occasions on which fire stations have been unable to turn out with the equipment firefighters want to use, not because there are not enough firefighters, but because not enough of them are trained to use the equipment needed for a particular incident?</p>
	<p pid="b.176.0/6">The experience in Hertfordshire provides a microcosm of the experiences I have been describing. Despite a reduction in the headline figures relating to fires prevented and call-outs, this is an area where there have been significant fires and, sadly, fatalities and injuries have resulted. That seems to me to be representative of the wider story that the FBU was trying to tell in its national lobby: there is a headline impact on the number of fires and call-outs, but insufficient time is being dedicated to allow firefighters to respond to the larger incidents.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.0/7">Guidance is another issue that arises, and the FBU makes recommendations in its report &quot;In the Line of Duty&quot;. It points out that in 2004 the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council was abolished, and raises concerns that since then there has been no systematic issuing and development of guidance. It suggests that a new body needs to be established to take on that role. I am not convinced of the need for a separate body, although I am open to being convinced. Does the Minister have any comment to make on whether any existing bodies could take on that function?</p>
	<p pid="b.176.0/8">As to data, we know largely from requests made under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 that more firefighters are dying and that the official figures are lower than the levels recorded. What can the Minister do to ensure that the definitions of reportable deaths and of minor injuries are widened and clarified to allow systematic reporting of incidents resulting in fatalities, as well as of other deaths of firefighters while they are on duty but not necessarily fighting fires? In addition, what can he do to ensure that near misses are recorded? The point of collecting the data is to understand how situations arise and what can be done to prevent them. Understanding near misses is as important as following through with information on what has happened when things go wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.0/9">The hon. Member for St. Albans raised pertinent issues on fire control. I have been concerned about the apparent continuing delay in the roll-out of the regional fire control centres. That adds to my cynicism about the prospect of the regional fire control centres doing a more effective job than existing fire control centres. I have asked several questions about that matter. On one occasion I asked why, if the Government say that centralisation is needed, they do not go the whole hog and put everything in one place. The response from then Minister was that that would not be sensible because a terrorist hit could take out that one fire control centre. That is true, and it seems to me to be an argument for spreading control centres out as widely as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.0/10">A huge amount of expertise will be lost. The people who work in fire control in my constituency will not relocate to Taunton, where the new fire control centre is to be built on the flood plain. Resources are being spent; once again, an information technology system is being set up that is running over budget and over time. The resources could be much better spent on the front line.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.0/11">There is a case for getting the correct balance between focusing on prevention and ensuring that firefighters have access to the training they need to use equipment that enables them to deal with fires and an ever-widening range of other incidents such as road traffic accidents and flooding, which has become a particular problem. Firefighters will be best able to respond, and the Department will be best able to ensure that they have the right equipment, only if there is proper reporting of information on the risks taken by firefighters whey they go out to do their job every day, and the impact of those risks.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.0/12">I would like to hear the Minister's response to all the recommendations in the report&mdash;for a common and consistent reporting mechanism for fatalities and major injuries, the widening of the definition of reportable incidents, a national independent fire and rescue service investigation unit, centrally issued guidance to ensure that firefighters know that they have back-up, national standards, and systems to enable lessons to be learned from the fatalities that occur.</p>
	<p pid="b.176.0/13">The report shows a need for Government action, and I hope that the Minister will provide reassurance to all hon. Members who have raised concerns and the firefighters who came to the lobby.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-25b.178.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1759" speakername="Stewart Jackson" colnum="178"  time="010:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081125/halltext/81125h0003.htm#08112562000636">
	<p pid="b.178.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I warmly congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" name="Anne Main">the Member for St. Albans (Anne Main)</phrase> on securing the debate and on her eloquent and well researched remarks. She is passionate about the issue and has responded as a good constituency Member of Parliament to last week's debate and lobby, when the Fire Brigades Union came to the House. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase>, who brought a personal touch to the debate when he related the experience of his constituent and his family, and the bravery of that gentleman. I support and congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1634" name="James Clappison">the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison)</phrase> on his principled and tenacious campaign on behalf of his constituents to save Radlett fire station.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/2">The issue is immensely important, not least because, as we have heard, 22 firefighters have been killed in the past five years, and the trend seems to be getting worse. It is interesting that one of the mantras repeated constantly by the Minister's predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1595" name="Parmjit Dhanda">the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda)</phrase>, concerned the number of fire-related deaths being the lowest since the 1950s. I do not necessarily query that. It is the case, and is the result of demographic and social changes and changes in education and community engagement. I congratulate the Government on that success, but the corollary, if I may quote Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, whom I met last week with Mick Shaw, the president, is that there is</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/3" class="indent">&quot;a policy vacuum&mdash;a neglect of up-to-date central guidance on firefighter safety.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/4">If, as my hon. Friends have said, overall fire deaths are falling but firefighter deaths are rising, there are some big issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/5">It goes without saying that I pay tribute to Hertfordshire fire and rescue as well as to the Fire Brigades Union, not only for its report, &quot;In the Line of Duty&quot;, but for its work in exposing the shambles of the regional fire control centres and destroying the intellectual case for that policy. I will refer to that later.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/6">I draw the House's attention to early-day motion 2489 on firefighter safety and data collection, which I tabled and which has been signed by 61 other hon. Members from all parties. It is a straightforward early-day motion that calls for more safety-critical operational guidance for fire authorities, draws attention to the deficiency in data collection mentioned by my hon. Friends and urges greater clarity and standardisation in the recording and investigation of firefighter fatalities and injuries. It stands as a record of the commitment of Her Majesty's Opposition to this pressing issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/7">My hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans raised concerns about flooding and resilience funding, which we discussed two weeks ago in this Chamber. The reason why Project Fireguard has collapsed is that fire authorities take the sensible view that resilience is essentially a national issue that should be funded nationally. It is incumbent on the Government to move quickly and to decide, finally, whether it should be a statutory duty for fire and rescue authorities to attend to flooding. If not, the Government should decide where to site funding to facilitate proper reactions to flooding incidents across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/8">It is important to discuss the practical operation of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004. Mention has been made of the integrated risk management plans. In the experience of many long-standing firefighters, union officials, local councils and fire authorities, the plans are being used as a fig leaf for driving through revenue cuts that remove retained firefighters, appliances and stations. In a debate on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-18">18 March</phrase> this year on Humberside fire and rescue, we saw that that is what is happening in practical terms. We should review integrated risk management plans, relate them to the everyday on-site training that firefighters receive and use them properly in terms of risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/9">On funding, as I have mentioned, we need to bring forward the review of the formula spending share from 2010 to 2009, not least in the light of yesterday's pre-Budget report and the fact that this Government have all but bankrupted this country. That is an important issue that the Fire Brigades Union and others will take forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/10">Why is there such a lack of risk-critical operational guidance? Why have we not updated it using avenues such as the national chief fire and rescue adviser, Sir Ken Knight, or the operational guidelines from the Department for Communities and Local Government? As the Minister will know, his predecessor and I debated the national fire and rescue service framework in June. That would have been an opportune moment to review firefighter training, but it was not addressed. More emphasis is placed on diversity, quotas and tick boxes than on firefighter safety. I do not think that that is the right set of priorities going forward over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/11">We come to the subject of regional fire control centres. Where do I begin? Yesterday morning, I visited the new regional fire control centre at Blackbrook business park in Taunton. It has been built on the edge of a flood plain. There has been massive opposition to regional fire control centres, not least in Gloucestershire, where the fire element of the tri-service centre in Quedgeley has been ripped out and a &pound;6 million private finance initiative scheme disabled by the obsession for regional government started by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1646" name="John Prescott">the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)</phrase>, the 2004 vote against the regional assembly and the vote not to go ahead with the merger of police forces. Fire control centres are the only behemoth of regional government still being pursued by this Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/12">Given that the then fire Minister told us in 2004 that regional control centres would cost only &pound;100 million and would definitely generate &pound;30 million, or 30 per cent., in revenue savings over the period to 2017, the figures are horrendous. Some &pound;55 million has been spent so far on consultants and &pound;50 million on local and national project set-up. That is &pound;100 million already. Some &pound;190 million has been spent on IT and &pound;342 million on premises. We are heading towards &pound;700 million, and not one regional control centre is yet open, nor is one likely to open.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/13">I challenge the Minister to give us a date for the new cut-overs. He has delayed them in the south-west and throughout the country, and he has refused to tell fire authorities when they will happen. He knows that they must happen before 2012, because of the Olympics&mdash;senior chief fire officers have said that it will not be a tenable situation if the fire control project is not online by the time of the Olympics. He will also know that, as I have said, the cost basis rationale for the project is dead and buried, as is the resilience basis. All the technical improvements that Ministers trotted out constantly and wrote to hon. Members about in the summer are happening anyway. For instance, in Avon, 19 of the 20 technical improvements that have taken place would have happened anyway, without a regional control centre and all the related costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/14">I challenge the Minister to have the courage of his convictions in his new role and say to the Treasury, &quot;This is a disastrous project. It's impacting in the post-comprehensive spending review period on real front-line services and on revenue funding. Kill it off; pull the plug.&quot; He would have our strong and emphatic support, as well as that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" name="Julia Goldsworthy">the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy)</phrase>, I am sure.</p>
	<p pid="b.178.0/15">Incidentally, I am sure that the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne will support the Conservatives' push for greater transparency. In government, we would seek an Australian-style grants commission that would exercise fairness and transparency in allocating revenue grant funding, unlike the present Government, who seem to make it up as they go along. However, I am slightly concerned that the hon. Lady is confused about how it will all be paid for. I thought that the Liberal Democrats had killed off local income tax, not least because it is electoral poison in most of the south of England, including&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;in the south-west and Cornwall.</p>

	<p pid="b.180.1/1">I hope that the Liberal Democrats have more clarity by the time we reach the general election, because people will want to know. They will want to know the point of voting Liberal Democrat anyway, given that it will be a clear choice between two competing visions, but I assure the hon. Lady that we have a clear and well-argued policy, which we will articulate in our general election manifesto.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.1/2">The issue of regional control centres is integral to this debate. My hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans has mentioned the Pitt review. The Pitt review specifically does not advocate regional control centres in the conclusions that it reached after examining the widespread national floods in the summer of 2007, despite being &quot;invited&quot; to do so. That is an important point.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.1/3">My hon. Friends asked what might happen in a new regional control centre set-up if there were a catastrophic outage&mdash;for instance, if a hacker were to place a computer bug throughout the IT system. Can anyone imagine the ramifications of all nine regional control centres, including the one for the London fire brigade in Docklands, crashing at the same time? Of course, that is something that none of us wants to happen, but it is something that we need to think hard about in terms of a risk assessment. At the moment, there would be 45 other potential fire control centres to pick up the slack in the event of a serious terrorist incident, a pandemic or major floods. That would not be the case if we had nine or 10 centres interlinked by a common IT network, which is a very serious concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.1/4">The New Dimensions programme has been mentioned. I know that the Minister will want to have some time to put his views forward and to answer the questions that my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans has put. In the spirit of consensus, I want to give the Minister an opportunity to use two specific avenues to try to address the particular issues that my hon. Friends the Members for St. Albans, for Hertsmere and for North-East Hertfordshire, as well as the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, have raised today.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.1/5">One avenue is the report into the very sad circumstances of the firefighter deaths at Atherstone on Stour, which the Minister will know about. That report is due by the end of this month or early December and it will obviously raise the profile of firefighter safety. It will be a golden opportunity for the Minister to examine the key issues that have been raised today. The other avenue, of course, is the Minister's official response to the National Audit Office report on the New Dimensions programme, which is also concerned with issues of resilience.</p>
	<p pid="b.180.1/6">Those two avenues will perhaps give the Minister the opportunity to look at resilience, training, achieving a level of consistency and the policy vacuum that the FBU have alluded to, and also the potential disaster of regional control centres. Let us trust local professionals and respect their expertise, and let us see some flexibility from the Government in assuaging the concerns that my hon. Friends have articulated so well today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-25b.184.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" speakername="Sadiq Khan" colnum="184"  time="010:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081125/halltext/81125h0004.htm#08112562000645">
	<p pid="b.184.1/1">I am glad that the hon. Gentleman intervened. I have the figures for the past 10 years, and interestingly the smallest increase was 1.9 per cent. in 1998-99, when we were tied to Conservative spending limits. From then on, there have been increases of 3.9 per cent., 5.4 per cent., 6.2 per cent., 7.3 per cent., 6 per cent. and 4.9 per cent. Opposition Members were not to know that this debate would come a day after the shadow Chancellor's shocking speech, but God knows what would happen if we had a council tax freeze in the hon. Gentleman's constituency and county over the next two years. God forbid that the shadow Chancellor was allowed to have his policies prey upon the people of Hertfordshire. Frankly, the hon. Gentleman should thank his lucky stars that he has the current Chancellor in the job rather than the shadow Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.1/2">Hertfordshire county council has responsibility for fire and rescue services throughout the county, as well as for other services. Formula grant is an unhypothecated block grant, which means that there are no restrictions on how the county allocates it to the services that it provides. Deciding on the allocations is a local matter, and the council is best placed to decide on local priorities for the communities that it serves.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.1/3">I was surprised by the criticism of efficiency savings by the hon. Member for St. Albans. I thought that her party, and the shadow Chancellor, were all in favour of efficiency savings. In fact, we are criticised for not going far enough in requiring county councils, other local authorities, and by extension fire and rescue services, to make such savings. I do not resile from asking all public servants to do so, and I do not apologise for that. Taxpayers' money is finite.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.1/4">I turn to the matters raised in the FBU report, which the hon. Lady mentioned. She raised the crucial matter of firefighter fatalities, which was one of the key concerns that the FBU raised. Although any firefighter fatality is a tragedy, thankfully the number of fatalities remains very low and the number of injuries to firefighters is falling steadily. Of course, we will continue to work closely with stakeholders to ensure that lessons are learned.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.1/5">It was extremely unfair of the hon. Lady to suggest that lessons were not being learned or that there was somehow a sham in relation to either the Buncefield incident or the 2005 incident that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire mentioned. He was right that in that case, the breathing apparatus crew rescued an occupant. When they learned that a further person was inside, they went back inside in search of the second reported person. That was when they suffered their injuries. It is worth taking the time to record that, so that they are thanked properly. There is a Health and Safety Executive investigation, and we will take it seriously, respond to it and work with key partners to learn lessons.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.1/6">On Buncefield, the hon. Lady will know that the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead would not allow the Government not to take action&mdash;she knows him too well. Further work is taking place, and four separate reports have been published and their recommendations implemented. I hope that she will shortly see the fruits of some of the changes that have been made, if she has not already.</p>
	<p pid="b.184.1/7">The hon. Lady mentioned training. My Department, the Chief Fire Officers Association and the Local Government Association continue to work together to provide support to fire and rescue authorities to ensure, as employers, that staff are trained to undertake their roles effectively and safely. Looking forward, we are keen to work with the service to ensure that training is effective. We are planning research to support continuous improvement in service delivery and share good practice. It should be noted that notwithstanding the difficult times and the policy of some parties to make cuts, we have provided some &pound;50 million of funding for the Fire Service College since 2002, including &pound;15 million to provide a state-of-the-art resilience training facility.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.1/1">My officials are currently going through the report thoroughly, as am I. As soon as we are in a position to respond to it, we will. I have spoken to the general secretary of the FBU once, and will be speaking to him again this week. As soon as I make progress, I undertake to alert the usual channels and the hon. Gentleman about the time lines involved. It was worth the hon. Gentleman's raising the matter, and I will not resist his chasing me up every few weeks to see what our response will be. That chivvying is right and proper, especially in discussing such matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.1/2">We have spent more than &pound;7.5 million on work force development projects, to provide training programmes and e-learning facilities and to establish a centre for leadership for the fire and rescue service.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.1/3">I cannot end without mentioning FiReControl&mdash;I do not think that the hon. Member for Peterborough would forgive me. He is right that there is a &pound;1 billion fire and resilience programme for England's fire and rescue services, and I believe that the case for a new national network of control services to handle emergency fire calls is clear. Every area and every constituency in England will benefit from enhanced resilience. Under FiReControl, eight key capabilities will be provided to each and every fire and rescue service, ranging from automatic caller location from land lines and mobiles to real-time information on the location of the resources out on the road and in-cab computers for firefighters, loaded with vital safety information. The hon. Member for St. Albans claimed that no one in Hertfordshire wants that, but that is not the case. Only 10 of the current 46 control rooms have six or more of those eight capabilities, and only two have all eight. They will benefit from being part of a national network that, unlike the present system, can back them up and deploy the right response if they get extremely busy.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.1/4">Floods have been mentioned. During last year's floods, we all saw the magnificent response of the professionals in the fire and rescue service and the other emergency services. We saw what a brilliant and professional job they did in tough circumstances. It brought home to me and to many others, including our independent adviser Sir Ken Knight in his report on the floods, the need for a national network able to respond to local, regional and national incidents. In short, the need to give the fire and rescue service the tools to face 21st-century challenges such as climate change and the treat of terrorism supports the need for FiReControl.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.1/5">The fire and rescue service has undergone a period of unprecedented modernisation and change since 2003. It has risen to the challenges admirably, and I believe that it will continue to do so. I welcome the opportunities of my new role as the fire service Minister, and I shall continue to work with the service. I once again congratulate the hon. Member for St. Albans and thank her for raising important issues. If there is any point to which she does not think I have done justice, I ask her to get in touch and I will respond by letter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-25b.191.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="191"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081125/halltext/81125h0005.htm#08112562000671">
	<p pid="b.191.5/1">Thank you, Mr. Hood. Regardless of any compensation scheme for relatives, it is plainly obvious that justice for policyholders who have died is no longer possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/2">According to the ombudsman, the fallout from Equitable Life could have been mitigated if action had been taken earlier. She states that</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/3" class="indent">&quot;there were lost opportunities to address critical issues earlier&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/4">No more delays, no more dodging the issue&mdash;the time has come for the Government to face up to their responsibilities to Equitable Life policyholders.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/5">As I mentioned earlier, the Equitable Life case has serious implications for the office of the parliamentary ombudsman. It is in the interest of the health of our democracy that we have an authoritative ombudsman to whom the Government listen and respond, but that is something that Ministers have been reluctant to support.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/6">An exhaustive 18-month investigation by the ombudsman found the Government guilty of mis-selling occupational pensions to 125,000 people who lost their company pensions without warning or any chance to protect themselves. The Public Administration Committee, the European Court of Justice and the High Court judicial review all agreed that the Government should have protected those people's pensions but failed to do so. The Government continued to resist pressure to pay compensation until December last year, when they finally agreed a compensation package of more than &pound;3 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/7">Another of the ombudsman's reports, in June 2007, looked at tax credits. Appropriately entitled &quot;Tax Credits: Getting it wrong?&quot;, the report contained severe criticisms of the Government's use of waivers in respect of overpayments, calling them &quot;unfair and inconsistent&quot;. The ombudsman sought to correct faults in a system that causes stress and misery for people such as a constituent of mine who was overpaid by &pound;5,300 and then told that the money had to be repaid within 12 months. In spite of the ombudsman's criticisms, the Government continue to defend their over-complex tax credits regime.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/8">Members of the Government have not always had such a frosty relationship with the ombudsman. Compare the cases that I have outlined with the situation when the Prime Minister was in opposition. An ombudsman investigation was instigated by his party into Barlow Clowes, which collapsed in 1988. It was he who argued that the Government of the day should support the ombudsman over charges of maladministration by the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/9">When Lord Penrose published his report in 2004, parallels were drawn between Equitable Life and Barlow Clowes. Speaking in the House after publication of the Penrose report on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-08">8 March 2004</phrase>, the right hon. Member for Bolton, West stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/10" class="indent">&quot;It has been put to us that as the then Government provided redress in the Barlow Clowes case, we should do so with respect to Equitable, but there are major differences between the two cases... In the case of Barlow Clowes, there was a finding of maladministration; for Equitable, there has been no such finding.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-03-08.1257"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 March 2004; Vol. 418, c. 1257</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.191.5/11">Now there has been such a finding, how can the Government possibly justify failing to act?</p>

	<p pid="b.194.2/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> on securing the debate. I also congratulate the members of the Equitable Members Action Group, whose professionalism is outstanding. They have gone through eight years of waiting and they keep on going, and they have provided us with regular&mdash;I would not say &quot;monthly&quot;&mdash;updates. I take my hat off to them. Some of them are watching the debate. Well done. Do not give up the fight.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.2/2">As to why we have not had such a debate before, looking at how many hon. and right hon. Members are attending&mdash;probably the most I have seen for a 90-minute Adjournment debate&mdash;perhaps it is time that we altered how this place runs. Perhaps 100 signatures from among all of us could bring about a six-hour debate on such crucial issues, rather than one of 90 minutes. Given that the Labour Government established the parliamentary ombudsman, perhaps reports from the ombudsman should be binding on the Government. That is something I believe in having seen the blood on the carpet for the next four years after starting the occupational pension debate with ASW Sheerness in 2003. Eventually, we conceded on every single point. Had we conceded within six weeks of the issue arising, the members&mdash;125,000 people&mdash;would have settled for 50 per cent. As it was, they got 90 per cent. and we were left with a gap of &pound;8 billion in the Department for Work and Pensions budget. It is the same in respect of Equitable Life: had we addressed the matter earlier, we would not be where we are.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.2/3">I have just over 500 constituents with Equitable Life pension schemes and the issue affects the most people of any that I have ever dealt with. Of course, those people are all different, which makes the problem harder. Although Ann Abraham has said that it would take two and a half years to deal with, I am afraid that I cannot see compensation being paid that quickly. I ask the Minister to consider a hardship fund and a way of administering that as fast as possible. It is simply not fair to ask people in their late 70s and 80s to wait another two and a half years, by which time they may have died.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.2/4">In respect of occupational pensions, there was a resolution for widows. I wonder whether the Minister will consider that too. After all, we are talking about people's savings&mdash;and their savings have gone. It is tough talking to them. All hon. and right hon. Members have such people in their constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.2/5">I do not want to repeat what the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire has said, because much of it is accurate and I want other hon. and right hon. Members to have their say. But considering the matter as a whole, Equitable Life expanded sixfold in the 1990s&mdash;from &pound;5 billion to &pound;30 billion&mdash;by voting excessive policy bonuses. How on earth could the board do that? It paid out to retiring policyholders more than had been earned by their investment, so there was a policy lag. How on earth that was not picked up by the regulatory bodies I do not know. As a consequence of it, the policies of current Equitable Life policyholders are not covered by the investments of the past.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.2/6">Equitable Life tried to change or alter the issue by offering a range of different products. However, when push came to shove, the company closed to new business in December 2000&mdash;and here we are, eight years on. The old directors resigned and the good bits of the business were sold off&mdash;the offices, the client list, the staff and unit-linked business. The new directors slashed policies by 16 per cent. in July 2001 and put in place a compromise scheme to deal with the guaranteed annuities, but that was not enough. Another 10 per cent. was cut off the value in 2002. By then, the society was entirely invested in fixed-interest stocks and could not take advantage of rising markets. It is now being run down and broken up, as everybody knows.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.2/7">Despite Lord Penrose and despite the ombudsman, we have done nothing. It is important that the Minister not only responds to some of the accusations made the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire, and to what all hon. and right hon. Members feel, but considers doing so before the Christmas recess&mdash;not on the last day of this part of the House of Commons calendar, but next week or the week after. It is neither reasonable nor fair to leave it much longer.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.2/8">I know that many hon. Members want to speak, but I ask the Minister to think of the morality of the situation. That is ultimately what the Government said about occupational pensions: they accepted the morality of the argument, but took five years to come to the dance floor and pay up. Will the Minister please tell us that there will be no more delay and that the Government will pay up?</p>

I hope that the huge number of hon. Members here today will encourage the Equitable Members Action Group a little. I join in paying tribute to it for what it has done, and I hope that the debate brings justice a little closer.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/2">I have three charges to level against the Government, who have fallen into three unpleasant habits. First, they have been mealy mouthed. Secondly, they have dragged their heels. Thirdly, they have put their hands over their ears and said, &quot;La, la, la.&quot; They have been mealy mouthed because they have not said sorry to start the process. How can they not accept that they should have said sorry many years ago?</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/3">The delay has been one of eight years, and there have been 13 reports just about something happening in the future. Finally and most seriously&mdash;this point has been made by other hon. Members&mdash;they have thought it acceptable to ignore the ombudsman's recommendations. It has been powerfully stated today that that brings the whole system into disrepute, and I hope that that message goes out from this Chamber today.</p>

	<p pid="b.204.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> not only on securing the debate, but on the masterful way in which she put her case on behalf of many hon. Members from all parties who had the opportunity to hear her speak. However, it is shameful that it took a Liberal Democrat MP to secure the opportunity for us to make the case in a debate on behalf of our constituents, rather than the Government making time available in the main Chamber. As a constituency MP&mdash;I know this is true of every MP in the Chamber&mdash;I have received dozens and dozens of letters from constituents who are extremely distressed by the circumstances in which they find themselves, and dismayed that the Government have dragged their feet and been unwilling to show greater resolve.</p>
	<p pid="b.204.2/2">It is worth remembering that it was due to failure of the management of Equitable Life that the company was allowed to get into the position that it did, but it is also right to say that regulatory failure allowed that to happen unhindered by the Government. The Government, through the Department of Trade and Industry, the Financial Services Authority and the Government Actuary's Department, had responsibility for ensuring that the company acted properly and prudently. As has said, there have been 13 reports on the failure of Equitable Life, all of which concluded that the company was not performing satisfactorily in the interests of those who were depositing money with it.</p>

	<p pid="b.213.1/1">I thank you, Mrs. Winterton, for the opportunity to discuss the information-sharing gateways of the Serious Organised Crime Agency and, in particular, the rights that attach to it following the transfer of some of the functions of the Assets Recovery Agency, which was wound up in April.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/2">A wider debate on the general performance information available on SOCA and the ability of the House to scrutinise its activities effectively will be necessary at some point. There was a suggestion that the Select Committee on Home Affairs would conduct an inquiry into SOCA, but that has not yet come to fruition. My general concerns are the opaqueness of SOCA's activities and the assessment of its performance, but such a wider debate is for another day, and for the whole House because of its seriousness, and I do not intend to stray into it in this debate. Rather, I have an opportunity to discuss the narrower, more technical matter of the information-sharing requirements that were placed on SOCA following the transfer of powers from the ASA earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/3">At the outset, I thank the Minister for the constructive way in which he has sought to address some of the points that I will discuss. I am grateful for the steps that he has sought to take although, unfortunately, it has proved necessary to introduce an Adjournment debate properly to explore the things that need to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-11">11 January 2007</phrase>, the then Home Secretary announced the transfer of the asset recovery functions of the ASA to SOCA, with the training functions going to the National Policing Improvement Agency, with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>. That announcement preceded a highly critical report of the performance of the ASA by the National Audit Office in February 2007. The report made a number of recommendations on the functions of the ASA that the NAO said would be applicable to the successor bodies that took over its functions. The report included significant criticism of the case management database, which the NAO described as &quot;poor&quot;. The NAO stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/5" class="indent">&quot;We had great difficulty in compiling a comprehensive list of cases and tracking their value and progress&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/6">The NAO said that the ASA had collected &pound;23 million against cumulative costs of &pound;65 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/7">As I have said, the transfer of the asset recovery functions of the ASA to SOCA was effective on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>. The measure was implemented by the Serious Crime Act 2007. In conducting its work, the ASA used information gateways for information that was disclosed to it by partner agencies to enable it to conduct its duties and to fulfil its responsibilities, and there were gateways that authorised the ASA to disclose specified information that it had obtained to certain other agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/8">The transfer of those powers was not addressed directly in the 2007 Act. Nearly two months after the transfer of the functions, the Government introduced secondary legislation to address the gap. Those measures&mdash;the draft Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Disclosure of Information by SOCA) Order 2008, and the draft Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Disclosure of Information) Order 2008&mdash;were considered in Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-24">24 June 2008</phrase>. The explanatory notes to those orders stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/9" class="indent">&quot;It is the policy that those undertaking civil recovery functions shall have the same provisions applying to them as...ARA&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/10">That point was reaffirmed in the other place when their lordships considered the orders. Lord West stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The orders merely ensure that organisations which inherited the Assets Recovery Agency's work and functions can access the same information sources that were available to the agency and can disclose the same information onwards.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-17">17 June 2008</phrase>; Vol. 702, c. GC371.]</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/12">In Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-24">24 June</phrase>, the point was reiterated by the Minister, who said:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/13" class="indent">&quot;So, the orders ensure that SOCA and others that inherit the civil recovery functions have the same information gateways as were available to the Assets Recovery Agency. There is no change in policy. The orders are not giving SOCA or any other agency powers or functions that were not previously available to the Assets Recovery Agency.&quot;<i>&mdash;&mdash;</i>[<i>Official Report, Fifth Delegated Legislation Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2008-06-24">24 June 2008</phrase>; c. 4.]</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/14">During the consideration of the two orders, I highlighted the fact that one of the orders went beyond the rights that had been enjoyed by the ARA. The inbound order&mdash;it permitted information to be disclosed to SOCA&mdash;was limited to conducting asset recovery functions. However, the general outbound disclosure provision, meaning the provision on disclosure by SOCA to certain specified third parties, was not limited specifically to asset recovery functions, but applied generally to SOCA functions. I made that point in Committee and the Minister kindly said that he would look at the matter, as he has done previously when technical problems have been highlighted, and investigate whether the explanatory notes or statements on the statutory order were correct.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/15">On my review and interpretation of the orders, there was an extension, and the approach was wider than asset recovery functions. The Minister e-mailed me <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-16">16 July 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The intention when the Assets Recovery Agency...was abolished and certain of its functions were inherited by SOCA was that SOCA should also inherit the same powers, including powers to disclose information. The Order's operation goes beyond the narrow policy intention.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/17">He added:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/18" class="indent">&quot;I do not want SOCA to lose an information sharing provision unless there are reasonable counter-arguments. I am therefore content for the gateway provisions to have their broad application, although I accept that this goes beyond the original stated policy intention.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/19">I countered by saying that although I understood the Minister's points, I felt that our considerations, including statements and explanatory notes, did not adequately set out what the provisions actually achieved. I felt that the House should have that corrected and that a restatement should be made. The Minister made some reasonable points on whether SOCA should have general information gateways to disclose certain pieces of information on prevention of harm and financial crimes to other agencies to investigate, but I wanted people to have the opportunity to decide whether that was appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/20">The point is that the situation was not as was stated. I therefore replied to the Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July</phrase> pointing out that that approach was not the way forward, that further consideration was appropriate and that one of the orders appeared to limit and restrict rights to asset recovery whereas the other did not. The Minister kindly took on board my points and said that he would revoke the order. He commented:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/21" class="indent">&quot;These gateways, I am sure you will agree, are important for the fight against serious organised crime. In order to address your concerns we shall be laying a new Order revoking the existing one so as to allow for a full explanation and debate on the effect of the statutory instrument.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/22">The Minister, whom I entirely respect, was true to his word and tried to do that, so that we could have the debate. However, having tried to go down that route he was, I believe, advised&mdash;as I am sure that he will explain to the House today&mdash;that unfortunately, for various technical and procedural reasons, it was not possible to do so, and that the best means of debating the issue and putting it on record and correcting in some ways what had been said before was an Adjournment debate. That is why I am using the House's time to correct some of what has been said and to achieve clarity. I do not believe that there was an intention to give a false impression or not to state the ambit and operation of the orders correctly. However, as a consequence of the statements and explanatory notes, an impression may have been given&mdash;I believe it was given&mdash;that the outbound order was more limited than it was.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/23">The issues that we are debating are technical and procedural. It is important that SOCA should have the right powers to do its job effectively. Will the Minister explain how he believes the extension in question will help it with its activities, through the information gateway that the two orders provide? How has the power been used to date? Prior to June it did not exist. The Minister explained to me in a further letter of <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-06">6 October 2008</phrase> that</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/24" class="indent">&quot;SOCA did not specifically request an extension of their general gateways to cover onward disclosure in respect of protecting public health and the functions of the Financial Services Authority under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/25">However, he said that he believed that it would be</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/26" class="indent">&quot;inconsistent...to have different...gateways for different purposes&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/27">albeit that, as I have said, the inbound information gateway has that slight distinction.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/28">Before I finish, there are a few more general points, one of which concerns the measurement of performance. During consideration by the Public Accounts Committee of the National Audit Office report, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March 2007</phrase>, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase> asked the Comptroller and Auditor General:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/29" class="indent">&quot;Can you reassure us that when your unit&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/30">the ARA&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/31" class="indent">&quot;is merged with SOCA and the other units, we will still be able to assess for example whether the costs spent on this unit exceed or is less than the assets recovered? Will we still be able to do that exercise?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/32">He followed that up with:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/33" class="indent">&quot;One of the criteria of the PAC, and I know it is a crude one, to assess value for money is whether the cost spent exceeds the amount of assets recovered. When this unit merges, will you still be able to do that task?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/34">Sir John Bourn, the Comptroller and Auditor General, answered:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/35" class="indent">&quot;Yes. It should have a proper system of management accounts which will provide that information and we shall see that it does have.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/36">I have recently received a parliamentary answer from the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" name="Alan Campbell">the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/37" class="indent">&quot;Information on the application of civil recovery and taxation powers under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 will be published by the Serious Organised Crime Agency as part of its annual report. The presentation of this data will be aligned with SOCA's reporting on its existing asset recovery powers and as such will not make use of older formats. SOCA has not inherited all of the Asset Recovery Agency's asset recovery powers and, unlike ARA, SOCA will not be the sole agency exercising civil recovery powers. Any like-for-like comparisons with ARA's past achievements will therefore be inhibited.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-11-10.810"><i>Official Report</i>, 10 November 2008; Vol. 482, c. 810W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/38">I take what is said in that answer, but the question remains whether there will be a level of transparency that allows an assessment of costs recovered and spent.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/39">The National Audit Office raised certain recommendations, as I said previously, with recommendation (b) requiring that the case management system be developed. The NAO commented:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/40" class="indent">&quot;Once this is established, the Agency should use the data collected to help inform case selection and prioritisation and to review its performance measurement regime so that it incorporates targets that are measurable, challenging and achievable, such as reducing the cost and time per case.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/41">A further parliamentary answer from the Under-Secretary confirmed:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/42" class="indent">&quot;SOCA has implemented Recommendations (a) to (d) of the NAO report.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/43">On recommendation (b) he added:</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/44" class="indent">&quot;SOCA has case management systems in place which contain all relevant management information.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-11-10.811"><i>Official Report</i>, 10 November 2008; Vol. 482, c. 811W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/45">My question to the Minister today is not simply whether the case management is in place, but equally whether what are described as &quot;measurable, challenging and achievable&quot; performance measurements are equally in place and will be published so that there can be appropriate scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/46">A general issue of disclosure arises. I have covered some quite narrow issues in relation to the disclosure gateways, but I note from a statement yesterday from the Ministry of Justice that that Department proposes to</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/47" class="indent">&quot;confer a power upon the Secretary of State to permit or require the sharing of personal information between particular specified persons, where a robust case for doing so exists.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2008-11-24.39"><i>Official Report</i>, 24 November 2008; Vol. 483, c. 39WS</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.213.1/48">On my reading, that announcement would appear to apply a very general and broad-brush approach to data sharing. Will the Minister clarify whether he has had any discussions with his colleagues in the Ministry of Justice about the application of what appear to be quite wide-ranging powers to SOCA or any other agencies, given that I data sharing needs to be tightly defined for specific purposes?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-25b.225.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Minister for Schools and Learners"  colnum="225"  time="013:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081125/halltext/81125h0011.htm#08112562000749">
	<p pid="b.225.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. It is an important topic that has affected many learners up and down the country. As he said, the experience has been wholly unsatisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.0/2">The Government are committed to giving every young person the best possible standard of education, to bring out their talents and give them the skills for a prosperous and satisfying career. To achieve that ambition, we are committed to removing all barriers that hold people back from success. That is why we introduced the education maintenance allowance in the first place&mdash;to ensure that financial constraints are not a barrier to learning&mdash;and it has had some success.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.0/3">Evaluation of the initial EMA pilots showed that the scheme led to increases in participation of 3.8 per cent. for 16-year-olds and 4.1 per cent. for 17-year-olds. That is why I am so deeply disappointed with the recent delays in getting grants out to students, and I can well understand their frustrations and the frustrations of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.0/4">Throughout this period, our first priority has been learners and ensuring that systems are put in place to process payments as quickly as possible. Paying the remaining grants continues to be my top priority. Since the beginning of September, I have received daily delivery statistics from the LSC, based on information provided by its contractor, Liberata. Last week, I wrote to the Chairman of the Children, Schools and Families Committee, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1645" name="Barry Sheerman">the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman)</phrase> and laid a written ministerial statement outlining progress and next steps, based on the information provided to me by the LSC, which was in turn provided to it by Liberata.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.0/5">However, during the LSC's work to migrate the contract and systems, it found that the method used by Liberata to calculate work in progress was not sufficiently accurate. I was informed yesterday evening by the LSC that the recent figure for outstanding applications provided by the LSC and cited in my letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-19">19 November</phrase> and repeated in my written ministerial statement to the House is not correct. I am grateful for the opportunity to correct that now. A physical count by Liberata recorded approximately 26,200 applications that are in the process of being finalised as of <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-21">21 November</phrase>&mdash;not 12,016, as stated in my letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.0/6">That is unacceptable, but we are continuing to make progress. I am advised that 6,000 applications are being processed per day, with a net reduction of 3,000 per day. We expect the backlog of applications to be all but cleared in the next three weeks. I have written to the Chairman of the Children, Schools and Families Committee today to clarify the position. I wish to put those revised figures on the record now.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.0/7">I have also written to the chief executive of the LSC&mdash;much mentioned this afternoon&mdash;asking for a full explanation why its contract monitoring did not reveal the problem sooner, and seeking reassurance that the new contract management arrangements that it is putting in place will avoid such problems in the future. I have asked it to review other figures and processes, to ensure that the figures that it provides me with are robust and accurate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-25b.229.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" speakername="Robert Wilson" colnum="229"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081125/halltext/81125h0011.htm#08112562000754">
	<p pid="b.229.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this important debate. I thank the Minister for her interest and engagement. We have already had discussions, and I am sure that she will do what she can to ensure that lessons are learned by the various agencies involved. My remarks today will focus on the personal experience that two of my constituents have had of the current system of managing a paedophile in their local area.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/2">David Cullen was a high-risk, highly dangerous paedophile, and well known to all the local agencies, yet he managed on numerous occasions to offend and reoffend, imparting desolation and destruction on families as a result. I find him a sickening individual, and I want everybody to be in no doubt at all that he caused so much heartache and distress.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/3">Due to the horrendous experience of my constituents, I shall protect their anonymity and refer to them as Suzie Smith and her son. Hon. Members can judge for themselves whether the system worked for them. What I would ideally like from the Minister today is a pledge that a review or inquiry will take place into what has gone wrong, if anything, in this case. I hope that, in due course, recommendations can be made to ensure better handling and monitoring of paedophiles in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/4">I am not here today to attack the police, social services in Abingdon or the Crown Prosecution Service. The work that they undertake is complex and fraught with difficulties, and I have great admiration for what they do, but that should not stop questions being asked when things go wrong. My task is to ask those questions and to see whether we can come up with answers and solutions. That is the only way in which things can be improved. I am therefore delighted by the reaction of the CPS, which I shall come to later.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/5">However, I have been slightly less delighted by the reaction of Thames Valley police. I usually have nothing but praise for its work, and I am one of its greatest advocates, but I was taken aback by its reaction to my involvement in the case. I shall not go into detail, because I do not think that it would be helpful on this occasion, so all I will say is that I am here to represent my constituents without fear or favour and to ensure that their legitimate concerns are heard. I have listened to the view of Thames Valley police and read its briefings, none of which substantially differ in detail from the view put to me by the victim's mother.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/6">I am in no doubt that the police did not fully disclose information about David Cullen to Suzie and her son. I am also aware of at least one other family to whom information was not fully disclosed, as it should have been. If the police have other information, I would be more than happy to look at it, but the bottom line is that they have to be accountable, as do we all&mdash;I believe that they accept that. I know that the police plan to undertake a review of the case, which I welcome. However, independent scrutiny across all the agencies involved is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/7">The story begins in June 2005, when Suzie returned to Britain from Spain with her four sons after leaving her husband because of domestic violence. She initially lived in a refuge, but was then housed in an Oxfordshire village north of Reading. In January 2006, she answered an advert in a local shop window asking for help for a widowed man who was responsible for two disabled children. As she had had several years' experience running a business providing carers, she applied and met David Cullen. As is the case with paedophiles, Cullen had a believable&mdash;some would say heart-rending&mdash;story. He appeared to be lonely man who was struggling to do his best. Suzie and Cullen became friends. At that stage, the only mention that he made of his past was that the local social services made his life difficult.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/8">The authorities knew that David Cullen was one of the most dangerous men in Britain, as far as children were concerned. Even at that early stage, questions surfaced that require answers. There are legal restrictions on the case, so I shall not say all the things that I would like to say, but why did a court put this man in a position where he had ready access to young children, and little boys in particular? He used his status as a widowed carer to access kind and caring families with children. Thames Valley police and social services have confirmed to me that they suspect that he was using those in his care to access other children.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/9">The friendship developed. Suzie was accompanied by her son when, for example, she took meals to Cullen's house. On one occasion when that happened, her son was seen by a social worker who was in the house talking to Cullen. Apparently the social worker internally raised the alarm that Cullen, a convicted paedophile, was having unsupervised access to a young child. No contact was made with Suzie, and no attempt was made to track her down, as far as we know. Why would social services not have tried to warn Suzie that she was allowing her son to enter the home of a convicted paedophile with a known strong desire for prepubescent boys? If they tried, what form did the attempts take, and how determined were they?</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/10">In April 2006, Cullen told Suzie that he was having renewed problems with social services. She was sympathetic, because her former professional career gave her first-hand experience of social services. Then things became more serious, and Cullen told her that he needed to discuss something with her. He told her that several years earlier he had gone to a nightclub with a young man he believed to be 19 years old. When the club closed, they went back to the young man's house and were becoming physically intimate on the sofa when the teenager's mother burst in and caught them in a sexual act. Cullen said that the mother told him her son was under age. He said that he went to court, was prosecuted and, in his words, &quot;put away&quot;. He also confessed that he had convictions for other offences including fraud and theft.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/11">Suzie broke off contact but Cullen craftily used disabled children to weaken her resolve. During that time, he was involved with the sea scouts in Henley. He was seen by a retired police officer who recognised him and alerted the police. As a result, an officer rang Suzie. He asked if Cullen had spoken to her, and she said yes. The officer never checked what Cullen had told her, but seemed satisfied with her answer. Social services then got in touch to ask the same question. Again, they did not ask her exactly what Cullen had disclosed in his chat, and they seemed satisfied that her children were not at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/12">It appears that both the police and the social services asked guarded questions about Cullen, whom they knew was a convicted paedophile. According to my constituent, they never gave her a clear and explicit warning about him until June 2006, three months after her son had been raped. That warning came only because the police were concerned about the safety of another boy and wanted Suzie's help.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/13">Finally, Suzie was told the true nature of Cullen's convictions. When she told social services the version Cullen had given her, they said, &quot;We knew that he had been lying to parents.&quot; I find that disturbing. If they knew that he was lying to parents, as a paedophile normally would be expected to do, why did they not take action? When the police were asked why Suzie was not explicitly told about Cullen, they explained that he had human rights and that they had trusted him to come completely clean about his past. It appears that, to some extent, both the police and social services relied on nods and winks rather than a full-blown formal warning about the full extent of Cullen's past. Suzie had been completely taken in by Cullen but the authorities did not appear to feel it appropriate to issue a detailed warning about his past.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/14">We need to know and understand why that happened. There may well be a reasonable explanation, but we need to hear it. What was stopping the police and social services from giving such a warning? What human rights were involved? Why was a duplicitous paedophile expected to tell Suzie the truth? Which legislation got in the way of full disclosure to Suzie so that she could protect her son? Did the police and social services correctly interpret it?</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/15">When Suzie's son heard about another boy in danger, he told Suzie that Cullen had been touching and hurting him and that he was afraid that he was doing it to another boy. There are further questions for social services about the other boy as well. He was already on the at-risk register but was apparently put in harm's way despite his own family's neglect and their relationship with Cullen.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/16">I do not wish to apportion blame. Again, social services may well have a perfectly reasonable explanation. When Suzie's son came forward, the police and social services were immediately called in, but it was six months after the rape that her son told them about it. According to Suzie, the police at first did not take this seriously and things were muddied by Cullen's claiming that Suzie was blackmailing him about this. It was only when her son sent a letter to the CPS that a decision was made to charge Cullen. But it was not until January 2007 that he was arrested and charged. Incredibly, he was released on bail and within two days he had raped again. Why did it take such a fight to get her son's case to be taken seriously when the police and CPS knew about Cullen's background? Why, after being charged with a boy's rape, was Cullen allowed out of remand within a few days to rape again? Apparently, Cullen was not even under surveillance.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/17">Then the CPS decided that Suzie's son's rape case would lie on file as part of a deal with Cullen's legal team. Shockingly, the CPS did not even consult the victim or his mother. I am pleased that the CPS has apologised for this, but on top of everything else, its action was a devastating blow to the family. It made them feel they were not believed by the police or the CPS. The CPS wanted her son's case to lie on the file and never be heard in court as part of a plea bargain, but she fought, with my help, for it to be put to Cullen at his hearing, where Cullen pleaded guilty to raping Suzie's son. Suzie feels that if I had not become involved and, as she put it, knocked a few heads together, she would not have got justice for her son.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/18">In addition to the questions that I have asked, Suzie wants an inquiry into why a dangerous paedophile like Cullen was allowed to live in the midst of a small village community with none of the families with children warned. What special precautions did the authorities take to ensure the safety of those families? If precautions were taken, why did those precautions have no effect? Why was Cullen allowed to have unsupervised access to young children when the police&mdash;an individual officer was, apparently, overseeing his case&mdash;and social services both knew he was a serious danger? Why was he was allowed to drive round in a blacked-out multi-purpose vehicle, when his previous offences included incidents in cars? But most of all, Suzie wants to know why she was not explicitly warned of the danger that he posed to her children. Her son was abused on 25 occasions.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/19">I do not expect the Minister to have all the answers, although we have spoken about this matter before today. However, I hope that she will focus on this family's terrible ordeal. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that mistakes have occurred and that lessons can be learned. But only those in government can act to make sure others are not left vulnerable to dangerous paedophiles like David Cullen.</p>

	<p pid="b.235.0/1">I know that the Minister cannot talk about the specific case, but I am a little concerned that Thames Valley police's warning to Suzie was that she should speak to Cullen. In the light of what she said, that warning does not seem to have been sufficient under its powers of disclosure. Did it make a mistake?</p>
