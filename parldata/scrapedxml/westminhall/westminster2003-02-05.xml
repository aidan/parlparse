	<p>I am grateful for this timely opportunity to raise the issue of Gulf war illness. My purpose is simple: I want to ensure that our troops are not exposed to any unnecessary risks to their health, as they were in the 1991 Gulf war, if and when they are engaged in hostilities in or near Iraq. I hope and pray that such a war never has to take place, but if it does, I would never forgive myself had I not drawn attention to the lessons of the last war. I know that I speak for many others. I am a member of the Royal British Legion Gulf war group, and am only too well aware of the suffering of so many veterans in that conflict. I am delighted that the hon. Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates), who is also on that group, is present, as are several hon. Members from all parties who share my anxiety.</p>
	<p>Clearly this is an appropriate moment to pay tribute to that group and to the veterans' associations. I must especially thank Colonel Terry English, chairman of the group and Royal British Legion director of welfare, and Professor Malcolm Hooper of the university of Sunderland, for their help in bringing together so much evidence for the debate. I also pay tribute to Lord Morris of Manchester, who has been a determined and persistent supporter of all Gulf war veterans. Recent ministerial answers to his questions in the other place have increased, rather then dispersed, our concerns.</p>
	<p>Why should we be worried, because surely the Ministry of Defence is capable of managing the inoculation programme, the application of pesticides and any other possible threat to the long-term health of our troops? I hope so, but frankly the omens are not encouraging. Organophosphate pesticides are extremely dangerous chemicals, as the House knows. They were originally developed by the Nazis in the second world war. From my long-term involvement as chairman of the all-party organophosphate parliamentary group, I am aware that they are now supposedly subject to rigorous controls. However, it was not always so.</p>
	<p>Despite ever louder warnings from medical and environmental scientists, it was only in the late 1980s that the Health and Safety Executive issued a comprehensive advice sheet on the dangers. In the early 1990s, I established that other Departments were totally unaware of the serious risks of both acute and chronic health hazards. Even farmers, who were forced to use them for sheep dips by the then Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, were left in the dark.</p>
	<p>Guidance note MS 17, which has been updated since the 1980s, provides the following succinct and official description of the signs and symptoms of acute OP poisoning. They include</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;those related to excessive activity of the autonomic nervous system: miosis (pin-point pupils), blurred vision, lacrimation, excessive salivation, cold sweats, bronchorrhorea, cardia arrhythmias/badycardia with decreased cardia output and hypotension; . . . those related to over-reactivity of voluntary muscle: tremors, impaired co-ordination; and . . . non-specific symptoms: headache, giddiness, loss of appetite, nausea and diarrhoea.&quot;</p>
	<p>There are other signs, too, which I need not go into. My point is simply that a great many of the signs and symptoms have been found among troops suffering from Gulf war illnesses. Some are chronic, some are long term, and they are very serious.</p>
	<p>As information about the 1991 conflict became available to parliamentarians, I was concerned to know how many of our troops were exposed to OPs, in what conditions and with what precautions. I asked the then Minister for the Armed Forces a parliamentary question. I shall quote his answer extensively because it is extremely important. He said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;I am aware of only 10 British service personnel who would have been involved with organ-phosphorous pesticides used by United Kingdom forces during the Gulf conflict. These 10 were members of a medical team involved in delousing some 50 Iraqi troops with a dusting powder containing 1 per cent. malathion at the prisoner of war enclosure at Quaisuma. Malathion is recommended in standard therapeutic textbooks as a treatment of choice for lice infestation and several preparations are commercially available in the United Kingdom, including body lotions and shampoos.</p>
	<p class="indent">No clinical evidence indicative of exposure to organo-phosphates has been found among the service personnel who have come forward with concerns about their health related to service in the Gulf. No specific research into organo-phosphorous has therefore been carried out in relation to the alleged Gulf war syndrome, though evidence from all relevant sources is closely monitored.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 3 November 1994; Vol. 248, c. 1237.]</p>
	<p>Amazingly, two years later, at the beginning of October 1996, after an intensive inquiry within the Ministry, the very same Minister had to make an abject apology to the House and to me because he had been completely misled. He said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;It has become clear, as the House now knows, that organophosphate insecticides were used more widely in the Gulf than we had been led to believe. I regret that the information given to the Defence Select Committee and to other hon. Members in the past few years has proved to be incorrect.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15 October 1996; Vol. 282, c. 680.]</p>
	<p>Many hundreds of our service personnel were exposed to dangerous chemicals in the Gulf, and it was not reassuring to learn about Ministry of Defence lack of competence and transparency, but worse was to follow.</p>
	<p>Claims that OPs were used only by trained operatives, with proper precautions and protective clothing, have been specifically challenged by Sergeant Tony Worthington, who has clear photographic evidence. He has shown that operatives were exposed to massive doses of OPs and other pesticides in vapour form. We still do not know whether those OPs, apparently bought locally in Saudi Arabia, were of a type that was banned for use in the UK. We can be sure, however, that any warnings and instructions for use were in a language that was unintelligible for those unsuspecting service personnel. It is not surprising to note that Professor Cherry's research found an association between exposure to pesticides and symptoms of Gulf war illness. Parallel research in the USA is equally alarming.</p>
	<p>After that dreadful experience, surely the Ministry of Defence learned its lesson. On 7 January, just a few weeks ago, I tabled a parliamentary question that was answered by the current Minister with responsibility for the armed forces. My question was:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will take steps to ensure that British service personnel are not exposed to organophosphate pesticides when on operations in the Middle East.&quot;</p>
	<p>In view of the 1991 disasters, I expected a promise to avoid such risks. Instead, he replied:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The use of pesticides remains an essential component of force protection against the threat of insect borne disease. It is the policy of the Department only to procure pesticides approved under the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 or to seek approval from Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to store items in United Kingdom, for use in overseas locations.</p>
	<p class="indent">Those pesticides are only supplied to and used by trained personnel, who are fully equipped with the appropriate personal protective equipment.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7 January 2003; Vol. 397, c. 79W.]</p>
	<p>I thought that that would be enough, but decided to make absolutely certain that there would be no risks. So I tabled further questions for answer this week, in which I asked the Secretary of State for Defence what training and guidance is being given to British troops and hygiene units in the use of organophosphate pesticides in any potential conflict in Iraq, and if he will make a statement. I also asked the Secretary of State whether adequate protective equipment is available to British military units using organophosphate pesticides, and if he will make a statement. As of yesterday, all I had received was a holding answer saying that he will answer shortly. Having already drawn attention to the problem, I expected a direct and firm answer to reassure our troops.</p>
	<p>So let us get to the truth of it. I have a number of questions for the Under-Secretary. If he cannot answer them all today, I hope that he will write to me. What OPs have been shipped to the Gulf&mdash;full names, please&mdash;and are they all approved for use in the UK? Will only fully trained operatives be used in the spraying and swing-fogging of any pesticides? Will protective suits and other precautions be employed? What studies of the effect of strong Gulf sunlight on the conversion of malathion into more toxic compounds have been undertaken? What other pesticides have been supplied and are intended for use? Has lindane been supplied, with all its inherent dangers? Pyrethroids are known to be nerve poisons that have a powerful synergistic action with OPs.</p>
	<p>Will DEET be issued to troops? It also has a synergistic effect with other pesticides. In 1991, much stronger solutions of DEET than those used in holiday packs were issued. Will those be issued again? What consideration has there been of the cumulative effect of OP exposure and administration of nerve agent pre-treatment set&mdash;NAPS&mdash;tablets, which attack the same target enzymes in the blood? What assessment has there been of the findings of Mackness and others that Gulf veterans have greatly depressed levels of para-oxonase in their serum? What steps have been taken to prevent repetition of the problems this time? British troops serving their country&mdash;serving us&mdash;have every right to expect their Government to take all precautions to avoid unnecessary risk, but the evidence is not encouraging.</p>
	<p>Another controversial aspect of the preparations for the 1991 hostilities was the inoculation programme. Many Gulf veterans who have since developed serious illnesses have given us evidence of administration of vaccines that was at best slap-happy and at worst downright irresponsible. The combination, in quick succession, of a cocktail of vaccines, quite outside the normal protocols, seems absurdly ill-considered and out of control in many units.</p>
	<p>I am no medical expert: others in the Royal British Legion team are far more qualified that I am to deal with such matters. Indeed, other hon. Members in the Chamber have relevant experience, and I hope that they will contribute. The best that I can do is to refer to the submissions made to the United States congressional hearings that we facilitated in the House of Commons last July. For example, the evidence given to those hearings by Professor Graham Rook contained this summary:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The Hypothesis that we put forward in 1997 was that long-term changes in the balance of the immune system could be caused by multiple vaccinations. This would be exacerbated in psychologically and physically stressed individuals and also by the chemical exposures and this could lead to a diverse range of symptoms including mood changes. So, I am going to show you that five new types of information have come forward to show the hypothesis was not as crazy as it was thought originally and it is within the epidemiology and the immunology done . . . it is important because it was saying that giving a massive load of vaccines in the Gulf War could have systemic effect on their overall immune systems for many years after.&quot;</p>
	<p>I must remind the Under-Secretary of the moving evidence given by Samantha Thompson, widow of Nigel Thompson. She said of her late husband:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Nigel was a Petty Officer in the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm and served in the Gulf War in 1991. Shortly after returning from the Gulf he started displaying the symptoms of Motor Neurone disease. Nigel always believed his terminal condition to be attributable to his active service in the Gulf. Right up to his death he fought tirelessly on behalf of Gulf War illness. Nigel also repeatedly called for an independent public inquiry into what went wrong during Operation Desert Storm that left so many military personnel ill or dying.&quot;</p>
	<p>The failure of the Ministry of Defence even to acknowledge the existence of specific Gulf war illnesses has been especially scandalous, showing a level of cynicism and lack of sensitivity when the US authorities have been much more sympathetic. As long ago as January 1995, the United States Government accepted the need to compensate those suffering from Gulf war illnesses, and I understand that Congress subsequently ordered compensation in the order of $60,000 per veteran.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, the indefatigable Shaun Rusling, who leads the National Gulf Veterans and Families Association, has identified a series of official decisions recognising Gulf war illness despite Ministry of Defence obstinacy. I quote just one. Mr. Alex Izett, a former Royal Engineer, was accepted to have been damaged by the vaccinations by a pensions appeal tribunal just last December. The tribunal found:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;We accept you were vaccinated and we looked at the MOD letter 24.01.01. We note the posity of the vaccination date: we therefore accept the evidence Autoimmune induced osteoporosis caused by vaccines.&quot;</p>
	<p>That is absolutely specific. I believe that the case may not be contested further by the Ministry. Perhaps the Under-Secretary can confirm that.</p>

	<p>I have been involved in Mr. Izzet's case, and I understand that he has received a letter from the Ministry saying that it will not contest the decision, but for 12 years it has contested his case. Mr. Izzet has said more than once that he has been close to suicide, which he has attempted at least twice, because of the perilous state that he is in. Indeed, he no longer lives in the United Kingdom because he is so depressed about how he has been treated.</p>

	<p>I know that my hon. Friend has been a valiant champion on behalf of not only that veteran, but others as well. It shows the seriousness of many of the cases. Mr. Izzet's case may have a happy ending. I certainly hope so. Perhaps the Under-Secretary can confirm that.</p>
	<p>Has the Ministry of Defence learned anything from that muddle and the potentially damaging consequences? Again, the omens are not good. Just a few weeks ago, batches of anthrax and other vaccines were washed up on south Dorset beaches. I asked the Secretary of State for Defence to explain where they came from, expecting him to say that it was nothing to do with the Ministry and that the UK Government did not know the source of the vaccines, as mislaying them at such a sensitive time and in such apparently incompetent circumstances would be peculiar and too mind-boggling to contemplate.</p>
	<p>To my amazement, the Under-Secretary replied:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The anthrax vaccine found on the South Dorset coast is from a batch produced by the centre for Applied Microbiology and Research and purchased by the Ministry of Defence in February 2001. Because ampoules from the batch were issued to a large number of units it has not yet been possible to identify how they came to be in the sea. As far as we are aware, this is the only vaccine found, although a number of other pharmaceutical products, including drugs, have been recovered. Investigations into the source of the items found are continuing.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 27 January 2003; Vol. 398, c. 635W.]</p>
	<p>That is pretty peculiar. What is more peculiar, however, is that no one has taken the trouble to tell me the result of those investigations.</p>

	<p>A few wags in the press have suggested that the crate of anthrax vaccine on a south Dorset beach might have something to do with the fact that HMS Ark Royal reputedly steamed past that beach a short while before it was discovered. Does the hon. Gentleman think that the fact that the uptake of the anthrax vaccine in the Navy has only been 28 per cent., compared with 78 per cent. in the Army, might have something to do with it?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.78.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1297" speakername="Paul Tyler" colnum="78"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h01.htm#30205h01_spnew4">
	<p>The hon. Gentleman has professional qualifications and more information than I have on that matter. I am grateful to him for his comment.</p>
	<p>The critical consideration is that the Ministry of Defence knows that the anthrax vaccines belong to that Department, but it has no idea how they got from A to B. That does not give me much confidence that it knows what it is doing to its service personnel. I want to emphasise that it is our troops who are being treated in such a way. It is extraordinary. No wonder they are losing confidence in the political direction and overall command.</p>
	<p>The Ministry does not know what it is doing. To paraphrase the Duke of Wellington, &quot;I don't know what effect our Ministry of Defence will have on Saddam Hussein, but, my God, they terrify me!&quot;</p>
	<p>Other hon. Members wish to contribute, and I hope that I have made my central point. The sorry saga of the suffering of the 1991 Gulf war veterans is an appalling reflection on the way in which successive Governments have treated them. Even worse than that would be a failure to learn the lessons and to avoid repeating them now. As I said, I hope and pray that Iraq and its dictator can be brought back to their senses without military action, but if British troops are deployed on our behalf it would be truly scandalous if they were also exposed to an unnecessary risk to their health by their own military planners in the Ministry of Defence. It would be the chemical equivalent of friendly fire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.78.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/988" speakername="Brian Iddon" colnum="78"  time="09:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h01.htm#30205h01_spnew6">
	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) on securing this timely debate. My interest in Gulf war illnesses has arisen as a result of a constituency case, like that of so many other right hon. and hon. Members. Also, like the hon. Gentleman, I want to ensure that if we go to war again in the Gulf we do not make the same mistakes that we probably made in 1990&ndash;91.</p>
	<p>A few days ago, on 20 January, it was admitted in the other place, in a written answer given by the Under-Secretary of State for Health, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, in response to a question from Lord Morris of Manchester, that the current recommendation from the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research at Porton Down, which manufactures the anthrax vaccine, is that it should be used alone, not in combination with other vaccines. That information is included in the product summary that is provided to doctors with the vaccine. The patient information leaflet also asks patients to inform their doctor if they are taking other medicines.</p>
	<p>My concern is that, as has been admitted, members of the armed forces were given more than one vaccine at the same time, as well as other medicines such as pyridostigmine bromide, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used as a nerve agent pre-treatment medicine. The question is, what limitations are placed on the administration of other vaccines and medicines and, if such limitations exist&mdash;especially if they existed at the time of the Gulf war&mdash;are they, or were they, taken into account? It seems strange that we went to the Gulf war in coalition with all our allies and yet, while the Americans seem to have accepted that new illnesses have arisen as a result of that conflict, the Ministry of Defence cannot entirely share those views.</p>
	<p>On 25 June last year, the United States research advisory committee on Gulf war veterans illness produced an interim report, which pointed out that there is increasing objective evidence that a major category of Gulf war illness is neurological. The US Government at present support 224 research projects, which involves $213 million.</p>
	<p>On 28 October, the honourable Leo S. Mackay, Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs, reported to that committee that Dr. Simon Wessely's research group in London had concluded, in an article published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, that the ill health suffered by Gulf war veterans cannot be explained by stress or other physiological disorders. That is certainly the conclusion that many British Gulf war veterans have obviously reached.</p>
	<p>On page 5 of the American report, we find the statement:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Most important, we want to send a message to veterans. That science is finally beginning to unravel the mysteries of Gulf War illnesses. That this Administration is committed to pursuing new science, medical breakthroughs and new treatments. And that, finally, there is reason for hope&quot;.</p>
	<p>I shall examine in more detail the scientific evidence that American scientists have unearthed to support their views. Epidemiological studies have shown consistently that between one in four and one in five of US veterans who served in the Gulf war are ill, suffering from health problems beyond those that could be explained by stress or psychiatric diagnoses and over and above the control population used in the studies.</p>
	<p>Professor Bob Haley of the university of Texas has described three Gulf war syndromes, for which he has provided evidence from his research and that of other scientists. At least one category of Gulf war illness appears from the evidence available to be neurological in character. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests a loss of neurons in selected brain areas in ill veterans, in particular in the brain stem and basal ganglia. The same veterans show cognitive problems and/or joint and muscle problems.</p>
	<p>The Americans have provided evidence that ill veterans who drive vehicles are significantly more at risk of being involved in road traffic accidents than others. Significantly, the Ministry of Defence recently admitted to me in a written answer to a parliamentary question&mdash;it can be found in <i>Hansard</i>, 7 November 2002, column 455W&mdash;that that is also the case in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p>The heart rate measurements of US Gulf war veterans show dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. They suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, at about twice the expected rate. They demonstrate an increase in the cold sensory threshold. Audiovestibular tests show abnormalities of central vestibular function and they exhibit elevated dopamine levels in the brain.</p>
	<p>Ill US veterans have low levels of an enzyme called paraoxanase in their blood. The Ministry of Defence has admitted to me in another written answer that that is also the case with British Gulf war veterans who are ill. That enzyme is responsible for breaking down organophosphates. Interestingly, those veterans who worked side by side with those who have become ill, but have not become ill themselves, have normal levels of that enzyme in their blood stream.</p>
	<p>As has been demonstrated, organophosphate insecticides were widely used during the Gulf war, for example, to spray the tented areas and the troops themselves&mdash;they were issued with insecticide sprays. More importantly, an estimated 100,000 of our troops were exposed to organophosphate nerve agents, mainly during demolition of the Khamisiyah ammunitions depot. There is some evidence that the symptoms suffered by some Gulf war veterans are similar to those of others&mdash; for example, farmers who regularly dip sheep have been exposed to substantial amounts of organophosphates.</p>
	<p>Let us compare the American conclusions&mdash;please note that these were obtained by several research groups&mdash;with those of our Government-supported Gulf war illness research unit, which has concluded that many thousands of British veterans who are suffering from illness cannot attribute that illness to agents such as the organophosphates that they encountered during the Gulf war. <i>The Sunday Times </i>covered that subject in a story of 24 November.</p>
	<p>The MOD-funded researchers at Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' school of medicine in London, however, studied only 49 Gulf war veterans with neurological symptoms and compared them with 29 without problems. While the general health of those who were ill was poorer than that of other ex-servicemen, no brain damage could be detected.</p>
	<p>Professor Simon Wessely is quoted as saying:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;In the past we have shown incontrovertibly that Gulf War veterans are sicker than similar groups but what this study shows is that the health effects are not associated with neurological problems&quot;.</p>
	<p>Professor Malcolm Hooper at Sunderland university, however, said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;I find this research frankly astonishing, unpersuasive and&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p>this is the important thing&mdash;</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;statistically insignificant&quot;.</p>

	<p>I know Malcolm Hooper well because I worked with him at the university of Durham for some time. He was trained as a professional organic chemist.</p>
	<p>Who is right? That is the big question now. I suggest to the Government that they should combine their research efforts with those of the Americans and, perhaps, those of other scientists worldwide, to seek the truth. I was pleased to learn from the Ministry that Professor Bob Haley has been invited to Britain to discuss his work with other British scientists.</p>
	<p>We are not spending enough in the United Kingdom on unearthing the truth, whereas the Americans have taken the problem far more seriously. Recently, the Government have involved the Medical Research Council in research, but that effort comes a bit late, especially for those Gulf war veterans who have died, possibly&mdash;I stress &quot;possibly&quot;&mdash;as a result of their illnesses. I must admit that enhanced mortality is not yet proven, although enhanced morbidity rates are. At present, however, I am inclined towards believing the American results merely because the Americans have not fixed their minds and have invested considerably more pro rata than we have in research.</p>
	<p>It is becoming clear that we have made mistakes in preparing our armed forces for the Gulf war. With the precautionary principle in mind, will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary assure us that the same mistakes will not be made again if we go to war again in that region?</p>
	<p>Finally, I apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as I will have to leave a few minutes before the end of the debate at 11 am, as I am chairing a session of a conference in Church house.</p>

	<p>I shall be extremely brief. First, I congratulate the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) on the timely way in which he introduced this debate. I serve with him on the Gulf war veterans' disease committee of the Royal British Legion and I acknowledge that the Ministry of Defence is trying, slowly, to get to the bottom of the matter.</p>
	<p>I do not yet convict the Under-Secretary of some of the lack of sensitivity and urgency that some of his predecessors have shown, as I believe that he is trying hard to proceed with the matter and to get the facts. I hope that he is as frustrated as we are at the snail's pace with which progress is being made. I do not expect him to say so, but I hope that by urging him to get a move on and to bring this long and sorry saga to a conclusion he will start to throw his considerable weight about at the Ministry of Defence and to urge people to move a little faster.</p>
	<p>The real point of my brief intervention is this. There is no doubt that there was a certain amount of shambles the last time that we went to war in the Gulf. There is no doubt that there were reasons for that&mdash;we were in a new area and we were not properly prepared, or expecting, to put our troops into the sort of dangers that chemical and biological weapons can cause. There was an explanation for the shambles, therefore. This time round, 11 years later, there can be no excuse, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will give us an unequivocal assurance that all the plans have been properly made, all the research done and all the best opinions sought as to how to protect our troops, should they have to face such dangers&mdash;of course, we all hope that they will not. Without that unequivocal assurance&mdash;this is a good time for the Minister to give it&mdash;our troops should not be sent in to face such dangers. 10.1 am</p>

	<p>Like the hon. Member for East Hampshire (Mr. Mates), I shall be brief. First, I congratulate the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) on obtaining this debate. It is timely, and it gives the Government an opportunity to state what precautions they are taking if our troops in the Gulf are engaged in warfare, and what steps they will take to prevent any such war having a history similar to that of the previous Gulf war.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for North Cornwall and my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) have set out the scientific facts. I did not know that many of the words that they used existed. I am aware, however, of the effects of the use of chemicals and vaccinations on Gulf victims.</p>
	<p>I have the good fortune to have the headquarters of the Gulf Veterans Association in my constituency. Shaun Rusling is one of my constituents. In the past decade, the correspondence that I have received from him and from others in my constituency who are associated with the GVA has become a small mountain&mdash;a mountain that expresses despair and frustration. They despair because they wonder what they have done wrong. They feel that they are victims. Why have they been let down by the Ministry of Defence? Why are their claims that they are now very ill, but that they were not before they went to the Gulf, not being treated seriously and effectively?</p>
	<p>In the early stages, correspondence from the Ministry of Defence on the subject almost showed indifference. I hope that that is changing. There seems to have been a change in atmosphere in the past few years. The soldiers thought that they were forgotten. They had or had not got pensions. It was almost as though the Ministry view was, &quot;Sad. We don't know what's happened and we're not really too worried about it.&quot; It was due only to the public pressure of Shaun Rusling and others that the Ministry was forced, tardily, to take an interest and to take tentative steps to find out what had happened.</p>
	<p>Hon. Members have compared the situation here with what the United States Government have done and the way in which they have treated their veterans. The same comparison has been made with Canada and France. A very different picture emerges here than in those other countries.</p>
	<p>I hope that we will get two things out of this debate. I know of the interest that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary takes in the matter and of his professional experience. I hope that there will be a further push and a greater sense of urgency from the Ministry of Defence. As the hon. Member for East Hampshire said, I also hope that none of our troops will face the same shambles if they are engaged in a war, that they will be properly protected and have full knowledge of what is being done to them and that full records will be kept. One of the greatest crimes is that there are no adequate records of what was given to the troops, and they do not always know what they were given.</p>

	<p>I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) on securing this important and timely debate. I am aware that he and other hon. Members present have been assiduous in pursuing a campaign for justice for Gulf war veterans.</p>
	<p>I concur with the hon. Member for North Cornwall in his condemnation of the shabby way in which successive United Kingdom Governments have dealt with the veterans of the 1991 Gulf war conflict. I understand that 500-plus veterans have died post-conflict and that many thousands are ill and suffering from debilitating illnesses. Many of them are deteriorating daily, which is obviously upsetting for them, but also for their families.</p>
	<p>What has been the Government's response? They have stalled, procrastinated and refused to recognise the problem and to deal with it properly. To deal with a problem, we must first recognise its existence. The Shaun Rusling case is undergoing an appeal and is sub judice, but I wrote to the Minister on 20 November 2002 to ask what budgetary estimates had been made as to the cost of appealing. Unfortunately, I have not yet received a response. Perhaps I shall get an answer today.</p>
	<p>Hon. Members who have spoken have mentioned research. The money allocated for research is unsatisfactory. An unfavourable comparison has been made with the amounts being spent in the United States, for example. Will the Minister state for the record whether he is satisfied with the level of funding? Will he explain what the level is for 2003&ndash;04 and say what percentage that represents of the entire Ministry of Defence budget?</p>
	<p>No proper compensation is available to Gulf war veterans. There is no specially targeted medical support. The pleas of the Royal British Legion for a full, independent public inquiry have been ignored to date, which is unfortunate. The issue is of key importance, as the Ministry of Defence may be about to make exactly the same mistakes again, which would be unacceptable and unforgivable. I and other hon. Members hope that there will not be another conflict in the Gulf, but the Prime Minister seems to be set on that path irrespective of what the United Nations may do. It is not clear that the Government have learned lessons from the 1991 conflict and intend to pursue different measures. Indeed, it seems that they remain complacent. I and other hon. Members want to hear what they are doing differently, in particular on organophosphates and vaccines.</p>
	<p>A debt of honour is long overdue to Gulf war veterans. Indeed, a Government who send soldiers to war have a duty of care towards them. It was not exercised in the first Gulf war conflict. That was compounded by the fact that the UK Government have refused since then to take real measures to help those veterans. This time round, I hope that the Government will do the right thing by our troops. I hope that they will have learned the lessons and will act upon them. Surely it is not acceptable for any troops to be subject to the same shabby treatment as the veterans of the 1991 Gulf war conflict.</p>

	<p>I, too, am pleased to take part in this debate secured by the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler). I have a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, as my first Adjournment debate in 1997 was on this subject. The issue has not progressed very far in terms of our understanding of the causes and uncertainties associated with these illnesses. At the last meeting of the Liaison Committee a few weeks ago, at which, of course, the Chairmen of various Select Committees met my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend was asked whether the necessary precautions had been taken to protect troops being deployed to the Gulf from these illnesses, and the answer received was a rather curt yes. I, too, would like to be reassured that we are learning the lessons from the past.</p>
	<p>Reference has been made to the work that is going on in the United States. I have studied the epidemiology, in which other hon. Members are also interested, as we have had these debates many times. Epidemiological evidence must be taken seriously, and it is often hard to prove: let us remember how long it took to prove the associations of tobacco and smoking through epidemiological technologies. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) has also referred to the work that has gone on in the United States on the symptoms, the illnesses and the diagnosis of veterans. Multi-symptom illnesses are associated with each veteran, which makes it difficult to associate one particular illness with one particular cause. There is no doubt, however, as has been admitted for years, that Gulf war veterans are ill and have problems. Although we cannot work out the cause or multiple causes, that does not mean that we should not take the matter seriously.</p>
	<p>The United States seems to be ahead of us in this area. The Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy of Sciences, has recommended the setting up of a national centre of war-related illnesses and post-deployment health issues, recognising that many veterans from many conflicts require a unit to examine these problems intensively and not in a piecemeal way.</p>
	<p>If I may make an aside, a reference was made to Malcolm Hooper during an earlier exchange. In a letter submitted to <i>The Lancet</i>, which I have been asked to review, his title is emeritus professor of medicinal chemistry and his address is given as the school of sciences, university of Sunderland. Although that is true, it is also true that he is chief scientific adviser to the Gulf Veterans Association. I hope that we will not let the initials after our names get in the way of this debate, as we should be examining the evidence. We can all score points in relation to who is a greater expert in a smaller and smaller field.</p>
	<p>My final point is about the depletion of uranium, of which there has been no mention whatever. A document on the health effects of depleted uranium munitions has been produced by the prestigious Royal Society in this country. Those munitions were used in the 1991 Gulf war. It is known that they produce harmful radioactive contamination in the battlefield environment, and they contaminate troops who have the insoluble uranium oxides in their systems for a long period, if not for life. It is alleged that the Iraqis learned only 12 months after the war ended that DU&mdash;depleted uranium&mdash;had been used on them and that no advice was given to troops in the United States or here of that use. UK Gulf veterans have been found to have DU in their urine, although it is difficult to quantify levels of that internally. Other sorts of cancers are alleged to be associated with it, and epidemiological studies are ongoing.</p>

	<p>Will my hon. Friend accept that there is no chemical or medical difference whatever in the effects of isotopes of a substance?</p>

	<p>We do not know that. I am not prepared to get into a scientific debate about the origins and what happens to a compound once it gets in the body when research is ongoing in that field. We need a staged study, and we need to know how much of the substance has been taken in, where it goes and so on, which is admitted in the Royal Society document. In Iraq, for example, depleted uranium levels are associated with cancers in children and birth defects in the Basra region, where levels are three times higher than in Baghdad. Many other birth defects have been associated with that, and finer and more intense research is needed, as there are serious implications of using those compounds. If events in Iraq proceed, and depleted uranium is used, it will end up causing many health effects, about which our troops need to know.</p>
	<p>To finish on an anecdote, this weekend I met a young person in the Norfolk area who is going out to Kuwait today to serve. That person had to purchase their own uniform, and many of their associates had not been issued with chemical combat uniforms. That is alleged, but I have no reason to believe that it is not true, and that person is in the eye of storm. The Minister has a job to do to convince many of us that we have learned the lessons and that some of the problems that have been associated with Gulf war illnesses will not happen again.</p>

	<p>Like other Members, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) and the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon), both of whom made excellent contributions. They are demanding assurances that are being sought by all of us in this Chamber today, and, more importantly, by the men and women who will go to the Gulf area on our behalf, and by their families.</p>
	<p>Historically, many people will be going to the Gulf for the second time. I met a young man&mdash;he is not so young now&mdash;who went to the Gulf the first time round and was there for only a matter of days. He received a cocktail of immunisations, and within five or six days, he was medivac'd out of the area back to Germany, where he was in hospital for some time. When he made a claim, he found that not one record had been kept of him having had the injections and having suffered a bad effect, despite the fact that there was a record of him being medivac'd back to Germany. There was no indication of what he had been given or of the cause and effect of the illnesses that he suffered, and his military career was put on hold for several months.</p>
	<p>That man has now gone back to the Gulf&mdash;his unit was part of the logistics unit that is already in the area&mdash;but he was very nervous about what injections he would be given and he wanted assurances. I sent him a copy of the evidence given by the Minister to the Defence Committee with the hope that that might provide him with assurances that, this time round, proper records would be kept, and that service personnel would be informed in advance of what they would be given, when they would be given, and who would be responsible for the record keeping. We know from evidence that the Minister has given to the Defence Committee that our past performance in relation to keeping medical records is lamentable. To his credit, he has assured the House, the Defence Committee and the armed forces that that situation has been turned around. I hope that that turns out to be true.</p>
	<p>As other Members have said, historically the Government's commitment to tell the truth on these issues is poor&mdash;it has had to be forced out of them. The answers given have been changed, and apologies have been given. Shaun Rusling and the Gulf Veterans Association have sought three things, which the Government have failed to give them. The first is recognition of the issue that they are trying to raise, the second is for the truth to be told, and the third is for justice to be granted to them. The hon. Member for Perth (Annabelle Ewing) was right to imply that there is a moral stain on this country because of the way in which we have failed to address the historic issues that we have faced.</p>
	<p>Excuse after excuse has been put forward for why numbers of these young men and, in certain cases, women, have died. I remember visiting the United States as a member of the Defence Committee, and encountering the argument about the number of young people who have died in horrific accidents or extreme sporting activities. The excuse used then was that that was fairly normal after having returned from war, because they had been excited by the experience and had had an adrenalin rush, and, for a period after coming home, felt that they needed continuous excitement and thrill in their lives. That does not persist for 10 years, however, and people are still dying in those circumstances. The answer that was given as to why so many young people had died in horrific accidents or in suicides has now been virtually ruled out by the Americans. We must therefore return to address those issues.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall raised the issue of protection for people who might use organophosphates in the Gulf on this occasion, but that is not the only question. Will those troops who follow them be properly protected and warned about what has gone on in advance of their move into an area? Are we absolutely sure about what substances our allies will use in any action? One of the difficulties in the previous conflict was the difference of opinion about whether the Americans had told us what they were using at different stages.</p>
	<p>Those Members in this Chamber today could repeat long lists of their experiences in relation to Gulf war veterans in their areas, but the case of Mr. Alex Izett is a classic one. For 10 years, the Ministry of Defence denied all of his claims. It fought tooth and nail, and letter after letter went from this country, via me and other Members, to Mr. Izett at his home in Germany. He won his case, and received recognition with a vaccine damage award, and within days of that award being given the Ministry of Defence wrote to say that it would not contest it. Why did he have to go through such a traumatic experience? Why was his family life destroyed when, 11 years on, we have recognised that we owed him a debt? Is it so much to ask that those individuals and their families whose lives have been destroyed should be dealt with properly and fairly?</p>
	<p>The Minister's outburst today seemed to be an over-reaction to what Members were saying. To be critical of the qualifications of someone who is advising the Gulf veterans was beyond him.</p>

	<p>I am delighted to absolve you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, from any of that responsibility and from any implication that I may have hinted at. Just as you were not responsible, the Minister was not responsible, and I cannot understand why current Ministers in the Ministry of Defence will not do what many of them promised to do when they were in opposition, namely to sort out the matter and give support to the Gulf veterans, which is what they asked for, and were promised, six or seven years ago. How sad it is that, today, we are firing warning shots to make sure that our service men and women will be properly protected this time round. I hope that the lessons will be learned, but it is sad that, 11 years on, we are demanding justice for men and women who have not had even an inkling of light in their campaign so far.</p>

	<p>I must declare an interest. As recorded in the register, I am an ex-service man and a current reservist, and I am a member of the Royal British Legion. I also have relatives serving in the Gulf, so this debate is germane to me, and I welcome the opportunity of contributing to it.</p>
	<p>I retain an open mind on Gulf war syndrome and illness. I must confess, however, that having been employed in the Royal Navy in the early 1990s, I recall feeling that we were doing less than we might to take seriously the concerns of service men, and particularly that our record was comparing unfavourably with that of the United States in relation to its service men. It was clear at that time that the USA was taking the travails of its service men and ex-service men a great deal more seriously than we were of our people in the UK. In mitigation, it was probably drawing from its experience in the Vietnam conflict which, fortunately, was an experience that we were spared.</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, I was concerned at that time because of the poor record keeping to which other Members have alluded and the general lack of urgency in relation to putting in place research to try to clarify exactly what was going on. The hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock) put his case well, particularly in relation to record keeping, and I hope that the Minister will assure us that measures are now in place to ensure that proper, meticulous records are kept of the state of health of our service men and of exactly what they are exposed to.</p>
	<p>As I said, however, I remain of an open mind on this issue, and it is important, in what is evidently an emotive subject, to bring some scientific clarity and light to it. It is important to quote the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of February last year. Members who take an interest in this matter will recall that Guy's, King's and St. Thomas's school of medicine has taken a particular interest in Gulf war syndrome and illness and has conducted studies on it. If I may paraphrase the <i>British Medical Journal&mdash;</i>time is short&mdash;it said in relation to illness following war that no single presentation is common to all modern wars, that variations seem to be determined by the nature of combat, contemporary medical knowledge and important health beliefs and fears, and that illness related to the Gulf war does not stand apart from that of other conflicts. That is important because the study considered post-conflict illness from the Boer war to the present day. While no one denies that veterans of the Gulf war are ill, that needs to be examined in the context of other conflicts going back to the beginning of the previous century.</p>
	<p>We need to be clear, however, about what we are dealing with this time. I hope that the Minister will assure us in a few minutes that we will put in place the research that is necessary to study that to which our people are being exposed, and that we shall keep adequate medical records. We risk doing the same again because we are exposing our people to much the same risks as in 1991, and potentially more of them. We need assurances that everything has been done to reduce the risk that they face.</p>
	<p>I accept that Ministers have put effort into ensuring that we do not have multiple vaccination as we did in the early 1990s, but there is some way to go to win over the hearts and minds of our service men and women. The vaccination rate among our service people is very low: it is less than 50 per cent., as the Prime Minister reiterated in an oral answer to me a couple of weeks ago. The figures are 28 per cent. in the Navy, 46 per cent. in the RAF and 78 per cent. in the Army. To a great extent, that is related to perceived risk&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;but it would also be interesting to know what the differential is within the Army. If these differences are due to perceived risk, I would expect those units in the front line&mdash;the teeth elements of the Army&mdash;to be vaccinated at a higher rate than those in the support arms. I would be grateful if the Minister could comment on that.</p>
	<p>Time is short, so I shall wrap up with the words of Colonel Terry English, who has criticised the Government by saying that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;a much earlier investigation of this whole issue would have given today's soldiers the confidence to take inoculations.&quot;</p>
	<p>The figures suggest that that battle has not been won. I would be extremely grateful if the Minister were to say what he is doing now to ensure that the uptake of necessary vaccinations is going ahead a little more successfully than it has hitherto.</p>

	<p>Like other hon. Members present, I am experiencing a certain d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, because within weeks of being elected in 1997, I accompanied my constituent, Major Christine Lloyd, on a visit to the Minister with responsibility for the armed forces. Major Lloyd had vaccinated troops and had been vaccinated herself, and had suffered certain effects for a considerable time. We were promised then that the incoming Labour Government would be open and honest in all their dealings with the Gulf war veterans, but, some six years later, the Ministry of Defence's persistent quibbling over terms such as &quot;syndrome&quot; and &quot;illness&quot; and its behaviour in cases such as those of Shaun Rusling and Major Christine Lloyd fall far short of those promises and of the responsible attitude that the Department should adopt.</p>
	<p>Although it is accepted that there is no single clear cause or symptom of Gulf war illness, the MOD must acknowledge that the various ailments suffered by veterans are neither mere coincidence nor psychosomatic. Shaun Rusling, the head of the National Gulf Veterans and Families Association, has called for an independent medical programme and investigation into the whole issue of Gulf war illness, taking it away from the MOD and from any possible bias or perceived bias towards its interests. We would support that. By broadening the scope of the medical assessment programme, all soldiers who have served in action would have access to an impartial and expert medical advice centre separate from the military alternatives.</p>
	<p>Although the MOD has published figures to show that there is &quot;essentially no difference&quot; between the mortality rates of Gulf war veterans and other service men who were not deployed to the Gulf, they do not take into account the severity and nature of the ongoing illnesses that are being suffered. The widespread suspicion and anxiety about this issue is detrimental to the morale of veterans and of other service men, particularly in the current climate.</p>
	<p>I also support the documentation proposals, because we want to know what steps the MOD has taken to ensure that better records are kept of the substances&mdash;such as organophosphates&mdash;that are being used, or are intended to be used, and what vaccines are being administered to troops, how they are being administered, in what order and according to what timetable. The US Government have made efforts to improve medical record keeping in theatre, and we must do the same. Furthermore, veterans and their GPs must be given swift and uninhibited access to medical records, and more strenuous efforts must be made to keep a better record of all service men when they leave the forces, so that their mental and physical health can be properly monitored.</p>
	<p>The seven-year rule for applications for war pensions must be waived in the case of Gulf war veterans. The MOD cannot and must not duck its obligation to make provision for soldiers and civilians suffering ill health as a result of time spent in theatre by focusing on the terminological niceties of these collective ailments. I want to know what lessons have been learned from the last Gulf war&mdash;that has not really been spelled out&mdash;and how they have affected preparations for possible action in the area in the coming months. We know that the MOD claims not to be administering vaccine cocktails any more, but will that make any difference if the vaccines are still the same ones? What is the medical evidence to support the new action? Have there been any alterations to the protective kit issued to troops and non-military personnel in the light of those lessons? In Saif Sareea, there were not enough NBC&mdash;nuclear, biological and chemical&mdash;protective suits to go round. I hope that we have now had confirmation that alterations have been made.</p>
	<p>The current situation with regard to voluntary vaccinations is difficult to understand. When my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch) visited our troops in the Gulf recently, that was clearly their No. 1 concern. United States troops have been vaccinated against anthrax, yet ours are offered such vaccinations as an option. One can forgive them for thinking that the MOD wants to avoid further costly law suits, as it has not yet determined the cause of Gulf war syndrome or illness. Either the vaccination is safe or it is not, and the Government should make a proper recommendation.</p>

	<p>In the way that I have just described.</p>
	<p>As for the discovery of batches of vaccine on the Dorset beaches, it is totally disingenuous to suggest that the Ministry cannot determine where those batches came from. There are clear scientific methods for calculating exactly where material from ships emanates from, using tides and so on. It is a well-tried scientific means of explaining these things, and it is used for environmental purposes all the time&mdash;to decide where oil spills come from, for example. We could easily determine from exactly which ship those batches of vaccine came.</p>
	<p>Yesterday, we were in this Chamber discussing tragic deaths in Army barracks. Today, we are talking about Gulf war illness. Does the Minister accept that there is a growing view that the MOD appears to follow a clear strategy when dealing with these problems? First, it denies everything. Secondly, under pressure, it apparently agrees to a review. Thirdly, it strings out the process, prevaricates and tries to convince everyone that there is nothing in the allegations, despite mounting evidence to the contrary. That does nothing to enhance the reputation of the Government or of the MOD, and it seems to many people that the Government will spend whatever is necessary to defend themselves against any action or any claim for compensation from anyone at any time.</p>

	<p>I also congratulate the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) on raising this subject. He has long experience of and dedication to the cause of the Gulf war veterans, as do many of the hon. Members here today. The purpose of this debate is to address the concerns of the Gulf war veterans and their families, especially as British troops are being deployed for a possible conflict in the Gulf even as we speak.</p>
	<p>I spent a large part of my professional career as a military historian, writing about the first and second world wars and interviewing thousands of veterans of both. Their experiences were the same as, and often far more traumatic than, those of the veterans of the Gulf war. I was also a special adviser at the Ministry of Defence in the lead-up to and during the Gulf war. I am only too aware of the decisions that had to be made very quickly and often with inadequate information, and, in the case of vaccination, with the most appalling option of difficulties. That is offered not as a defence, but merely as an observation.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman has just told the Chamber that he was present during those deliberations. Will he explain why the decisions about inoculations were taken in such a rush, when the planning was several months in the making? It would appear that he is now suggesting that the decisions on what inoculations service personnel would have was rushed through without proper information being available.</p>

	<p>No, I am making two points. First, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and a decision had to be made very quickly to deploy British troops, so many of the actions taken had to be rushed. Secondly, we were aware at the time that Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological capability. That represented an option of difficulties. It is never easy to make such decisions, as anyone who has experience in government will know. I hope that if the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock) becomes a Minister one day, he will realise what the consequences of his decisions may be.</p>
	<p>Tens of thousands of Gulf war veterans in the United States and the United Kingdom, and their families, are convinced that there is such a medical condition as Gulf war syndrome. The debate that we are having today covers five points. First, is there a definition of Gulf war syndrome or illness? One of the things that has come out of this debate, as well as all the previous debates and the medical evidence, is that there is no agreement on this. The Ministry of Defence genuinely believes that there is no such thing as a syndrome that is unique to the veterans of the Gulf war. However, the pensions appeal tribunal last year accepted the term &quot;Gulf war syndrome&quot;, finding that the condition was attributable to a veteran's service. So there is major disagreement on this matter.</p>
	<p>Secondly, is it possible medically and scientifically to identify a specific Gulf war illness or syndrome? Again, there is mixed evidence. There is disagreement between the MOD and the veterans over its origins and over the specifics. There is even disagreement among the medical and scientific experts and those with a background in this field. That has been displayed today, given the backgrounds of the Minister and the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson). These are major problems, and they are not simply academic. They go to the root of the question. My hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) has referred to the fact that the United States Department of Defence's war syndrome study found that Gulf war syndrome was a manifestation of established post-combat syndrome, which arises out of all combats. That is rejected by many Gulf war veterans.</p>
	<p>Thirdly, have the Gulf war veterans shown medical symptoms and levels of mortality higher than the control group? We have just had the latest MOD figures for the period from 1 April to 31 December 2002, which showed that 571 Gulf war veterans had died, but 574 people in a control group of service personnel had also died. So, is there any real difference? We have to get into the specifics, and a number of hon. Members have done so. A recent study in the United States showed that US military personnel who served in the Gulf were twice as likely to contract motor neurone disease as others. That study must be reviewed by an independent scientific panel. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs&mdash;a very powerful organisation, which has money and political clout&mdash;immediately offered disability and survivor benefits to veterans with the disease.</p>
	<p>Fourthly, has the MOD shown a willingness to investigate this issue, to be transparent and to consider awarding further compensation when necessary? There is no agreement on this. Colleagues who have spoken in the debate so far have accused the Ministry of being slow, ignorant and more concerned about financial compensation, and said that information has to be dragged out of it little by little. I am a little more sympathetic, having been inside the Ministry and seen that it is often more a question of cock-up than conspiracy.</p>

	<p>With respect to the hon. Gentleman, we are perhaps becoming a little hysterical. I am saying that when it comes to administration, it is more likely to be a cock-up than a conspiracy. The logistical problems involved, with the medical records and everything else, are absolutely enormous. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury, I conclude that the onus is on the Ministry of Defence. It must now recognise that not only Gulf war veterans but many independent observers no longer automatically believe what it is saying, and that we may have to have, at the very least, an independent review of the evidence available from the Ministry and from the Gulf war veterans.</p>
	<p>I want to give the Minister as much time as possible to respond to this debate, so I shall make my final point. As hon. Members have said, there is no doubt that the information that is available from the last conflict should be considered rationally, and that the onus should be on the Ministry of Defence to provide that information to the military personnel who are now being deployed to the Gulf, and to their families. If there are any major problems or weaknesses, it is right and proper that they should be identified. Equally, those of us who have relatives or friends about to be deployed to the Gulf will know that it does not help them or their morale if issues are raised for which there is no scientific or medical background. A fine balance has to be struck, but I accept that the onus of responsibility lies with the Ministry of Defence.</p>

	<p>It is difficult to know exactly where to start when winding up a debate such as this. I am certainly grateful for the opportunity to set Members' minds at rest, although I suspect&mdash;I shall check my records&mdash;that all of them have at one time or another received one of my eight-page letters on Gulf war veterans' illnesses or on depleted uranium. If any hon. Members have any questions of any kind, or if there is anything that they do not understand&mdash;which, I am afraid, seems clearly evident from their contributions today&mdash;my door is always open. They can come and see me to discuss it. They can tell me their concerns and I will discuss them frankly and openly. I do not want to get involved in a qualifications parade, but as someone with higher qualifications in psychiatry and in public health, I am probably uniquely qualified in the House to talk about many of these subjects, with the possible exception of the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison), with his medical background.</p>
	<p>I want to dispose of the argument about depleted uranium as quickly as possible. Depleted uranium has exactly the same effects as ordinary uranium. No scientist in the world could provide any basis for suggesting anything else. There is no difference in the chemical effects of isotopes. There are differences in the radiological effects of isotopes, because some decay more quickly than others and produce more radioactivity. Depleted uranium&mdash;as its very title would suggest to anyone with even modest intelligence&mdash;has less radiation in it than ordinary uranium.</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend is very distinguished and promotes himself very well, but has he read the Royal Society report, which accentuates the measures that I suggested should be taken on the different isotopes, what happens to them in the human body, whether they are filtered out, and so on? A huge area of research needs to be done on this subject, and my hon. Friend has no right to say that we know anything, when an august body such as the Royal Society says that we need to put more time and effort into this research and to find new methodologies to assess what isotopes&mdash;</p>

	<p>That is quite long enough, I think, Mr. Deputy Speaker. If my hon. Friend wants to send me any documentation, I shall be happy to look at it. In fact, I shall read it with great interest, but, frankly, anyone who tries to suggest that there are medical differences&mdash;other than those due to radioactivity&mdash;between the effects of isotopes is talking out of the back of his head.</p>
	<p>I have a passionate desire to get to the bottom of any problem such as this one. It is utterly abhorrent to me&mdash;it is anathema&mdash;to think that we might be ignoring any medical effect that could be taking place as a result of anything that we have done. I would not for a moment countenance the Department in any obfuscation, any delay or any attempt to push this matter under the carpet. It would be unthinkable to do that.</p>
	<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock) will accept that there is a recognition that people are sick. There is no denial of that whatever. There may have been in the past; there is none now. I believe that if we talk about a syndrome, it is incumbent on us to show that there are scientific reasons for saying that such a syndrome exists. So far, no evidence whatever has been produced to back that up. I cannot find any reputable medical source that will accept that a separate syndrome exists. To me, it is unthinkable that one should call it that. There is no medical reason for doing so. That is not to say&mdash;</p>

	<p>I do not have time to give way again. I want to cover as quickly as I can the points that have been raised. Many hon. Members have rightly referred to the arrangements for current deployments. I stress that the well-being of the personnel whom we deploy is of the greatest importance to us. We have made some important improvements since the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict. We have made improvements in medical record-keeping through the introduction of a new operational medical record form, which is now in use. That should ensure that health events while on deployment are recorded much more systematically than in the past.</p>
	<p>Again, like any other record, it is up to those in the field to maintain records properly. That is something over which I have much less control. I cannot look over everyone's shoulder when they are conducting a medical examination, much as I would like to occasionally, but we have strengthened the central administration of our medical services appropriately. That strengthening and the recognition by the vice-chief of the defence staff of the importance of medical issues have ensured that the chain of command has been left in no doubt as to the importance of maintaining accurate historical records of deployment, where people go, what they are given and what happens to them. I hope that that will work much better than it did at the beginning of the 1990s.</p>
	<p>The Gulf conflict revealed shortcomings in medical preparedness. A number of personnel were not up to date with their service standard vaccinations. The standard of vaccinations is the same as the standard of vaccinations given to everyone in the population. An adequate body of literature shows that, in general use, those are absolutely safe. One can never give a 100 per cent. guarantee on anything, but the widespread use of normal vaccinations is well documented. It is no different for our people. What we have ensured this time is that forces that are being deployed have had all the routine vaccinations that they should have. There should be no requirement this time to give anyone a cocktail of vaccinations in the Gulf.</p>
	<p>I cannot give a 100 per cent. certain answer on that. We have a voluntary programme. Although I and my colleagues have agonised over this, I still think that we should retain a voluntary programme, despite the difficulties it gives us with differences in uptake, particularly on anthrax. We have maintained the voluntary programme.</p>
	<p>When vaccines are administered, informed consent is given. There seems to have been some doubt in people's minds as to whether they have recently been asked to sign a waiver in relation to any effects that might arise. That is not the case. They have been asked to sign a form saying that the effects of the vaccinations and the reasons for giving them have been made clear to them and they have refused to have them. A proper record of that should be kept. People may get to the Gulf and change their minds, in which case they may be given inoculations more quickly, and they ought to be. It should be a tiny percentage of the people being sent there.</p>
	<p>We have greatly improved the briefings that are given to personnel on health-related matters. Up-to-date medical intelligence briefings are now routinely commissioned for the area of the world where it is judged that our forces might operate. Personnel deployed in operations receive pre-deployment and in-theatre briefings on health and hygiene matters based on the assessment of the conditions that they may meet. The briefings include information on things such as protection against biting insects, personal hygiene, how to acclimatise, operating in arduous environments and malarial prophylaxis, which is important.</p>
	<p>There are also briefings on the nature and management of combat reactions and other psychological stresses of conflict. Arrangements are made to try to limit the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder in the armed forces. We have been trying to do that for many years. I have no idea yet whether that will be effective, but we are aware of those effects and are trying to make progress in the light of what is still very limited medical knowledge of how to prevent them.</p>
	<p>Health and safety instructions have been issued to the crews of vehicles loaded with depleted uranium ammunition and to the units that support them. Those instructions make it clear that the risks from DU are far lower than those from other hazards arising from military operations, but they include advice on procedures for minimising contamination by use of respiratory protective equipment, protective clothing and other procedures, particularly for those who may end up going into a vehicle that has been struck by a DU round.</p>
	<p>I should mention in passing that 35 United States soldiers have fragments of depleted uranium buried in them as a result of friendly fire during the last Gulf conflict. They have been followed up ever since, and not one of them has shown any signs of heavy metal poisoning, which is what one would expect as a result of such contamination. It is amazing how little effect a relatively large amount of the substance can have. One would expect heavy metal poisoning, which as everyone knows is usually characterised by effects on the kidney. So far, they have found no effects on the kidney whatever.</p>
	<p>On anthrax vaccines washed up on beaches, I must admit that that would be a monumental embarrassment to any Government. I assure hon. Members that there is nothing I would like better than to find out who was responsible for it. Until now, despite strenuous efforts by my Department, we have been unable to do so. I assure hon. Members that those efforts are continuing and will continue until we get to the bottom of it, if we ever do. However, I cannot work out why that would imply a dereliction of duty towards our soldiers. It is not a case of the Navy throwing the vaccines away rather than administering them. As a former commander in the Navy said, it is much more likely that sailors do not think that they are exposed to those risks on board ship, so they are much less likely to take up the vaccine. We have noticed that the uptake of anthrax vaccine among strike units that are likely to be deployed is very high compared with other units. Perceived risk in a voluntary situation is always likely to lead to a higher uptake.</p>
	<p>Anthrax should be administered alone. The procedures that we have introduced should have ensured that it has been. Again, I cannot say that that will be done in 100 per cent. of cases, but if it is administered alone in the vast majority of cases we can set our minds at rest.</p>
	<p>Anthrax vaccination will be given alone. It is fairly extensive: four injections over six months. Full protection is not achieved until the end, but significant protection is achieved with the first dose. It is important to realise that there has never been a case of a serious reaction to our anthrax vaccine. Although it is voluntary, if personnel feel that there is any chance of their being exposed to anthrax, they should certainly take the vaccination to get protection.</p>
	<p>It was argued that research is being carried out at a snail's pace. Indeed, the research has been very slow. That is not in our hands. We have no control over the speed of research. If people come to me and suggest any line of research that we should follow up, and there are good scientific reasons for doing so, we will fund it. I give that absolute assurance to hon. Members today.</p>
	<p>I recognise the strength of feeling about this matter, and the depth of feeling among veterans. We will do whatever we can. If hon. Members have any constructive suggestions to make to us, we will consider them with the same care as we are examining Professor Haley's work from the United States. We have asked the Medical Research Council to review that work and to see whether any further research can be done. Good research must always be properly&mdash;</p>

	<p>Order. We have arrived at the time when we must move on to the next topic for our consideration, which is agriculture in West Dorset. I regret to say that the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), is not in his place to listen to the debate. Perhaps some of his colleagues might transmit that news to him. <i>[Interruption.]</i> He has just arrived, to my great relief.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.98.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1042" speakername="Oliver Letwin" colnum="98"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h02.htm#30205h02_spnew0">
	<p>I assure you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that your relief on seeing the Minister arrive is nothing as compared to mine. For the purpose of the record, he is indeed prompt, just. It would have been sad had he not been present, as the purpose of these debates is to bring matters to the attention of Ministers.</p>
	<p>I am somewhat in the position of Dr. Martin Luther King, who once had a dream, which I am glad to say has been almost entirely fulfilled. My position differs from his, because I have a dream that is almost entirely unfulfilled. My dream is that there may come a year when I no longer need to ask for a debate on agriculture in West Dorset, because it is in good condition. The previous years have not been such years, and this year is not such a year.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Minister will already have heard many times everything that I say today, because it is certainly true of many other parts of rural England. I hope that the Minister is so well aware of the problems that he is already tackling them, but in case some of them have escaped his attention, I shall explain again the problems that currently afflict my farmers.</p>
	<p>The first is straightforward: it is lack of profitability. It has been a problem for many years. I say a problem, but for many of my farming constituents with small and mid-sized farms it has ceased to be a problem and has become nostalgia. Many of them are no longer in the business. For others, it is a daily struggle, and many of them are on the point of giving up.</p>
	<p>Of course, the lack of profitability is most striking in West Dorset in the dairy sector. It remains afflicted by pricing that neither the Minister nor I, were we currently in the business, would be able to sustain, except with the most monumental efforts. He must be as aware of that as I. Although there is no doubt that there has been a significant effort to push the supermarkets into increasing the prices that they pay, the effect on the farm-gate price of milk is limited because only about 50 per cent. of production is going into liquid milk. For dairy products, I regret to say that there is little sign of improvement.</p>
	<p>That is a long-running sore. If that were all, and if there were no side effects and no noise going on that caused additional problems, I suspect that the Minister's task, my task and indeed that of my farmers would be much lighter. A series of items that goes beyond the fundamental economic malaise is addressable, and I hope that the Minister will tell us that he is addressing those problems.</p>
	<p>The first relates to the reform programme, so-called. The Minister must have tracked, as I have over some years, the thoughts and tergiversations relating to modulation, digressivity and all the rest of it. Unless the Minister can assure me to the contrary, I do not believe, and my farmers do not believe, that the present proposals will have any effect other than to diminish significantly the economics for many of my farmers.</p>
	<p>I do not see any sign that the money that will arise from whatever form of modulation is ultimately adopted will come back to West Dorset. It still seems that there is significant asymmetry, to the disadvantage of British agriculture, and, while we are at it, significant irrationality. There is no rational argument for modulation, because modulation is trying to move in the opposite direction from that in which the Government have been trying to move for many years to increase efficiency. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us that he is working hard to avoid those dire effects.</p>
	<p>Many of my farmers went into organic production encouraged by schemes. That is no fault of the present Government; many of the schemes pre-date the present Government. They were also encouraged by some extremely well-meaning individuals, many of whom write to me. No doubt many more write to the Minister. They argue that we should establish much more aggressive targets for organic production.</p>
	<p>I have an unbroken record of having written back to such individuals, sometimes to their dismay, saying that they are engaged in a process that is all too likely to be self-defeating. If the target is set high and the production level is sufficient for the production of organic produce to exceed demand, the effect will be to remove the premium.</p>
	<p>I have been saying that for some years and, lo and behold, many of my farmers are in that absurd position. They have converted, they are producing perfectly accredited organic produce, and the premium has disappeared. Indeed, some of the produce is being sold on the open market as if it were non-organic. We clearly need to have some rational policy to arrive at a situation in which we are not disadvantaging people twice over: first, because of the extra costs of organic production and, secondly, because they are not getting the premium.</p>
	<p>I said five years ago that the pig industry was one of the few rational sectors, in the sense that it had not been systematically destroyed by the lunacies of the common agricultural policy. Alas, it has been systematically destroyed by other lunacies since then, not all of which started then but which have been aggravated. The asymmetry of regulation between the United Kingdom and competing countries&mdash;Poland, Denmark and the Netherlands&mdash;in the pig industry has reached levels that exceed those that I warned about in previous years, so far as I can see from West Dorset.</p>
	<p>I have in West Dorset&mdash;sorry, I had in West Dorset&mdash; probably the most efficient and sophisticated operation in the British pig industry. Denhay Farms was a process industry that related pigs to dairy and used cycles of production&mdash;in effect, it was in a combined cycle. It is a highly modern operation based on niche marketing. One can buy Denhay produce in the most expensive shops in Britain at high premiums. It is a tightly organised business on a very large scale. It would be impossible to imagine a business, other than the very large Velcourt-type operations, that is more modern in its approach than Denhay.</p>
	<p>I do not know how we can hope that there will continue to be a pig industry if Denhay has given up pig production, as is now the case. It is still producing bacon and the excellent smoked ham but it has no pigs, because it no longer makes sense to have pigs in Britain. It makes sense to import the pigs.</p>
	<p>When we import the pigs, we export the cruelty. Because the asymmetry of regulation is so great, countries have animal welfare standards of pig production well below those that previously obtained in the UK. They are producing pigs and dumping them. I persist in believing that there is a significant case for assessing that as predatory pricing on the part of some producers in other countries. They are using low-cost production to engage in predatory pricing to destroy the British pig industry, and once destroyed the costs of entry are considerable. We are still under pressure that would increase the likelihood that no pig industry will exist in Britain. People write to me&mdash;as they probably do to the Minister&mdash;about the need to end the use of farrowing crates. That would be the final blow. I also discover from constituents in Tolpuddle that they, as small organic outdoor pig producers who are just surviving thanks to their organic status, will no longer be allowed to engage in cutting on farm. As a result of some meat products regulations, they will have to use an approved abattoir miles away. Why add another level of regulation that will end up by destroying what little agriculture is left?</p>
	<p>I have said in previous years, and I will say again, that the crisis will come in bovine tuberculosis. It will be greater than anybody presently imagines, because consumer confidence will be affected to such a degree that Ministers will not be able to contain it, if there is a serious outbreak of bovine TB. However untrue it may be that bovine TB affects the quality of milk&mdash;I do not offer a scientific opinion on that, because I have no scientific background from which to do so&mdash;the hysteria will generate a huge fall in consumer confidence if a widespread outbreak occurs.</p>
	<p>The Krebs tests have gone well beyond an appropriate time scale. We still do not have any reason to believe that they will produce a sensible policy on badgers in any reasonable time. We do not have any sign of the development of accurate tests or proper vaccinations, but I hope that the Minister can tell us that something can be done about that promptly.</p>
	<p>Many farmers in my constituency will not be able to afford the cost of the new scheme for fallen stock that is due to start in April. The Government have talked about partial funding, but we need to know more, and quickly, because it is now February. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us that the partial funding will in fact be complete funding.</p>
	<p>The Minister will be aware from his correspondence records that I&mdash;and, I am sure, many other Members&mdash;have written to him repeatedly about the problems with the British Cattle Movement Service. The organisation continues to provide aggravation that is farming's equivalent of the Passport Agency or the immigration and nationality department, although it does not reach quite the same levels. The problems caused by BCMS cross-checking with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs about non-payments and delays have left some of my farmers tearing their hair out. I hope that the DEFRA review will lead to improvements, and I would be grateful for the Minister's comment on that.</p>
	<p>I may be a ludicrous optimist and, indeed, the fact that I am talking about agriculture in the area of west Dorset at all suggests that I probably am, because the pessimists do not believe that it will exist in future. However, I have long harboured the hope that many of the problems that I have outlined could be significantly ameliorated in the long run by a movement towards biofuels. It could have huge environmental consequences, as I am sure the Minister agrees. Therefore, in my area we welcomed unreservedly the biodiesel changes in the Budget of a 20p reduction in tax per litre. I also welcome the pre-Budget report suggestion that the tax on bioethanol will be similarly reduced. I am conscious of the fiscal constraints on the Chancellor and I understand that they are getting tighter, but industry estimates suggest that the cost differential between biofuels and ordinary fuels is more than 20p&mdash;it is more in the region of 25p to 30p a litre. That explains why we have not yet reached the tipping point and why the uptake of the opportunity to produce biofuels has not yet become significant.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Minister shares my belief and is willing to lobby the Chancellor on the point. It will be a case of Treasury myopia if 20p per litre is not increased to 30p, or at least to 27p or 28p. If we could reach a tipping point, the benefit would be felt in the environmental effects and the huge advantages for my farmers in west Dorset, and it would also make a significant fiscal impact. If the industry could develop significantly, it would add, to the direct taxation on the sale of fuels&mdash;which is classed, oddly enough, in Treasuryspeak as indirect taxation&mdash;the indirect tax, which is known in Treasuryspeak as direct tax, on the corporations that are making money by producing the fuel. If the two are added together and compared to anything other than North sea production, such as imported fuel or allowing increased exports of North sea production, the fiscal equation begins to look very different from that on which I imagine the Treasury mandarins are currently basing their calculations. I hope that DEFRA will use its endeavours to persuade the Chancellor that it would make sense to try to reach that tipping point. We are almost there. It would not require much further effort, but it would make a huge difference to my farmers if they could see that light on the horizon.</p>
	<p>I have taken 16 minutes, and I leave the remaining 14 minutes to the Minister to provide&mdash;I hope&mdash;the answers that will make my farmers happy for the first time in a long time.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.101.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1122" speakername="Elliot Morley" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"  colnum="101"  time="11:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h02.htm#30205h02_spmin0">
	<p>I congratulate the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) on obtaining the debate and on making an effective case. He has dealt with a range of issues affecting his agricultural constituents and I understand and share many of the concerns that he has raised.</p>
	<p>Milk prices have been poor for a range of reasons. Prices are influenced by world prices, as well as home demand, production levels and the exchange rate. We have tried to provide assistance for our dairy sector through the mechanisms of the common agricultural policy, but the real problem is supply and demand and the volatile nature of the market. In the aftermath of foot and mouth, it was calculated that the dairy sector would experience a dip in production and a potential rise in demand. However the dip did not materialise, and an increase in production has led to price falls. Other innocent victims were those people who had converted into organic milk production, who were caught by the same problem of supply and demand. The right hon. Gentleman was right to point to the danger of targets, which can play a role in driving policies, but care must be taken not to apply them too rigidly. If targets are applied too rigidly, production starts to be focused on just hitting the target, instead of responding to market demand, and that risks having an effect on the premium.</p>
	<p>I am glad to say that we have produced an organic action plan that contains the flexibility that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to see. It has the support of the organic bodies, the National Farmers Union, consumer groups and environmental groups. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman has had the chance to see the plan, but I can ensure that he is sent a copy. I am sure that it will be of interest to him.</p>
	<p>The right hon. Gentleman also rightly raised the issue of the current negotiations in the mid-term review. We think that the Commission is heading in the right general direction, especially on decoupling, the problem of production subsidies and the need for changes to the CAP. We will not achieve any of our objectives in the World Trade Organisation negotiations unless other countries see us making progress on agricultural production subsidies that distort the market, affect developing countries and do not even deliver for our own farmers in their artificial effect on prices.</p>
	<p>I understand and share the right hon. Gentleman's concerns about the modulation elements of the proposal. Modulation is not ideal, because the ideal outcome would be the removal of all production subsidies, which would allow the freedom to apply the rural development policy and environmental policies without that rigid framework. However, we do not live in an ideal world and, as part of a transition, a case can be made for modulating the direct support payments and putting the money into the rural development fund framework. In that way, the money would go back into the rural economy. It is an opportunity for farmers and it would use the money more constructively than simply using it for production subsidies, with all their attendant problems. At present, the way in which the modulation proposals are unfolding in the mid-term review is not logical and would work against the nature and structure of UK farming. Nor would they deliver the money in the same way to the rural development programmes. We will try to change that.</p>
	<p>I have much sympathy for the points that the right hon. Gentleman raised about pigs. The pig industry is strong in my area and I have much regard for the industry for precisely the reasons that he advanced. It has always operated without subsidies, it is efficient and good at marketing and, left to its own devices, has been a successful sector of agriculture. Unfortunately the industry has faced similar problems with prices as other sectors have. Prices are stable, but do not provide the sort of return that the industry needs and deserves. When the industry went through a very difficult period a few years ago, the Government made &pound;66 million available over three years to assist it through the restructuring scheme. It was taken up by many sectors in the industry.</p>
	<p>I understand that the Commission introduced private storage aids in December 2002, which are also designed to stabilise the market and improve prices. That is a considerable commitment from the Government in recognition of the particular problems that the pig industry faces. We are also trying to re-open some of the important markets for pig meat products that have been lost over the years for various reasons. For example, Japan used to be a high value market for a range of pig products, and we are working hard to re-open those markets. DEFRA is also sponsoring the world pork congress, which is designed to stimulate international trade&mdash;something that our industry has always been very successful in achieving.</p>
	<p>We are also trying, with some success, to improve the market for genetic products. That market has been subject to some restrictions, but embryos and semen have been high value exports for our industry in the past. When I attend international conferences, I always take the opportunity to meet the Agriculture Minister of the country to press the case for semen and embryos, so I have become something of an expert on the international trade in those products. I perform the same service for the beef sector, and for ovines&mdash;other areas in which we have traditionally had high quality and high value, if limited, exports. We will do our best to assist the pig industry within the rules that apply.</p>
	<p>The right hon. Gentleman also mentioned bovine TB. It is a difficult issue, but I do not believe that we may face a potential consumer problem. TB in cattle posed a real problem before pasteurisation, but since its introduction milk has been absolutely safe. Bovine TB cannot be passed on through pasteurised milk and that protects the consumer.</p>

	<p>I took pains not to challenge that scientific view, but does the Minister agree that the hysteria of the tabloid press and the fears of those who are no longer convinced by the scientific evidence are likely to lead to a scare that we are unlikely to be able to counter, no matter how rational our explanation?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.103.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1122" speakername="Elliot Morley" colnum="103"  time="11:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h02.htm#30205h02_spnew2">
	<p>I understand that point, and it is fair to say that we cannot predict how food scares will take hold. However, there is no rationale for any such scare, and we can demonstrate that. The existence of the Food Standards Agency has also made a huge difference to consumer confidence. The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that the credibility of Government scientists and Departments has been damaged by food scares, especially in the days of the old Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The FSA, which has an independent role, has been successful in providing well-balanced and rational opinions on food issues.</p>
	<p>We have introduced extra measures to deal with the backlog in TB testing that built up during the foot and mouth crisis, when we diverted all our staff and resources, and we are making progress. We have also recently introduced a new package of control measures, which involves the licensed movement off farm of non-reactor cattle, in certain circumstances; the imposition of movement restrictions on herds with overdue tests; and a pilot project to assess the effectiveness of the gamma interferon blood test, which is what I think the right hon. Gentleman meant when he talked of better and more accurate tests. The test is relatively new and we are introducing it in several areas to test its effectiveness. We hope that it will be faster and more accurate, which would certainly assist our TB control strategies.</p>
	<p>As the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, we also have the Krebs experiment and the independent scientific group, chaired by Professor Bourne, which does an excellent job in advising the Government. We also have a stakeholder group on animal health issues, and a TB forum on which the industry is represented. That gives farmers an opportunity to raise their concerns.</p>
	<p>It is true that we presently spend &pound;30 million on fallen stock collection, including over-30-month stock, fallen cattle under our BSE monitoring and the result of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy monitoring in sheep. We made an offer to the industry to set up a national organisation. We are already committed to collecting the money, but we could use it to put in place the framework of a national collection service. We are also willing to provide up to &pound;500 million to set up the organisation. We would require a contribution from the industry but we could keep it to a minimum. At the moment, the industry feels that the Government should pay 100 per cent. of the costs, but we cannot do so under state aid rules. We feel that the industry should make some contribution. We are still discussing the issue and the offer is still open if the industry wishes to take it up.</p>
	<p>The BCMS has experienced some problems with computer control. I understand the right hon. Gentleman's concern and we will try to ensure that the problems are addressed and rectified.</p>
	<p>I share the right hon. Gentleman's optimism on biofuels. The range of biocrops potentially has a bright future. The 20p cut in tax on biodiesel has stimulated the market. Indeed, the local garage in the village of Winterton, where I live, sells biodiesel and I fill my diesel Land Rover with it. I am slightly disappointed that it is the same price as ordinary diesel&mdash;I thought that it might have been cheaper. Nevertheless, because it is an environmentally friendly fuel, I am keen to use it. Biofuels could have a greater role to play and a case could be made to consider further the fiscal incentives. As the sponsoring ministry, DEFRA wants to see a good future for biofuels. If there is a good argument for further fiscal inducements, we are prepared to consider them and make representations to the Treasury accordingly.</p>
	<p>I thank the right hon. Gentleman for the way in which he put his case. The issues that we have discussed are important and DEFRA is trying to address them. It is an ongoing process, although I am encouraged by the latest signs of increases in some farming incomes in some sectors. There is a long way to go, but it is better to see figures going up rather than down.</p>

	Unitary Authorities

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.105.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/925" speakername="Jane Griffiths" colnum="105"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h03.htm#30205h03_spnew0">
	<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss unitary authorities in the broadest sense. They have been with us for several years, and it is now time to take stock of their efficacy and their operation. After all, local government reform and local government review seem to happen almost continuously. We have a review, some changes are made, and almost immediately the next review is upon us.</p>
	<p>County councils, which almost seem like a part of history, have not been a local government unit for all that many years. For example, when Berkshire county council was abolished a few years ago, there was much breast beating and hand wringing&mdash;if it is physically possible to do both at the same time. People said that our county was being abolished, taking part of our history with it&mdash;but that was not really true. It is true that Berkshire, as an entity, existed for centuries, but its boundaries have changed from time to time. Its county town used to be Abingdon, but with boundary changes, that rightly became Reading, which is, of course, the capital of the Thames valley&mdash;and which should be a city, as I am sure hon. Members of all parties will agree.</p>
	<p>In fact, Berkshire was an artificial county, very much a creature of the Local Government Act 1972, and the move towards unitary local government was the right approach to adopt at the time. Most counties vary in character from urban through suburban to rural, and Berkshire is no exception. It has the urban centres of Reading, Bracknell and Slough, the rural expanse of west Berkshire with its racecourses and rolling downs, and the suburban and commuter towns and villages of Wokingham district. Many other counties are largely rural but contain large towns, so their character varies.</p>
	<p>In the 1960s, Bedfordshire, the county in which I grew up, varied from the urban car factories of the south through the brickfields at the centre to the onion fields of the north. It has changed somewhat, and I would not presume to trespass on the territory of the hon. Members who represent the communities of Bedfordshire now, so I shall discuss the unitary authorities of Berkshire, particularly Reading and Wokingham&mdash;areas that I have the honour to represent.</p>
	<p>I would like to air issues about the provision of services by local government and try to reach a view on the optimum size of population per unit of local government, and on the closeness to the population of those who are elected as representatives and determine council tax and spending.</p>
	<p>Let us consider the purpose of local government. Historically, county councils have been responsible for education, personal social services, libraries, museums and art galleries, structure plans, highways and parking, refuse disposal, the control of mineral and gravel extraction, fire and rescue services, civil defence, weights and measures and consumer protection services&mdash;a heavy responsibility.</p>
	<p>Shire districts have been responsible for housing, environmental health services, refuse collection, local plans and development control, markets, land charges, parks, recreation and leisure facilities generally, museums and art galleries&mdash;often jointly with county councils&mdash;crematoriums and cemeteries and a variety of licensing and registration functions, including public entertainment licensing and taxi driver licensing. They too have a heavy work load and a heavy responsibility, quite different from those of county councils.</p>
	<p>Most county councils, because of the variety of communities that they have the duty to represent, will have a variety of representation. A county council member who represents a rural district or division may not be particularly knowledgeable about an urban part of that county and may not be inclined to vote resources in that direction, or wish to divert them there. That is a historical problem that affects county councils as units of local government.</p>
	<p>The review of local government really got under way in 1990, when the then Environment Secretary rightly said that the review of local government would</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;rule nothing in and rule nothing out&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, </i>5 December 1990; Vol. 182, c. 318.]</p>
	<p>That led to the establishment of the Local Government Commission and to the enactment of the principle that where possible, there should be single-tier government, because two-tier government is likely to produce excessive bureaucracy and duplication of effort. In practice, the process, which tied up councillors and officers for several years in efforts to arrive at sensible solutions for their areas, produced workable unitary authorities only in mainly urban areas.</p>
	<p>Outside the metropolitan conurbations, most counties acquired unitary authorities. Cambridgeshire contained Peterborough unitary authority, Bedfordshire contained Luton and so on. I will not weary the House with an account of the lengthy and at times acrimonious debates that took place in Berkshire about the future of its local government. Should there be four, five or six unitary authorities? Should Berkshire county council stay or should it go? If there were four or five unitary authorities, the existing districts would have to expand their boundaries. Would that result in a change of political control in those councils? Did that matter? Berkshire, in common with much of the south of England, is not a one-party state. Its eight hon. Members in the House represent all three main parties and its local authorities are similarly situated.</p>
	<p>In Berkshire, we faced the dilemma of arriving at a consensus between those who wanted to retain their existing political control&mdash;a natural instinct on the part of anyone who has been elected&mdash;even at the expense of effective local government, and those who were prepared to jeopardise their personal political futures, as it might have been seen, to achieve effective representation and provision of services. To cut a long and tedious story short, there was furious lobbying and debate, and the occasional exchange of threats and promise of reward. That was all done in the most punctilious fashion; nothing improper took place.</p>
	<p>Eventually, the Secretary of State decided that although the Local Government Commission had recommended the creation of five unitary authorities, there should be six within the existing boundaries of the shire district. In 1996, Berkshire county council was refused leave to appeal against the ruling. Thus were born the Berkshire unitary authorities of Bracknell Forest, Newbury&mdash;now renamed West Berkshire&mdash;Reading, Slough, Windsor and Maidenhead, and Wokingham. Although not typical, in that throughout Berkshire there is only one tier of local government, the Berkshire unitary authorities provide a useful pointer to the future of effective local government and should inform the inevitable review of local government that will, and should, take place sooner or later.</p>
	<p>I remind the House of the guidance that was given to the Local Government Commission in relation to carrying out its work. The commission was told that, although reorganisation should be worth while and cost-effective over time, it was not</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;precluded from recommending an option which would be more expensive than the status quo if it believes that the cost would be outweighed by other considerations&quot;.</p>
	<p>The commission was</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;instructed to look at representation and the provision of services from the viewpoint of the citizen, not the authority. It should take into account the extent to which a possible structure might improve responsiveness to local people. For example, it should consider the potential effect on elected members' ability to give political leadership, and on the level of understanding of local government, and participation in it, by local people and organisations&quot;.</p>
	<p>I would suggest that that part of the guidance is salutary for us all to consider, even now. The Local Government Commission did some excellent work, but much remains to be done. How wide and how deep is understanding of local government among ordinary council tax payers?</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend is making a good point, and drawing the attention of the Chamber to the fact that it was a Conservative Secretary of State who chose to ignore the recommendations of the Local Government Commission. I have two points on the lessons to be learned from that. First, is the Conservative party not being completely hypocritical when it mourns the impending demise of the counties, because it was a Conservative Secretary of State who abolished Berkshire county council? Secondly, the decision to create six unitary authorities in Berkshire was criticised at the time as a political fix. What are my hon. Friend's views on those matters?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.107.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/925" speakername="Jane Griffiths" colnum="107"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h03.htm#30205h03_spnew2">
	<p>My hon. Friend is right to make those points. The Secretary of State in the Conservative Government of the time was the ultimate decision maker on the future of local government in Berkshire. The decision was indeed criticised as a political fix, and I recall that the two Conservative Members representing the two Reading constituencies applauded the demise of Berkshire county council and the creation of those unitary authorities. It is not for me here to comment on or seek to analyse Conservative party policy; that is for Conservative Members. However, my hon. Friend's points are well made.</p>
	<p>The commission was told that when it recommended the creation of unitary authorities, it should aim to make them responsible for all local government functions rather than passing existing authorities' functions to joint boards&mdash;an idea that was considered at the time. That is because the potential benefits of unitary authorities are lost if those authorities, and the communities that they represent, do not have direct responsibility. Although it was probably right to jettison the notion of joint boards in almost all cases, the aim of making a unitary authority responsible for all local government functions, although it has technically been achieved, has not really been fulfilled in terms of local council tax payers' appreciation of how such services work.</p>
	<p>We have all failed in some measure if what we want is truly participative local democracy. The local government that we now have is an improvement on the previous structure&mdash;certainly in Berkshire it is&mdash;but there is a very long way to go.</p>

	<p>Does the hon. Lady have any data to hand on participation rates in elections in unitary authorities compared with those in two-tier authorities? If so, it would reinforce her point.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.108.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/925" speakername="Jane Griffiths" colnum="108"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h03.htm#30205h03_spnew4">
	<p>I know that participation rates in local elections are higher in unitary authorities than in county council elections. County council elections are often held on the same day as other elections, perhaps general elections. That affects participation rates. Most unitary authorities are largely, if not entirely, urban, and participation rates tend to be a little lower in urban than in suburban or semi-rural areas. I am not sure what conclusion can be drawn from those points, but participation rates in different types of district would merit further study.</p>
	<p>The commission was guided as follows:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Any new structure should enable functions to be performed in a way which is cost-effective, is responsive to local needs and conforms with statute, EU directives and regulations and national policy requirements.&quot;</p>
	<p>Did that happen with unitary authorities and the new structures? Do they enable those functions to be performed cost-effectively? I shall explain later that in some ways they do not. That is not necessarily the fault of unitary authorities, and certainly not usually the fault of elected members and officers of those authorities, but in some cases the fact that they are unitary can work against cost-effective provision of local services.</p>
	<p>There are problems in Berkshire&mdash;I am referring to Reading and Wokingham rather than the other local authorities in Berkshire. Two areas in which unitary authorities face particular difficulties are transport infrastructure and education provision, as well as the ever vexed question of local government finance. Just about every unitary authority, and many others, will tell anyone who will listen that they believe themselves to be underfunded, but it is difficult to make judgments about that from the outside.</p>
	<p>Reading is typical of small unitary authorities in that in this era of parental choice, its secondary schools cannot accommodate all its school-age population. There is no comprehensive school in east Reading, so 11 to 18-year-olds, by and large, go to school in Wokingham district. The present nature of local government finance means that Wokingham receives less for each child it educates than Reading does. The reasons for that are various, but largely concern particular needs that are suffered by more young people in Reading than in Wokingham district, because the character of those two districts is different. Thus Reading children travel outside the borough to school and Wokingham must consider the needs of Reading children when it plans its education services. Under Berkshire county council that was not the case&mdash;although Berkshire county council as an education authority had serious deficiencies.</p>
	<p>Three quarters of my constituents live in Reading borough, but considerably fewer are educated there. It is logical for any local education authority to plan to educate the children of its council tax payers. Neither Reading nor Wokingham can do that, so the arrangements must be examined again. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider the difficult issues that face small authorities when they are trying to plan education provision. Perhaps he will discuss the matter with his colleagues.</p>

	<p>On education provision, my hon. Friend will recall that the recommendations of the Local Government Commission for England in respect of Berkshire, particularly Reading, envisaged a sensible expansion of Reading's outdated 100-year-old boundaries, which would have picked up many of the schools built subsequently on the periphery of the urban area of Reading. Had the absurd decision to create six unitary authorities not been made, many of the education problems to which my hon. Friend refers would not have occurred.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.109.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/925" speakername="Jane Griffiths" colnum="109"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h03.htm#30205h03_spnew6">
	<p>That is certainly the case. My view at the time was that the six proposed unitary authority boundaries were much too tightly drawn. Many thousands of people who do not live in the borough of Reading consider that they live in Reading, because they work and shop there. Their children may be educated in Wokingham, but they use Reading to meet just about all their other needs.</p>
	<p>I have referred to schools in east Reading, but the problem is greater in south Reading. I apologise if I sound parochial, but the issues facing Reading and other authorities in Berkshire are pertinent to unitary authorities&mdash;throughout England, at least. South Reading has two comprehensive schools: Reading girls school and Thamesbridge college, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter). Just over the border in Wokingham is Ryeish green school, more than 60 per cent. of whose pupils live in Reading borough. Wokingham needs secondary school places elsewhere in its district, and has been considering whether Ryeish Green school should be relocated to meet that need. That proposal, which was considered by Wokingham quite recently, led to a campaign, run by Reading councillors and by my hon. Friend, for the school to be retained in its present location in the interests of the children who go there. The future options for that school and others in Wokingham district are being considered. Wokingham had hoped for a private finance initiative for its schools, but that has not so far been authorised. I hope that, with his colleagues, my hon. Friend the Minister will find an opportunity to reconsider that.</p>
	<p>My view is that the two schools in south Reading within Reading borough are not well served by the existence of Ryeish Green school in its present location. We are left with that piece of history: there are three schools, the people of south Reading need to send their children to school, and the money is in the wrong place&mdash;I believe that one of the schools is in the wrong place too.</p>
	<p>The families who have the greatest choice in educating their children, because of transport and other factors, tend to choose Ryeish Green and other schools outside Reading borough. That makes it extremely difficult for Reading girls school and Thamesbridge college to fulfil their potential and that of the children who attend them. This factor creates a burden for Reading borough council, which is responsible for those two schools. That means that things are difficult for Reading borough council in the present funding regime, and my constituents who live in south Reading are not well served. Education provision is a continuing problem for Reading and Wokingham unitary councils, and could usefully be scrutinised by my hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues. Size does matter; education does matter.</p>
	<p>The transport infrastructure is also a burning issue for unitary authorities.</p>

	<p>The hon. Lady has just said that size matters. I shall ask the Minister later about size in relation to unitary authorities. From her experience, and that of her neighbours and colleagues in what used to be Berkshire, does the hon. Lady have a view on the minimum size, and perhaps the maximum size, of an effective unitary authority?</p>
</speech>

	<p>It would be difficult to arrive at a population figure and say no fewer than that&mdash;or no more than that. That could cause problems. The density or sparsity of population would affect the number of people who could receive good governance from a unitary authority. The population of the borough of Reading is about 150,000, whereas the usership of the borough is a quarter of a million, possibly more. That anomaly needs to be addressed.</p>

	<p>Before my hon. Friend moves away from the subject of education, I thank her for drawing attention to the successful campaign, run by myself and by local councillors and parents, to allow freedom of choice, and to allow the people of south Reading to choose Ryeish Green school for their children. Does she acknowledge that the campaign was supported not only by the Labour party in Reading but by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) and by the Minister, who made the position of the Department for Education and Skills clear to Wokingham council? The proposal to move Ryeish Green school some eight miles to Finchampstead has now been dropped. That has been acknowledged in a press release from Wokingham district council. Will my hon. Friend clarify her position? Does she believe that parents in south Reading should be denied the opportunity to send their children to a school outside the boundary, such as Ryeish Green?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.110.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/925" speakername="Jane Griffiths" colnum="110"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h03.htm#30205h03_spnew10">
	<p>I would never say that parents living anywhere should be denied the opportunity to send their children to the school of their choice, whether it is in the borough in which they lived or not. My point about Ryeish Green school is that the other two schools in south Reading are not well served by its existence. The fact that more than 60 per cent. of its pupils live in Reading borough shows the choice that parents in Reading are making. That is their privilege, and I would not seek to deny anyone that choice.</p>
	<p>Under the Greenwich judgment, it would not be lawful to limit the geographical origin of the pupils of any school. I do not believe that the question arises. At Ryeish Green school, things have moved on and various options for the future are being considered. When the debate being held behind closed doors emerges and conclusions are reached, it will be salutary for all of us, because that debate goes to the heart of the problems of small local authorities. This is a question not of the quality of the schools concerned, but of where the money goes.</p>
	<p>I want to talk about transport infrastructure, which is a burning issue for unitary authorities. The near impossibility of planning and implementing transport infrastructure projects for unitary authorities, especially small authorities, is well known. That is one reason for the widespread support for regional government, which I share&mdash;but we are not here to debate regional government today, although I hope that there will be opportunities to do so in the future; we are here to debate unitary authorities.</p>
	<p>The Thames valley is one of the most affluent areas of the country, and as a consequence has one of the severest traffic congestion problems. It is imperative that the local authorities in the Thames valley work together to plan, manage and minimise that congestion.</p>
	<p>The Thames runs through the north of my constituency. There are only two crossings of the river in Reading, which contributes greatly to the traffic congestion in the north and centre of my constituency. Much of the traffic does not need to be there, but is there because there are only two realistic ways to get across the Thames. There is almost no public transport alternative across the Thames, if one lives outside the borough of Reading. People drive in from South Oxfordshire because they work in Reading. The catchment are of Reading is about a quarter of a million people, some of whom live in villages in South Oxfordshire.</p>
	<p>The issue of a third Thames crossing has been debated among the various local authorities in their changing guises since the 1920s, and no solution has yet been found. Most local authorities in the area favour a new road bridge across the Thames, but the more rural authorities to the north do not want it to be in their territory. That position is untenable. If we want a road, it has to go somewhere.</p>
	<p>In transport planning, as hon. Members will know, there is never one solution to a problem. There is always a range, each of which will do something&mdash;but not everything&mdash;to reduce congestion and make journeys easier. My own solution is a light rail system. Light rail is an excellent transport mode for urban areas such as greater Reading. In Reading, we are greatly envious of the excellent system enjoyed by Croydon&mdash;and we felt better able to commiserate with Croydon when both towns failed to achieve city status. We will get over it.</p>
	<p>Light rail, however, is unlikely to provide a good solution in sparsely populated rural areas. That is why the Berkshire unitary authorities, and the neighbouring authorities in Oxfordshire, cannot agree. While they fail to agree, traffic congestion increases week by week. Parts of my constituency, such as central and east Reading, achieve&mdash;if that is the word&mdash;severe pollution and dangerously low air quality on far too many days of the year. All the best efforts of Reading borough council to encourage alternative modes of transport, excellent though they are, will never remove the problem. Unitary authorities will never be able to plan transport infrastructure effectively acting alone, because there are too many factors beyond their control.</p>
	<p>Upon the demise of Berkshire county council, a body was set up&mdash;the Reading urban area package, comprising Reading, Wokingham and West Berkshire councils. If small unitary authorities were really the answer, why was the package necessary? The Reading urban area package does some very useful work of benefit to all, which none of the unitaries could have done alone. This is not an argument for the return of Berkshire county council&mdash;far from it. Unitary authorities need to join together to achieve outcomes that are of benefit to all. It may be difficult for them, with different political colours and strategies, much like the three councils that I have just mentioned.</p>

	<p>Is the hon. Lady sure that she has drawn the right conclusion? She said that she was not calling for the return of Berkshire, but that the unitary authorities within the county were too small.

	<p>Our experience in Berkshire leads to my strong conviction that a county council model is not the right solution. I will not waver from that. I tried to highlight the problems faced by small unitary authorities. If they were larger&mdash;obviously there would be fewer of them&mdash;the problems would be less difficult to tackle. However, they would still be there, and there would still have to be joint working. The realisation that joint working had to take place was an immediate acknowledgment, upon the demise of Berkshire county council, that the new authorities were too small. Some of us said that all along, but it fell on deaf ears.</p>

	<p>I apologise to the hon. Lady for arriving in the middle of her speech. Perhaps she could help me with two questions. First, has the Electoral Commission reviewed the boundaries of the unitary authorities in Berkshire, or is Reading making such a proposal? Does she feel that there could be a better arrangement of unitary authorities in Berkshire? Secondly, what would be her advice to authorities that do not have adjoining unitary authorities?</p>

	<p>We do expect a review of the boundaries in Berkshire, but exactly when we shall have one I do not know. Part of the reason for today's debate, ahead of any review, is to highlight some of the issues. I appreciate the difficulties that the hon. Gentleman might face. For geographical reasons, his unitary county&mdash;I believe it is the only one&mdash;has no other to join with and so works alone. I also appreciate that he might have a very heavy constituency work load, because he represents more people than most of us do. He has my sympathy. I am sure that he does an excellent job.</p>
	<p>We must find a new way to encourage unitary authorities to work together, or to oblige them to do so if they are unwilling. Otherwise, all their council tax payers are let down. Central Government take full account of that. Ministers often receive delegations and are lobbied on issues that, if local authorities were of sustainable size, could be resolved at local level, without the need for ministerial intervention.</p>
	<p>Some small local authorities own land and property outside their boundaries. It might have come to them from the previous county council or might simply be there for historical reasons. That is the case in Berkshire. Reading borough council owns a considerable number of properties in Woodley, in the Wokingham district, which is in my constituency. I doubt that that situation is unique. The residents who live there find it difficult to understand why they must pay their council tax to Wokingham and their rent to Reading. If they have nuisance neighbours they must contact Wokingham to complain about noise or environmental health hazards. If they need housing repairs they must contact Reading. That is not a customer-friendly provision of local government services. I mean no disrespect to Reading borough council when I say that there is no great incentive for Reading, with its limited resources, to prioritise putting money into property that is outside the council's boundaries. The brutal political reality is that no one who lives in those houses can vote in the Reading borough council elections. Tenants of one council who live in another often lose out on services, through no fault of their own. We must do whatever we can to tackle that problem.</p>
	<p>That was the experience of my constituents in Woodley. Fortunately, the matter has now been resolved, and I am glad to say that they are getting their housing repairs. However, such circumstances must exist elsewhere to a considerable extent. I am sure that hon. Members of all parties often encounter such problems in their casework.</p>
	<p>I would like to highlight another issue that particularly affects Reading and other small unitary authorities with urban centres that attract a great many people for work, shopping or entertainment. The people who come in do not pay council tax to the authority. Although they make a welcome contribution to the economy of towns such as Reading, they place a considerable burden on local services, for which the people who live in the town must pay.</p>
	<p>There are more people on Minster street in Reading, which is pub and club land in my constituency, at 1 am on Fridays and Saturdays than there are at 1 pm. Managers of local authorities did not anticipate such inflows of people, but they are increasingly common. Few people would want Reading to return to the sleepy market town that it was many years ago, but at any given time most of the people on the streets of Reading are people who live outside the borough, but fairly close to it.</p>
	<p>I was very pleased by the recent launch of the business improvement districts, which will include Reading. That programme, which is very welcome, will go some way to redressing the balance, but it does not entirely solve the problem. Size does matter. How should the council tax payers of Reading reconcile their wish for a lively local economy with the fact that they are subsidising residents of Wokingham, West Berkshire and South Oxfordshire councils who want to have a good time?</p>

	<p>Is the hon. Lady suggesting that the people who flood into Reading do not spend any money or contribute to the local economy?</p>

	<p>Not at all. They contribute greatly to the local economy and create job opportunities. Reading university is popular, partly because students who are struggling but do not wish to incur large debts know that they can get jobs. The entertainment economy&mdash;the evening economy&mdash;in Reading is staffed by students. It is an asset to the town, but services such as the police, and, to some extent, general emergency services, are called on in places with a lively evening economy.</p>
	<p>Reading also has a rock festival and the Womad festival, to which tens of thousands of people come to enjoy themselves. The cost falls disproportionately on the council tax payers, many of whom may not be able to afford to enjoy themselves in the pubs and clubs of Reading. That is a problem.</p>
	<p>That brings me to the vexed issue of local government finance. The population of Berkshire is growing, as it is in much of the south of England. There is a problem of data lag&mdash;a new piece of jargon&mdash;in areas in which the actual population is greater than the planned population. If one uses census figures to project house building and to plan how many people will live in a district, they will always be behind. If the population is static, there is not a problem. If it is declining, there may be empty homes. We do not have a significant number of empty homes in Reading and Wokingham.</p>
	<p>I can do no better than share with the House a letter that was sent by Wokingham council to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. It is headed &quot;Revenue Support Grant 2003/04&quot;:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;In general the Council welcomes the proposals. The recognition that the costs of providing services in Wokingham are higher than authorities in the &quot;other south east&quot; block and the introduction of the &quot;Berkshire Non Fringe&quot; is particularly welcome.&quot;</p>
	<p>We can see that a whole flurry of jargon is threatening to overwhelm us. The letter continues:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;We are also pleased to note that a number of the other changes in methodology supported by the Council have been adopted. In addition the census population data has shown the degree to which the previous data used in the distribution process understated the true demands on this Council's services. This is clearly good news for Wokingham and reinforces our previous representations on the inadequacy of Wokingham's grant...Whilst the floors and ceilings concept is fully supported by the Council the magnitude of grant entitlement being held back has serious implications. It represents &pound;6m or 5 per cent. of our budget requirement and will mean that, in spite of the good news, real and damaging service cuts will be required to keep the rise in Council Tax to a reasonable level. We cannot believe that this is an intention of the floors and ceilings mechanism.&quot;</p>
	<p>I am sharing that with hon. Members because Wokingham is a small unitary authority in an affluent area. It incurs high costs when providing services, because skilled workers are hard to find. However, low-paid workers, such as care workers, are even harder to find, because they cannot easily afford to live in such districts. That is also largely true of Reading&mdash;although we were pleased to find that the rise in council tax may not, after all, be as prohibitive as we had thought.</p>

	<p>That problem exists throughout the high-pressure areas of the south-east. It certainly exists throughout Surrey. It has nothing whatever to do with unitary structures.

	<p>The hon. Gentleman is right, and I simply mention the issue in passing because unitary and other authorities&mdash;regardless of whether they are single-tier or two-tier&mdash;tend to raise it with Departments when they discuss finance levels. I did not highlight it earlier, because, as the hon. Gentleman said, it is not specific to single-tier local government. None the less, the issue does arise.</p>
	<p>After it became clear that I would be introducing this debate, I was contacted by Telford and Wrekin unitary authority, which is very concerned about the issues before us, and I am happy to share a little of what it had to say:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;If data lag on population is not addressed the new formula is still no fairer to growing authorities. We still have to provide services to the population growth for two years without any Government support. This is not rough justice&mdash;it is a fundamental flaw in the formula.&quot;</p>
	<p>I am inclined to agree. The authority continued:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The Growth Areas Group suggested that the population figures used for the 2003/04 settlement should be updated from the 2001 data by estimating population growth for 2002 and 2003 based on the average known growth for the last three or five available years.&quot;</p>
	<p>It noted that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;felt this was too complicated and suggested the use of a targeted grant instead&mdash;outside the floors and ceilings methodology. The Formula Review Group accepted this in principle without objection and this formed the basis of the consultation option.&quot;</p>
	<p>However, the effects of the census have skewed population numbers. The data are not real&mdash;they are rapidly outdated.</p>
	<p>The authority continued:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;the census shows previous population figures used for RSG&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p>rate support grant&mdash;</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;have been understated. The Council has lost grant over the years as a result. Now that the population figures are correct for 2001, it is difficult to explain to the public that the Government is not willing to use them to address the data lag anomaly, because the previous years' figures were wrong! That is surely penalising the Council twice.&quot;</p>
	<p>Speaking as someone from outside Telford, I pass the authority's points on at face value, because they show that the issues that affect unitary authorities in Berkshire also affect many other authorities in England.</p>
	<p>The final issue that I shall mention is licensing, which will place a disproportionate burden on small unitary authorities. We may see a change in legislation&mdash;I hope that we do&mdash;to modernise licensing laws in the near future. When that happens, the decision-making burden will fall on local authorities. Much of what was previously done by magistrates will be done by local authorities, but people who live in Reading, for example, will expect the enforcement of licensing laws to continue at least at the same level. It will be difficult for small unitary authorities, which have a limited tax base, to fulfil their responsibilities, and I shall raise that matter again on other occasions.</p>
	<p>I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider those issues. I look forward to hearing from him whether he agrees that small unitary authorities often experience many difficulties, not of their making, in providing local services effectively. I hope that he will agree to discuss with his colleagues ways in which good and effective unitary authorities, such as Reading and Wokingham, can be helped to become even better and more effective.</p>

	<p>I assure the Chamber that I shall not speak for 14 minutes. I imagine that my colleagues have heard more about Reading than they ever thought they would, and I apologise for the fact that they are about to hear a little more. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) on securing the debate. Frankly, given the number of unitary authorities that exist, and notwithstanding the obvious difficulties that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) would have in contributing to the debate, I am surprised that more hon. Members have not decided to participate. Unitary authorities have been in place for sufficiently long for us to conclude certain things about their inception and operation. Perhaps we can learn lessons from the past and rectify mistakes. I am certainly looking forward to a boundary review in Reading, but I shall deal with that later.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend talked about the optimum size of an authority, and discussed the matter with the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman. I have not researched the subject, but I seem to remember that the criteria to which the commission was working, or which it published, referred to a unitary authority with a population of no fewer than 120,000 people and up to 250,000 or 300,000. I have a similar relationship with West Berkshire to that which my hon. Friend has with Wokingham, in that one third of my constituency is in West Berkshire&mdash;and has the misfortune of coming under Liberal control, although I am not sure for how much longer&mdash;and the other two thirds are well represented by Reading borough council. The recommendations of the Local Government Commission did not envisage that West Berkshire and Wokingham would exist in their current form. Two options were proposed: one was a four-authority option and the other was a five-authority option. Wokingham did not exist in either option. It is worth putting it on record once again that a political fix occurred. The fact that the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) had an influential position in the Government, which he was able to use in alliance with the then Conservative leader of Wokingham council, is a political fact of life, but it led to the creation of that political fix of unitary local authorities created outwith the criteria that the commission set down.</p>

	<p>I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but I shall not rise directly to the bait. However, I shall ask him whether he will tell the Chamber his view on the maximum viable size of a unitary authority in an area the size of rural and suburban Berkshire.</p>

	<p>I was not attempting to bait the hon. Gentleman; I was merely reading a bit of political history into the record. I am a great believer in making statements when I actually know something about the subject. I know a little about local government in Berkshire, having been a Reading borough councillor for 12 years and deputy leader of the council. My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East was a senior councillor there at the same time.</p>
	<p>I must say that one look at the map of Berkshire would suggest that the natural expansion of Reading council's boundaries would take in Greater Reading, which includes areas under Wokingham and West Berkshire councils and a few other places besides. That would give Reading a population base of more than 200,000. It may vary elsewhere. Medway Towns council is considerably larger, and it would be an entirely different question were we to look at the old metropolitan boroughs and districts in the midlands and north-west. There is not a one-size-fits-all solution.</p>
	<p>However, as my hon. Friend was saying, there is an issue of economic scale. Is it possible to deliver an efficient tie-up between housing and social services if there is an unnaturally small boundary? Can people be provided with the educational choice that we would like to give them without there being internecine war across the boundary divide?</p>
	<p>One of my favourite campaigns was for a unitary Reading in which my hon. Friend and I were heavily involved. I have still got the stickers that say, &quot;One town, one council and a third Thames bridge.&quot; It was a very punchy campaign. One of my favourite photos of my hon. Friend, and I have many, is of her holding a huge bag of petition forms outside the civic offices in Reading in support of the campaign. I may have taken the photo.</p>
	<p>Sadly, we have not got our third Thames crossing, although we have our one council. We have not got city status, and Reading council remains built on 100-year-old boundaries. We are hemmed in. We cannot deliver park-and-ride services to the west of the town without getting co-operation from Liberal Democrats in West Berkshire. Anybody who has worked with Liberal Democrat councillors knows that it is like herding chickens&mdash;it is impossible to get consensus. A former leader of a Liberal Democrat-controlled council gave me that soundbite. He knows how difficult it is to herd chickens so he should be believed.</p>
	<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East said, it is absurd that we have housing stock outside our borough boundaries and conflict over where children should attend school. I must tell my hon. Friend that our well-publicised difference on the Ryeish Green school has now been given another public airing. The fact remains that had Wokingham been able to get away with moving Ryeish Green school from south Reading to Finchampstead, the catchment area would not have included the south Reading area. Many of my constituents&mdash;and hers&mdash;would not have had the option of choosing schools, which would have been a great shame. That said, the education provision in Reading must be resolved and it is a victim of our absurd 100-year-old boundaries.</p>
	<p>How absurd are those boundaries? I have a constituent who pays, I think, 25 per cent. of her council tax to West Berkshire council and 75 per cent. to Reading council because the boundary goes through a corner of her house and across her garden. She pays Reading for a few hundred bricks and West Berkshire for a garage and a shed. It was a moot point, of course, as to whether she was entitled to a bus pass or 75 per cent. of one. As one can imagine, there is tremendous difference between the standard of public services delivered by a Labour-controlled authority in Reading, which has one of most generous bus pass schemes in the country, and the paltry token service that the Liberals in West Berkshire offer. I was able to get common sense to prevail and, despite only paying 75 per cent. of her council tax to the people's republic of Reading, she obtained a full bus pass. That is another triumph that we can tick off.</p>

	<p>No, I will not; I am just warming to my theme.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East made a pertinent point that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) failed to grasp: the burden on the council tax payers of the urban centre. This is not just about Reading; I am sure that it applies to Nottingham and to many other towns. Yes, it is great that people come into our town centres to use our pubs and clubs and to shop. Sadly, that revenue does not necessarily flow into the coffers of the local authority. Every piece of litter dropped in Reading by a resident of Wokingham, albeit accidentally, is picked up by a council tax paid employee of Reading borough council. The police funding formula is often based on the residential economy as opposed to money generated by passing trade. A great many issues must be bottomed out on that front. That is not to say that we disagree with or condemn our town centres for being lively and exciting, but we must acknowledge that the funding formulas do not reflect reality. I will give way to the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight and then to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge if they will be brief.</p>

	<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I am interested to hear that his local authority can distinguish between litter that is dropped by residents of Wokingham and that dropped by residents of Reading&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i>A different class of litter.</p>
	<p>Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is easier, albeit that it has not yet happened in Reading, to define the boundary of an urban area than it is to define boundaries in rural areas? To create a rural unitary authority large enough to be viable often means extending it beyond people's reasonable travelling distance.</p>

	<p>The hon. Member for Reading, East also referred to policing costs. I did not intervene then but I wish to now since both Members for Reading mentioned the subject. Perhaps there is something peculiar about police funding in the Thames valley. However, my understanding is that the Thames Valley police were funded by all the council tax payers in the Thames valley, so people living in Wokingham will be contributing to the policing of Reading. Is that not correct?</p>

	<p>I refer the hon. Gentleman to a speech that I made last year on police grants. I think that it may be coming up again today. It is not just about the funding of the police; it is about the allocation of police resources. We end up in the absurd situation whereby my constituents and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East pay the same as everybody else towards the precepts levied by the police authority on the council tax. In effect, because of the requirements of policing Reading town centre, we end up with one police officer per&mdash;and I used this figure purely for example&mdash;2,000 head of population; whereas somebody else will be paying precisely the same and get one police officer per 1,000 head of population. As I say, I use those figures purely for illustration, but the point is clear.</p>
	<p>We talked about the absurdity of the boundaries of Reading; we talked also about some of the problems in education, transport, joined-up services and economies of scale and about the need for a boundary review and for change. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East, I welcome the creation of business improvement districts. This is an opportunity for a little bit of municipal socialism, if we are still allowed even to conceive of such a thing. Of course, it must be done with the consent of the business community, but how I would love to see an opportunity for Reading and for other lively, vibrant urban centres to be able to levy a modest tax on some of the profits of the breweries, the clubs and the other centres of entertainment to help to fund CCTV, extra police and all the other measures that are needed to keep the population of the town centre, visitors and residents safe and secure. It is far too easy to profit from lively town centres yet not put enough back into the security that we all seek.</p>
	<p>As a nation, our record on local government reform is pretty poor. I remember my days as a politics student studying the Redcliffe-Maude report of 1974 on the reorganisation of local government. Sadly, we fudged it last time round. I believe in the unitary format; I believe it needs to be large enough to create economies of scale, and sometimes that means grasping the nettle of a local authority. After all, it did apply to county authorities being beyond the normal scope of people's travelling patterns. I believe in strengthening parish and community councils and I believe in effective regional government with real powers that could bring together the disparate boundaries that affect health, education, the police, the fire service and strategic planning.</p>
	<p>I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East for giving us the opportunity to debate this issue. I hope the Government will accept that what was done by the previous Administration was only half done, and that there is much further to go if we are going to have proper, radical and effective reform of unitary local government.</p>

	<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman; I am delighted to hear that.</p>
	<p>In principle, unitary authorities are probably the best way of delivering local services. However, local needs and considerations must always be taken into account before unitary authorities are imposed. There should not be a top-down solution. I shall now touch on the reasons why unitary authorities are a good way forward.</p>
	<p>In two-tier areas, housing and social services come under different authorities. We need joined-up thinking. In some areas that can be achieved with local authorities working together, but in general it works better in unitary authorities. It has sometimes been linked with health. In Herefordshire, before the strategic health authorities were set up, the unitary council had housing and social services under the same roof, but the chief executive of the Hereford health authority was also the chief executive of the council. It was a tight-knit authority. In Shropshire, the director of social services is the deputy chief executive of the primary care trust, and is currently acting chief executive as well. That close synergy makes a great deal of sense.</p>
	<p>On other matters such as environmental health, economies of scale would mean some of the smaller districts disappearing into the unitary authorities, but that makes a great deal of sense. The same applies to waste management, which is currently divided into waste collection and waste disposal. That division has resulted in a number of perverse effects&mdash;but again, unitary authorities get round the problem.</p>
	<p>We have mentioned the history of Reading and the local government review, but I have a great deal of sympathy with Shropshire, which suffered similar perversities under the last local government review. It has been said before, and it is worth saying again, that the pressure in Berkshire was for four or at most five unitary authorities. The Local Government Commission's recommendation was for five, but political pressure from local Conservatives, including a Berkshire Member of Parliament, resulted in there being six unitary authorities, which was probably too many.</p>
	<p>Now that we have those six unitary authorities, the problem is that Reading wants to expand. I understand that it approached the Deputy Prime Minister for a local government review but was turned down. I know exactly why the Deputy Prime Minister did that: he does not want local government reviews, except when regional referendums are due. We have mentioned that in Committee on the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill. Another problem is that the neighbouring unitary authorities are not keen on Reading expanding and taking over parts of their areas. That is an ongoing, long-term problem.</p>
	<p>Should there be reviews of local authority boundaries outside the scope of the Regional Assemblies (Referendums) Bill? Of course there should. In some areas there is demand for changes to existing unitary or two-tier authorities. In Shropshire, we want a unitary authority to cover the area currently covered by Shropshire county council. There are five district councils and the county council. All three political parties would like to see the abolition of the five districts, and a unitary authority. However, we have been told that there will not be a chance of doing that until there is a referendum in the west Midlands, which could be years away. The mess that the Government have made of their regional policy is causing a problem at a local level.</p>
	<p>We now need a unitary authority in Shropshire, because in the last review Telford was taken out, against the recommendation of the Local Government Commission, which recommended the then current two-tier system structure of six districts and one county. Taking Telford out of the equation left the rest of Shropshire without a large chunk of the population of Shropshire, which made less economic sense. We now need a unitary authority in Shropshire, to make the economies of scale work.</p>
	<p>The Government have missed out on an opportunity. The Minister needs to address how they will deal with the various demands for reviews of local government outside the regional process. In the south and the midlands, it will be many years before we get to that stage, so it would be useful if the Minister gave us some encouragement that there might be some reviews outside that regional process. With our amendments to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill we gave the Minister in the Standing Committee opportunities to decouple the process of local government review from the regional reviews. It is unfortunate that the Government did not take up that opportunity.</p>
	<p>We have heard a fair bit about the appropriate size of unitary authorities. We should be cautious about saying what the appropriate minimum size should be. The Local Government Commission's preferred size was, I think, between 150,000 and 300,000. Herefordshire is below that size, and is a successful, efficient, Liberal Democrat-run unitary authority.</p>

	<p>I am not sure that my schedule would permit me to do that&mdash;or, even if it is what is needed, that I am the person to do it.</p>
	<p>Herefordshire is a successful unitary authority with fewer than 150,000 people. If the Government are too dogmatic about the minimum size, places such as Northumbria, when they are considered in the review of the north-east, will be split up into large unitary authorities&mdash;large in terms of area, that is&mdash;in order to achieve the minimum population. Those authorities will be so large that people will not naturally feel part of that community, and could be a long way from their nearest centre.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman has spoken at some length about reviews. However, did he not say earlier that unitary authorities have to be the best way, and that there should be local consultation before they are imposed? That suggests that under Liberal Democrat policy, they would be imposed.</p>

	<p>That is not quite what I said. I said that the unitary authority was the best way forward, but should not always be the solution, because local considerations needed to be taken into account. That is why we have sought the decoupling of local government reviews from the regional process. If the Government carry out their regional process along those lines, all two-tier authorities will eventually go, for no other reason than the form of local government that has come in.</p>
	<p>I have covered most of the points that I wanted to make. I welcome the fact that we have been able to talk about unitary authorities again, and I look forward to hearing from the Minister how we might have reviews without having to wait for the regional reviews.</p>

	<p>I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) on having secured the debate on unitary authorities, although it has occasionally seemed to be a debate on the woes and opportunities of Reading. I thought that I knew the area well, but I have been apprised of the woeful state of my geographical knowledge. I now know about Ryeish Green school, and I shall take the opportunity of mentioning it to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), in a display that will astound him. While the two hon. Members who represent Reading were intervening on each other, I felt rather like a voyeur at a meeting of the management committee of Reading Labour party&mdash;but I am sure that they will sort out their differences.</p>
	<p>We have heard about the pros and cons of unitary authorities from the hon. Members for Reading, East and for Reading, West (Mr. Salter). The hon. Member for Reading, East focused on the diversity within counties and suggested that smaller unitary authorities might have a better focus. She also mentioned the &quot;diseconomies&quot; of small scale, and made particular reference to the problems of small education authorities. She made many interesting points, and I shall address the Minister about them shortly.</p>
	<p>Both Reading Members mentioned institutional change and institutional structures. Those are important. In this country, we have a bit of a history of thinking that we can solve problems by changing the institutions that deal with them. Experience has shown, however, that changing institutional structures does not necessarily solve the real problems that bother people. The conclusion is clear: there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; policy, and structure must be locally determined. If it is a widely held view in Shropshire that people want to have a unitary county, then we in Whitehall and Westminster should be cognisant of it.</p>
	<p>A unitary structure might be best in urban areas, where distance is not a great issue. I was reminded yesterday that the largest metropolitan authorities have populations well in excess of 1 million, and function very well. However, they have the benefit of high density of population, and thus relatively small geographical areas. When we consider more sparsely populated areas, the minimum size of unitary authority required to deliver effective and efficient services might well, as the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green) suggested, be too large to allow people that essential sense of relationship with the place from which they are governed that is the advantage of district councils&mdash;our lower-tier authorities in the current two-tier areas.</p>
	<p>I want to talk to the Minister about two issues. The first is choice. We can conclude that the Government think that unitary authorities are the structure of choice, because they propose to impose them on any region opting for elected regional assemblies. I understand the Government's natural desire not to be lambasted for creating an extra tier of government in existing two-tier authorities, but in some regions&mdash;certainly in the north-east, likely to be one of the first regions to have a referendum&mdash;some 68 per cent. of the population already live in unitary authority areas. In those areas, an extra tier will be created by the introduction of elected regional assemblies. That is slightly peripheral, however.</p>
	<p>It is extraordinary that the Government have introduced a double hurdle for a yes vote in a referendum. I am still quietly puzzled as to their motive for making it more difficult to achieve a yes vote for a principal Government policy project.</p>
	<p>Presumably we all agree that change is traumatic and tends to undermine the principal function of local government&mdash;good, efficient public service delivery. However beneficial the outcome of the change may be, the process is difficult. One problem that may arise from the Regional Assemblies (Referendums) Bill is constant uncertainty about whether that change will take place.</p>
	<p>Worse still, in my view, is the fact that the Government's proposals for a boundary committee review of areas opting for referendums for regional assemblies may produce a sub-optimum pattern of unitary government, because the Government will not allow the current unitary council boundaries to be reopened. In other words, the existing two-tier areas in the north-east, which contain 32 per cent. of the population of that region, must be organised into unitary authorities that fit round the existing ones. That may not in every case be the most logical solution.</p>
	<p>My question to the Minister mirrors one put by the hon. Member for Ludlow: do the Government propose an alternative mechanism for achieving unitary status, if that is what a local community wants? It would be bizarre if the Government were to say that a community must have a unitary authority if it is to have an elected regional assembly, but that it cannot have a unitary authority without opting for an elected regional assembly. If they did, it would be inappropriate and lop-sided. The Government may argue, although I would not agree with them, that a unitary structure is necessary to accommodate elected regional authorities, but they cannot argue the other way round, because unitary authorities already operate in areas that do not have elected regional assemblies.</p>
	<p>My second question to the Minister is about size. That is an important issue, and I have tried in a couple of interventions to draw out hon. Members' views on the size of unitary authorities. With few exceptions, the creation of unitary authorities of a workable size in the shires will sound the death knell of the counties. It seems to me&mdash;we have heard some evidence for it this afternoon&mdash;that a minimum size will be required to enable them to work. However, there should also be a maximum size&mdash;perhaps not in population terms, because in our metropolitan areas there are large populations in a single authority area, but in geographical terms&mdash;so that people are not too distant from the point from which they are governed.</p>
	<p>If an authority such as Wokingham, with a population of 150,000, is acceptable at the bottom of the size scale, it is difficult to imagine that an authority such as Essex or Kent, with a population of 1.3 million or 1.4 million, could be a plausible unitary county. That is why I assert that the Government's &quot;unitarisation agenda&quot;, as part of its elected regional assemblies programme, necessarily means&mdash;in some cases at least&mdash;the death of the counties as we know them, because they are too big to be effective unitary authorities.</p>
	<p>The Minister for Local Government and the Regions has gone to great pains to muddy the water on that issue, and to suggest that nothing has been ruled out in advance and that counties could be unitary authorities. Perhaps Shropshire could be; I do not know the detailed facts. What work has the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister done on the effective size of unitary authorities at the top and bottom end of the scale? Has it considered the minimum size needed to deliver public services economically, and the maximum size, in terms of population or geographical area, necessary to ensure that local government is still local government and will be delivered close enough to the people to ensure that there is a genuine sense of ownership? I should be grateful to the Minister if he would address head on the position of the counties in an all-unitary structure, and tell the Chamber bluntly whether he is asserting that a county the size of Kent or Essex is a viable and plausible unitary authority area.</p>

	<p>I am not sure whether, in the time available, it will be possible to address all the wide-ranging issues raised in the debate. I place on record my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Jane Griffiths) on securing the opportunity to debate so many issues, especially on the wonderful town, area and district of Reading and the various people living therein.</p>
	<p>Common themes among all speakers have been the nature of local authority institutions, and structural and boundary issues. It is important to say at the outset that at the heart of the Government's approach is performance and whether local authorities&mdash;regardless of their composition, nature and size&mdash;can perform and deliver high quality services for their people. Our aim is systematically to achieve a more uniform and higher level of local government performance throughout the country. That is why we have put in place reforms such as best value and new constitutions and are building on those reforms by embarking on the process known affectionately as comprehensive performance assessments&mdash;CPA&mdash;and performance management. We are committed to higher performance and determined that local councils should deliver quality public services. People want them, and have a right to expect them.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East raised questions about education and the nature of schooling in her council area. I was interested to note, when reading the formula for allocation of education funds, that characteristics of the block for education spend reflect not only population but deprivation and the costs of paying people in high labour cost areas. That has all come together in my hon. Friend's constituency to result in a comparatively good settlement. Reading has had an 8.8 per cent. grant increase and Wokingham an 8.4 per cent. grant increase, which are towards the upper end of the scale for unitary authorities throughout the country.</p>

	<p>We are extremely grateful for the very good grant settlements in the Thames valley, but my hon. Friend the Minister must bear it in mind that for many local authorities, this year saw the end of other income streams from central government. Reading is actually losing some &pound;3 million as central Government funding for other projects comes to an end. On the face of it, the settlement seems wonderful and one might hope for a council tax increase of 1 or 2 per cent. but, sadly, other factors have been brought to bear.</p>

	<p>I assure my hon. Friend that that is still a wonderful settlement. We have moved away from ring-fenced grants, which have, in a sense, tied local authorities' hands, because we want to give more in general grant to those councils so that they can make their own local decisions, as they are best placed to, on how to allocate and spend money. My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East referred to the PFI bid and the question of capital for education, and I shall certainly draw her comments to the attention of the Department for Education and Skills. She also mentioned population growth statistics, how those feed into the formula and the time lag in feeding the data into the system. The new formula grant arrangements are based on the most up-to-date data and evidence that we could muster. The new census figures are accurate and the Office for National Statistics is proud of them. The per head element of the formula gave her local authorities a relatively good result.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friends the Members for Reading, East and for Reading, West (Mr. Salter) mentioned the extra costs for Reading of daytime and, in particular, night-time visitors. We have tried to take that into account in our allocation of resources to local authorities, and I can tell them that the formula allocation for environmental services, highways services and policing reflects the number of daytime visitors. For highways and policing, that also applies to night-time visitors. We have not been blind to that point and have taken the issue into account.</p>
	<p>Performance cannot be improved simply by considering issues such as local government structure, boundaries or the size of local authorities. Structure and boundary reviews can, in some circumstances, distract local government from the real work at hand, which is the delivery of quality local services and the provision of leadership to communities. Of course, there may be some evidence to suggest that some functions can be more easily delivered by larger authorities. We recognised that in the draft guidance that we gave to the boundary committee about the local government reviews that might take place before any referendum on an elected regional assembly.</p>
	<p>The guidance states that many of the most significant factors that determine the ability of authorities to deliver quality services have little direct relation to the geography, structure or size of the authority. However, there is some evidence to suggest that the quality of political management, a willingness to innovate and a sound corporate structure and capacity are the most significant determinants of high-performing councils. None of that means that quality services are beyond smaller authorities, albeit that they might sometimes work in partnership with others.</p>
	<p>Indeed, the recent CPA results on the quality of performance of local authorities show that there are smaller authorities&mdash;Reading is one&mdash;that are judged as being of good quality. Hartlepool is nearly the smallest unitary council in England, yet it is in the excellent category. The same is true of Blackburn with Darwen, which is similar to Reading in size. Some large authorities are classified as weak or poor. Conversely, there are small authorities that are not performing and larger authorities that are performing well or better. To coin a phrase used by my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East, size does not always matter in that respect.</p>

	<p>The Minister is concentrating on the economies of scale and service delivery. Will he address the issue of potentially large unitary counties, such as Northumbria, in terms of geography, and Essex and Kent, in terms of population? If they were to become unitary authorities on a county-wide basis, there might be a problem of remoteness from the people and communities that they are supposed to serve as local government.</p>

	<p>I am not quite sure what point the hon. Gentleman is making. Does he think that unitary authorities need to be large in order to preserve the county characteristic? Or does he think that they should be small? I shall come on to the fact that we have not been as prescriptive as he might like when giving guidance to the boundary committee about structural reviews that might take place in relation to elected regional assembly referendums.</p>
	<p>Partnership between authorities is important and can take place. My hon. Friends have touched on some of those issues. Regardless of size and boundaries, joint working is always welcome. There will always be an element of local discretion. Local authorities are independently elected, autonomous bodies; each local authority has its own priorities. However, they need to work together on more strategic issues.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East raised the question of transport. I understand that there is some feeling that the size of Berkshire authorities might be hampering their ability to co-ordinate transport provision across authority boundaries. However, each of the six authorities produces its own local transport plan and I note that, although Department for Transport guidance urges neighbouring authorities to consider having joint plans, the Berkshire authorities have not done so. I would encourage Berkshire authorities to carry out more joint work in that area, which could lead to more joint local transport plans.</p>
	<p>Structure and boundaries are not central to the delivery of quality local services. However, we recognise the importance of getting boundaries right. Although other factors, such as leadership and corporate capacity, are critical to the creation of high-performing local authorities, we accept that the ability of authorities to develop or sustain those attributes may be affected by their geography, structure and size. Nevertheless, before we could alter structures or boundaries of local authorities, including the boundaries of existing authorities, we would have to invite the Electoral Commission to carry out a review. Only if and when it recommended change would the Government act. At present, we do not believe that such reviews should be a priority for the Electoral Commission. There are other issues to be addressed such as periodic electoral reviews, which are a priority. In considering that question, structural reviews are not on the agenda, but we have not closed the door for ever on boundary matters. We have a strong agenda of reform and improvement in local government that will benefit all our constituents. I urge all hon. Members to focus on that agenda.</p>

	Sugar Industry
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.128.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/952" speakername="Doug Henderson" colnum="128"  time="15:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h04.htm#30205h04_spnew0">
	<p>May I start by saying what a privilege it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Deputy Speaker? It is also a privilege to raise such an important issue on behalf of my constituents. It is some time since I secured an Adjournment debate, although I have responded to some over the years.</p>
	<p>The issue is about sugar production in the United Kingdom and competition in the sugar industry. It is crucial in my constituency, where more than 600 people are employed at the Nestl&eacute; confectionary plant in Fawdon, Newcastle, making such well-known products as pastilles, Fruit Gums, Jellytots, Tooty Frooties, Rolo, Blue Riband, Breakaway, Yorkie biscuit and Caramac, which are covered by the sugar regime.</p>
	<p>The sugar regime has many consequences, the first of which is that British consumers pay a high price for their sugar. That is also true throughout the European Union, but the price in Britain is higher than that in other European Union states. According to the UK Industrial Sugar Users Group, in our country prices are consistently 20 to 30 per cent. higher than the intervention price. On 27 January, sugar cost &pound;677 per tonne compared with an intervention price of about &pound;400 per tonne. The price of sugar in other European Union states is only between 8 and 22 per cent. higher than the intervention price. Anyone who depends on sugar to manufacture a product in the UK is not only at a relative disadvantage to other parts of the world, but at a relative disadvantage to other European Union states.</p>
	<p>A second consequence is that the British taxpayer must pay a significant share of the Euro800 million in annual subsidies. British confectionary producers must pay an excessive price for an important ingredient. If there is a movement, or an incentive to move, by international manufacturers away from the United Kingdom, there is a risk that British jobs such as those at Fawdon, Newcastle will be lost to other parts of the world.</p>
	<p>What has created the inflated profitability in the sugar industry, which I consider to be economically inefficient? The profits of the two major British sugar companies&mdash;I shall come to them&mdash;are significantly higher than those of any other manufacturer in the food processing industry. I would argue that that is because of the monopoly&mdash;more accurately, duopoly&mdash;situation in the industry. The root of the problem is the rules in the common agricultural policy. Those, including myself, who have had some contact with the CAP have tried to drive through reform.</p>
	<p>The duopoly of the two manufacturers in the United Kingdom is equally important. British Sugar, which is part of Associated British Foods, processes sugar beet and Tate and Lyle processes sugar cane. The situation in the United Kingdom has grown up over many years under successive Governments. The duopoly exists because Governments have been unable to refer the companies to the competition authorities, which has resulted in a change in the market situation within the industry. It is worth noting that the producers have been fined by the European Union on a number of occasions for anti-competitive price-fixing policies. Even when they have had an opportunity to reduce prices because of fluctuations in exchange rates, they have failed to respond. During the period between May 1996 and April 2000 there was a significant movement in favour of sterling away from the euro currencies. The price of sugar fell during that period by 33 or 34 per cent., but the processed sugar price in this country fell by only 14 per cent., which demonstrates that there has not been the response that might have been expected if the market had been competitive.</p>
	<p>The industry is not small. Its size is considerable in this country. The sugar processors employ about 2,000 people; the farmers who grow the beet that is linked to quotas employ about 7,000 people; and the food processing industry employs about 90,000 people. About 100,000 people in the industry are directly affected by whatever regime governs the price of sugar in this country. The companies involved are widespread and include Nestl&eacute; in my constituency, Cadbury Schweppes, Mars and United Biscuits. It may not always be recognised but sugar is a substantial ingredient in the soft drinks industry and companies such as Britvic, Coca-Cola and dear old Barrs in north-east England and Scotland are also affected.</p>
	<p>How does the anti-competitive duopoly work? First, sugar is regulated with an intervention price and quotas are linked to it. Theoretically, that is to prevent overproduction, but it actually creates an anti-competitive situation resulting in a certain amount of production above the intervention price, but the subsidies go with it and that is very much in the interests of the two main sugar processors.</p>
	<p>Consumers who buy sugar also suffer, but the food manufacturers provide the main market for sugar. Those companies historically pay two to three times the world price for their sugar, although currently they pay more than three times the world price. I recognise that there are fluctuations around the two to three times level. Taxpayers foot the bill for export subsidies and tariffs keep out competition. That not only causes excessively high prices in this country and an anti-competitive position, but damages the ability of most developing countries&mdash;some are allowed to export to the European Union&mdash;to sell an amount of sugar that would make a major contribution to the demands of people in the European Union and beyond.</p>

	<p>Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the sugar regime costs British consumers &pound;750 million a year? There is a Cadbury's factory in my constituency, as well as ones belonging to Brooks Soft Drinks and Malvern Water. I have witnessed the way in which sugar is brought into such factories. I hope that the hon. Gentleman would agree that the way that it is delivered is incredibly efficient. Those delivering it seem to have a way of knowing when to turn up to keep the amount of sugar in the factory at the right levels. That monitoring process is carried out remotely. The sugar companies are doing a good job, but anything that would make ingredients cheaper for the soft drink and chocolate industry would benefit all our constituents considerably.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.129.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/952" speakername="Doug Henderson" colnum="129"  time="15:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h04.htm#30205h04_spnew2">
	<p>I take the hon. Gentleman's point. It is true that consumers in this country suffer because of the increased prices that they pay, and the taxes that they pay towards the sugar regime. I am not sure that I would ascribe efficiency to the sugar producers. If they could not produce sugar at a profit under their rules, they would have to be very poor at it. I am sure that they do try to be as efficient as they can. Given that there are profits at stake, they would be silly to do otherwise.</p>
	<p>Oxfam has played an important part in explaining the damage that can be done to developing countries. I would like to cite some of the Oxfam submissions on the subject. It says:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;European consumers and taxpayers are paying to destroy livelihoods in some of the world's poorest countries. Through the sugar regime of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), they are paying for a system that rewards a handful of sugar producers in Europe&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p>so it is not only in the UK&mdash;</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;while undermining markets and opportunities for farmers and agricultural labourers in the developing world. No agricultural sector is in more urgent need of radical reform. Yet sugar is not even included in the European Commission's latest reform proposals.&quot;</p>
	<p>That is one of the most iniquitous aspects of the regime. Once the British demands have been met, the excess sugar produced by the two duopolists with subsidy is then dumped on the world market, often to third-world countries. Nigeria was cited as one such country recently. The regime is directly subsidised by the British taxpayer, and it keeps the production of developing countries out of those other markets.</p>
	<p>In this country, the regime adds between 2p to 3p to the price of a typical product such as a packet of pastilles or a packet of Rolos, compared with the price that would apply if the confectioners in this country were able to buy sugar at the world price. I recognise that the world price would rise a little if there were more of an open market. That would have to be taken into account. However, it would still leave people who buy sugar in this country at a great advantage, compared with the current situation.</p>
	<p>I raise the issue now because the current regime is wrong. There has been debate about it in the past. We are at a crossroads concerning agricultural policy in the European Union. Some say that what has served us well in the past should be reinforced in future. Others say that there must be change if the European Union is to progress in its development. Protectionism in the United States leads to the same impact as does the regime in Europe.</p>
	<p>The next major reform of EU agricultural policy is in 2006, which is when the big arguments must take place. A mid-term review will take place this year. The Commission will be taking on board ideas and suggestions from March until the early summer, and it is expected to make some sort of recommendation in midsummer or early autumn. If I am wrong about the dates, I am sure that the Minister will put me right. It is appropriate that there is a debate in this country and in the European Union about the sugar regime.</p>
	<p>The Commission's study covers virtually everything, but its terms of reference require it to consider the impact of European Union enlargement. One of the big questions is whether, if the sugar price in such countries as the Czech Republic is much lower than the price in the UK, producers have an incentive to move to the Czech Republic. Clearly after enlargement the relationship will be different, although the argument about moving to a lower-cost sugar-supply nation would still apply, but outside the European Union. There will probably be a rise in prices in the countries that accede to the European Union, but it will probably&mdash;this is guesswork&mdash;be over a period of time. A great deal of negotiation must take place on the phasing in, and that will be an ideal opportunity to raise the question of the sugar regime.</p>
	<p>The Commission is also considering the relationship of products to developing countries. The agreement has the name &quot;everything but arms&quot;, a typical piece of Eurospeak and the lowest common denominator that everyone could agree to. It deals with the relationship between products produced in the European Union and those that can also be produced in developing countries. To what extent should there be free trade? To what extent should there be restrictions? At present sugar is excluded from the considerations, even for the poorest countries, some of which are sugar producers. It would be very progressive if the Government tried to get that definition changed in the Commission and succeeded in bringing sugar structures into the discussion. Even if no progress is made, let us at least have the discussion.</p>
	<p>I know that the Minister will want some time to reply on those issues. I do not wish to hog the floor much longer, but I want to ask him some specific questions, which I ask him to deal with today or, if not today, perhaps later.</p>
	<p>First, do the Government recognise that there is a problem and are they prepared to take any of the actions suggested by me today and by other pressure groups in the industry?</p>
	<p>Secondly, even if it is difficult to achieve change in the European Union&mdash;I do not claim that it is easy&mdash;can action be taken in the United Kingdom at least to bring the sugar price here in line with that in other European Union countries? Can something be done in this duopolistic situation to free things up and allow more competition? We are not suggesting that sugar producers should be denied their profits, but can those using the product have a better deal in this country?</p>
	<p>Thirdly, are the Government committed to removing the sugar exclusion clause from the everything but arms agreement and will they take action in the Commission to achieve that?</p>
	<p>Fourthly, will the Government insist on a phased reduction of export subsidies, which would be part of the proposals for the mid-term review of the agricultural policy?</p>
	<p>Finally, are the Government prepared to commit themselves to a major restructuring in 2006 and to say that the main objectives are to bring competition into the sugar industry, reduce prices to bring them nearer to world prices and allow more competition from developing countries&mdash;in other words, bring prices down and give sugar consumers in this country a better deal? That would be good, because it would not only follow the general drift of the Government's policy and their desire for a more competitive economy but help to guarantee jobs in such companies as Nestl&eacute; in my constituency.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) on securing the debate and on the thorough and knowledgeable way in which he set out the complex issue of the effect of sugar prices on manufacturing and processing.</p>
	<p>Sugar beet is a very important crop in this country and region. It is an important crop in my constituency in north Lincolnshire. I sometimes wish that the people who defend the status quo would listen to the other side of the argument and consider the impact on processors and on the many jobs in this country, including those in my hon. Friend's constituency. He made his case clearly and strongly. I shall try to deal with the points that he raised.</p>
	<p>I can deal straight away with the everything but arms agreement. Sugar is not excluded from the EBA, but provisions relating to it are phased in, as is the case with rice and bananas. The Agriculture Council agreement allows for an increasing quota of duty-free sugar imports from least developed countries until 2009. This year, 85,000 tonnes of sugar will enter the European Union under the arrangement.</p>
	<p>Between 2006 and 2009, there will also be stage reductions in import duty for unlimited quantities of sugar, with a view to full liberalisation by 2009. To many manufacturers, that is not exactly a speedy agenda. I sympathise with them, because the Government's general approach towards sugar and other products is to encourage vigorous competition. The framework of competition law in the United Kingdom has been thoroughly revised since 1997 by the Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise Act 2002. My hon. Friend mentioned the duopoly. Measures have been put in place to ensure that it is not abused.</p>
	<p>The real problem is prices, which my hon. Friend rightly stated are affected by the CAP. We believe that strong competition is the best way to ensure that consumers get a good deal from lower prices, increased choice and higher quality. Vigorous competition puts pressure on firms to find ways of reducing costs by increasing innovation and organising their production efficiently. It is a key driver of productivity. Changes are inevitable for the sugar beet sector as well and are being phased in to give people time to adjust.</p>
	<p>We recognise that the present situation leads to considerably higher prices. My hon. Friend was right in saying that the price of sugar in the EU is three times the world price&mdash;that is significant. One can understand why drinks and chocolate manufacturers, who are big sugar users, are concerned. As I said, the price is high because sugar is part of the subsidised and quota-controlled sector of the CAP.</p>
	<p>I assure my hon. Friend that the Government recognise the problem. That is why we are committed to CAP reform. The policy has been largely unchanged for nearly 30 years, and it does not deliver what farmers, the rural economy, consumers and the environment need. The distortion of world prices has not helped farmers. The policy has caused all sorts of problems in this and other countries, it is hugely expensive for EU consumers and it does not meet the challenges posed by the World Trade Organisation negotiations or, as my hon. Friend said, enlargement of the EU.</p>
	<p>We are committed to reducing the overall burden of the CAP. The mid-term review of the CAP is a good start in the right direction. We have some concerns about the detail, because we want to move away from price and production support and provide more money for the so-called second pillar&mdash;rural development and agri-environment scheme support&mdash;which benefits agriculture and the rural economy generally.</p>
	<p>As things stand, sugar is not yet part of the mid-term review discussions, as my hon. Friend said, and I can understand his frustration about that. The reason why it does not form part of those discussions is that, when the existing sugar regime was renewed in 2001, it was decided that the new arrangements should run until 2006. Following pressure from the UK, we succeeded in getting a formal commitment to a further review this year, which the Commission has now openly linked to the MTR process by promising a report and proposals by June. As my hon. Friend rightly said, if one is going through the MTR process and looking at decoupling, it is difficult to ignore the sugar regime. The report will have to take account of what is now being proposed in the MTR for other sectors. The Commission has said openly that that is its intention, and we welcome that.</p>
	<p>We do not believe that there is a case for the sugar regime remaining outside any such changes. The UK will argue vigorously that any MTR decisions will have to apply to sugar at the earliest opportunity. I agree with my hon. Friend that the sooner we tackle those issues, the better for all concerned. We are committed to taking action on price. We also want to see a reduction in subsidies as part of the MTR process, because they are not helpful to European consumers or to world prices, or consequently to developing countries and poorer countries, which want market access.</p>
	<p>I understand my hon. Friend's point about the Oxfam report entitled &quot;The Great EU Sugar Scam&quot;, and we have a great deal of sympathy with what Oxfam said about the impact of heavily subsidised and protectionist regimes on developing countries.</p>

	<p>As my hon. Friend will recognise, these are complicated issues. Would he be prepared to meet a delegation from the industry before the end of March to discuss the British submissions to the European Commission?</p>

	<p>I certainly have no objection to that in principle. I should point out, however, that my colleague, Lord Whitty, is responsible for food and farming at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and it is all too easy to make commitments on behalf of people who are not here. I deal with debates in this Chamber as part of my multi-functional role in the Department, and because my colleague is a Member of the House of Lords. I know that he shares the Government's views on the matter, however, and has been a strong campaigner for the changes that I have described, so I will put my hon. Friend's proposition to him. I am sure that he will be happy to talk to him about the progress that is being made and about the details of the MTR, which are complex.</p>
	<p>It will be no surprise that there are differences of opinion between member states, but the UK has consistently taken the lead in pressing for the urgent adaptation of the internal market to the circumstances that full market access for developing countries will bring. We believe that that is in the best interests not only of our processing sector, for which my hon. Friend made a good case today, but of agriculture, in terms of adapting to the changes and considering the opportunities that a more liberalised market may present.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend did not raise the subject, but I know that sugar growers are interested in industrial crops and the use of sugar for ethanol production. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has introduced changes in duty to encourage biodiesel and bioethanol production, which offers some potential in the long term.</p>
	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend on the way in which he made his case. I will take up his request with my colleague, Lord Whitty. I hope that I have reassured him that we sympathise with the points that he made and are committed to advocating these changes in the European Union, which are long overdue.</p>

	Beechwood Lodge, Basingstoke
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-05.135.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1349" speakername="Andrew Hunter" colnum="135"  time="16:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030205/halltext/30205h05.htm#30205h05_spnew0">
	<p>I welcome the opportunity to raise in this short debate an issue that is of grave concern to me and to a significant number of people in the constituency of Basingstoke and in the wider borough of Basingstoke and Deane. My right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) is with us in spirit, but business elsewhere demands his attention. I know that he identifies himself with the broad thrust of the comments that I propose to make.</p>
	<p>Almost a year ago&mdash;on 4 February, to be precise&mdash;I wrote a letter to the Secretary of State for Health in which I expressed my profound concern about the deaths in the community in Basingstoke of five former residents of Beechwood lodge. I should explain that Beechwood lodge is a Stonham housing association hostel for single men. Four of the deaths happened within a few weeks of one another around Christmas 2001, and the body of one man lay undiscovered for three weeks or so. They followed the death in the community early in the year of another former resident.</p>
	<p>In my letter, I asked the Secretary of State to set up an official inquiry into the five deaths and the way in which Hampshire social services, Stonham housing association and the borough council had acted. I also tabled parliamentary questions. The Secretary of State replied that he was not planning to hold an inquiry, but he did not totally rule out the possibility that one might be held. He implied, or so I understood, that he hoped that the inquiry instigated by the borough council would serve the same purpose. I regret to report that it has not. Concerns about what happened to former residents of Beechwood lodge have not remotely subsided during the past 12 months, perhaps because of the efforts of some to remove the issue from our local agenda. I return to the issue without apology and repeat my request for an official inquiry.</p>
	<p>The five men died after being moved into the community following Stonham housing association's controversial decision to close the hostel. Their deaths gave rise to a storm of local protest over the lack of care and support that they had received after being moved out of the hostel. While the residents of Beechwood lodge were being moved into the community, Hampshire social services and Stonham housing association gave solemn assurances that residents' needs were being assessed and that appropriate care packages would be put in place. It later transpired that many of the residents were given no support in the community, but were left to fend for themselves.</p>
	<p>On 7 February&mdash;three days after I wrote to the Secretary of State for Health&mdash;Basingstoke and Deane borough council announced that it had commissioned a review, not an inquiry, in partnership with Stonham housing association and the other relevant authorities and agencies. The review, which was labelled &quot;independent&quot;, examined the procedures that had been followed in implementing the closure of Beechwood lodge. The independent review was also to make recommendations as to further action that might be taken to assist former residents and to advise how such processes should be carried out.</p>
	<p>There was immediate concern locally. First, there was to be a review, not an inquiry. There is a fundamental difference between the two: by definition, an inquiry is inquisitive, whereas a review is an overview. The terms of reference focused too much on what had happened rather than on the whys and wherefores and where responsibility lay. There were also well-founded concerns about how genuinely independent a review could be if it were set up by the involved parties. It was also realised that the reviewer would have no statutory powers to summon witnesses or to demand papers, and it was uncertain what resources would be at his disposal and whether evidence would be heard in public or in private, and over what period of time. Not only were there many misgivings concerning the conditions surrounding the independent review, but the reviewer had no powers to compel the various agencies and authorities to implement any recommendations.</p>
	<p>The task of conducting the review was given to Mr. Frank Rust, the chairman of the community health council and a past member of an area health authority and much else. I wish to state unambiguously that Mr. Rust's personal integrity and commitment to the task are not in dispute. He is rightly respected for his contribution to public life in many fields. The quarrel is not with the reviewer, Mr. Rust, but with the terms of reference that were imposed on him and the consequential limitations of his report. Furthermore, the borough council has subsequently handled the report. I emphasise that the review was the initiative of the borough council.</p>
	<p>There was an early manifestation of concern. Mr. Rust was tasked with providing the council with an interim report prior to presenting his final report. He did so in April last year. We now know that the interim report was the only one that he provided. It was, in the words of a leading councillor,</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;polished and padded a bit&quot;.</p>
	<p>Some members of the council felt that it was lacking in substance and detail, but it became the actual report. Moreover, copies of the interim report were sent to the various agencies and authorities involved, but not to individuals whom Mr. Rust had interviewed in the course of preparing it, such as Mrs. Anne Ritchie, who has played such a dedicated role in representing the interests of the residents of Beechwood lodge. The comments of those agencies were taken into account. It is truly alarming that the polishing and padding was provided by the council, an act that brings into serious question the ostensible and declared independence of the report.</p>
	<p>A fortnight or so ago, Lord Laming made public the findings of his inquiry into the horrific suffering and death of Victoria Climbi&eacute;. That tragic case has a number of points of contact with the Beechwood lodge saga, the most striking being the proliferation of responsible bodies. With the advantage of hindsight, one can see that each body tended to minimise its own responsibility and to maximise that of the others. Where there should have been multi-agency co-operation, there was multi-agency failure. At the time, I described the Rust report as</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;an anaesthetised analysis of a human tragedy which should never have happened.&quot;</p>
	<p>The report inadequately stated that the tragedy was wholly avoidable. Some of the most vulnerable people in our community were grievously let down. Mr. Rust's report appears to imply that prime responsibility lay with Stonham housing association. The report is essentially non-censorious. Stonham's appalling shortcomings are listed as a matter more for regret than for blame. Social services emerge in a poor light. At times they are more concerned about the resource implications of their involvement than the needs of residents. Mr. Rust recently reminded me that letters survive from social services and Stonham asking one another for extra resources. Not least, social services failed to complete assessments within the promised time.</p>
	<p>The report acknowledges the pivotal role of the borough council in providing accommodation for Beechwood lodge residents in the community, including sheltered housing schemes. The council could have influenced events far more than it did. It almost wholly ignored warnings&mdash;the correspondence survives. The report also finds that the Housing Corporation</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;could have taken a more proactive, even a strategic/leadership role&quot;.</p>
	<p>It does not make it clear when that could or should have happened. Mr. Rust recently wrote to me, saying that the crux of the problem was the decision by the Housing Corporation to reduce the revenue grant for Beechwood lodge and its failure to fund the closure programme. As in the case of Victoria Climbi&eacute;, each lapse may not of itself have been fatal, but taken together they were lethal. The catalogue of failure is chilling. One of the glaring weaknesses of the report is the absence of any testimony from former residents. The inquiry's terms of reference did not demand its inclusion, nor did they require the reviewer even to speak to former residents. The absence of such testimony detracts greatly from the completeness of the report.</p>
	<p>In fact, the report tells us nothing that we did not already know. The closure of Beechwood lodge and the ensuing tragedy was a ghastly saga of multi-agency failure for which no one has been held responsible. It is a classic instance of the no-blame culture that bedevils modern society, but individuals formulated those strategies, and individuals took the decisions. They should have been held to account, but they were not. They could still be held to account.</p>
	<p>Although every agency and authority involved bears some responsibility, there is particular concern about the borough council's attitude. It is summed up in the repeated assertions heard so often in public and in private: &quot;We must not blame anyone; we must put this behind us and move on.&quot; The impression is given that some wish to sweep the whole horrific and tragic affair under the carpet.</p>
	<p>It is piously hoped that the new &quot;supporting people&quot; strategy will prevent a repetition, and I share that hope. However, &quot;supporting people&quot; only formalises what should have happened in the past; it is no guarantee of delivery. Moreover, in Basingstoke, the &quot;supporting people&quot; strategy will be implemented by precisely the same agencies, and in some cases by the same people, that failed the residents of Beechwood lodge so badly.</p>
	<p>A sizeable body of informed local opinion believes that, despite Mr. Rust's good intentions, his report inadequately analysed the complexity and the full horror of what happened in Basingstoke after Beechwood lodge residents were rehoused in the community. There is much unease that the agencies and authorities responsible may have escaped too lightly. There is genuine concern about the council's perceived attitude. For these reasons, it is hoped that, even now, the Government will instigate a fuller inquiry to find out what went wrong and why, so that from the mistakes of the past we may learn lessons for the future.</p>
	<p>I do not ask the Minister to pronounce judgment immediately; this is a matter for thought and reflection. I ask her to give serious consideration to setting up such an inquiry, and I hope that in due course the Government will agree. The tragedy that followed the decision to close Beechwood lodge was both predictable and predicted. I have made the point that it happened because every involved authority and agency failed. Consequently, some of the most vulnerable people in our local community were grievously let down. The seriousness of what happened and the imperative of ensuring that lessons are learned demand an official inquiry.</p>

	<p>I start by saying to the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) that I understand his great anxiety about the issue and the individual cases. I know that his concerns are deeply held and have been for some time. I thank him for giving me prior notice of some of the issues that he wanted to raise today. I also understand that when the hon. Gentleman speaks about the matters, he is representing the views of ex-residents and the members of Basingstoke Action for Single Homelessness. As he said, there is real local concern.</p>
	<p>I want to describe the circumstances that I understand to have been in place and the reasons for the closure of Beechwood lodge. A regular three-year review of Beechwood lodge by the Housing Corporation found that many residents had alcohol issues that did not require the intensive support that would justify payment of the supported housing management grant. Beechwood lodge also had a void rate of about 30 per cent., which was below funding guidelines set by the corporation. The decision to close Beechwood lodge was taken by Stonham housing association, with the support of the Housing Corporation, Hampshire social services and Basingstoke and Deane borough council following consultation with stakeholders, including the local health authority.</p>
	<p>A structural survey also showed problems with design to the extent that the cost of routine maintenance for the building was no longer sustainable. Basingstoke and Deane borough council had already provided &pound;148,000 of housing association grant in 1995 to repair a building that was not even 10 years old.</p>
	<p>My information is that residents were consulted about the decision to close the hostel, with more than 70 per cent. responding that they would prefer to move. I also understand that the closure was planned over a four-year period to July 2001 to ensure that appropriate placements were found for all residents. However, despite joint working, the information given to my officials was that some people did not accept the care packages that were offered to all residents by the agencies as part of the re-provision arrangements and preferred to move into independent accommodation, which was perfectly within their rights.</p>
	<p>Consultation with the residents highlighted the fact that 74 per cent. would prefer to live in flats, bedsits or shared accommodation. As half of the bed spaces were permanent and the home was running at 80 per cent. capacity, there were only 40 bed spaces for which vacancies could occur. The borough council and Stonham planned re-provision around finding alternative accommodation for the long-term residents and providing an equivalent number of other bed spaces in the first instance, followed by a programme of expansion based on the needs of the individual in line with the &quot;supporting people&quot; requirements, to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</p>
	<p>In 1998, Stonham assessed 77 residents and found that 32 needed further health and care assessments. The council's health and housing committee subsequently put in place an initial re-provision plan to increase the number of move-on nominations to 13 each year, in order to assist residents with little or no support needs&mdash;needs that could be met through floating support in alternative accommodation.</p>
	<p>I understand that by June 2000, the borough council had submitted a multi-agency strategic plan to the health and housing committee; four months later, it was approved by a panel of elected members. The result was that multi-agency assessments with social services could ideally match the remaining residents with appropriate accommodation. In the months leading up to the closure, joint assessments took place for about 20 residents with high support needs. The residents were accompanied to viewings of alternative accommodation by Stonhan or council housing officers, who worked to find housing options that met the needs of and were acceptable to residents.</p>
	<p>Our information is that all residents were rehoused in other schemes more appropriate to their level of need. Since the announcement of the closure of Beechwood lodge, the 40 lost bed spaces have been replaced with the equivalent of more than 140 new bed spaces, including Mary Rose court. I have not had the advantage of visiting Mary Rose court, but I understand that the hon. Gentleman has been there and I believe that he was impressed by what he saw.</p>
	<p>Additional bed spaces have been provided through a number of initiatives, including local authority social housing grant, and floating support. By that I mean workers who provide support to help people to live independently and to support tenancies for those with low support needs. That should either prevent vulnerable people from becoming homeless or enable them to sustain a more independent tenancy.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman spoke about the review commissioned by the council. It was run by Mr. Frank Rust, the ex-chairman of the community health council. The report made a number of recommendations. It recommended, first, that all vulnerable ex-residents should be contacted to assess the level of support that they receive; secondly, that Basingstoke Action Against Single Homelessness and other supporting agencies should be included in developing the borough council's homelessness strategy; and thirdly, that the agency should lead on commissioning services for those vulnerable to homelessness. My information is that the council has implemented all those recommendations.</p>
	<p>I understand that health and social services both advise that it is no longer appropriate to provide one large-scale institution in the area, where residents may become deskilled. That was confirmed by a recent survey into the housing needs of single people, in which the hostel residents were well represented.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman, as he has said, asked the Department of Health to investigate the circumstances leading to the deaths of former residents of the hostel, and to assess the performance of agencies providing care and support at Beechwood lodge. The Department declined to undertake an inquiry into the circumstances of the deaths of four men following the closure of Beechwood lodge because it was judged that such an inquiry would not add value to the inquiry already commissioned, and that a separate inquiry might have impeded the progress of the internal inquiry. The social services inspectorate has maintained contact with Hampshire social services on the progress of the inquiry and received a copy of the report in July 2002. I understand that the local agencies have continued to discuss the outcome of the report, and that the local council discussed the matter in its overview and scrutiny committee in January.</p>
	<p>At that community overview and scrutiny committee, the council agreed that it was content that the housing strategy addressed the issues of vulnerable residents within the borough. However, the social services inspectorate is continuing to liase with Hampshire social services department to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to implement lessons learned from the inquiry and its outcome.</p>
	<p>Improved joint working between agencies coupled with new provision across the borough for men and women has resulted in housing support being more tailored to the needs of individuals. The introduction of the supported housing panel also ensures more appropriate housing together with appropriate support in future. It is supported by the borough council, the Housing Corporation and the &quot;safer communities&quot; programme in investing more than &pound;4.4 million in accommodation for vulnerable people.</p>
	<p>Funding has also increased to develop floating support services. The borough council has invested &pound;1.5 million to purchase 31 houses for statutory homeless households and provided other funds for a 14-bed hostel, which is due to open in July, which can accommodate single homeless people or homeless households. The borough council is also undertaking a feasibility study on the provision of a day centre as part of its review of homelessness provision in the borough. I know from my experience what valuable work day centres do.</p>
	<p>Tackling homelessness is about considering individual circumstances. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is not just about seeing whether people have a roof over their head but about considering their special needs and supporting them. The homlessness directorate within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has provided more than &pound;100,000 to help Basingstoke and Deane to put in place some homeless prevention projects such as a rent deposit scheme for intentionally homeless people, a mediation service and a supported lodgings scheme for 16 and 17-year-olds. Funding is also being used to employ a specialist housing advice officer and a new homelessness and resettlement officer.</p>
	<p>Today the Government announced their proposals in &quot;Sustainable Communities: building for the future&quot; to provide a major programme of affordable homes for key public sector workers and those in priority housing need. In that document there is a commitment to continue with the work on homelessness outlined in &quot;More than a Roof&quot;, which goes into detail about how people's individual needs are to be considered when dealing with homelessness.</p>
	<p>Our objectives are to develop more strategic approaches to preventing homelessness and to consider how to deal with the subject; to encourage new responses to tackling homelessness such as mediation schemes; and to strengthen the help available to people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.</p>
	<p>We have passed legislation to strengthen the help available for people who need it and from April the &quot;supporting people&quot; programme will provide support services to vulnerable people and help them to stay in their homes. I hope that the hon. Member for Basingstoke will be reassured when the programme is implemented and developed.</p>
	<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising some interesting and important points, which the Government will consider. It is important that we improve our services, especially when they are provided to vulnerable people. There is a greater range of provision for homeless people in Basingstoke and Deane, which is supported by the Homelessness Act 2002 and from April by the &quot;supporting people&quot; programme.</p>
	<p>I assure the hon. Gentleman that the borough council is one of the district councils working in partnership with others as part of its &quot;supporting people&quot; strategy; although it does not come in until April, a great deal of preparation is going on to ensure that it is implemented properly. Hampshire has always worked well with its district councils and with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and continues to do so.</p>
	<p>I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on raising the issue and I hope that I have been able to reassure him.</p>
