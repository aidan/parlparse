	<p pid="a.188.5/1">My hon. Friend is right; a cheque from one of my constituents was cashed 15 minutes before the administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.5/2">I understand that the administrator has a statutory duty to report to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, and if he considers that the conduct of any director makes him unfit to be the director of a limited company, he can prevent them from being able to. We are discussing very rich men. They are rich off the backs of the hard work of our constituents, who now have nothing at Christmas. That is not justice.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-07a.196.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1903" speakername="Denis Murphy" colnum="196"  time="010:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061107/halltext/61107h0003.htm#06110746000648">
	<p pid="a.196.6/1">Thank you, Miss Begg. Most of my points have already been covered, but I would like the Minister to comment in his winding up speech on a statement made by Neil Henderson-Begg, who represents the Hamper Industry Trade Association. After the collapse, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/2" class="indent">&quot;It seems odd that Farepak declared its financial position untenable at the time of the year when it is holding most cash&mdash;when contributions are almost fully paid-up. Customers will want to know where their pre-payments have gone.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/3">Naturally, they will. He said that customers are concerned about the time that elapsed between the suspension of EHR shares and Farepak's ceasing trading, and that</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/4" class="indent">&quot;Others want to know whether their money went towards making other firms in the EHR group attractive enough to be immediately snapped up&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/5">which they were, very shortly after the collapse. He added that customers also need to why Farepak's lending banks allowed the situation to go as far as it did. That point has been touched on by several hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/6">I also ask that the Minister examine closely whether the Government are one of Farepak's creditors. Sadly, in the past, the small investor has normally been the last to be compensated. On this occasion, the Government and other large creditors should set an example, step back and allow any assets of the company to be used to form a compensation package for those people who have been so devastated by the loss of all their savings.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.2/1">I take the Minister's point, but if VAT has been paid, clearly the Minister will want to consider hon. Members' comments in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/2">On what can be done in the future, we look forward to hearing what stage the Minister's discussions with the Financial Services Authority have reached. Farepak is not the first case of a Christmas hamper voucher company getting into difficulties. There was the case of FHSC in February, and Choice Gift Vouchers went into bankruptcy earlier this year. We need to know what can be done now, given that several companies have had difficulties. We look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about how quickly secondary legislation can be introduced under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to add such companies to the list of those that are regulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/3">Several hon. Members have rightly mentioned HBOS. One of the key questions that we need answers to is why the offer from Park to buy Farepak was rejected twice. Park is the company that rescued FHSC and that prevented its customers from getting into the same problems as Farepak's customers. What was the role of HBOS in preventing that rescue offer from being accepted?</p>

	<p pid="a.198.0/1">My hon. Friend mentions the role of HBOS, and we have heard about the roles that many people played. Is it not the case that the Minister, who has been working on hard on the issue, needs to get all those people around the table so that they can all contribute to helping those who have lost out? Does my hon. Friend share my worry that the British Retail Consortium has said that there is no central database of customers? If that is so, it will be difficult to put together a rescue package.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.1/1">I shall be very brief, Miss Begg. We have had an excellent debate, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1866" name="Anne Snelgrove">the hon. Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove)</phrase> on initiating it. The issue has touched the hearts of hon. Members and of people throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/2">I shall focus on how the problem arose. The industry is unregulated. It falls within the retail sector, not the savings sector, but in principle it operates in a similar way to credit unions. The hamper industry depends on each company fulfilling its part of the bargain.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/3">In February this year Family Hampers went bust. The system allowed customers to pay in their savings, the company would bank the money and vouchers were issued to customers by a separate voucher company; the company then invoiced the Christmas club, and the shops invoiced the voucher company. When Family Hampers went bust, Choice Gift Vouchers went into administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/4">The major store groups decided that they had had enough of that&mdash;they were &pound;55 million out of pocket. They decided that there should be no more credit and that vouchers should be purchased up front. That led to a funding crisis at European Home Retail, the parent company, and its shares were suspended in August. However, EHR was using Farepak to fund its own deficit, and each month the customers' savings were being raided like a piggy bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/5">Why was that company not put into administration until October? HBOS was still raking in savers' money to fund the EHR overdraft. The worst thing, however, is that earlier in October the non-Farepak rump of EHR was sold off for &pound;34 million in cash. Where has that money gone? How is it possible to drain a subsidiary of cash and then sell it, leaving tens of thousands of people being owed money?</p>

	<p pid="a.203.2/1">Yes; my hon. Friend makes an important point. The reputation of the hamper industry has been gravely damaged. Regulation would greatly strengthen its reputation, and its ability deal properly with the money that people entrust to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/2">Will the Minister investigate the actions of HBOS? It continued to accept &pound;1 million a month of savings from Farepak, knowing that the company was insolvent. Will he also look into the claims of organisations such as the Hamper Industry Trade Association, which purport to offer protection through a bond until something goes wrong? The British Retail Consortium initially offered to make a goodwill gesture but it seems that its Christmas good will has run out. Indeed, several hon. Members have alluded to the cruel irony that, having made the offer, it has now withdrawn it.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/3">In conclusion, I nominate three candidates for Christmas Scrooge 2006&mdash;the British Retail Consortium, HBOS and whoever pocketed the &pound;34 million for the sale of European Home Retail.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.5/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point on which I am certainly not qualified or knowledgeable enough to comment in detail. The Minister will surely respond by saying that rail utilisation strategies are what the Department for Transport is focusing on at the moment to obtain better use of the existing network. It appears that that is certainly not happening in my hon. Friend's neck of the woods.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.5/2">In my experience, the Treasury is always involved in the railways and actually killed off the investment in rail that was part of the Beeching package. There was supposed to be investment following on from the cuts, but while there were cuts, there was no investment, a move that set back electrification. The Treasury has suffered and groaned, quite understandably, under Railtrack and the events associated with it, and has calculated that it subsidises every rail passenger by about &pound;4 per trip. However, the pressures for expansion exist and have to be admitted. In recent statements, the Government have said that they are aiming for more use and capacity on the railways, which is part and parcel of the new franchising process. Network Rail certainly aim to do that, and it set aside considerable sums of money for that purpose. The rail regulator, to whom I recently spoke, said that in his dealings with the rail companies and Network Rail, he wished to encourage, as far as possible, increased capacity and rail growth&mdash;whatever we mean by that.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.5/3">Groups such as Transport 2000 are mounting a vigorous and effective campaign, arguing for developing the railways. There have been a number of conferences on that, which have been supported by players such as the CBI.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.3/1">I agree. I suspect that many lessons can be learned from London's experience with congestion charging and from the attempts to increase the number of buses and to promote the use Oyster cards and other mechanisms to reduce the cost of public transport. In Scotland, the policy of free bus travel for pensioners has also been very successful in getting pensioners to use buses as their preferred mode of transport. It is clear that price is a major factor when transport users make their choices, but if the trains are not there, people will not be able to use them, no matter what the cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.3/2">To conclude, there is a strong political case&mdash;particularly against the backdrop of the Stern report&mdash;for making significant investment to ensure that Britain's railways provide us all with a service. Like me, my hon. Friend the Minister regularly commutes to Scotland, and he will be well aware that the journey is far lengthier for those who commute by rail than it is for those who use alternatives such as air. If we had the high-speed links that exist in many European countries, however, rail would become a far more competitive option. I therefore congratulate my hon. Friend on the work that he has already done since being appointed to his position and encourage him to do all he can to ensure that we get better investment in our railways.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-07a.254.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" speakername="Andrew MacKinlay" colnum="254"  time="013:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061107/halltext/61107h0011.htm#06110746000782">
	<p pid="a.254.0/1">I associate myself with everything that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1528" name="Howard Stoate">the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate)</phrase> said. I represent Thurrock, which is on the other side of the bridge, and I support his views and his protest, which he has outlined to hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/2">Strictly speaking, we are not talking about the M25, but the Thurrock-Dartford crossing is part of the M25 to all intents and purposes. It was therefore a gross discourtesy on the part of the Minister and his Department not to advise Members in the area before he made his announcement. He has apologised informally, but that is not good enough. his actions and those of the Department were sloppy and inexcusable, and I will not forget it.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/3">Let me set out the history of the matter. Under an Act of Parliament&mdash;you probably voted for it, Mr. Martlew, but it was before I came to the House&mdash;there was to be no tolling once the bridge was paid four. Approximately four years ago, it was paid for, and, under the Act, the tolling was supposed to cease. However, the Transport Act 2000, to which my hon. Friend referred, was bounced through the House and gave the Government a way of continuing to derive revenue from the crossing. I protested at the time and I regret that, instead of listening to me, Thurrock council listened to the then Transport Minister, who offered it the carrot of some extra borrowing if it acquiesced in the continued tolling. I told the council that it was being foolhardy in the extreme and I take no satisfaction from the fact that I will be proved prophetic when the council realises that it was indeed foolish to acquiesce in the continued tolling.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/4">At the very least, I had thought that the tolling would wither on the vine. I thought that it would continue to give the Department for Transport a revenue stream, but that it would reduce in real terms. Why? Because it is an unfair tax, particularly on my constituents and those of my hon. Friend, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> and other hon. Members representing areas to the east of London. It is demonstrably unfair that our constituents are making a disproportionate contribution to the running of the M25 and other road projects, when the costs should be met by all motorists. That is what is so unacceptable. It is amazing that the Government have produced such an unfair proposal, which hits some of the most disadvantaged people. Those people have to go to work on the other side of the river, and the tax on their trip to work, which is already &pound;10 a week, will be even higher if the present proposals are accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/5">I do not oppose road charging&mdash;indeed, there is a lot to be said for it&mdash;but we should introduce a planned, comprehensive national system under which there is parity of treatment and people pay as they go. The people of Thurrock, Dartford and nearby areas should not pay for other people's motoring.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/6">Congestion will increase under the present proposals. My hon. Friend told us about the problems of pollution, which are often caused by static vehicles pumping out fumes. Clearly, if motorists have to find &pound;1.50, rather than just a &pound;1 coin, that will mean greater delays, so the proposals do not make sense from that point of view.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/7">I understand that the Minister's motive is revenue, and he may try to tell us that the proposals are part of the plan for road charging and tolling. If so, will he also announce the proposal for an experimental road-pricing system in and around Broadstairs? I am told that that is being introduced, but I do not imagine that he will amplify on it today.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/8">The fact is that the proposals are unfair to the people in the area. We need to make it clear that it is time for the Minister and his colleagues to think again about the operation of the scheme, its inequity and whether it could be part of a road-pricing scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/9">The tolling did prove to be successful, and I am certainly a convert to the idea of paying for a bridge or river crossing by means of tolling. Furthermore, the idea of a further crossing is compelling, and I cannot understand the delay, because the project could be a gilt-edged investment. It could be paid for by users not of the Thurrock-Dartford crossing, but of the new bridge, which could and should be constructed with the utmost expedition in the interests of United Kingdom Ltd. and commerce. That should be happening now.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/10">I do not want to discourage the use of tolling to pay for bridges, and I am quite happy about road pricing as a matter of principle&mdash;indeed, there is a compelling case for arguing that it is fair&mdash;but the current proposal to increase toll charges, and the manner in which it was introduced, are unacceptable. I will do everything that I can to frustrate the new charges&mdash;and I will not be so nice next time.</p>
