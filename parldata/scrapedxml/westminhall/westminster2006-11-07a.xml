	<p pid="a.183.7/1">I shall just make a little progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.7/2">At least 150,000 people are affected by what has happened at Farepak, and many Members, some of whom wished to attend today but could not do so, have written to me in support of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1566" name="Ian Stewart">the debate. They include my hon. Friends the Members for Eccles (Ian Stewart)</phrase>, for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown), for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan) and for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe). I am pleased to see so many hon. Members present who are ready to speak for their constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.7/3">In all our constituencies, families were robbed of their Christmas when the hamper firm Farepak collapsed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-13">Friday 13 October</phrase>. I remember as a child at Christmas competing for attention with 45 cousins&mdash;the other grandchildren of my grandparents. My poor grandparents had to find a present for each of us every year, and amazingly, there were always 45 to 50 presents under their tree. It was some achievement, and companies such as Farepak knew it.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.7/4">Farepak capitalised on the fear that, without some kind of savings system, Christmas would be a failure, and it is galling to look back on its promotional material now. The brochure featured a mum and her family around the Christmas tree, and it said:</p>
	<p pid="a.183.7/5" class="indent">&quot;This year give your family the best Christmas ever&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.7/6">To those hon. Members who have asked me why people invested in a voucher company and not in a bank, the message on the brochure is a simple but powerful answer. They were trying to avoid debt, and many had no other place to turn to for a savings scheme that paid out at Christmas.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.5/1">I agree, and I shall address that point a little later.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.5/2">My constituent and others were told by Farepak that there was no problem with the vouchers and not to worry, when everyone knew that it was all going wrong. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase>, the company announced that it would run out of money by the autumn unless funds could be borrowed. That followed the collapse of Choice Gift Vouchers, the voucher company that Farepak used, which led retailers to demand that companies such as Farepak pay for their vouchers up front, when before they had been allowed credit. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-23">23 August</phrase>, Halifax Bank of Scotland said that it would lend no more money to Farepak, because the company was beyond saving.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.5/3">Farepak was a subsidiary of European Home Retail, which included Kleeneze and other companies. An investigation by <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> into Farepak's accounts revealed that millions of pounds were regularly transferred between Farepak and European Home Retail. It was said that Farepak money was used to pay off the overdraft with HBOS.</p>

	<p pid="a.185.5/1">I could not agree more. Soon after the issue was raised on the Floor of the House during Trade and Industry questions on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-19">19 October</phrase>, all our hopes were raised with news of a British Retail Consortium good-will gesture. However, like many other Members, I was disappointed that, at home time last Thursday, just as we were leaving Parliament for our constituencies, so no one could be found to appear on the news, the BRC slipped out the news that it would not put together a rescue package. It is disappointing.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.5/1">There are 47 shopping days until Christmas, and we need to get on with this as quickly as possible. The DTI needs to bring forward a scheme, and I am pressing for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/2">I hope that the Minister will join me and other hon. Members in calling on the top retail companies, who do so well at Christmas, to use their corporate social responsibility budgets to help to save our constituents from loan sharks and to give them a good Christmas. My constituents have been adding to the profits of those companies in recent days by buying extra toys for the GWR charity campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.5/3">One of the most obvious companies to which we should look is Findel plc. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-13">Friday 13 October</phrase>, when Farepak went to the wall, Kleeneze was bought by Findel plc. It has a database of Farepak's customers and is in a position to support fundraising schemes. It has issued a press release suggesting that FTSE 100 companies contribute &pound;50,000 into a savings fund, which would be interesting. Does the Minister know how much of Farepak's customers' money can be traced to Findel? I doubt whether that is a legal issue, but as a matter of corporate responsibility, Findel should help Farepak customers.</p>

Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove)</phrase> on her powerful speech and her advocacy on such an important cause. As has been said, the fact that so many right hon. and hon.

As she said, it is particularly tragic that so many of those affected can least afford to lose that kind of money&mdash;least of all at this time of year.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/2">Many of my constituents are affected, as are those of other hon. Members. A lot face the loss of hundreds of pounds. Our local paper, the <i>Oxford Mail</i>, reported the case of a mother of six and her daughter, a mother of one, who had paid in &pound;900 and &pound;450 respectively. It is not hard to imagine what a blow the collapse has been for their Christmas.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/3">A local agent and near neighbour of mine, Debbie Simms, who first alerted me to the scale of loss locally, paid her final instalment of &pound;1,600 into the bank on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-13">Friday 13 October</phrase>, shortly before the administrators were called into Farepak at quarter-past 2 that very day. She and I have been considering whether there is any way of getting the money back from the bank concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/4">The questions to which we must get answers and on which my right hon. Friend the Minister must act, although I know that he is already doing so, fall under three key headings. First, how did the collapse happen and could it have been avoided? As my affected constituents have pointed out, there were signs that something was wrong when shares in the parent company, European Home Retail, were suspended in August. How was Farepak allowed to go on collecting money? How is it that, as <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> reported, millions of pounds were regularly transferred between Farepak and EHR? How is it that Farepak's bank, HBOS, continued to take in customers' money to credit a company that it must have known was in serious difficulty?</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/5">The Department of Trade and Industry inquiry must get clear answers on such questions and on the responsibility of Farepak directors. It must also have lessons to learn in respect of my second key question: how can we better protect the hard-earned money of people who save up for Christmas in such a way? After all, as has been pointed out, Christmas hamper schemes such as this one are, to all intents and purposes, savings schemes. They should be regulated as savings schemes and brought within the supervision of the Financial Services Authority. There is a clear need for standards. There should be oversight of the adequacy of such schemes' financial positions and protection against money being siphoned off to elsewhere within a group. Furthermore, a bond or insurance scheme that protects against financial insolvency should be set up. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister can provide positive assurances that action, with legislation when necessary, will be taken as a matter of urgency on all those points.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.2/6">The third and most pressing question of all is about what can be done now to help those who have lost out. I commend the speed with which my right hon. Friend, as Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs, moved to try to get a goodwill contribution from the British Retail Consortium. It was a bitter disappointment when it decided that as an organisation it could not help. I had written to the chief executives of Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's, all of which serve my constituency, asking whether they could donate just some of their profits in that very worthwhile direction.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.6/1">Thank you, Miss Begg. Most of my points have already been covered, but I would like the Minister to comment in his winding up speech on a statement made by Neil Henderson-Begg, who represents the Hamper Industry Trade Association. After the collapse, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/2" class="indent">&quot;It seems odd that Farepak declared its financial position untenable at the time of the year when it is holding most cash&mdash;when contributions are almost fully paid-up. Customers will want to know where their pre-payments have gone.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/3">Naturally, they will. He said that customers are concerned about the time that elapsed between the suspension of EHR shares and Farepak's ceasing trading, and that</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/4" class="indent">&quot;Others want to know whether their money went towards making other firms in the EHR group attractive enough to be immediately snapped up&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/5">which they were, very shortly after the collapse. He added that customers also need to why Farepak's lending banks allowed the situation to go as far as it did. That point has been touched on by several hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.6/6">I also ask that the Minister examine closely whether the Government are one of Farepak's creditors. Sadly, in the past, the small investor has normally been the last to be compensated. On this occasion, the Government and other large creditors should set an example, step back and allow any assets of the company to be used to form a compensation package for those people who have been so devastated by the loss of all their savings.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.2/1">I take the Minister's point, but if VAT has been paid, clearly the Minister will want to consider hon. Members' comments in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/2">On what can be done in the future, we look forward to hearing what stage the Minister's discussions with the Financial Services Authority have reached. Farepak is not the first case of a Christmas hamper voucher company getting into difficulties. There was the case of FHSC in February, and Choice Gift Vouchers went into bankruptcy earlier this year. We need to know what can be done now, given that several companies have had difficulties. We look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about how quickly secondary legislation can be introduced under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to add such companies to the list of those that are regulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/3">Several hon. Members have rightly mentioned HBOS. One of the key questions that we need answers to is why the offer from Park to buy Farepak was rejected twice. Park is the company that rescued FHSC and that prevented its customers from getting into the same problems as Farepak's customers. What was the role of HBOS in preventing that rescue offer from being accepted?</p>

	<p pid="a.198.0/1">My hon. Friend mentions the role of HBOS, and we have heard about the roles that many people played. Is it not the case that the Minister, who has been working on hard on the issue, needs to get all those people around the table so that they can all contribute to helping those who have lost out? Does my hon. Friend share my worry that the British Retail Consortium has said that there is no central database of customers? If that is so, it will be difficult to put together a rescue package.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.2/1">Many people in my constituency have been affected by the collapse. One agent has lost &pound;11,000 and is still waiting for a reply from the administrator. Another has lost &pound;18,500, and I know of individual savers who have lost between &pound;150 and &pound;450 each.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/2">I want to comment briefly on the role of individuals, and of the directors in particular. Although I go along with the administrators' applauding the Government and the action that they have taken under the Companies Act 1985, we have to be sensible. Disqualification of directors is not what we are talking about. We have heard a lot of things today, and the disqualification of directors is not the end result that we are looking for. I am told that the administrators have realised &pound;2.5 million and I call on the administrators to ensure that that money goes not to the preferred creditors, but to those who were the savers and the backbone of the industry. Clackmannanshire council and the Alloa and District Round Table are each putting in &pound;5,000, and they are calling on industries and businesses in Clackmannanshire to do the same, so that Farepak savers there can have at least some sort of Christmas.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.2/3">My last comments are to do with the role of the Hamper Industry Trade Association. We know that it has five members, including Farepak, and that it has a voluntary and unenforceable code of practice, with a bond of &pound;100,000. HITA called on its members to give due attention to safeguarding their customers' money. I wrote to HITA on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-25">25 October</phrase> and received a reply from the secretary. He wrote that the collapse was extremely unfortunate but that he is on holiday from <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-02">2 November</phrase> until the 12th. On behalf of a number of my constituents, I invited him to meet hon. Members at the House. He refused to do so, but although others have had a part to play, HITA and its member organisations should be called to the House to explain their role, so that Members can explain it to those who have lost their money.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.1/1">I shall be very brief, Miss Begg. We have had an excellent debate, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1866" name="Anne Snelgrove">the hon. Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove)</phrase> on initiating it. The issue has touched the hearts of hon. Members and of people throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/2">I shall focus on how the problem arose. The industry is unregulated. It falls within the retail sector, not the savings sector, but in principle it operates in a similar way to credit unions. The hamper industry depends on each company fulfilling its part of the bargain.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/3">In February this year Family Hampers went bust. The system allowed customers to pay in their savings, the company would bank the money and vouchers were issued to customers by a separate voucher company; the company then invoiced the Christmas club, and the shops invoiced the voucher company. When Family Hampers went bust, Choice Gift Vouchers went into administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/4">The major store groups decided that they had had enough of that&mdash;they were &pound;55 million out of pocket. They decided that there should be no more credit and that vouchers should be purchased up front. That led to a funding crisis at European Home Retail, the parent company, and its shares were suspended in August. However, EHR was using Farepak to fund its own deficit, and each month the customers' savings were being raided like a piggy bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/5">Why was that company not put into administration until October? HBOS was still raking in savers' money to fund the EHR overdraft. The worst thing, however, is that earlier in October the non-Farepak rump of EHR was sold off for &pound;34 million in cash. Where has that money gone? How is it possible to drain a subsidiary of cash and then sell it, leaving tens of thousands of people being owed money?</p>

	<p pid="a.203.2/1">Yes; my hon. Friend makes an important point. The reputation of the hamper industry has been gravely damaged. Regulation would greatly strengthen its reputation, and its ability deal properly with the money that people entrust to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.2/2">Will the Minister investigate the actions of HBOS? It continued to accept &pound;1 million a month of savings from Farepak, knowing that the company was insolvent. Will he also look into the claims of organisations such as the Hamper Industry Trade Association, which purport to offer protection through a bond until something goes wrong? The British Retail Consortium initially offered to make a goodwill gesture but it seems that its Christmas good will has run out. Indeed, several hon. Members have alluded to the cruel irony that, having made the offer, it has now withdrawn it.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.4/1">I, too, add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1866" name="Anne Snelgrove">my commendations to the hon. Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove)</phrase>. She has been leading on this issue in parliamentary questions, in her constituency, and now here. That is very much to her credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/2">Many questions have been asked and issues raised, and I am sure that the Minister will want to respond to them in full. I shall attempt to rattle through them; I shall therefore take no interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/3">One issue that arose in debate was the advice given to Farepak agents holding customer payments not yet paid into the company's account. My understanding is that they had been advised that the money should be returned to the customers. Will the Minister confirm that the administrator has indeed given that advice? As the hon. Member for South Swindon said, the Hamper Industry Trade Association Ltd is reported to have referred to a bond against deposits for member companies. Does the Minister agree that such an offer is largely meaningless in a case of such scale and calibre?</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/4">The collapse of Farepak has left many families facing a bleak Christmas. They tried to do the right thing by saving for the festivities, but now they are completely out of pocket&mdash;in some cases, to the tune of hundreds of pounds. We do not know the exact number of customers. Some reports suggest that about 120,000 are affected. Indeed, the total amount lost is not clear. Estimates vary between &pound;27 million and &pound;40 million. What we do know is that those people have been robbed of their Christmas.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/5">The collapse seems to have come without any warning to the customers or to the 25,000 or so agents who acted for Farepak. Marisa Cavarra, who was an agent for Farepak in the vale of Glamorgan, told the BBC:</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/6" class="indent">&quot;We had no indication that anything like this was about to happen. I paid my money last month and there were no warnings that there were problems.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/7">The lack of forewarning is especially concerning given that the parent company, European Home Retail, had its shares suspended three months previously, back in August. Will the Minister ask why it took so long for administrators to be appointed after the shares were suspended and why, as several hon. Members mentioned, payment reminders were sent out to agents during that period?</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/8">The absence of information is not the principal concern, however. When one looks at the accounts, one sees that Farepak's finances looked good. It received a clean audit, had assets of &pound;3.6 million and last year had a profit of &pound;1.6 million, so what went wrong? Where did the families' money go?</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/9">There have been reports, notably in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i>, that there were significant cash transfers between the parent company, EHR, and Farepak, with the former using the large cash balances of the latter to pay off its overdraft with the group bank, HBOS. Let us be clear: group-wide money management is fairly routine for many companies and is not, of itself, illegal. However, when that money is the savings of individuals, there is a serious problem if those deposits are not secured appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/10">In 2000, EHR bought a book and toy firm called DMG for &pound;35 million. Apparently, the purchase proved to be a financial disaster and after several asset write-downs, the firm managed to sell DMG&mdash;for just &pound;4m. Several analysts have suggested that that episode in particular is the reason why the firm found itself owing millions to its bank. That is when, the reports suggest, the large cash transfers between Farepak and its parent company began in earnest. Someone decided to raid the piggy-bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/11">Given that, can the Minister confirm that his Department's inquiry will specifically consider that aspect of the case and the actions of those responsible for the financial management of the firm, including the advisers and the bank? Equally, I wonder whether he can comment yet on the advice that he received from the Insolvency Service, which he sought on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-19">19 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/12">Farepak was one of many Christmas-club companies, which tend to target those on lower incomes and which bank the money on their behalf, usually in return for vouchers that are redeemed in stores such as Woolies or Argos. The more people save, the more vouchers they get. That savings model has been around a long time and typically means that the retailers are extending a lot of credit to the voucher company while it in turn is cash-rich. To be fair, the activity has been around a long time and has, for many lower-income households, been a good informal way to save. As hon. Members said, there is a personal touch to that form of saving, not least because it is often family members who act as agents for the firm. Perhaps most important, that form of saving has helped people who would otherwise never have saved money to start that vital habit.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/13">Therefore, if there are remedial measures to be taken beyond this one business, we need to be careful not to destroy the whole market and, with it, the opportunity that many families have to save. Amid the understandable clamour for regulation, the Minister must not&mdash;I am sure that he will not&mdash;lose sight of the facts of the case and who is responsible. Given that, will he confirm that his inquiry will include the whole EHR group of companies, its directors, its managers and its advisers? Can he say whether the inquiry will extend to the pensions of the work force and to how many of them have lost all or part of their entitlement? Can he confirm that it is his intention to make public the full results of the inquiry? The families affected deserve to know exactly what happened and who is responsible.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/14">The sudden demise of Farepak has caused great heartache and financial loss&mdash;very often, for people who can ill afford to lose any money. As hon. Members have said, it will mean that for thousands of families Christmas will be bleak. The Minister was very quick in responding to the situation, which is to his credit, but what is important now is that the facts are clearly established about Farepak and EHR and that any proposed actions focus on the specific circumstances. If people have failed in their duties, they must be held to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.4/15">It is far too early to say whether this case shows that there is reason to believe that regulation must be imposed on the industry, but once the inquiry is concluded and, we hope, its results published, we shall be able to judge whether Farepak is an isolated case or whether there are wider lessons to be learned. I am sure that, if there is a case for sensible action beyond the circumstances of this case, the Minister will want to return to that issue. Meanwhile, I am certain that the families will want to hear what progress he has made and what news, if any, he has for them about his Department's inquiry.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-07a.205.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" speakername="Ian McCartney" speakeroffice="The Minister for Trade"  colnum="205"  time="010:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061107/halltext/61107h0004.htm#06110746000673">
	<p pid="a.205.0/1">Good morning, Miss Begg. I thank all right hon. and hon. Members for participating in what has been a passionate and sometimes genuinely angry debate. People should be angry about the situation that we are discussing. This is one of those areas in which Members of Parliament can, I hope, make a difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/2">First, I shall put on record the basic facts of the case. Then I shall talk about what I have been doing and the proposals for a way forward, and give some information about the administration, the investigation and the regulatory framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/3">I want to give a commitment. It would not be prudent to answer all the questions that have been asked here today, and I shall explain why. An investigation is going on, and I want to ensure, as the Minister, that I act appropriately, so that if at any later date there are further investigations, inquiries or, indeed, charges, no one can put up a slick lawyer or barrister in the High Court and use what I have said in the House to allow someone to avoid a proper inquiry. It is important that I give as much information as I can, but I also ask hon. Members to trust me. At each stage, I will come back to the House, in a forum such as this or in other forums, to keep hon. Members fully up to date on the inquiry, the investigation and the appropriate action that will need to be taken later.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/4">Like other hon. Members, I was appalled when I heard about what happened. It took me back 35 years to the time when I was a 20-year-old with two children. We paid for our Christmas by joining a hamper club, a Christmas club. That was what a young family did. My parents and grandparents did it before me. It was part and parcel of the community in which I was brought up and it remains part and parcel of that community. These things are deep in the psychology of the community. This is about self-opportunity in saving and ensuring that every member of the family does as well as they can at Christmas. People save throughout the year. It was passed on from generation to generation that that was what we did. That is why the events involving Farepak are so appalling and why I took the action that I did. I know from personal experience what it would be like to be affected by such events.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/5">I shall recap briefly on the basic facts of the case so that everyone is clear about them. Farepak's main business was essentially a Christmas club. The company took payments during the year, mostly through a network of agents, and delivered in return either vouchers redeemable in a range of stores, or a hamper. Some 10 to 15 per cent. of the business involved hampers. Some 80 to 85 per cent. was done through vouchers. The vouchers would have been sent out about now, the hampers nearer Christmas, and the rest of the industry is currently doing exactly that&mdash;hon. Members may be asking what is happening with other companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/6">It appears that this company had some 26,000 agents. We are trying to identify, through the administrator, how many of those are active agents. That work is ongoing. The number of customers is uncertain, because the relationship was always with the agents, not the customer base. The company itself had no direct information, but it appears that there are probably in excess of 100,000 customers. That is an estimate from the administrator. The situation has affected whole families and whole streets in communities up and down the country. The total amount due to those customers is not known, but we have heard that many individuals are owed hundreds of pounds and some, at least, are owed thousands.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/7">I would like to give an assurance. BDO Stoy Hayward made a statement a few days ago, following a meeting with me, that cheques sent to Farepak and received by the joint administrators after the company went into administration on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-13">13 October</phrase> were never banked, and that some customers will already have received their returned cheques. That process will continue for some time. Because of the volume of correspondence to be processed, there is no set limit on the time that it will take for those cheques to arrive, but the administrator is trying to get it done by the end of November. That money will be returned by the administrator, and not seized and retained.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/8">The company was placed in administration on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-13">13 October</phrase> on application to the High Court. The administrator has confirmed that the company will not be able to fulfil orders that it has received for either vouchers or hampers, and&mdash;I must be straight; there is no point in dressing it up&mdash;it is pennies, not pounds, that it will return, at the end of the investigation, to those who lost their money.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/9">I cannot comment on the possible reasons for Farepak's failure. That is, of course, subject to investigations by the administrator and my Department's companies investigation branch. I cannot prejudge the outcome of those investigations but I undertake to pass on to the investigators all the points raised by hon. Members this morning, including some points that I have heard for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/10">This is an appalling state of affairs. The impact on so many family Christmases, in so many parts of Britain, can only be imagined. I fully share the concern that so many hon. Members have expressed about the effect on hard-working people, many of them among the least well-off, who aimed to put by something for Christmas, so that when that happy time of year came round again, they could be sure of participating without getting into debt. Let us be clear that the people affected are not ordinary, but extraordinary, and that they come from extraordinary communities, where they try to do the best they can by their families, friends and workmates. What has happened is not their fault. They have been let down by the so-called top people.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/11">My first priority is to mobilise whatever resources or assistance may be available to help to alleviate the impact of the collapse on the customers and their families, in the limited time available before Christmas. That is why I made it clear in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1866" name="Anne Snelgrove">the House, when my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove)</phrase> raised the matter in questions on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-19">19 October</phrase>&mdash;I cannot praise her too highly for what she has done, not only in securing the debate, but behind <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1942" name="Tony Cunningham">the scenes, with my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Tony Cunningham)</phrase> and other colleagues, in their communities&mdash;that I had discussed the way forward with the administrators and contacted the British Retail Consortium. That led to a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-21">21 October</phrase> to discuss the potential for a good-will gesture to help the most needy people, who have lost out completely. It readily agreed to the meeting, which was held at the Department of Trade and Industry to assess the level of the problem caused by the company going into administration. We agreed that the aim should be to find a package that would be simple, fraud-free and not derisory, and which would be easy to administer at store level as well as providing as much choice as possible for the customers to shop where they wanted.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/12">The retail sector has no legal obligations in the matter, and the package would not have been a compensation package, but the British Retail Consortium accepted in principle the idea of a good-will gesture, given the exceptional circumstances surrounding Christmas, and agreed a statement setting out the arrangement, to be placed in the public domain. I am sorry that the consortium has come to the view that the practical difficulties are too severe, and has abandoned its efforts to devise a good-will package. I am very grateful to the BRC for its help so far and its continued willingness to support our efforts to find a solution. I know from the individual retailers who have contacted me that they remain willing to consider supporting any alternative proposal that is sufficiently simple and timely.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/13">I have also had initial discussions with the chairman of HBOS, Lord Stevenson, about the possibility of the banking community, including his own bank, making a contribution, and we have agreed to further discussions following today's debate. I am sure that Lord Stevenson would like me to report further to the House on the discussions that we have had. I want to make it clear to hon. Members that I am not in discussions with him about the role of HBOS, or allegations about that role. That is a matter for the investigations. I am discussing his ability, and the sector's ability, to make a contribution. He has made it clear that some of the allegations in the press are fallacious, and I am sure that a defence will be set out on that basis. However, he has also said that HBOS will, as a company, work with the investigators and support any work that they want to do to get to the bottom of the issues. The discussions that I am having are fire-walled. The other matter is for the investigators, and hon. Members with allegations to make should make those to the investigators, not to me. I shall report back on my discussions with HBOS.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/14">I make it clear to hon. Members that I am not giving up on this issue. I am as committed to it as they are, and we need to make a difference to hard-working people. I was mindful of what the BRC said and accepted what it said, in good faith. I have no reason to believe otherwise. As a consequence, my office and staff have been working around the clock&mdash;we were in the office at half-past 1 this morning&mdash;trying to bring together what I shall propose. We have been working closely with the Family Fund, a registered charity based in the city of York, whose chief executive is Marion Rowe. She is well-respected in the government, business and charity sectors. She and her team have, in the past few days, been working tirelessly with the administrators. The fund's main focus is on providing assistance to families with disabled children, and it was originally prompted by the thalidomide disaster, so we are talking to skilled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/15">The fund has 30 years of experience of grant-making and providing assistance to families, including the large-scale distribution of vouchers. In 2006, it distributed &pound;27 million on behalf of the Government to more that 46,000 low-income families with disabled children. I am genuinely pleased to announce to the House today that the Family Fund is setting up a dedicated voucher fund for Farepak customers, called the Farepak response fund. The Government are strongly behind that. The fund will be independent of all agencies and will accept donations from all sectors. In recognition of the need for a good-will gesture this Christmas, may I suggest to hon. Members that we should take the moral high ground today? We received a pay rise this week. I ask hon. Members to donate a day's pay to the fund, because I shall be going out there and asking a lot of people, who have no legal obligation to make a contribution and about whom many remarks have been made today. I want to do that from the moral high ground.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.5/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point on which I am certainly not qualified or knowledgeable enough to comment in detail. The Minister will surely respond by saying that rail utilisation strategies are what the Department for Transport is focusing on at the moment to obtain better use of the existing network. It appears that that is certainly not happening in my hon. Friend's neck of the woods.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.5/2">In my experience, the Treasury is always involved in the railways and actually killed off the investment in rail that was part of the Beeching package. There was supposed to be investment following on from the cuts, but while there were cuts, there was no investment, a move that set back electrification. The Treasury has suffered and groaned, quite understandably, under Railtrack and the events associated with it, and has calculated that it subsidises every rail passenger by about &pound;4 per trip. However, the pressures for expansion exist and have to be admitted. In recent statements, the Government have said that they are aiming for more use and capacity on the railways, which is part and parcel of the new franchising process. Network Rail certainly aim to do that, and it set aside considerable sums of money for that purpose. The rail regulator, to whom I recently spoke, said that in his dealings with the rail companies and Network Rail, he wished to encourage, as far as possible, increased capacity and rail growth&mdash;whatever we mean by that.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.5/3">Groups such as Transport 2000 are mounting a vigorous and effective campaign, arguing for developing the railways. There have been a number of conferences on that, which have been supported by players such as the CBI.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.3/1">I agree. I suspect that many lessons can be learned from London's experience with congestion charging and from the attempts to increase the number of buses and to promote the use Oyster cards and other mechanisms to reduce the cost of public transport. In Scotland, the policy of free bus travel for pensioners has also been very successful in getting pensioners to use buses as their preferred mode of transport. It is clear that price is a major factor when transport users make their choices, but if the trains are not there, people will not be able to use them, no matter what the cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.3/2">To conclude, there is a strong political case&mdash;particularly against the backdrop of the Stern report&mdash;for making significant investment to ensure that Britain's railways provide us all with a service. Like me, my hon. Friend the Minister regularly commutes to Scotland, and he will be well aware that the journey is far lengthier for those who commute by rail than it is for those who use alternatives such as air. If we had the high-speed links that exist in many European countries, however, rail would become a far more competitive option. I therefore congratulate my hon. Friend on the work that he has already done since being appointed to his position and encourage him to do all he can to ensure that we get better investment in our railways.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-07a.239.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" colnum="239"  time="012:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061107/halltext/61107h0009.htm#06110746000758">
	<p pid="a.239.2/1">I would be grateful to receive that from my hon. Friend, perhaps by letter, or we may discuss it afterwards. If I may, I shall return to addressing the points that she raises.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/2">The FVO returned to inspect Bowland in September, but it did not consider that enough had been done to bring the premises up to the required standard. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-06">6 October</phrase>, the Commission used emergency powers to ban the sale of curd cheese from Bowland, effectively shutting the business down. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-16">16 October</phrase>, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice initiating infraction proceedings against the UK for failure to implement food safety legislation, and announced that an FVO mission would be sent to inspect the UK dairy industry in November.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/3">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs maintains close contact with the FSA on the matter because it is important that the dairy industry does not suffer as a result. The United Kingdom has a dairy industry to be proud of; it is a matter for congratulation that the processing sector sets itself higher standards than those required by legislation and voluntarily uses rapid screening tests to check for antibiotic residues.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/4">The FVO mission made a number of allegations, some of which are still disputed. I hope, Mr. Martlew, that you will understand that there are certain elements into which I may not go for fear of prejudicing legal proceedings. However, we need to be clear about what is and is not acceptable. None of us would support the use of milk contaminated with substances such as detergents or dyes. None of us could endorse the use of out-of-date milk collected from retail establishments to be reprocessed into dairy products. I am sure that my hon. Friend would not support the use of mouldy and contaminated cheese, including floor waste, being vacuum-packed for sale.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/5">In my view, it is also important to acknowledge that the majority of the UK dairy industry consistently applies much higher standards of food hygiene practices&mdash;ones that often exceed the requirements previously set out by the FSA. The industry is to be congratulated on such rigorous self-vetting. However, it is clear that in future the whole industry needs to be certain about what is and is not acceptable, and that must be reinforced by guidance from the FSA.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/6">The Government responded to the infraction letter by agreeing to implement the Commission's interpretive guidance on milk that fails a rapid antibiotic residue screening test. The FSA supported that approach and issued revised guidance to local authorities and the dairy industry on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-20">20 October</phrase>. At the meeting of the European Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase>, the Commission agreed to bring together all the parties concerned in order to enable discussion of the outstanding scientific issues on antibiotic testing. That is a welcome development. In the long term, it should resolve the scientific questions at issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/7">The FSA, working with local authorities and the dairy industry, needs to ensure that there is no confusion over its revised guidelines and that the UK dairy sector knows exactly what is needed to pass this month's audit with a clean bill of health.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-07a.244.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="244"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061107/halltext/61107h0010.htm#06110746000769">
	<p pid="a.244.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Martlew, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.2/2">I have explained at some length why I do not think that Harriet falls within the cohort definition required by the European regulations. A further, more general point&mdash;it would be helpful for the Minister to respond to this&mdash;is that my contention and the contention of the Prices is that Harriet does not pose any threat to human health. For her to do so, she would have to enter the food chain. My contention is that this will never happen. First, her owners have no intention of selling her or doing anything other than keeping her as a pet. Secondly and, from the Department's point of view, most importantly, DEFRA hold her passport so she cannot legally be moved or slaughtered, and even if that were to occur, she would have to be tested for BSE post-slaughter. My contention is that the risk to human health from Harriet is non-existent.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.2/3">In the letters I have written to the Minister, I have repeatedly asked him to explain how Harriet poses a threat to human health, and that is one of the key points that has never been satisfactorily answered. I would be grateful if the Minister could explain in his response, without reference to bureaucratic regulations and in plain English, how Harriet continuing to live poses a threat to human health. I cannot work that out.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.2/4">In the Minister's reply to me of <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-13">13 June</phrase>, he correctly points out in paragraph 4 that currently</p>
	<p pid="a.244.2/5" class="indent">&quot;there is no live test for BSE&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.2/6">That is one reason why animals have to be slaughtered and tested post-mortem. There are two examples of companies working on live tests for BSE&mdash;one in Canada and one in the United States. They are currently at the final stages of tests before clinical trials within the EU. Those tests are expected to be available before the end of 2007 and will analyse DNA strands in the blood of the animal in question, pick up on any signs of disease and detect the disease well in advance of any symptoms. If the Minister is unable to accept that Harriet is captured by those regulations, and if Harriet's owners were to agree to further controls over her movements, one possible avenue open to him might be to give Harriet a stay of execution until a live BSE test is available, when she could be tested to check whether she is free of infection.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.2/7">I know that Ministers and officials are very keen on precedents, so I would like to give two examples of where they were sufficiently flexible to exempt animals in cases such as this. A short time ago in March, it was reported that Larry the lamb, which despite that name was female, entered a slaughter house but was not slaughtered because abattoir workers realised there was a new-born lamb among the sheep and made an exception. However, official rules said that no animal born in a slaughterhouse could leave it alive, and they were ordered to kill the lamb, which they named Larry, and its mother. They had to go as far as employing a barrister to argue their case against DEFRA, the Department represented by the Minister, which made the point that disease control legislation was unequivocal and rules were rules. However, after a day's intensive lobbying, a high-ranking civil servant in London finally relented and gave permission for a special licence allowing Larry to live on a local farm, showing that officials can be sufficiently flexible if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.2/8">Of course, the best known example, which many people, certainly in my constituency, can remember, takes us back to the days when we were suffering because of foot and mouth disease. The famous Phoenix the calf was found on a pile of dead animals and should have been killed under the requirements of the rules at the time, which we know were applied relentlessly throughout the country. However, Phoenix was allowed to live under a &quot;policy refinement&quot;&mdash;I think that was the official way it was described at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.2/9">This is my plea to the Minister. Will he consider the evidence about how Harriet was reared and fed, which shows that she was not part of the cohort and therefore is not required to be slaughtered under the regulations? If he does not find that evidence convincing, I plead with him to allow Harriet a stay of execution at least until a live BSE test is available. I am sure that the Prices would comply with any further restrictions that the Department wanted to invoke, to assure themselves that there was no risk of her being moved or entering the food chain. Finally, I ask the Minister to think about the other examples in which flexibility was shown. If he were able to do that, he would have the gratitude not only of the Prices and the many people in my constituency who are supporting them and Harriet, but of many people who have contacted me from around the world about the case. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-11-07a.254.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" speakername="Andrew MacKinlay" colnum="254"  time="013:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061107/halltext/61107h0011.htm#06110746000782">
	<p pid="a.254.0/1">I associate myself with everything that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1528" name="Howard Stoate">my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate)</phrase> said. I represent Thurrock, which is on the other side of the bridge, and I support his views and his protest, which he has outlined to hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/2">Strictly speaking, we are not talking about the M25, but the Thurrock-Dartford crossing is part of the M25 to all intents and purposes. It was therefore a gross discourtesy on the part of the Minister and his Department not to advise Members in the area before he made his announcement. He has apologised informally, but that is not good enough. his actions and those of the Department were sloppy and inexcusable, and I will not forget it.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/3">Let me set out the history of the matter. Under an Act of Parliament&mdash;you probably voted for it, Mr. Martlew, but it was before I came to the House&mdash;there was to be no tolling once the bridge was paid four. Approximately four years ago, it was paid for, and, under the Act, the tolling was supposed to cease. However, the Transport Act 2000, to which my hon. Friend referred, was bounced through the House and gave the Government a way of continuing to derive revenue from the crossing. I protested at the time and I regret that, instead of listening to me, Thurrock council listened to the then Transport Minister, who offered it the carrot of some extra borrowing if it acquiesced in the continued tolling. I told the council that it was being foolhardy in the extreme and I take no satisfaction from the fact that I will be proved prophetic when the council realises that it was indeed foolish to acquiesce in the continued tolling.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/4">At the very least, I had thought that the tolling would wither on the vine. I thought that it would continue to give the Department for Transport a revenue stream, but that it would reduce in real terms. Why? Because it is an unfair tax, particularly on my constituents and those of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">my hon. Friend, the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> and other hon. Members representing areas to the east of London. It is demonstrably unfair that our constituents are making a disproportionate contribution to the running of the M25 and other road projects, when the costs should be met by all motorists. That is what is so unacceptable. It is amazing that the Government have produced such an unfair proposal, which hits some of the most disadvantaged people. Those people have to go to work on the other side of the river, and the tax on their trip to work, which is already &pound;10 a week, will be even higher if the present proposals are accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/5">I do not oppose road charging&mdash;indeed, there is a lot to be said for it&mdash;but we should introduce a planned, comprehensive national system under which there is parity of treatment and people pay as they go. The people of Thurrock, Dartford and nearby areas should not pay for other people's motoring.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/6">Congestion will increase under the present proposals. My hon. Friend told us about the problems of pollution, which are often caused by static vehicles pumping out fumes. Clearly, if motorists have to find &pound;1.50, rather than just a &pound;1 coin, that will mean greater delays, so the proposals do not make sense from that point of view.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/7">I understand that the Minister's motive is revenue, and he may try to tell us that the proposals are part of the plan for road charging and tolling. If so, will he also announce the proposal for an experimental road-pricing system in and around Broadstairs? I am told that that is being introduced, but I do not imagine that he will amplify on it today.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/8">The fact is that the proposals are unfair to the people in the area. We need to make it clear that it is time for the Minister and his colleagues to think again about the operation of the scheme, its inequity and whether it could be part of a road-pricing scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/9">The tolling did prove to be successful, and I am certainly a convert to the idea of paying for a bridge or river crossing by means of tolling. Furthermore, the idea of a further crossing is compelling, and I cannot understand the delay, because the project could be a gilt-edged investment. It could be paid for by users not of the Thurrock-Dartford crossing, but of the new bridge, which could and should be constructed with the utmost expedition in the interests of United Kingdom Ltd. and commerce. That should be happening now.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/10">I do not want to discourage the use of tolling to pay for bridges, and I am quite happy about road pricing as a matter of principle&mdash;indeed, there is a compelling case for arguing that it is fair&mdash;but the current proposal to increase toll charges, and the manner in which it was introduced, are unacceptable. I will do everything that I can to frustrate the new charges&mdash;and I will not be so nice next time.</p>
