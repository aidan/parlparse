	<p pid="b.439.2/1">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.&mdash;[Mr. Cawsey.]</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.439.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="439"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h01.htm#60215h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.439.3/1">I sought this debate because there is an emerging controversy&mdash;indeed, a scandal&mdash;about the small British dependency of Ascension Island. Over a period of years, its inhabitants, of whom there are just over 1,000, were led to believe that they had a settled future on a developing, liberalising island. Those expectations have been rather brutally removed following a Government policy U-turn announced at the end of last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.3/2">Concern over the issue has been compounded by the suspicion&mdash;there is no proof of this&mdash;that much of that change in policy is attributable to the influence exerted on the Government by the Americans, who have a major strategic interest in the island. That, therefore, is the context of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.3/3">I was prompted to seek the debate by a constituent, Mr. Hutchison, who is passionately interested in the subject. Since then, I have been deluged with e-mails and other messages from islanders, their elected councillors, people who have served on the island and former British administrators, all of whom feel passionately that the islanders have been betrayed and that we might well be on the brink of a case similar to that of Diego Garcia, which aroused much controversy four decades ago and whose consequences rumble on to this day. The island is, of course, very small, and the issue affects a small number of people, but it is worth remembering that this country went to war 20 years ago over the 2,000 people in the Falklands. The status and rights of just over 1,000 people on Ascension Island should therefore concern us, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.3/4">Let me give a bit of background to explain why the issue is important and how it came about. The British started using Ascension as part of the empire roughly at the time of the Napoleonic wars; that was related to Napoleon's incarceration on St. Helena. From the outset, there have been arguments within the Government about what to do with the island. That was rather beautifully captured in a quotation about the first Admiralty commandant at the beginning of the 19th century, Captain Bates. It was said that he was</p>
	<p pid="b.439.3/5" class="indent">&quot;by no means the last commandant of Ascension to be crippled by changes in&mdash;or rather the lack of&mdash;any proper policy in London. The Lords of the Admiralty seem never to have made up their minds about what they wanted Ascension to be.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.439.3/6">That is as true today as it was 200 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.3/7">The geography is unpromising, as the island is on a volcanic outcrop on the Atlantic ridge. The rock is very new; indeed, it is so new that there was originally no soil on the island. However, when people involved in the campaign first showed me pictures of it, I was struck by the fact that there were forests and small farms at the top of the mountain. I was told that they were there because people had imported soil in the 19th century so that agriculture could begin. They had carried it to the top of the mountain because that was the only place where water could be captured. Great labour has therefore gone into creating this British dependency and into its active use.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.3/8">The population is small, and there has been a long tradition of controlling it. A statement of policy in, I think, 1925 said that only friendly tribes could go to the island. That was a reference to St. Helenians, and migrant workers from St. Helena make up three quarters of Ascension Island's population. The pattern of population has been characterised by contract working. Workers on the island are, in effect, Gastarbeiter in the truest sense: they are there to work for a period and are required to leave when they retire. That has been the traditional pattern.</p>

	<p pid="b.440.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. I can establish no connection between my constituency and Ascension Island, but a former mayoress of Kettering came from St. Helena, and the island was very proud of her elevation to that post. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we owe a huge debt of gratitude to Ascension islanders, not least in connection with the Falklands war, and that it is up to Her Majesty's Government to do the right thing by the islanders as regards their future administration?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.440.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="440"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h01.htm#60215h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.440.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has captured in a sentence the essence of what I am going to say at rather greater length. His reference to the lady mayoress raises the interesting issue of what constitutes a resident of the island. The Foreign Office doctrine, which it often repeats and which the Minister has echoed in his parliamentary answers, is that there is no indigenous population of islanders. That is a fundamental Foreign Office principle and it certainly reflects the intention, but the problem is that the truth is more complicated.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/2">The situation was captured for me in an e-mail that I received from Mr. Martin Cole, who told me about his great-grandmother, Flora Wilson, who apparently was born on Ascension Island in the middle of the 19th century and always considered herself an Ascension islander. She wrote many times to the Foreign Office and the authorities on Ascension for documentary proof of her birth, and they always refused to answer her letters. On one occasion, she was told off the record that it would be rather embarrassing if they had to acknowledge that people had been born on the island, and that they were committed and attached to it, because that would blow something of a hole in the official definition of an islander.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/3">Over the years, many people have been born on the island. The average is five a year, which is not an enormous number, but people have been born there, and there are grandchildren of residents. The extent of settlement is therefore rather more substantial than the official definition would suggest.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/4">My final point by way of introduction, which is crucial to an understanding of how the place works, is that the island has long been a centre of communications and military activity. On the British side, it has long been an RAF base. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> said, it was used during the Falklands war, when it was described on one occasion as the busiest airport in the world. It is also an important base for GCHQ and for British military and communications activity. It is also important for the Americans. In particular, there is the Wideawake airfield, which I shall discuss later.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/5">That leads me to the question of governance and administration. For many years, Ascension was managed by the Admiralty, and in 1922 it was passed to St. Helena, of which it remains officially part. However, the practical point is that it has been run for most of the past 80 years as a company island. Public and private sector users of the island formed a committee or consortium to manage and run it, using contract labour from overseas. They provided services and charged islanders for using them by means of what amounted to a poll tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/6">All that came to an end in 1999, when the late Robin Cook issued his White Paper on dependent territories, which created new expectations about how dependent territories should be run. A key passage says:</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Discussion of constitutional change is already under way. We are planning, for example, to consult the people of St Helena and Dependencies about how to develop the democratic and civil rights of people living on Ascension Island&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/8">A lot flows from that, politically and economically.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/9">The next key step was that the Government encouraged a study to set out a plan for the island. It was called the Portsmouth study, after the university of Portsmouth, and I met one of its authors yesterday to discuss its continuing relevance. The Portsmouth report initiated its argument with a key passage, which said that</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/10" class="indent">&quot;decisions must be made about whether this island becomes normal or another Diego Garcia&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/11">That is exactly the issue. Normality consisted of three main developments, and the logic of the proposals was that each development was interlocking.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/12">The first element was the development of a proper economy based on what the report called the public finance option. In other words, public services should be provided by the state and people should pay taxes for them&mdash;a simple principle, but it had not operated in Ascension until then. That was acted on, and by April 2002 a system of income tax and property taxes for business had been introduced to finance the embryonic services on the island. The islanders then said, &quot;No taxation without representation.&quot; They wanted democracy. Democracy was agreed and a council elected in November 2002. Much of the feedback that I have received has come from the islanders' democratically elected representatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/13">The third element of the package is the crucial one, but it has caused the greatest difficulty. The Portsmouth report argued that it was not possible to have a meaningful economy or democratic polity without the wider liberalisation of the island. What was meant by that was property rights, the right of abode, the privatisation of assets&mdash;so that there could be an embryonic business system, with the growth of small business&mdash;and opening the island to visitors, with limited specialised tourism.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/14">Since then, all three elements of the package have been gradually put into place, with the full and active support of the Government. A lot has happened. A land registry has been established, which is crucial, because there can be no property rights without the designation of land. The implicit assumption throughout has been that the islanders would be given property rights. Houses were built for the first time&mdash;there used to be only barrack-type residences for contract labour&mdash;and there has been privatisation, although we are talking not Railtrack, but the privatisation of the launderette, among other things. None the less, important assets have been created for private business, in terms of the scale of the island.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/15">The Department for International Development has been actively involved in the development of the island, spending &pound;500,000 to support a nature reservation, with some unique turtles and bird life being protected with the help of British taxpayers' money. All that has taken place on the assumption that the island will develop a tourist industry and that the islanders working on the island will acquire long-term residence and become stakeholders in the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/16">The Americans were co-operative and agreed to the idea that there should be a limited number of flights to the island. There was no problem at that stage and, most crucially, legal advice was sought on how property rights and the right of abode could be consolidated in law. A leading lawyer, Michael Bailey QC, was commissioned to do that legal work. I received a slightly odd parliamentary answer when I asked how much that legal advice cost, which said that it was &pound;2,500. My information is that it cost at least &pound;60,000. There may have just been an accident in the Foreign Office, but that fits with the story that has emerged of the attempt to minimise the extent of the Government's commitment to the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/17">This happy story was evolving very nicely and coherently until the end of November, when a delegation from the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence went to island, supposedly to consult&mdash;in fact, an announcement was simply made&mdash;on what was described as &quot;new thinking&quot; in the Government. A statement was made that said, among other things, that</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/18" class="indent">&quot;the UK Government could face unacceptable risks&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/19">and that</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/20" class="indent">&quot;UK Ministers were . . . moving . . . towards the view that it would not be appropriate to grant . . . right of abode and rights to property . . . ownership to people . . . living on Ascension.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/21">That was followed by a letter from the governor, who said that he was reluctant to proceed with the reforms, and a letter from Lord Triesman about significant new risks that had emerged.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/22">The islanders were horrified. They felt badly betrayed and have expressed themselves forcefully in letters to the Government. I shall read not some of the more emotional comments, but a low-key statement that captures, in essence, why the islanders have a powerful sense of grievance. A letter from the island council to Lord Triesman says:</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/23" class="indent">&quot;Expectations of right of abode and land tenure have been raised by a whole raft of Ministers, FCO Desk Officers, our previous Governor and Administrator and there must now be some accountability for this. Tax Payers' money has been spent on the construction of . . . houses with the full knowledge of the Administrator and Governor, neither of whom challenged this development at any stage and Individuals on Ascension Island have invested money, time and effort in small businesses and now face losing everything.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/24">So, we come to the question, why have the Government done this? Why has there has been such a brutal and abrupt U-turn? If the Government had openly said, &quot;Look, we have a serious problem here. It's all connected with security&mdash;we're sorry,&quot; they would have had some sympathy. Instead, they have hidden behind opaque Foreign Office language, which I am familiar with. As a former member of the foreign service, I used to use and manufacture such language in my day.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/25">The first argument that is employed is that there are so-called contingent liabilities to British taxpayers. As my party's finance spokesman, I should be aware of contingent liabilities and duly deferential to such arguments, but the Government have never spelt out what those contingent liabilities are. They have been asked, but they have not said. One can guess what the contingent liabilities are. I think the Government are worried that if islanders are given the right of abode, some may stay and become old and sick, and somebody may have to pay for that. The Government consider five or 10 people becoming destitute on the island a rather horrific prospect for the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/26">Apart from being a little petty, that position is economically wrong, because if the island were to be run down, the contract workers would return to St. Helena. St. Helena would lose its remittances and the destitution would appear there instead, so we are not talking about additional cost to the Government. It would be interesting to know what the Government believe the contingent liabilities to be and to have them properly examined by the Public Accounts Committee, which is where I believe the issue will end up.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/27">On the other hand, there are some contingent assets. As I said, the Government have spent more than &pound;500,000 on environmental improvements such as a nature reserve. What will happen to that now? Will the money be written off because there will not now be a tourism industry?</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/28">More seriously, there is a direct link with the controversial development of the full-scale airport on St. Helena, which I understand will cost the taxpayer between &pound;150 million and &pound;350 million. The link is that Ascension Island could provide many activities that the St. Helena airport is due to provide. There is complementarity between the islands. None the less, the Government have decided, through DFID, to spend large amounts of money on the St. Helena airport. It is difficult to find out what the options were or whether they have ever been examined, because the Freedom of Information Act 2000 has been repealed on the island of St. Helena to disguise such information, so we cannot have a proper analysis.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.1/29">The situation is worrying, not least because if the full-scale airport on St. Helena goes ahead, there will be no cross flights to Ascension and the Ascension islanders who are left will have to get back to St. Helena via London. There are some strange arguments being used. I do not know what the underlying facts are, because they are not being revealed and the Government will not reveal them. However, when we talk about contingent liabilities, we need to know the interaction between the cost to the island of maintaining its current path and the cost of terminating it. Many of those costs are involved in the St. Helena parallel development.</p>

	<p pid="b.444.0/1">During the hon. Gentleman's extensive researching of the island, has he managed to ascertain what the Government's investment in the island has been for the past few years&mdash;how much money have we given to it? Also, has he managed to find out what contribution has come from the United States of America, which has 150 citizens on the island?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.444.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="444"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h01.htm#60215h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.444.1/1">That is a good and appropriate question. The further the controversy develops, the more exactly that question will need to be answered. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the global figure. I know how much DFID has spent, and that the Foreign Office has spent a substantial amount on legal advice, but we should also consider the administration of the island.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/2">Britain committed itself both politically and financially to the course of action that it now proposes to abandon, and the Americans have, in their own way, contributed to its development. One of the oddities of Ascension is that, despite its small population, it has two sets of roads. On one, people drive on the right, while on the other they drive on the left, because America has a big presence and nobody has thought to integrate the two sets of roads. That is one of the lasting legacies of American involvement there.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/3">One set of the British authorities' arguments involves contingent liability, which has never been properly explained, while the other involves security, which has not been explained either. Indeed, it is a rather odd argument. When the development of the island was first raised, the British military authorities and GCHQ apparently saw no problem and raised no objection. Ascension is a very secure island&mdash;one has to get security clearance to go there, and then to go to Brize Norton to get on an aeroplane&mdash;and it is not as though people just wander in and out.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/4">The British authorities saw no problem, nor did the Americans&mdash;indeed, they agreed that civilian flights should go there&mdash;but something suddenly changed in the middle of last year. I can only speculate, as I have no proof whatever, that the United States undertook a major security review of its strategic objectives. At some point, somebody in the Pentagon must have raised objections to having a permanent population and an increased number of tourists on Ascension. It would appear that the British Government simply rolled over and accepted that, regardless of the commitments they had made to the islanders.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/5">That is a hypothesis; one can only assume that it is what happened. The comments made at a public meeting by the major responsible for the base on the island rather confirmed that that was what occurred, but I have no proof. Whatever the case, it appears that the British Government have been rather spineless in their dealings with the Americans over the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/6">My final point is that spinelessness might have been excusable if major strategic interests were involved. What is inexcusable is how the British Government have acted over the past two months. Instead of being honest in saying that we have a problem and that we will have to do a U-turn, they have reverted to the most extraordinary deviousness in their attempts to deal with information, and to denying the facts.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/7">Let me give just two examples. I am not criticising the Minister personally, because he has put his signature to parliamentary questions on an issue that is not his direct responsibility. I asked him a fairly innocuous parliamentary question about whether the Government had ever set a timetable for legislation on property rights. He replied:</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The Government have provided no such timetable to the Ascension Island Council&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/9">Actually, I have here&mdash;month by month, date by date&mdash;a timetable that was agreed with the British authorities. It was drawn up by the Attorney-General for the islands, who covers St. Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, and who came out from London, briefed by the Foreign Office, and prepared the work on the timetable with the full knowledge and support of the British authorities, yet the Government are now claiming that there is no such thing.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/10">The Government have also supported and subscribed to a series of programmes and timetables, such as the Ascension Island strategic plan for 2003&ndash;08 and the land management plan. They even submitted a report to the European Commission on the plan for the island, so it is completely wrong to say that the Government have no responsibility for planning the transition to legal rights. I hope that the Minister will have a chance to talk to his officials about the things they have asked him to sign.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/11">To take another example, I asked a parliamentary question about the basis of employment. The Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/12" class="indent">&quot;There has been no change to the basis on which people work and live on Ascension Island&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-02-06.763"><i>Official Report</i>, 6 February 2006; Vol. 442, c. 763&ndash;64W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/13">That repeats the Foreign Office line that everybody there is a contract worker, which is simply not true. Substantial numbers of people, in Ascension Island terms, have been admitted on a flexible basis&mdash;not necessarily linked to contracts&mdash;such as business people and members of families who have been reunited. The expectation of normalisation was explicit.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/14">The deviousness that I mentioned extends to foreign investors. In entirely good faith, British companies&mdash;Obsidion Group, for example&mdash;bought property under the privatisation programme. I have the contract for the privatisation here. It makes it clear that the document was approved by the British authorities, who said that the company would be issued with a long-term lease. It bid, it paid and it acquired its asset, but when it asked where its long-term lease was, it was told, &quot;Sorry, we don't have one.&quot; When it asked for meetings at the Foreign Office, it was refused. So, the acts of bad faith do not relate just to the islanders, but affect other people who have brought their resources and given their commitment to the island. There is something very unsatisfactory about the whole episode.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.1/15">I apologise, Mr. Bercow, for having spoken for rather longer than I should have, but I thought it necessary to spell out the facts. I think that this is a story that will run and run. We are probably just at the first stages of exposing a very seedy and disreputable episode in recent British colonial history, and I hope that colleagues from all parts of the House will join me in trying to take the matter forward.

	<p pid="b.446.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. It seems that property rights are the key. Presumably, the Government have given the Americans a lease over Wideawake airfield, so a legal mechanism for granting property rights must exist somewhere. Has he investigated that?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.446.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="446"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h01.htm#60215h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.446.1/1">Clearly, in respect of property, the relationships between states are somewhat different from those between individuals and the state. However, the relationship with the United States is governed by the 1956 Bahamas agreement, which governs British military co-operation in the Atlantic area. There is no doubt that the arrangement that the Government proposed and agreed for the island, and supported, could have been accommodated in the treaty arrangements with the United States. The Americans had never previously suggested that there was a contractual problem. For the second time, I shall draw my remarks to a close.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.446.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" speakername="Daniel Kawczynski" colnum="446"  time="009:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h01.htm#60215h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.446.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on having secured the debate. When I first knew that we were going to have a one-and-a-half-hour debate about such a small island with so few people, I was rather puzzled as to how we could justify it. However, some of the points made by the hon. Gentleman have made it very clear indeed why this is such an important issue and why it needs an airing in our Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.2/2">The hon. Gentleman gave a good account of the situation in the island, but I want to mention one historical aspect that he omitted. The island was discovered by the Portuguese seafarer Joao da Nova Castelia in 1501, although the visit apparently went unrecorded, and was rediscovered on Ascension day two years later by Alphonse d'Albuquerque, who gave the island its name. That is why it is called Ascension Island.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.2/3">Ascension is an island of great strategic importance to our country. In effect, it is a permanent aircraft carrier in the mid-Atlantic. It must save this country a great deal of money because of where it is and how it is used. Therefore, as a tremendous asset, it needs to be discussed and we need to find out about the problems there.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.2/4">I very much hope that the Minister will take on board the views that have been expressed. The hon. Member for Twickenham asked some important questions, particularly those involving the distortions between the answers he received from the Foreign Office on costs and what he was told by experts.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.2/5">Today, I should be on Ascension Island en route to the Falkland Islands. Unfortunately, the trip had to be cancelled because of this evening's votes, but that gives me a good opportunity to talk about the island. Obviously, as I was going to go there, I have done some research on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.2/6">I am extremely concerned about the lack of Government accountability&mdash;not just for Ascension, but for all our overseas territories. That is why I shall introduce, in March, a ten-minute Bill on our 14 overseas dependencies. It will refer to the administration of those dependencies and how they participate in terms of voting and accountability with us and the European Union, which also, ultimately, makes decisions on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.2/7">Although Ascension is owned by the UK, it does not have the same status as French overseas territories&mdash;the d&eacute;partements d'outre-mer, which are an intrinsic part of France. The French have realised the importance of bringing those overseas territories into the 21st century and giving them proper status. The people there have the same rights as the people of France and can send representatives to the French Parliament. Such accountability and democracy, which are so important in this modern age, are granted to French overseas territories but not to ours, it would appear.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.2/8">I am extremely concerned by the first part of the briefing that I received from my researcher, which tells me that Ascension Island is a dependency in the overseas territory of St. Helena. There is an overall governor of the territory who is based on St. Helena&mdash;he is not even on the island&mdash;and represented on Ascension by an administrator. It seems that the island is run by an administrator about whom we in this building know little, and who has little accountability to us. I would like the Minister to consider us having a similar option to the French d&eacute;partements d'outre-mer.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.2/9">As I said, Ascension is governed not only by the UK, but by the EU. We have seen that the EU plays a major part in people's lives in overseas territories. It interfered on a massive scale in how the 40 people on Pitcairn Island live. Although the EU can issue diktats to such places, the inhabitants have no representation in the EU. That is totally unacceptable in the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.2/10">We should be proud of those islands. I am always talking to children in my schools in Shrewsbury about the Great British empire and our imperial past. I am not ashamed of the history of our country&mdash;we should be proud of it, rather than try to cover it up&mdash;yet when I talk to children in Shrewsbury about the history of our country and about the empire and its legacy, and when I talk to adults, I find that they know little about overseas territories such as Ascension Island, or any of the other 14 islands.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.2/11">I believe those territories to be an integral part of our country, but it seems as though Governments of all colours in recent times have somehow tried to airbrush them out of existence and not talked about their importance. We have to hold on to those territories for future generations. That can be done partly by sharing information about them with future generations and discussing them in the House of Commons. We must increase knowledge of and interest in them, and increase tourism, because only by going to see them will we be able to grasp how we have to work with them in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.448.0/1">Order. The hon. Gentleman's disquisition on imperial affairs is of considerable interest I am sure, but I know that he will want fairly narrowly to focus his remarks on the administration of Ascension Island.</p>

	<p pid="b.448.1/1">Yes, certainly. I was about to conclude.</p>
	<p pid="b.448.1/2">As the hon. Member for Twickenham said, when administering an island such as Ascension&mdash;as is the case with Diego Garcia&mdash;it is important that Parliament knows how much money is being spent on it and what is going on with the Americans. I ask the Minister, what are the 150 US citizens on the island doing? How much is the United States paying us for them being there? How do we benefit from their position on that island?</p>
	<p pid="b.448.1/3">I conclude by again thanking the hon. Member for Twickenham for securing the debate. I hope that he continues to scrutinise the Government in relation to the administration of the island.</p>

	<p pid="b.448.2/1">I was an expert on Ascension Island last autumn: I was in Ascension on a Monday and, later on, on a Sunday.</p>
	<p pid="b.448.2/2">I think that the answer to the question posed by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> is that the Americans find it useful to have a spare runway or landing strip for the shuttle in case it comes down in the wrong place. Ascension has a long runway.</p>
	<p pid="b.448.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> has done Ascension Island, the Government and the House a service by raising this topic. This is one occasion on which I would have preferred the Minister to speak second in the debate, so that the rest of us could contribute having heard what the Government have to say. A number of issues have come forward. The Minister has had some good material, and obviously has some more now. However, the rest of us would have been able to speak with greater advantage had we heard what he has to say.</p>
	<p pid="b.448.2/4">I should declare an interest of sorts, as my grandfather was in the Colonial Office and my father was in the Commonwealth relations office of the Foreign Office, so, on the whole, I take the view that what the Department behind the Minister says and does are normally wise and often well considered. If that has changed, it is for Ministers to explain why, because it is they who take the decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.448.2/5">I went to Ascension on the way to the Falklands, which are one of the real reasons for the investment in Ascension, rather than, in particular, those who are resident there, whether temporary or more than temporary. The investment is made because Ascension Island fulfils a function. When I went there, I got the impression that the question of islanders' rights is a live issue. If the Government feel the need to adapt their policy, to make it clearer or to reverse it, that ought to be done in the open. Decisions are normally better if they are announced in the open and discussed retrospectively, but not prospectively. It will be interesting to hear whether the hon. Member for Twickenham is right that an American security assessment is leading to difficulty. I am not sure that that is necessarily the explanation, but when we hear from the Minister we will know better.</p>
	<p pid="b.448.2/6">For those who have not yet been to Ascension Island, the greatest interest, besides the runway and the turtles, is the mountain, which is the wrong way up, so to speak. The tropics are at the top, eucalyptus trees are in the middle and there is nothing but volcanic rock at the bottom. It is an intriguing part of nature.</p>
	<p pid="b.448.2/7">Having said that it would be better if we could have listened to the Minister first, I shall let him explain what the policy is and whether it has changed.</p>

	<p pid="b.449.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing the debate. When I saw that there would be a debate on this issue, I could not help but come and say a few words, although I shall be brief. I shall concentrate on two areas: the environment of the island and the military impact on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/2">I am fortunate to have been to the island many times. When I first went there, I was due to stop for just one day on the way to the Falklands, but in true style the Royal Air Force broke down and I spent a week there. I have been back on several occasions to do engineering work, not least with the Army, and to do environmental work, also with the Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/3">Before I get on to my two main points, I shall try to add a bit of colour to this rather barren rock, because I think it the most remarkable place in the world. It is, of course, the second most remote island in the world, but other hon. Members have touched on how unique it is. It is an island full of surprises.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/4">Green mountain, to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" name="Peter Bottomley">the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley)</phrase> referred, is remarkable. Reaching the Dew point on the way to the top, one enters a marvellous microclimate with a mini rain forest on top. One of my worst memories of Ascension is having to do the Dew point run, which involves running from the shore to the top of the mountain. It covers about 7 miles and the runners are absolutely exhausted by the time they get there. The island is probably the only place that I have ever played half a round of golf&mdash;there is only half a golf course&mdash;entirely on flint and rock with not a blade of grass to be found.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/5">The community is unique because it has so many different elements. GCHQ is there, as is the BBC. There is an American community and there used to be a Royal Air Force community. All four parts of the community, as well as the St. Helenians, manage to work together well. The island is one of the few places in the world where I have spent any time where people did not have to lock their doors, and I would hate for that to be spoiled.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/6">As one travels up the island through Donkey plain to Cricket valley around the back, one can see that it is the most remarkable environment. Although it is essential that tourism on the island is developed, I am concerned about how we will ensure that such a unique place is not destroyed by too much tourism. I would like to hear the Minister's view on that. We have already done our bit by introducing the rat to the island, which has caused some problems, although we have also done some quite remarkable things. As one goes up to the now defunct National Aeronautics and Space Administration centre&mdash;I know that it is defunct because I kicked the front door in during a military exercise once, and there is definitely no one there any more&mdash;one passes a remarkable plantation with incredibly tall, thin trees. I asked what it was, and was told that they are trees planted by the Royal Navy in the 19th century to provide spare masts. They are still there. That is the sort of place Ascension Island is&mdash;an island full of secrets.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/7">I am concerned about the environmental impact of an increase in tourism. I was fortunate when I went in that the green turtle, which lays its eggs on the shores, was laying its eggs when I arrived. When I went back in the summer, they were hatching. I can see the appeal and that tourists would want to see such things, but that must be handled sensitively so that we do not impact on the island or on that population.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/8">I also want to touch on the military aspect. I am concerned that the state of the island is deteriorating. I saw the range on the far side of the island only recently. It is kept in mothballs, but it is an essential facility. I am sure that during the Falklands war no one expected that Ascension Island would be as prominent as it was. It is essential that we keep it in top condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/9">As the Royal Air Force squadron was withdrawn several years ago, I am concerned that the island is being overlooked to a degree. We rely entirely on the Americans to look after the runway. I realise that it is leased to them, but it is vital that as a country we maintain some form of military community there to ensure that it is there when we need it.</p>

	<p pid="b.450.0/1">I apologise for my late arrival, Mr. Bercow. I was involved with the launch organised by the all-party group on small shops.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/2">In my role as chair of the all-party group on St. Helena&mdash;Ascension Island, of course, comes within the orbit of St. Helena&mdash;I congratulate the Government on all they did to restore full British citizenship to the citizens of the overseas territories, which include St. Helena and Ascension Island. I also congratulate them on the progress that they have made towards the establishment of an airstrip on the island of St. Helena. Of course, Wideawake airport on Ascension Island can take jumbo jets as well as TriStars when it is working, but like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase>, I have been marooned on Ascension Island because of the inability of the RAF to provide flights from the Falklands through to Brize Norton.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/3">The island is indeed remarkable and the American presence is the dominant feature, but it is strategically important for this country as well. We know that because of what happened in the Falklands war and in the years that followed. The community on Ascension is predominantly made up of people from the island of St. Helena. I asked many of them whether they regard themselves as Ascension islanders or Saints from the island of St. Helena, and they still regard themselves as Saints.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/4">The rights of abode of the people who live on Ascension Island are the important aspect of the debate, and the Government were going down the road to achieving them. Serious questions have to be asked. When the island is so obviously British and its citizens have had their full British citizenship restored by the Government, why do those people find themselves once again relegated and, in effect, second-class citizens? Although they retain the full British citizenship that has been granted them, they have been told that they cannot have rights of abode on the island.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/5">Those of us who have visited the only real village on the island, Two Boats&mdash;I am not sure what happened to &quot;One Boat&quot;&mdash;know that that community is home. Many people have lived there for decades. Some youngsters have lived nowhere other than Ascension Island and the village of Two Boats. I think that, per head of population, more young males are members of the scouts than is the case anywhere else in the world. Nothing is more British than the scout movement.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/6">The 1,000 or 2,000 people, or however many there are, on that British island have rightly had full citizenship restored. The Government are doing a good job, although they need to do more, to bring the mother island of St. Helena fully back into the British family. However, the Minister needs to explain why Ascension Island is being treated differently from everywhere else. In simple terms, will he explain whether that is just an aberration, or will the good moves that were being made up until recently be reinstated?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.451.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" speakername="Jeremy Browne" colnum="451"  time="010:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h01.htm#60215h01_spnew13">
	<p pid="b.451.0/1">I am in an unusual position as I have never been to Ascension Island and I am in a room of people who are all great authorities on that remote part of the world. However, for anybody of my age&mdash;I am 35&mdash;Ascension evokes our upbringing, because it was such a dominant feature of the Falklands war and the preparation for that conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.0/2">I want first to pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase>, who is an example to us all. He manages to be an authoritative Treasury spokesman for our party, as well as a diligent and conscientious MP for his constituents, yet he still manages to have a global scope to his activities and to promote causes such as this. He has a versatility that, as an MP who has been here for only nine months, I can only wonder at and learn from.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.0/3">The debate has been effective already: not only has it drawn the Minister to this Chamber and given hon. Members the opportunity to raise their concerns, but it has provoked a large public and media interest. Only yesterday, I turned on the &quot;Today&quot; programme to hear my hon. Friend discussing the subject, and <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>and others have covered it. That shows that one can create interest in a subject and a wider debate by securing Adjournment debates here. That should encourage us all.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.0/4">We in the House should be concerned about individual liberty and the freedom of people to live their lives against a consistent backdrop of rules, without the state moving the goalposts in a way that makes it difficult or impossible for their lives to progress in the way they would like.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.0/5">I have read information about the situation on Ascension Island and I can see that there are cases to be made against opening the island up. I understand that there are serious problems with securing enough water for the inhabitants and generating electricity in sufficient quantities. Furthermore, as my hon. Friend said, there may be issues involving liabilities for the Government. He cited caring and providing for people who are sick or have reached old age, but there are also considerable environmental issues. I am referring not to the issues alluded to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase>, but to the impact on the island of dumping waste and similar practices. I can understand the Government being somewhat concerned about having an open-ended commitment to clean up and preserve the environment of the island.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.0/6">That said, I understand that there are no substantial infrastructure-related reasons why the island should not be inhabited and function effectively with a modest population. Ultimately, the point is that the Government have shown a serious disregard for those based on Ascension Island, who were led to believe that it would be opened up for residency and who, in many cases, invested a large amount of money&mdash;perhaps their life savings&mdash;as well as time and emotional energy in trying to make a new future. The Foreign Office has shown&mdash;this is a modest way of putting it&mdash;poor judgment in not being as straight and consistent with the island's inhabitants as they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.0/7">To resolve the situation, the Government have an opportunity either to try to push ahead with opening up the island and devote adequate resources to that task or, at the very least, to be straight with the islanders and offer them compensation and clarity on the way forward. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to those challenges.</p>

	<p pid="b.452.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing the debate. I think that it was my first day in the House when I went into the Tea Room and someone said to me, &quot;You know, whatever topic is discussed in the House, there will always be someone who is an expert on it.&quot; When I saw the title of this debate on the Order Paper, I obviously knew that the hon. Gentleman was an expert on the subject, but I did not know that my hon. Friends the Members for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster), for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) and for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley), as well as the hon. Members for Colchester (Bob Russell) and for Taunton (Mr. Browne), were also experts. I congratulate them all on their speeches.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/2">I also congratulate you, Mr. Bercow, as I think this is the first time that you have found yourself in the Chair for these proceedings. We are delighted to see you in that exalted position and hope that you will have many happy years sitting in the Chair, doing exactly what you are doing today.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/3">I tend to the theory that there has not been a conspiracy over what is happening on Ascension Island and that the Government have found themselves in a bit of a muddle. As the hon. Member for Taunton said, they did not want to be totally open about their thinking on what the future of the island ought to be.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/4">I declare an interest: like a number of my hon. Friends, I have been to Ascension Island on the way to the Falklands. I spent a happy lunchtime in the administrator's delightful residence. It had a lawn that many people in this country would be proud to tend, and a great deal of effort must go into tending it considering the problems on the top of the mountain there. We had to spend even more time on the island on the way back from the Falklands because the RAF would not take us out of there until the fog had cleared at RAF Brize Norton. The RAF did not want to land at Heathrow or Prestwick because of the cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/5">Like my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes, therefore, I have spent several hours on Ascension Island. There is not much there, but it is no exaggeration to say that the Falkland Islands invasion could not have been repelled without the use of the island. It is strategically very important to the Government and to the Americans, as one can see by the size of the airport there and the facilities that GCHQ, Cable &amp; Wireless and the RAF have there. It is a vital strategic base for us, as well as an important test base for the Americans, with their tracking of rockets and so on. The Government therefore need to be totally open about what they want to achieve for the island.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/6">I, too, was struck by the article in <i>The</i> <i>Daily Telegraph </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February</phrase>, just two days ago. I picked out from it the phrase &quot;contingent liabilities&quot;. The Government need to explain carefully to us what gave rise to the complete change of heart. They established an island council and they wanted to establish property rights, alternative American charter flights and a tourism business. Now, all of a sudden, the Government have changed their mind. It would be useful if the Minister explained clearly to us the reasons for that change of mind. As my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West pointed out, it would have been useful had the Minister spoken at the beginning, because we could have questioned him on what he said. In the absence of that, we have to ask a few questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/7">I have given the Minister notice of my questions. If he cannot answer today all the points raised in the debate, I would be grateful if he put a note in the Library, or perhaps provided a written statement to the House on the points that emerge. Perhaps we could have a position paper on the Government's intentions for the future of the island. It might be helpful to have that on the record.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/8">I shall ask the Minister a few of the questions of which I gave him notice. Do the Government regret their recommendation that there should be a review in relation to the constitutional rights of residence for people living on Ascension Island? Do the Government now believe that the residents of Ascension Island should have any influence on local decision making or not? What will be the future of the island council? If the people are to have some form of representation, the Government need to know how they are to be represented, both on the island council and directly to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/9">What did the Government have in mind when they decided in April 2001 that fundamental changes were necessary in how Ascension Island was run? Do the Government regret their decision to introduce the idea of an island council in the 2001 concept paper, and their introduction of a new fiscal regime in April 2002, which brought in local income, property and customs taxes without the award of local democratic representation to the residents of Ascension Island? Those are critical questions, as are those on property rights, to which the hon. Member for Twickenham alluded.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/10">Ascension Island's revenue budget for 2003&ndash;04 amounted to &pound;4.3 million. Fiscal expenditure amounted to &pound;3.3 million for recurrent expenditure and &pound;0.7 million for capital expenses, leaving transfer reserves of &pound;0.3 million&mdash;7 per cent. of revenue. Government expenditure funds one school, one hospital offering limited services but including basic operations, and police and judicial services, all of which are provided free to local taxpayers. Given that the economy is so fragile, surely the Government should reassure the residents of Ascension Island by employing a consistent and fair policy towards the island.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/11">Following the completion of negotiations with the US authorities in October 2003 to allow air-charter access to Wideawake airfield, what approaches have been made by private transport groups to operate a link with Ascension Island? Have the Government considered promoting such links? Incidentally, Wideawake airfield is a misnomer if ever I heard one, because one nearly always arrives there in the middle of the night after a long flight from RAF Brize Norton anything but wide-awake. I think that the name refers to the birds, rather than the human condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/12">What assessments have been made of the effect on the Ascension Island economy and on the local economy of a link with airports such as Brize Norton? It seems to me that that would be a possibility. Having visited Brize Norton, which is contiguous to my constituency, and knowing that the RAF is thinking about introducing a more commercial element to Brize Norton, there is an ideal opportunity to establish some form of tourism and more commercial activity with the island if the Government want to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/13">The hon. Member for Twickenham asked how many people were born on the island. It seems to me that if people, and perhaps their parents and grandparents, were born there, they have gone a long way down the road of citizenship. If they have citizenship of the island, will the Government recognise it?</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/14">What discussions have taken place in the past 12 months with the US Administration on changes in the administration of Ascension Island? Have those discussions impeded the agreed powers of the Ascension Island Administration? That is a key matter. I suspect that some discussions have taken place with the Americans and that some security implication has caused the Government's change of mind. It would be helpful&mdash;within, obviously, the bounds of open government&mdash;if the Minister gave us an idea of that today.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/15">What are the contingent liabilities? The hon. Member for Twickenham, with his financial background, concentrated on the financial possibilities of contingent liabilities, but they could cover a multitude of possibilities&mdash;including even contamination and things of that kind. Alternatively, are we just thinking about the human condition and the problems of providing health, pensions and social security? Are they what is meant by contingent liabilities? We need to know. This is one of the crucial questions that we need to have answered in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/16">According to Government figures, the cost of internal security and policing on Ascension has not been borne by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Who has shouldered that cost and what influence do they now have over the running of the island? Is it true that Ascension Island's local government paid for its own policing and internal security in 2004&ndash;05 and does the Minister believe that the Ascension Island Administration are now capable of running their own affairs? If there is to be a council, we need to know what revenue-raising powers, and thus the likely powers over administration of the island, it will have with regard to those essential public services.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/17">What measures are the Minister's Department and the Ministry of Defence taking to ensure that the residents of Ascension Island who are entitled to a state pension receive a fair deal? If the Government will not award them quarterly uprating, does the Minister intend to give the Ascension Island Administration the powers necessary to provide for those residents? We need to know that with regard to not only pensions, but the entire range of public services.</p>

	<p pid="b.455.0/1">My hon. Friend and the Minister will be aware of the anomaly whereby many people with British state retirement pensions who go abroad to an old dominion do not receive inflation upratings, whereas those who go to some other countries do. Perhaps the Minister will write to hon. Members about whether someone from this country who retired to Ascension Island would be caught in that way and not get the inflation uprating.</p>

	<p pid="b.455.1/1">My hon. Friend takes me down another route that I did not intend to travel, although I had it in mind when I raised the question. Many other countries, not least Zimbabwe, suffer from exactly the same problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/2">Finally, we need to know what the islanders' future is to be. Will they be granted citizenship? If so, will they be granted property rights? What representation will they have to their own island council, if that is allowed to continue? What rights of representation will the island council have to the Government, and what rights will the islanders, whatever their status, have to lobby the Government?</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/3">Will the islanders have voting rights in the future, as voting rights are a vital part of citizenship? Will they have voting rights in the EU? My hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham said that the EU likes to interfere in the running of such islands. If it is to do that, it should certainly follow the precedent set in the case of Gibraltar and give the islanders voting rights in European elections.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/4">I am afraid that I have asked the Minister a host of questions, but the debate has been very interesting. Ascension Island is a hidden corner of the world and a spotlight has been shone on it this morning. We owe the hon. Member for Twickenham a debt for that. Let us hope that the Minister will shine not only a spotlight but a searchlight on the problem, so that we all emerge fully informed about what is going to happen.</p>

	<p pid="b.456.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Bercow, for chairing this important debate this morning. It would be remiss of me to begin other than by paying tribute to your chairmanship on your first outing in this new role. Having crossed swords with you in this room and in the Chamber, I feel some relief that you are the referee in today's debate, not a player. This has none the less been an important debate in which several hon. Gentlemen have raised points. I would like to deal with one or two of those before moving on to my main remarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.0/2">First, I shall of course endeavour to respond to the specific points raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> about parliamentary questions, legal advice, the timetable and terms of employment. He may rest assured that I shall discuss what he raised today with my ministerial colleague Lord Triesman and my officials.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.0/3">Secondly, as to the point about the European Union raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase>, I was, I must say, intrigued to hear from a member of the Conservative party such a suggestion about the EU's reach and the proposal that Ascension should reach directly to Brussels. That is a novel line of inquiry, but it perhaps speaks to the new diversity abroad among those on the Conservative Benches. Certainly, notwithstanding your remarks about a broader disposition on imperial affairs, Mr. Bercow, clear distinctions can be drawn between the external d&eacute;partements of France and the traditional position of the overseas territory.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.0/4">As to the question about United States citizens, they are working at the United States base. Ascension Island provides an important strategic base for, among other things, evacuation or humanitarian aid, which might be needed to enable the United States to undertake activities in west Africa. The 1956 Bahamas agreement, which was referred to by the hon. Member for Twickenham, allows the use of Ascension Island without charge. Those people are, however, liable for taxes for any goods and services purchased off their base and their main contractor pays income tax. I hope that that deals with the point that was raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.0/5">I am humbled by the knowledge and experience of Ascension Island that Opposition Members offer. I am not sure that it has been the greatest advertisement for the reliability of RAF flights, but the experience of hon. Gentlemen has clearly illuminated aspects of the debate. I was asked about the environment by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase>, and about the concerns that understandably have been raised about the ecostructure. The Government are strongly committed to protecting the environment on the island and the rich biodiversity of Ascension.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.0/6">I understand that, under the joint FCO-DFID overseas territories environment programme, &pound;169,310 has been committed for projects relating to environmental issues specifically on Ascension Island. Ascension has been involved in a further three cross-territory projects. The FCO has also funded &pound;500,000 towards the seabird restoration project, in conjunction with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. I hope that that is evidence of the enduring commitment to the environment, which the hon. Gentleman raised as a specific issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.0/7">Several other points were raised. I reiterate that, although I am Minister for Europe, I am answering the debate on behalf of my noble Friend Lord Triesman, the FCO Minister directly responsible for the overseas territory, and I shall ensure that he is fully aware of the points and comments made by hon. Gentlemen this morning. I am aware that the debate takes place in the wake of several stories&mdash;some of which have been referred to by Opposition Members&mdash;that appeared in the papers at the weekend in anticipation of our discussions.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.0/8">The debate offers the opportunity to set out the Government's position with regard to Ascension and to refer to the issues raised by the hon. Member for Twickenham. I am also aware that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> has raised some specific questions. I am grateful to him for giving us notice of those, and I will endeavour to deal with them in my speech. If they are not covered by what I say, I shall ensure that Lord Triesman is aware of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.0/9">Perhaps it would be most useful if I were first to set out the context of the situation on Ascension Island. Ascension has no indigenous population, no exploitable natural resources and a very limited water supply. All that is needed to meet the needs of those who work on the island&mdash;everything from food to pharmaceuticals&mdash;is therefore imported. Today, the major employers, or &quot;users&quot; as they are known on the island, are the UK and US military bases, the BBC, Cable &amp; Wireless and the Ascension Administration.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.0/10">According to the most recent statistics available to me, there are just over 900 people living on Ascension Island, including those on short-term visits. Ascension Island is unique in that all those working and living there are on the island only because they or their families are employed by one of the users.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.0/11">The administrator of Ascension has authority to grant permission to enter and remain on island. I was asked about the administrator. The administrator is the responsibility of the governor, who operates from St. Helena, as was recognised. In turn, the governor is accountable to the FCO, whose Ministers, as hon. Members can see this morning, are accountable to the House of Commons. There is no distinctive feature here. There is a chain of accountability leading through the governorship on St. Helena to the Foreign Office and on to Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.457.0/1">Does the Minister accept that once upon a time St. Helena did not have an indigenous population? Does he agree that many of those who live on Ascension Island have lived there for decades? Can he cite any other dependent territory where residents do not have the right of abode?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.457.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="457"  time="010:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h01.htm#60215h01_spnew18">
	<p pid="b.457.1/1">Let me deal with the specific issue of the right of abode. Where Ascension Island is unique and can be distinguished from St. Helena is that all those working and living on the island are there only because they or their families are employed by one of the users. The administrator of Ascension has authority to grant permission to enter and remain on the island, and employees of the users and their families are entitled to enter and remain on Ascension for the duration of their employment contract. On the termination of their contract with a user, they are required by Ascension Island law to leave. There is, therefore, no general entitlement to enter or remain on Ascension Island, nor has there ever been under British rule.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.1/2">The hon. Member for Twickenham argued that the Government raised false hope for the people living and working on Ascension&mdash;a point also raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase>&mdash;by giving them the impression over the last six years that they would be granted a general right to remain and own property on the island, separate from employment with a user. I shall set out the chronology surrounding consultations on this issue to explain how the Government reached their decision, as set out by Lord Triesman in his letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January</phrase>, not to allow the development of these rights.</p>

	<p pid="b.458.0/1">Will the Minister give way?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.458.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="458"  time="010:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h01.htm#60215h01_spnew20">
	<p pid="b.458.1/1">I am quite keen, not least given the specific questions that have been put to me, to set out my response comprehensively. With the forbearance of the hon. Gentleman, I shall make further progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/2">First, I shall explain what the decision entails. Allowing the development of a settled population by granting a general right to remain would make the UK ultimately responsible for ensuring a viable future for those individuals who chose to settle on the island. That means that the UK would be taking on contingent liabilities, and possible&mdash;indeed, it is judged, probable&mdash;extra financial commitments in relation to the future provision of infrastructure and services. Before taking such a decision, it was imperative to explore where this funding could be found, now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/3">In March 1999, the Government published a White Paper that set out the results of a review of the UK's relationship with the overseas territories. The White Paper used the words</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/4" class="indent">&quot;consult the people of St Helena and Dependencies about how to develop the democratic and civil rights . . . on Ascension&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/5">Indeed, that quote was used by the hon. Member for Twickenham. But that White Paper also noted that every territory was unique and needed a constitutional framework to suit its own circumstances. There must be a balance of obligations and expectations. The White Paper also set it out that each territory had to be considered on its own terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/6">In the late 1990s, the users on Ascension informed the Government that they no longer wanted to finance directly the majority of the services on the island, as they had been doing for many years. In the light of that, the UK therefore needed to address the future administration of the island. A consultation paper setting out options on how Ascension could be run was produced in April 1999, and a follow up fiscal and economic study by Portsmouth university, again referred to during the debate, was commissioned. In line with the consultation document, it recommended the establishment of a publicly funded system.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/7">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office agreed with the Ascension Island Administration that they should take over responsibility for core services from the users. A new fiscal regime was put in place in 2002. Revenue is now derived primarily from personal income tax and property tax, both borne primarily by the users on their employees' behalf, and customs duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/8">Following that, those living and working on the island were consulted on the form of democratic representation for the island, which was only appropriate given they were contributing to the running of the island through taxation. A 10-strong Ascension Island council with seven elected members was set up in the same year. The council's establishment, therefore, resulted from the UK's intervention to ensure that Ascension remained economically viable for the users. As a result, there were continued employment opportunities. This was not taken forward as part of a staged process that was intended to result in those living and working on Ascension being given the right of abode.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/9">The 1999 consultation paper, as the hon. Member for Twickenham pointed out, raised the issue of the development of a general right of abode and property rights, in addition to other issues including services and democracy, but it stressed that those were options only and stated specifically that the UK had not yet made up its mind on what those changes should be. Up until 2002, the possibility of developing the general right of abode and property rights on Ascension had not been developed. The island council engaged a legal draftsperson to draft proposed legislation. This process, which started in 2003, remains incomplete.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/10">In 2003, the UK Government also concluded the Wideawake agreement, referred to by the hon. Member for Cotswold, to open up the possibility of commercial charter flights to Ascension, if viable. Partly as a result of these consultations, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office looked again in 2005 at whether the island would be economically viable to support a settled population, with regard to fishing and tourism in particular.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/11">The Government commissioned an economic study by Oxford Policy Management Ltd. in August 2005. The report highlighted the limited scope for development without significant external investment. It concluded that the prospects for buoyant growth driven by significant inward investment seemed slender in the near-to-medium future, and that the costs entailed by the local and physical characteristics of Ascension made the development of tourism unlikely to succeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/12">During 2005, the FCO continued to consult, but in the light of the Oxford Policy Management report published in October, it became increasingly apparent that the economic argument was outweighing the views of the minority of those working and living on Ascension Island who wanted a general right to remain and reside there and to buy property. FCO officials and Ministers were in contact with the island council during the year, including through two visits in May and November. Lord Triesman also talked to Councillor Lawson Henry in London in October.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/13">The Government accept that the continuation of the process to assess whether this was politically and economically viable might have led to confusion on the part of some of those living in Ascension. That, of course, is to be regretted. However, it would have been wrong to prejudge the decision that my colleague Lord Triesman took last month without examining all sides of the issue, including the steps I have just outlined.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/14">In exploring all the options, the Government consulted widely, with Ascension and across Whitehall. The FCO took into account representations made by those on the island to the governor, administrators and groups of visiting officials. Before the decision was made, the FCO considered fully the representations to the team that went to the island in late November 2005 and the letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-07">7 December 2005</phrase> to Lord Triesman from the island council.</p>

	<p pid="b.460.0/1">I do not wish to stop the Minister's flow and I know that he is pressed for time. He has acknowledged that confusion was created among the islanders. Does he not agree that that confusion was systematic? Why did the British authorities encourage the islanders by establishing a land registry, the only purpose of which was to entrench property rights? Why did they endorse the council's campaign to regard Ascension as a &quot;family island&quot;? That was its slogan, which, by implication, involves settlement and long residence. Surely the Government were not assessing the options, but were very actively involved in creating the framework they now wish to repudiate.</p>

	<p pid="b.460.1/1">As a Scottish lawyer, I was intrigued by the establishment of a land registry, given that Scottish jurisdiction has the distinction of having the last system of feudal land ownership in Europe, so I raised exactly that question when I spoke to officials yesterday. They informed me that it was important to have a public record of property on Ascension and who currently occupies it.</p>
	<p pid="b.460.1/2">The question of individual leases, which have already been issued, is being examined by the Attorney-General, but the almost mechanistic view that the establishment of the land registry would, in and of itself, prejudge the decision that would ultimately be taken by Ministers&mdash;in this case, by Lord Triesman&mdash;is wrong. It is wrong in the sense that there was, I understand, a clear articulation at the outset of the process that options were being considered. I have acknowledged candidly that there appears to have been some confusion among the limited number of those who reside and work on the island&mdash;a number of whom were represented on the island council&mdash;who have come to hope for and aspire to property rights being secured.</p>
	<p pid="b.460.1/3">None the less, from the Foreign Office's point of view, there was a clear view that a decision had yet to be reached and that the consultation that followed&mdash;in terms of the visit of the officials to the island and the further discussions that Lord Triesman had with one of the councillors&mdash;reflected that ongoing process before the decision was reached last month.</p>

	<p pid="b.461.0/1">I shall not intervene again because the Minister needs another 10 minutes to complete his remarks, but can he cite a single case in the past five years in which the Government warned the island council that its expectations were unrealistic?</p>

	<p pid="b.461.1/1">My recollection from my discussions with officials is that when they visited the island in November, it was made clear to them that those with expectations of securing the property rights that we are discussing today were prejudging a decision that was ultimately for the Minister to take. I understand that there was some indication that clear consideration was being given to the outcome that was finally reached in terms of a decision made by my ministerial colleague in January.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.1/2">I shall address a couple of further points that have been raised following those interventions. Up until 2002, the possibility of developing the general right of abode and property rights on Ascension had not been developed. As I have said, the island council engaged a legal draftsman. Those points have already been covered during our debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.461.2/1">A jagged edge has emerged from this debate. It seems that people were given an expectation of property rights, and as a chartered surveyor I know about such matters. If they were given that expectation, and they have invested considerable sums of money in building those four houses and are now to be denied any proper permanent legal rights, will the Government consider paying compensation to them?</p>

	<p pid="b.461.3/1">I am respectful of the past professional experience of a chartered surveyor, but I speak with the past experience of a solicitor, and a very clear distinction can be drawn between confusion and expectation. I have been scrupulous in my language today, making it clear that there may have been confusion. We accept that there may have been confusion, but that is an entirely separate matter. I make that observation not least in terms of the importance in public law of expectation. It is helpful to have clarified that point, but I would draw a clear distinction between expectation and confusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.3/2">Reluctantly, the Government have concluded that granting the general right to remain could cost the UK taxpayer considerably, in the short and long terms. If the users were not on the island to provide a regular income for employees, the cost of meeting Ascension's reasonable ongoing needs&mdash;the provision and maintenance of utilities and infrastructure, and the provision of social and additional education and medical services&mdash;could easily run, on the Government's estimate, to tens of millions of pounds.</p>

	<p pid="b.462.1/1">With the greatest respect, I have been generous with the Chamber in giving way and I am keen to make a little more progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.462.1/2">Granting a general right of abode and property rights could impact adversely on the unique working environment of Ascension Island, rather than improve it. I am sure that all Members of the House recognise that the Government have an obligation to take responsible decisions for the good governance of their overseas territories. That spirit has been very much abroad in the Chamber today. The Government also have a responsibility to minimise the future risk to UK taxpayers by not unnecessarily exposing the UK to an increased likelihood of contingent liabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.462.1/3">At the same time, the Government remain committed to a sustainable quality of life for those whom they hope will continue to work on Ascension in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.463.1/1">It is unusual for me to be on the Front Bench and it is worth having a debate just to be here.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.1/2">The Minister is used to occasions such as this. I think that this is the third time this week that she has been in such a room to discuss Northern Ireland, as she has already spoken about rates and selling the family silver. She is here now to discuss education, and I look forward to hearing her response.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.1/3">Recent Government figures have indicated that more than 100,000 youngsters live in relative poverty in Northern Ireland. Many of them are concentrated in particular areas, some of which are relatively affluent but have estates in the middle with a high concentration of families living in poverty and deprivation. That impacts on educational achievement.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.1/4">The debate on those issues has sometimes been mixed up with other big education controversies in Northern Ireland. For example, there has been an attempt to link educational under-achievement and disadvantage with the selection system, although I want to stay away from that issue this morning, because it is a red herring and it does not answer the problem; I see the Minister smiling, however, because she has sometimes tried to link the two.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.1/5">I do not believe that the solution is simply to throw money at the problem, although resources are required. The important question is how to lift people's aspirations. In many deprived areas education is not seen as it used to be: as a way out of poverty and a way of improving opportunities in life. How do we give people the inspiration and aspiration to look to education as a way out of their current economic situation?</p>

	<p pid="b.463.2/1">I sit on the same Select Committee as my hon. Friend&mdash;the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs&mdash;and I know how passionate he is about this issue and how important it is to him in his constituency. Does he agree that education is the cornerstone of a civilised society and that we must inspire children to take the highest level of academic and vocational qualifications so that they can succeed in this uncertain world? As I have found in my constituency, education must remain the ladder out of deprivation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.463.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="463"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h02.htm#60215h02_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.463.3/1">Absolutely. The problem is not unique to Northern Ireland. Many of the lessons that we have learned in Northern Ireland can be transported to other parts of the United Kingdom. Equally, some best practices need to be transported to Northern Ireland. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.3/2">It is clear that there are problems, because there has been no lack of initiatives in Northern Ireland. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that there are currently 58 or 59 initiatives to deal with failing schools, raise standards, improve attendance and so on. Sometimes, all that happens is that jobs are created for those who administer the initiatives and a paper nightmare is created for principals who must find out about initiatives and how to apply for them, and then fill in the forms. Education and library boards provide some help, but resources are dispersed. The resources themselves are often time-limited and are stopped just when they begin to bite. Even worse, sometimes when the results begin to come through the schools no longer qualify. They may benefit from an innovative scheme, but the money may then dry up.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.3/3">I want to look at two initiatives that illustrate some of the best practices and some of the problems. First, the school support programme amounted to &pound;50,000 a school. Clear targets were set and one school decided that it wanted to spend the money on tackling the problem of school attendance. The money provided a home-school liaison officer who targeted families whose children had a poor attendance record. The liaison officer obtained parental involvement, which was important&mdash;sometimes, that meant putting parents on accredited courses to learn how to help youngsters with reading, homework, counting and so on&mdash;and brought in other statutory agencies. Sometimes it was a case of ensuring that youngsters came to school having had breakfast, and also came there clean. Money can be poured into breakfast clubs in schools so that youngsters at least start the day with some food in their stomachs, so that they can concentrate for the rest of the day.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.3/4">The effect of that initiative was that the school moved from the bottom 5 per cent. at key stage 2 into the top 5 per cent. over two years. However, once it had moved up, the money was no longer available and the good work was lost. That is a problem with many initiatives. It might be better to have fewer initiatives, but to have more money going directly to schools while allowing them to decide how to use it in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.3/5">It is important to get parents involved. Some community groups and initiatives have been helpful, such as the &quot;Parents and kids together&quot; initiative in the Sunnylands area of Carrickfergus in my constituency, but its funding is under threat. It identified a problem regarding the need for pre-school work and after-school clubs, but it did not allow parents simply to dump their youngsters at the community centre to be looked after. It demanded parental involvement. Sometimes that parental involvement was no more than an information evening about what services and courses might be available. Sometimes men were required to look after the youngsters playing football and fathers were asked to come down to help out with that. When I made a visit, I saw that many of the parents who had come along reluctantly at the start had seen the value for their youngsters, had become enthusiastic supporters and had begun to volunteer for more and more activities. Sometimes the scheme gave leadership to youngsters, such as when menfolk took them out for games. Sometimes it gave parents inspiration to find other ways of helping their youngsters. Many of them moved on to accredited courses and some then went on to other educational courses to improve their opportunities in life. Such initiatives require funding, but they can involve people who might not previously have been involved in their youngsters' education.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.3/6">Some initiatives have not worked and lessons can be learned from them. One is the group 1 schools initiative, under which some schools received &pound;200,000 over five years. Some received &pound;1 million over that period. I visited some of those schools with the Assembly Education Committee. There has been a lot of good work and a lot of effort, but much of it has dissipated, perhaps because there was not enough direction. There were no boundaries for success, and although the core purpose was to raise standards, there seems to have been little monitoring. I understand that the schools involved deal with difficult youngsters, but so did many schools that received money from the school support programme, and we have not seen the same return.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.3/7">One problem is that it was left to individual principals to come up with ideas. If we are to stick with initiatives, perhaps there should be sharing of best practice or even an initiatives forum so that people can find out what has happened and what has been good in other schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.3/8">Another thing that we need to consider is the attitudes of the schools themselves. I want to be careful about what I say. Many teachers who teach in difficult areas have a difficult task. Perhaps it is because of that that they can become burnt out and cynical more quickly. I have visited many schools and seen the kind of inspirational teaching that is done. Nevertheless, in many cases, it is a fact that teachers who have been teaching difficult youngsters in difficult schools for a long time sometimes lose their initial enthusiasm. The schools themselves tend to be faced with declining numbers and therefore budgetary problems. They have all kinds of resource problems. Perhaps the new, enthusiastic teachers are the first to be made redundant in many such cases, thereby leaving a gap in those schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.3/9">There is a role for the inspectorate, which I sometimes think is a bit cowardly. Inspectors may come in and say that such and such a teacher is having problems or that a class was not well taught, but leave it up to the school and the principal to decide what should happen. It is rare that an inspector will put his name to a report stating that a teacher needs to be moved on or needs retraining&mdash;the decision is usually left up to the school. Inspectors need to take a more proactive approach if they think that failure may be partly the result of the need for some staffing changes.</p>

	<p pid="b.465.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is very difficult for schools to get a bad teacher or head teacher moved on? One of the difficulties is how they do that but keep within the law.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.465.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="465"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h02.htm#60215h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.465.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend. That is exactly the point that I am making. Often, the inspector will not back up such a move, and the board of governors or the principal is left with a difficult decision. If the inspector will not back them up, what will happen if the case goes to a tribunal?</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/2">I know of schools with a high number of youngsters from disadvantaged areas and that had a bad reputation five or six years ago. With leadership, they were turned around in a short period. The quality of leadership is important, and perhaps we should target schools in the most difficult areas and even give incentives to put in the best teachers and principals to turn them around. That issue must be addressed. The role of the board of governors should also be considered. Sometimes there is an issue as to whether dynamic leadership by the board of governors could turn schools around.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/3">The problem cannot be dealt with simply by throwing a whole lot of money at it. It is not even an issue for the schools alone. As I have said before in the wider education debate about the post-primary controversy in Northern Ireland and the transfer procedure, society's views must change. We must value not just academic education in Northern Ireland&mdash;or, indeed, anywhere else&mdash;but practical and vocational skills. Many youngsters do not have great academic aspirations&mdash;even their parents may not have such aspirations for them&mdash;but do not think of education in terms other than of good exam results, GCSEs, A-levels or university.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/4">I welcome the changes in the curriculum, which will give schools much more flexibility on courses than was available under the set curriculum of the past. Attitudes to the whole spectrum of educational opportunity must change so that parents and youngsters from backgrounds where university is not viewed as the route to take nevertheless realise that education can also mean training for a vocational job, whether as a bricklayer, plumber or whatever else; that such education is valuable to them; and that they should use the opportunities provided by schools to achieve skills. That means that there must be intervention from an early age.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/5">There are opportunities. The Minister has spoken in the House on several occasions about rationalisation in Northern Ireland and the number of surplus places. I accept that there is a problem, and I do not believe that we should spend money on empty school places. I criticise myself and political colleagues right across the board. In the light of constituency pressures, we sometimes feel under pressure to defend a school that has gone down in numbers and does not offer good educational opportunities for youngsters.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/6">There are innovative ways to use such schools, however. Rationalisation offers an opportunity to turn them into child centres rather than simply schools. Other services could use the vacant premises; health services could be offered, for example. Youngsters could go for health checks and problems could be identified at an early age. A school could become a community focus so that parents would value the place, even if they did not much value education. It would be a place providing other activities for them and their youngsters, and attitudes could be changed in that way. I beg the Minister to consider some of those points, and I hope that I have given her enough time to reply.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.466.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" speakername="Angela Smith" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"  colnum="466"  time="011:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h02.htm#60215h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.466.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> on securing the debate and on choosing what is perhaps one of the most topical issues in Northern Ireland at present. It is certainly one of the most important if we are to consider what happens in Northern Ireland in the future. I enjoy my discussions on education with the hon. Gentleman, and I believe that we are as one on many issues. We have similar outlooks on what we seek to achieve for the education system in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/2">The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight areas of educational disadvantage. Kids have one chance in school. We fail them if we do not give them the opportunity to make the best life chance that they possibly can through the education system, and we should take that on board in everything that we do to improve education.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/3">This debate is not just about fairness for the individual, but about the future needs of our economy. The hon. Gentleman rightly highlighted academic and vocational education. Unless we offer a twin-track approach providing every child with the opportunity for academic and vocational education, we will not meet the needs of 21st century Northern Ireland. We will not produce the people whom we need as plumbers, doctors, parents and so on, and we will not address the need to ensure that people have the required skills and abilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/4">The hon. Gentleman also highlighted the problem&mdash;we have to acknowledge it before we can do anything about it&mdash;of far too many young people leaving our schools without achieving their full potential. Across Northern Ireland as a whole, 6 per cent. of them leave school with no GCSEs. In the most deprived areas, about which I know he is concerned, that proportion rises to 14 per cent. One quarter of 14-year-olds fall short of the expected standard in literacy and numeracy. In some schools in the most deprived areas, which he and I have visited, the figure is closer to three quarters, and more than 20 per cent. of adults have low literacy and numeracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/5">Those figures surprise some people. When we debate post-primary education and the removal of academic selection, we often hear about Northern Ireland having had the best results in the whole UK&mdash;no one can touch Northern Ireland's exam results. That is true at one level, but those figures and that success mask deep-seated problems that we have a duty to address. I fully take on board the hon. Gentleman's comments that just removing academic selection would not achieve the outcomes that we want, but I point out that it is part of a package to improve life opportunities for every child that includes changing the curriculum across Northern Ireland and giving support to schools that need it. Those things together can make a difference. I always think that there is only one opportunity in life and politics to make a difference, and we should take it. We are addressing the problem for the benefit of not only children, but the Northern Ireland economy as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/6">We need to avoid the easy option that some people take of blaming the parents, school or teachers. We are talking about deep-seated issues, and we have to consider the answers to them in the round. We need to consider all the factors that influence educational attainment, and the hon. Gentleman is right to highlight that that is not a job for education alone. I often discuss with my officials and with politicians in Northern Ireland the fact that if we try to deal with disadvantage in education and lack of achievement through the education system alone, we will not succeed; we have to consider the matter holistically, and involve the health service and housing bodies. The Department for Social Development will look into those problems as well. Together, we can tackle the issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/7">Parental support for the school is key; the hon. Gentleman highlighted the differences that it can make. We have found in disadvantaged areas as well as others that parents and young people recognise the value of education. We need to find ways of channelling that recognition and giving parents support so that they can help their youngsters in school.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/8">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the number of initiatives. It is fair to say that the Department has not sat on its hands ignoring the problem; there have been a number of initiatives to achieve what is needed. He mentioned that there were 58 or 59 programmes, but the number is irrelevant. I met a group of primary and secondary school principals who were talking about the number of initiatives that came through to schools. I asked, &quot;If you could get rid of some of these, which would you choose?&quot; They said, &quot;Well, none, because they are all valuable.&quot; Although there are initiatives and they are valued, we have to streamline them and make it easier for schools to be involved in them&mdash;and, where there are problems, we have to take them on board and address them.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/9">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the school support programme, which normally gives a school three years of intensive professional help and support. Some 193 schools are or have been involved, and 26 are currently on the programme, which is worth &pound;9.4 million. It is time-limited, and not open-ended. The idea behind the programme is that schools get the support that they need and move forward. There should then be a review on removing that support, because the school should have achieved its objectives through the programme. However, I take on board what he said, and I will come back to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/10">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the group 1 initiative, which provides &pound;200,000 a year for schools in severe difficulties. He was concerned about the lack of monitoring and the role of the inspectorate. The action planning, monitoring and evaluation are intrinsic parts of the process, but I share some of his concerns. I will take on board some of his comments about the education and training inspectorate. Since I became Minister with responsibility for education, I have had regular meetings with the ETI, and I am impressed by its knowledge, commitment and drive for the education system. Perhaps we should incorporate it more in policy making and take on board its comments when we look to move forward on those issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/11">The Government and the inspectorate have no interest in supporting those who are not going to be good teachers. If teachers are having the difficulties and problems that the hon. Gentleman mentions&mdash;if they are getting worn out, tired and put under tremendous pressure&mdash;they should get all the support that we can give them; but if teachers are really not able to teach, and teaching is not the profession that best suits them, then we should support them in looking into alternative professions. I share some of his concerns about the group 1 programme. There will be a review of the school improvements programme as a whole, and I give him an assurance that it will deal with the issues that he highlighted. Unless we review it and look into how we can do things better in future, we will not address the problems that he and I want to address. I shall announce the details of that review shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/12">The literacy and numeracy strategies have been very successful. We can see how results have improved in Northern Ireland schools and how, at the lower levels, where there is disadvantage and underachievement, those strategies are making a difference; I am pleased with how they are working. The reading recovery programme has also been very successful. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the dissemination of good practice, and some &pound;15 million is being put into that. There may be better ways to share good practice, as the inspectorate highlighted.</p>

	<p pid="b.469.0/1">The Minister will be aware of concerns in the primary and secondary sectors about the implementation of the Special Educational Needs and Disability (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 and the costs associated with it. Will the Department support schools in implementing the requirements of SENDO and in making adaptations to accommodate children who wish to move into mainstream education?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.469.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" speakername="Angela Smith" colnum="469"  time="011:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h02.htm#60215h02_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.469.1/1">We always recognised that there would be costs in implementing SENDO. If the hon. Gentleman is asking whether I can give a commitment that every school will have everything that it needs, I should say that that would be quite difficult, but certainly money has been allocated for that. Schools to which I have spoken have been very supportive of inclusion where it is appropriate for the individual child, the school and other children in the school. I have met representatives from a number of mainstream schools that have included children with disabilities, and they have reported that where inclusion suits the pupil, it has been a success. We keep that issue under review to give support to the schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/2">I should also highlight the &quot;Entitled 2 Succeed&quot; programme, which looks into the curriculum, as well as collaboration and transfer between schools. That has the potential&mdash;largely through the curriculum&mdash;to address the points made by the hon. Member for East Antrim about ensuring academic and vocational support for every young person who wants it.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/3">The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of leadership in schools. It is important that there be effective, high-quality leaders in schools. In a number of schools that I visited, I could see where that made a difference. If a head teacher inspires the staff and pupils, one can see a school lift off, and it is not just the results that change, but the behaviour and aspiration of pupils. We are keen to pursue that. There are some good examples of regional training units and children's and students' services, but we want to do more in working with heads to improve capacity. The head teacher from my old school, in my constituency, was in Northern Ireland recently, talking with people involved in the education services, and one thing that I have found useful is heads giving support to other heads. Heads who have that inspirational leadership really want to pass it on to other heads. That is another area that we have to develop further.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/4">The message that I want to give today is that the Government are very much attuned to wanting to give support to all pupils in Northern Ireland, so that we not only maintain our high levels of academic excellence, but ensure that young people who are currently underperforming in the education system have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Part of the answer is ensuring that the finance and support are in place, but we are spending the money that we have far too thinly across Northern Ireland's schools. I am very concerned whenever I speak to head teachers who have to give up being a full-time head to go into the classroom and teach full-time because of funding in the school. That is not because there is a lack of funding; the amount of funding going to schools is constantly increasing, but we are spending it across too many schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/5">The hon. Gentleman asked about rationalisation. I have spoken to the boards about that. Under the capital programme that I shall announce shortly, we will see whether there are opportunities to rationalise schools, and to support merging, amalgamations and closures where appropriate. If we do not take that on board and make sure that we have a schools estate that is fit for purpose, we will have too many schools that are not sustainable. That will put unacceptable pressure on schools that have to finance their work while money is being drained by too many schools across the board. I assure him that we will take that on board.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/6">I fully endorse the hon. Gentleman's point about schools being hubs in their communities. We already have breakfast clubs and activities to promote good health for young people; there is no doubt that children who eat better and who have good health learn better. There are also links to parents through Sure Start family learning programmes. There is support for study through homework clubs, too, where children have the opportunity to work with other children and get support enabling them to undertake the work that they have been given. There is clear evidence that that helps their studies to improve. There are also much closer links between education, health and social services, because we are bringing those together; we are taking a holistic approach to the young person. The children and young person's funding package, which the state announced in the budget process, is designed to tackle those issues to improve the life chances of young people. Further details will be announced shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/7">In conclusion, I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising the subject. I hope that I have addressed some of his concerns, and I look forward to discussing the issues further with him and seeing what more we can do to ensure that every single young person reaches their full potential and gets the life chances that they deserve.</p>

	<p pid="b.471.1/1">I see from the numbers in the Chamber that the business in the main Chamber is obviously non-controversial and that hon. Members need somewhere to come out of the cold. The pleasure of seeing you in the Chair, Mr. Bercow, is lessened only by the realisation that you are not on the Front Bench, where you so obviously deserve to be. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear!&quot;] I hope that <i>Hansard</i> recorded that deserved applause. The Conservative party's loss is our gain.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.1/2">I am delighted that the Speaker has chosen this debate, which is particularly welcome as it gives the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" name="James Plaskitt">the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt)</phrase>, the opportunity to explain current Government policy on Post Office accounts and the contract, and to settle genuine worries that there has been a change in policy in recent weeks. The debate also gives hon. Members and the Minister the chance to have a dialogue about the three pilot schemes that have come to our attention, although not through the House. A fair number of Members wish to speak, so I shall go through my speech as quickly as possible. I also hope that hon. Members will bear with me if I read my speech, because if I depart from it, I fear I shall lessen the number of those who can participate.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.1/3">The history of the subject, briefly, is that since 1997 the Government have invested between &pound;1 billion and &pound;2 billion in modernisation of the Post Office. Most of that money went on IT, to enable the Post Office to get up to date and to compete for other markets. That allowed the Department for Work and Pensions to realise an objective that it had sensibly had in mind for a number of years, which was to introduce the plastic card and direct payments because pension books and giros were costly and open to abuse. Once the IT system was in place, the Department went ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.1/4">The obvious move from books to plastic cards directly affected pensioners, but it also called into question the viability of thousands of post offices. We all know the results: thousands closed, although not in every case because of the new payment method. However, a major source of income was affected. That proved to be the last straw for a number of post offices, and, where the offer was made, postmasters took the opportunity to depart the scene. Some 2,500 post offices disappeared in that tranche.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.1/5">The customers also had a hard time. The Minister present was not at the Department then, so I can say without causing personal offence that its behaviour was slightly unpleasant. It wanted customers to give up their pension books and open bank accounts to facilitate direct bank payments. The Department was reluctant to tell pensioners that they could retain their books, and its literature was deliberately evasive on that point. It also frowned on the Post Office account and instituted a convoluted method of opening one, for which one needed a degree from Cambridge and the tenacity of a bulldog. I know from having spoken to those in the DWP who participated in early discussions that it wanted only banks to be involved, because they were the cheapest, and it set its stall out accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="b.472.0/1">Can my hon. Friend imagine the angst and chagrin of those 4.7 million benefit claimants&mdash;up to 5,000 in each constituency, and 10,000 in some&mdash;who, having survived an obstacle course of Olympic proportions to get the card account open, now find that the Government have abandoned the very assurances that they gave to us MPs? Is not that a deception of sub-post office staff and a betrayal of benefit claimants? I speak as a member of a third generation sub-post office family in the village in which I still live.</p>

	<p pid="b.472.1/1">I think that my hon. Friend has increased the number of pensioners and benefit recipients, but we will pass quickly over that. He uses strong language, but I shall touch on some of those matters, albeit in a gentler way&mdash;gentleness is the difference between us.</p>
	<p pid="b.472.1/2">While the DWP was working in that way, No. 10, the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry took a more mature view. Although they recognised the financial benefits to the DWP, they understood the sensitivity of the pensioners' worries about the break with post offices and also appreciated that the Post Office needed time to build up other income streams. A seven-year contract was therefore signed to subsidise the Post Office accounts, and leading banks chipped in with a contribution of &pound;180 million, which ends in 2008. The contract between the Government and the Post Office started in 2003 and will run to the financial year 2010&ndash;11.</p>

	<p pid="b.472.3/1">A number of hon. Members want to speak and I am reluctant to take up too much time, so if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will not.</p>
	<p pid="b.472.3/2">Important to all parties concerned was the stated agreement to work together in the intervening period, between 2003 and 2010, to evolve the Post Office accounts into something more akin to a bank account, which was in line with the Government's financial inclusion agenda. The discussion centred on the concept of what was termed the universal bank, run through the Post Office. That has largely disappeared from public sight, but it is perhaps still alive, albeit barely, as an idea. Nevertheless, the position accepted by all participants and known to Parliament and hon. Members was that a seven-year contract was in operation, and it was intended to evolve into an acceptable, viable and convenient alternative that would fit in with the Government's wider intention of extending financial inclusion.</p>

	<p pid="b.472.4/1">My hon. Friend makes his point strongly. Representing a semi-rural constituency, I persuaded people to use the Post Office card account instead of direct debits. We did that in my family, and I sent letters to constituents, a number of whom also did it. They did so because they wanted to keep their post office open, more than anything so that pensioners could use it. Does my hon. Friend agree that under the current position those people have been badly let down, if not completely deceived?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.473.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" speakername="George Mudie" colnum="473"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h03.htm#60215h03_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.473.0/1">I welcome this debate, because I always give the Government the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps others in the Chamber are less generous, but I want to hear what the Minister has to say, because I cannot believe that a Labour Government would act in that fashion. I am prepared to suspend judgment, although I will touch on the matter later.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/2">I hope that the Minister will largely agree&mdash;although perhaps not entirely&mdash;with a fair summary of the position, which is that it was unchallenged and widely understood before <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January</phrase>. There was then a debate about the Post Office in the other place in which Baroness Prosser, a member of the Post Office board, made a speech; she seems to have put the cat among the pigeons. She said:</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Government actions threaten us on two fronts. The first is their proposal to set up 70 high street offices to vet and interview applicants for passports. This would dig into the &pound;12 million net contribution this business currently brings in. Secondly&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/4">and relevant to this debate&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the Department for Work and Pensions has notified us that the current Post Office account card will cease when the contract ends in 2010&ndash;11. It is simply not possible to maintain the service politically demanded while at the same time being deprived of the wherewithal to underwrite the cost of that service.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2006-01-12.329"><i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 12 January 2006; Vol. 677, c. 329</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/6">It was suggested that the DWP had unilaterally taken the initiative to indicate that it intended to end the Post Office account when the contract ended in 2010, despite a well accepted understanding that, although the existing contract was an interim one, with a seven-year life and an objective that had been agreed by everybody involved, every effort would be made to allow it to evolve into a better arrangement that suited post office customers, the Post Office and the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/7">Unfortunately, that statement by the noble Baroness was not referred to or expanded on by the Minister who replied to the debate in the other place. So the story is out: the implication of Baroness Prosser's remarks is that unilateral action has been taken via the DWP, and there is to be no &quot;son of Post Office accounts&quot;&mdash;no life after 2010. The attitude is, &quot;We do not care what is said by the Treasury, the DTI or No. 10's performance unit, in 2010 we are coming out regardless of the consequences.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/8">If the Minister in the other place had answered the point at the time, this debate might have been unnecessary. However, the remark in that debate referred to pensioners all over the UK, who did not want to give up their pension books and who eventually compromised and accepted a Post Office card account. They now feel let down, angry and fearful. They believe that their cards will be withdrawn and they will have to have bank accounts whether they like it or not. The hard-working people who run sub-post offices genuinely fear that the Government have reneged on the agreement and are determined to move the business out of post offices and into banks. That will mean massive closures and not a few bankruptcies.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/9">This debate is a good chance for the Minister to kill that misunderstanding and reassure people. I sincerely hope that that will happen. This is not a pleasurable debate; it reflects a lot of worry among small businesses, vulnerable pensioners and benefit recipients. The sooner that fear is dispelled the better. I still worry, however. In the past half hour, I have received some e-mails. The one from Postwatch says:</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/10" class="indent">&quot;We were surprised to learn that the government's subsidy for the POCA will not be continued&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/11">That is from people who know the situation. If they are surprised, one wonders what is going on. The most worrying one was from the Post Office itself. It says:</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The Department for Work and Pensions have informed Post Office Ltd that they will not support the Post Office card account beyond 2010. This notification is given under the terms of the current agreement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.473.0/13">That is worrying, and it needs to be dealt with, because we have a Government commitment to life after 2010 for the Post Office account and the plastic card for those who wish it, yet this suggests that the DWP is acting unilaterally and has given notice. It would be useful to clear that up.</p>

	<p pid="b.474.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on having secured this debate, because he has touched on a serious point. A major redirection of Government policy seems to have happened in the Department without the involvement of this House, although the Department must know how much concern there is about the issue in all parts of the House.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.474.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" speakername="George Mudie" colnum="474"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h03.htm#60215h03_spnew8">
	<p pid="b.474.1/1">I totally agree. We have reached the stage at which a statement during a debate in the House of Lords has gone unchallenged by a Minister and we have learned the facts from a written answer, while nobody has made a statement. The good news might be that that was because there was no statement to make; the three or four Departments are all acting together and we are still on track.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.1/2">Having dealt with that point&mdash;I am sure that others will reinforce the message&mdash;it is necessary to seek assurances and explanations about the three pilot schemes. They, too, surfaced in such a way that hon. Members read about them for the first time in the newspapers. They are important, because they seem to go against the spirit, if not the letter, of the stated policy. The first pilot scheme is to frame the payment system information given to 3,000 new claimants in the north-east so that it does not include the Post Office account as an option for new claimants. That is disgraceful&mdash;London or the south I could understand, but surely not the north-east. I jest.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.1/3">That is reminiscent of the Department's early tactics with pensioners over the right to retain the pension book, and the right to a Post Office account. It was not volunteered, and one had to be a persistent pensioner to fight to retain one's pension book or even to get a Post Office account. That is not an entirely open and straightforward way to deal with people and needs to be reconsidered. It is also unfair to the sub-post offices in the area, because it affects their businesses and futures.</p>

	<p pid="b.474.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is worse than that in rural areas such as mine? The banks have pulled out, so pensioners cannot go to them. The post office is their only option, and if that goes there is nothing for them.</p>

	<p pid="b.475.0/1">I totally agree. The hon. Gentleman is not alone. Rural areas have an additional problem with distances, but there have been post office closures in urban areas; I had five in my constituency, which is in a deprived part of the inner city of Leeds.</p>

	<p pid="b.475.1/1">Just to endorse the point about rural areas, there is not just a lack of banks, but a lack of alternative provision of any kind in many villages. In my constituency, the sub-post office is the last thing left; it is the last place for social, let alone commercial, activity.</p>

	<p pid="b.475.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very relevant point.</p>
	<p pid="b.475.2/2">The second pilot scheme is totally unacceptable and raises questions of bad faith; it allows those minded to cause mischief and distress to vulnerable people to go ahead. The intention is to send letters to existing Post Office account holders who also have bank accounts to demand their bank details and to tell them to use those accounts. That is how the initiative is framed by the sub-postmasters. We have not been officially informed about it, but my only other source of information is impeccable: it is a briefing note from the parliamentary Labour party. As hon. Members can imagine, it is much more gentle&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.475.4/2" class="indent">&quot;DWP will . . . write to 35,000 existing POCA customers with bank account details, suggesting they may like to move over to a bank account payment and requesting their bank details.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.475.4/3">It we consider the two approaches, the truth will lie somewhere in the middle. It is still a disturbing situation and we would welcome clarification from the Minister. Much gentler that might have been, but, however phrased, it puts pressure on the customer. It is reminiscent of past bad behaviour and, above all, it is a breach of faith with sub-postmasters and Post Office account holders and takes a potential 35,000 customers away from sub-post offices.</p>
	<p pid="b.475.4/4">In my former incarnation as a trade union official, I would not have accepted it if an employer who had a seven-year agreement with me sought to interfere with it in such a way in only the third year. The Government and the DWP made an agreement and signed a contract. To do anything without consultation in the third year of a seven-year contract is provocative and needs to be rethought.</p>

	<p pid="b.476.2/1">I have taken a few interventions. Will my hon. Friend let me finish this point? I am conscious of the time. I hope that you understand the difficulty with my taking a lot of interventions, Mr. Bercow.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.2/2">The third pilot scheme is along the same lines, and is equally objectionable. In that pilot, 2,500 Post Office account holders who have one benefit paid into a Post Office account and another into a bank account have been told by the Department that the payment that goes into the Post Office account will be moved into the bank account forthwith. However logical and harmless that might seem when discussed around a ministerial table, it is offensive, not only because it cuts across the long-term contract to the detriment of people who are trying to keep small businesses afloat, but because it ignores customers' decisions. They were asked to use only a bank account&mdash;indeed, one could say that they were badgered into it&mdash;but they settled on a Post Office account. Now it is suggested, without a word of apology, that 2,500 people's payments will be moved into their bank accounts. As the Citizens Advice, sub-postmasters and others say, there are often individual reasons why people want to keep such accounts separate, and those should be honoured and recognised.</p>

	<p pid="b.476.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, and I apologise for the fact that I will have to leave to meet a constituent at 3 pm to discuss this very issue. For me, this came to light only two years ago when the whole issue of the pension credit was being considered, when I discovered through Pension Service staff that the account was short-term. If there is a problem, it is the fact that it was not spelled out to everyone when the Post Office card account was introduced that it would be only until 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.3/2">I agree with what the spokesman for the Scottish National party, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase>, said about this being an issue in rural areas. We have a particular difficulty in Scotland, because of the major banks. It would have meant additional business if the major banks had joined up, and we might have been in a more sound position.</p>

	<p pid="b.476.4/1">I genuinely have a different opinion from my hon. Friend. There is a seven-year contract, but it was tied to an agreement that there would be work in the intervening period to put together some mechanism to move towards financial inclusion, as the Government wanted to, by making the Post Office account a more attractive financial vehicle.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.4/2">When I started this debate, we were aware of the arrangement that we had seven years with Post Office accounts, and we were looking forward to the post-2010 arrangements and the universal bank. The worry is that people such as my hon. Friend are suddenly accepting that all that is going to disappear in 2010, but that is not the case. The contract was to end, but was to be replaced with something better. The suggestion now is that not only will that not happen, but steps are being taken to weaken the seven-year agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.4/3">I shall finish now, Mr. Bercow. I am grateful for hon. Members' patience and your wisdom. I hope that on the substantive issue there will be life after 2010 for an improved form of Post Office account, and that the Minister will confirm that there is no intention by the DWP of the sort described, and that no precipitate action was taken. I would equally welcome reconsideration by the Minister and his Department of the three pilot schemes, which I find provocative. Perhaps I am alone in that. In view of the misunderstandings and worries caused by the statement in the other place, to go ahead with the pilot schemes would send out the wrong message.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.477.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" speakername="Owen Paterson" colnum="477"  time="014:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h03.htm#60215h03_spnew22">
	<p pid="b.477.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Bercow, it is a pleasure to speak with you in the Chair. I reiterate the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase>; perhaps this will be a temporary sojourn on the Chairmen's Panel and you will be on the Front Bench soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/2">I congratulate the hon. Member for Leeds, East on landing this debate, which is of great interest to many of our constituents. I have worked on this issue as a constituency MP for a long time. As I have told the House before, a few years ago I drove around 28 post offices in my constituency, a 150-mile drive, and established that in many of them the proportion of turnover related to benefits was extraordinarily high. It was 60 per cent. in Gobowen, 80 per cent. in Treflach, 70 per cent. in Pant, 60 per cent. in West Felton, and 50 per cent. in Baschurch and Prees.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/3">At that time, I was working with a splendid postmaster, Colin Doyle from Knockin. I went to see the then Minister of State for Energy, E-Commerce and Postal Services, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" name="Stephen Timms">the hon. Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms)</phrase>, to discuss the real barriers that were being put up by authorities, which were being backed by the Government, to put people off getting a card account. We were told on the Floor of the House that there were only three steps to be taken, but I went through it with Colin and we established that in some cases there were a minimum of 22 steps, and that applications for cards would be rejected for the slightest of errors, in order to force people to take payments directly into bank accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/4">The outgoing Conservative Government had a perfectly sensible swipe card scheme, which would have had the advantage of the security that the Government wisely seek, and would have kept income going through sub-post offices. However, that scheme was unwisely scrapped because there was great belief in the universal bank. The hon. Member for East Ham, who is one of the most respected members of the Government and whom I completely trust, said that he genuinely thought that everyone would have an opportunity to partake in the universal bank in a few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/5">The Minister who is here today gave me a parliamentary reply only yesterday saying that the following banks do not offer current accounts through post offices: Abbey, Bank of Scotland, First Trust, Halifax, HSBC, NatWest, Northern bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Ulster bank and Yorkshire bank. We are a country mile away from having a universal bank option and enabling all benefits customers to take direct payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/6">At no stage in any discussions was it hinted that for those who had struggled through the jungle with their machetes, survived the passage of 22 obstacles and got their cards, this was a temporary option. It was thought that having made a substantial investment&mdash;the Minister will tell us how much; the Government trumpet those figures all the time&mdash;in the new system, it would be there for good. I have a letter from the hon. Member for East Ham, which does not even hint that there was a 2010 deadline.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/7">I enjoy the role of secretary to the all-party group on sub-post offices, which is chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase>. We were astonished on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>, when one of our meetings was attended by Colin Baker, general secretary of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, to be told by him about the three trials. That was the most extraordinary revelation.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/8">I ask the Minister to confirm what consultation he had with anyone, not least with his colleagues in the DTI. I asked the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry about the subject in questions recently, and he seemed bemused. I raised it with the Leader of the House in the main Chamber and he ran into semantics about the difference between the words &quot;impermanent&quot; and &quot;temporary&quot;. Again, he did not seem to realise the consequences of what the Government are proposing through their arm, the DWP.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/9">What consultation has taken place? What happens if one of the 3,000 new benefits claimants does not want to open a card account? What would happen to one of the 35,000 existing customers who did not like the tone of the letter from the DWP, however it is phrased and even if it is in cuddly language from the parliamentary Labour party? What happens if one of the 2,500 existing customers is not prepared to have their payments put into a bank account or if they are with one of the banks mentioned on the list in the reply to the parliamentary question? What will the consequences be? What is the legal basis for the change? What rights do benefits claimants have not to be bamboozled by the Government and forced into new arrangements that none of us have heard of?</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/10">It was alarming in our meeting that the chief executive of the Post Office, Adam Crozier, said that he would need 4,000 post offices to run a mail service. The Government have done grievous damage to post offices. An income of &pound;400 million through the benefit payments has been taken away from post offices, and it is probably down to &pound;160 million with the 4.3 million existing card account holders. If they are to be dragooned into some form of direct payment and made to surrender their cards in 2010, what will be the role of the 14,400 post offices when only 4,000 are needed to run a mail service? The Government do not appear to have thought that through.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/11">There may be sensible, rational gains and savings to be made. We would all support that; we do not want the Government to waste public money. There may be savings in having direct payments and dropping the card account scheme. However, there has been substantial investment in recent years and benefit income is the core of the sub-post office network. The post offices that I have visited&mdash;we have been through this in previous debates&mdash;have other business tacked on. There is stationery related to the direct benefits payment at the post office, but it may also sell dry food, fresh food and fruit. Many post offices have an off-licence attached, or they may sell cold food or products for tourists. Benefits are always the core base from which the hub of the village shop is built up, and that performs a valuable service.</p>

	<p pid="b.479.0/1">My hon. Friend is describing the exact situation in Little Irchester, a small village in my constituency. I was in the sub-post office last week; the splendid sub-postmaster is concerned about the change. His is the only business in the village.</p>

	<p pid="b.479.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman remember&mdash;it was before my time in this House&mdash;an Opposition day debate on the introduction of Post Office card accounts on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-11">11 June 2003</phrase>? Talking about why the accounts had been introduced, the then Under-Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" name="Malcolm Wicks">the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase>, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.479.2/2" class="indent">&quot;If we did not make this change, the post office network would be bled dry by people increasingly choosing to have their benefit or pension paid into a bank or building society.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-06-11.767"><i>Official Report</i>, 11 June 2003; Vol. 406, c. 767</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.479.2/3">Does the hon. Gentleman not think that that is exactly what would happen? The Government were right to be concerned about the possibility and if the Post Office card account is abandoned that will have a severe impact on the viability of the post office network.</p>

	<p pid="b.479.3/1">The hon. Lady understates her case. The network would collapse. I do not see what will maintain the 10,000-odd post offices without a core business of benefits on which they can build a business of selling Post Office products, food and so on. The Government have not thought things through. Perhaps they will save money in the DWP, but there will be substantial economic costs in closing down the post office network. There will be massive social costs. There is not joined-up government.</p>
	<p pid="b.479.3/2">I rarely sign early-day motions, but I drafted one with the hon. Member for Vauxhall about the abolition of the Post Office card account. I am delighted to see that on the first evening 81 Members signed that early-day motion, and you, Mr. Bercow, were one of them. I got myself into some trouble because I had not cleared the proposal with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1468" name="David Ruffley">the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley)</phrase>, but we sorted it out later and it now has full Tory support. We want a review of the DWP's proposals, but I would also like a review of the future of the Post Office. What does the DTI think the post office network is for and what does it think is its future over the next 50 years? What does the DWP think is the future of the network? What is the Government's social view? What social function do post offices provide? The Government must give a coherent strategic view. At the moment, we have a mess.</p>

	<p pid="b.480.0/1">I, too, signed that early-day motion. Does my hon. Friend share my concern that a review is not the answer? In the meantime, all the people who have invested in their own post office businesses will find that their businesses are blighted and that the business plans that they entered into&mdash;perhaps with bank support&mdash;are complete mincemeat as a result of the Government announcement.</p>

	<p pid="b.480.1/1">That was a great question from my hon. Friend. It is just the point that I was going to make. Like many people, my constituent, Colin Doyle, bought into the business to round off the working years of his life and as a nest egg for his retirement. Many sub-postmasters cannot sell their businesses because the future is blighted. We do not have a clue of the Government's strategic view of the post office network, and there is a real problem as people are getting out and retiring. Above all, however, there is a huge blight on people coming into the business. To have a vibrant post office network we need a constant turnover of fresh, enterprising people to take on that role.</p>

	<p pid="b.481.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> on obtaining this debate. We will need to debate the subject on the Floor of the House as soon as possible if we do not get proper answers from the Minister today. As chairman of the all-party group of which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> is secretary, I obviously agree with everything that he has said. He has put a number of points that I hope the Minister will answer.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/2">The Government have, I am afraid, committed a dual breach of faith. First, they have breached the faith of all those people, particularly pensioners, who went through such trauma giving up their book, which they were used to, and after a huge amount of work managed to get a Post Office card account. Most in my area have got used to it and begun to feel that it gives them the freedom to go along each week and get out as much cash as they want.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/3">Secondly, the Government have breached the faith that many sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses had in what they had said. Those people put in extra money, produced their business plans and thought that they had a future. Not only do they now see that they are likely to have no future after 2010, but they are facing those ridiculous three pilot schemes, which we only heard about at the last minute, which the Post Office and Adam Crozier told us that they had only known about for a short time and which seem to have been plucked out of the air by the DWP. They were probably worked on for many months by civil servants and signed off by a Minister who gave them no real thought, with no consultation at all of the DTI. I hope not only that we will obtain answers to the legal questions that have been asked today, but that the Minister will ask for the schemes to be withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/4">The wording of the letters that went out is so patronising; the attitude is basically &quot;We know best.&quot; The letters state:</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/5" class="indent">&quot;As you have been using your Post Office card account for some time, now is the time to make arrangements to pay your benefit/pension into a bank (or building society) account. You'll go on receiving the same amount of money as often as you do now.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/6">How dare any civil servant or Minister send out such letters to people who chose to have a Post Office card account? They may have a bank account but still want their card account. It is all very well saying that the people who have gone on to benefits for the first time have been told that they must have a bank account, but that if they say no, they will probably be told, &quot;That's okay. You can carry on as you are.&quot; That will be made so difficult for them. They will have to do all the work to get their Post Office card account when the situation should be the other way round. If banks want to take people away from having a card account, it is up to them to spend the money to do that; taxpayers' money should not be spent trying to do it.</p>

	<p pid="b.481.1/1">Would it be fair to ask the Minister to say when he winds up the debate whether there is any agreement between his Department and the Treasury on cost savings that may come to the Government? If there is, can they be open about that?</p>

	<p pid="b.481.2/1">I hope that the Minister will try to answer that question. There is no doubt that the proposals will save the DWP money, and they probably tick a box in one of the spending plans that it has to produce over the next few years, but the long-term effect will be to destroy the post office network. Yes, some post offices will remain&mdash;the 4,000 that are needed, as was pointed out, to provide a universal delivery service across the country&mdash;but there is no doubt that the vast majority, having thought that they had been saved, will be lost. That creeping attack on the Post Office card account demonstrates so much bad faith. The Government are not saying openly and honestly, &quot;Look, we want to get people off the account as quickly as possible. Let's do it this way.&quot; They hoped that everything would be happening almost before anyone knew about it.</p>

The Government must get their act together on what their policy is on post offices, because clearly they are saying one thing to us and something else behind the scenes. It is amazing how a campaign or an issue such as this unites political parties. Whatever our politics overall, we know that for our constituents this issue is very important. It does not matter whether someone is a Conservative, a Liberal Democrat or a Labour MP: this issue matters to our constituents, which is why there is so much unity on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/2">I say to the Minister, &quot;You have been caught out.&quot; I do not mean the Minister personally&mdash;at least, I hope that it is not him who has been caught out&mdash;but the issue has now come to the attention of us all, and we will not give in. We want answers today, we want all three pilot schemes withdrawn and we want everyone to get round the table and find a sensible solution for the time after 2010&mdash;a solution that retains people's right to use the post office and to have the flexibility that they have at the moment.</p>

	<p pid="b.482.2/2">The recent announcement that the Government intended to abolish the Post Office card account in 2010 came as a big shock to us all. Sub-postmasters and the 4 million pensioners who had chosen to use that account assumed that it or a similar successor would continue indefinitely. At least 4 million pensioners had to battle to get the account. The customer conversion centre that they had to telephone tried to badger them to the banks, but those pensioners were determined that they wanted a Post Office card account. They were never told that the account would be temporary, which must now come as a big shock to them.</p>

	<p pid="b.482.3/1">Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern about closure? Some of my constituents jumped through various hoops to get the Post Office card account and registered it with their local sub-post office only to find that that post office was to close. They then had to move their account to another post office, which also closed. If someone does not have a local sub-post office, there is no point in having a Post Office card account.</p>

	<p pid="b.483.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. Part of the problem with the Government's approach is that abolishing the Post Office card account and forcing people to go to the banks inevitably means that many post offices will close. Even though some of the bank accounts may allow the pensioners to lift their money at the post office, they cannot do that if there is no post office in their local village.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/2">In all our debates during the previous Parliament, the Government never once made it clear that the Post Office card account would be temporary. They always argued that people could collect their money through a Post Office card account; there was no mention of the words &quot;only until 2010&quot;. Of course, it is not only the abolition of the account in 2010 that has become apparent; the Government have started to take people off the account this very month. They know that if they are to abolish the Post Office card account in 2010, they need to move every pensioner and benefit recipient off the account by then. As we have heard, the Government have already written to 3,000 pensioners saying, &quot;You must use a bank or a building society account; you are not being given the choice of a Post Office card account.&quot; When I asked the Minister in a written question what would happen to people who did not have a bank account, he effectively replied, &quot;We'll send them giros.&quot; That practice, as we know from what has happened in the past, is open to fraud, but it is what the Government are going to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.483.6/1">My hon. Friend mentioned how the Department for Work and Pensions seems to be resurrecting its desire to bully people into banking the way it wants them to, rather than letting them have a free, open and clear choice to do it their own way. It has also reverted to the old language of not telling the whole story. I received a letter from the Minister today, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.483.6/2" class="indent">&quot;People will still be able to collect their benefit or pension at the Post Office if they wish by using their bank or building society account there.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.483.6/3">No caveat is given to show that many banks or accounts do not allow that. The DWP fell into that trap before, and it is falling into it again. If a post office is shut, no one will be able to access their bank account there, so unless the Government have a strategy for keeping post offices open, there will not be any access.</p>

	<p pid="b.484.0/1">My hon. Friend is quite right. Before his intervention, I described pilot A. The DWP has two other pilots. In pilot B, it simply writes to pensioners who are collecting their pension through a post office account and asks them to supply their bank or building society account details. There is nothing in the letter to tell the pensioner that they have a choice to continue with the Post Office card account; it simply asks them to supply bank account details, thus conning them into moving to a bank. The pensioner receives a letter from the Government, does what the Government ask and phones up to supply their bank account details. Suddenly, without being aware of it, they will find that their pension has been removed from their Post Office card account to a bank account.</p>

	<p pid="b.484.1/1">The hon. Gentleman mentioned earlier that the Minister had said that someone can always get a giro, but if there are no banks in rural areas and the post offices are closing, where will they be able to cash that giro? Given that the banks have moved out and post offices are closing, does the hon. Gentleman agree that we are increasing financial exclusion in rural areas of Scotland, Wales and probably even England?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.484.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" speakername="Alan Reid" colnum="484"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h03.htm#60215h03_spnew47">
	<p pid="b.484.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is quite right. In my constituency, of the three main Scottish banks, the Clydesdale is the only one that allows current accounts to be accessed at post offices. The Clydesdale is closing rural branches, however, so he is right: if people have a giro and there is no post office or bank to go to, they face the expense of journeying to the nearest town.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.2/2">In the third pilot, pilot C, people are given no choice. The people involved are pensioners or benefit recipients who receive more than one benefit from the Government. One is paid through the Post Office card account, and they have chosen to be paid the other through a bank. The benefit that they currently receive through the card account is simply moved to the bank account without any choice being given to them. The Government are taking choice away from people again.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.2/3">It had always been the assumption that if the Post Office card account came to an end in 2010, it would be replaced by another solution based in the post office. When I raised the matter with the Leader of the House at business questions, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.484.2/4" class="indent">&quot;We are not about to abandon the success of the card&mdash;we want to ensure that it continues but in an appropriate way.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-02-02.474"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 February 2006; Vol. 442, c. 474</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.484.2/5">However, by starting these pilots now and forcing pensioners away from post offices to banks, the DWP is pre-empting what the Leader of the House believes and, as we heard earlier, what other Departments believe. It is simply not joined-up thinking. The DWP may think that it is going to save money in its own budget, and as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> said, it will be able to tick a box, but that is not joined-up thinking. It will cost other parts of the Government money. The publicly owned Post Office will lose money; and if it loses money as a publicly owned company, the Government and the taxpayer lose money.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.2/6">The abolition of the Post Office card account threatens the viability of thousands of urban and rural post offices, many of which are in very remote areas or areas of urban deprivation. Often the post office is the only shop in such areas. Even if it is not, those around it may rely on people getting money there and then spending it in the shops. If the post office goes, there will often be no shop left in the village or the urban housing scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.2/7">Before it is too late, I urge the DWP to think again, because its actions will have devastating effects throughout Britain. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> said, we have heard from Royal Mail that the approach could mean 10,000 post office closures, leaving us with only 4,000 in the country. I urge the DWP to think again, abandon these pilot schemes, get together with other parts of the Government, initiate a full review of how we can secure the future of the post office network in the long term and allow pensioners to have the choice of continuing to collect their money at the post office from a Post Office card account.</p>

	<p pid="b.485.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> for securing this debate and making his case effectively and eloquently. Rather than repeat many of the points that he made, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to just two issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/2">The all-party group on small shops, of which I and many hon. Members present are members, published a survey today called &quot;High Street Britain: 2015&quot;. One of its conclusions is that the Government should directly support and expand the specific services offered by the sub-post office network. The sub-postmasters' submission to the inquiry went further and suggested that they could be paid to provide advice centres for the Government. Many of them already give a wide range of advice for free.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/3">The Welsh Assembly Government have given &pound;4.1 million of Post Office development fund money to support and develop post office branches located in the 125 most deprived and isolated electoral divisions throughout Wales, including a number in my own constituency. The grant was given to improve their future viability. If a post office closes within three years of receiving a grant, the money, quite properly, must be repaid.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/4">The killing off of the Post Office card account is a real threat to the viability of post offices that serve small rural communities or deprived urban communities. Is that really joined-up government thinking? The card account brings people into the post office who then make other purchases there or in an adjacent corner shop, helping to make those businesses viable. Furthermore, in a close-knit and caring community, if Mrs. Jones does not pop in to use her card account, the post office staff will make inquiries to check that she is safe and well and ensure that nothing untoward has happened to her. I hope that the Minister is listening and that he realises post offices are the heart of our communities. If the heart is ripped out, the community is killed off.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.486.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" speakername="Michael Weir" colnum="486"  time="015:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h03.htm#60215h03_spnew49">
	<p pid="b.486.0/1">I am very pleased to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1692" name="Nia Griffith">the hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith)</phrase>, and I agree entirely with what she said. It demonstrates the cross-party support there is for the Post Office and the card account. When the Government launched the Post Office card account in the first place, they did so under intense pressure because they were trying to transfer benefits to banks. For the life of me, I cannot understand the Government's obsession with giving business to banks and taking it away from post offices. It does not make sense, it undermines the post office network and it undermines many villages and small towns in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.486.0/2">Looking at my constituency, one sees that many of the larger towns are down to one or two sub-post offices. Two of the larger villages, Letham and Newtyle, have a post office, but they have no banks. They are quite large communities. Friockheim, another large village in my constituency, has neither bank nor post office any more. If we take away the Post Office card account, and we have plenty of evidence of what that will do to the post office network, it will destroy what is left.</p>
	<p pid="b.486.0/3">I do not agree with the comment earlier that there will be enough post offices left for a universal service. That will be doubtful if we lose another huge tranche of post offices as a result of this measure. The universal postal service is essential to our rural area. It is as much under threat because of the threat to our post offices as anything else. The post office system was unified, and it is being broken up by this Government's action, and it will be killed off if this measure goes through.</p>
	<p pid="b.486.0/4">The Government say that people can use banks instead. Where are those banks? Throughout rural Scotland and Wales, and throughout rural England I am sure, the banks have pulled out of small communities, and they have done so over many years. In Scotland, we are now in the ridiculous situation whereby one major bank is advertising that there is no bank closure programme. There is no bank closure programme because it closed all the branches years ago. It is using that as an excuse to poach business from one other bank that is in the middle of a closure programme. Many of our rural communities no longer have banks.</p>
	<p pid="b.486.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1469" name="Hywel Williams">the Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase> reminded me that a few years back, the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs produced a report on this very subject and considered financial exclusion in rural areas. The Committee raised the spectre of exclusion increasing in Wales at that time. It is increasing throughout our rural areas. He mentioned that in Caernarfon, the rural post offices have closed and been replaced by a post van, which will effectively reduce post office services in those communities to a couple of hours a day. There will be no financial benefit. Throughout Scotland, Wales and rural England, the problem is serious.</p>
	<p pid="b.486.0/6">We have heard about the pilot schemes. I can only imagine the situation of a pensioner who has gone through the whole procedure of getting a card account, and then gets a letter saying, &quot;Go to your bank account.&quot; In many areas, people will be asking, &quot;Where is that bank. Do I have to get a bus to the nearest town? How much is that going to cost out of my already meagre pension?&quot; This measure will increase financial exclusion in many areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.486.0/7">We are told that in one other pilot scheme, people who have a bank account and a Post Office account have been told that they should go to the bank account. Whatever happened to personal choice? Why are people not given such choice? They may have very good reasons for wanting ready cash in a Post Office account, and for using their bank account for other matters.</p>

	<p pid="b.487.0/1">One of those ready cash reasons will the avoidance of bank charges. One safe thing about someone used to budgeting on a cash basis through the post office is that the card account does not incur them any charges. Bullied by the Department into prematurely going into banking, they go overdrawn and end up with &pound;20 letters from the bank.</p>

	<p pid="b.487.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is correct, and he makes an excellent point. Many people with bank accounts are having to take money out of cash machines, and in rural areas many of them charge. Again, it is a charge on their already meagre pension. I must ask the Minister again, why the obsession with banks? My experience of banks these days is that they do not want accounts into which people put money and take it all out again. There is no good business in that for the banks. We are told, I think by Citizens Advice, that one reason the Government may be doing so is that it costs considerably more to pay into a Post Office card account than it does to pay into a bank account. I cannot find the figure, but I think that it is something like 30p as opposed to 1p. That makes one suspect that the measure is purely financially driven. There is no evidence of joined-up government, and the Government are taking no account of the effect on rural communities. I urge the Minister to rethink the policy before it is too late.</p>

	<p pid="b.487.2/2">I strongly agree with the comments made by other Members that the matter should be the subject of a full debate on the Floor of the House, and I hope that it can be secured in Government time in the near future. The anger that has been expressed by Members of all parties in this debate is shared more widely throughout the whole House.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.2/3">The Government claim that it was known all along that this was an interim measure and that the Post Office card account would be wound up in 2010. Perhaps the Minister will tell us otherwise. That news has come as a devastating shock to many people. If the Government had always planned to end the account in 2010, it was a very well kept secret.</p>

Gentleman remember that back in 2001, there was a grand vision for the future of post offices as general practitioners for Government services, which would boost their business? I think that it was called the &quot;Your Guide&quot; scheme, and the Post Office card account seemed to be an essential part of it. Does he agree that we ought to be returning to that vision, rather than moving even further away from it?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.488.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="488"  time="015:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h03.htm#60215h03_spnew58">
	<p pid="b.488.6/1">First, I should like to agree with the point being made here very strongly. There is a great difference between the termination of a contract and the ending of a service. That distinction has been made by Members from all parts of the House. I have scoured in vain many previous debates on this matter in <i>Hansard</i> to find an occasion when the Minister has made clear not the term of the contract, but when the service was going to end. I have not been able to find a single quotation from a Minister making clear that the Post Office card account was a time-limited, temporary matter that would not carry on after 2010. Terms of contract are one thing; provision of service is quite another. It is that point that I should like to hear the Minister address when he responds.</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/2">For a Government who place such a high value on the presentation of policy, that aspect was well hidden at the time. The contract, which apparently makes this clear, was not made public for commercial reasons, and therefore, Members of Parliament and benefit recipients had no reason to believe that the card account would cease to exist after 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/3">Speaking in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-15">15 January 2004</phrase>, the then Leader of the House, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1723" name="Peter Hain">the right hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain)</phrase>, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/4" class="indent">&quot;Two million pensioners have taken up the opportunity to get cash from the local post offices with the card, which replaces the benefit booklet, and that is a sensible way to proceed.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-01-15.965"><i>Official Report</i>, 15 January 2004; Vol. 416, c. 965</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/5">Would so many people have thought it a sensible way to proceed if they had known that the Government were going to pull the rug from under their feet a few years later? Those statements and many others, which I could list if there were enough time, contained not even a hint that the Post Office card account was intended to be only a short-term or temporary measure .</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/6">A joint DWP and DTI statement described the card account, and the package of which it was supposed to be a part, as the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of the services provided by the Government&mdash;a strange cornerstone when, seven years later, it is removed and the building collapses.</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/7">Will the Minister tell us today when Ministers explicitly told Parliament that the card account was a purely temporary measure? The announcement has also come as a shock to the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters. The general secretary said that he first knew of the decision when it was announced by Baroness Prosser in the House of Lords. She is not even a Government spokesperson.</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/8">We must think about the impact that the measure will have on the people affected. Some 4.3 million people throughout the country use the card accounts, and they are not just pensioners. According to an answer that I received this morning, giving a list broken down by constituency, in which other hon. Members may be interested, 6,500 people in my constituency use the account; 33,000 use it in the highlands and islands; 562,000 use it in Scotland; and almost 7,000 of the Chancellor's constituents and 10,000 of the Prime Minister's constituents use it. The figure in the Minister's constituency is smaller&mdash;5,500&mdash;but in relation to his parliamentary majority it is still a very large number indeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/9">Like the switch away from pension books, this measure will cause real distress and anger. Indeed, 40 per cent. of those benefit recipients who were invited to convert to direct payment instead chose a Post Office card account. Of the many who did not, more than 500,000 people still receive their payments by weekly girocheque. Does the Minister want to see that number balloon when he removes the card account, with more people on the least secure form of payment?</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/10">The card account contract is worth around &pound;1 billion to post offices between 2003 and 2010. Without that income stream, many thousands of branches will be unable to survive. Indeed, the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters has predicted that many thousands of post offices throughout the country will have to close. The worst hit will be post offices in rural areas and urban deprived areas, as the hon. Member for Leeds, East made clear. The people who most need the service of a post office will be worst hit.</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/11">Typical post offices run alongside a retail outlet, and it has been estimated that within a rural community alone &pound;3.7 billion of retail expenditure is facilitated directly by having local post offices serve as an anchor to those services; thus a mass closure of post offices, as a result of cutting the card account, is likely to have a crippling effect on the local economy in rural and poorer urban areas alike.</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/12">By terminating the Post Office card account the Government are seriously damaging the post office network. Far from seeing it thrive, the Prime Minister risks making the destruction of Britain's post office network the most visible part of his legacy. Will the Minister tell us today how many post office branches throughout the country he thinks will have to close if the Post Office card account is removed?</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/13">I want to make a couple of points about the pilot schemes. They have been much discussed in this debate, but no evidence has been produced to suggest that they were introduced as a result of any consultation with stakeholders. Perhaps the Minister would tell us what consultation took place. It seems that the pilot schemes were implemented without any publicity to alert pensioners that they were able to open a Post Office card account. Will the Minister tell us, especially in relation to pilot C, whether people will be able to say, &quot;No. I would like to keep my Post Office card account&quot;? If not, what is the legal basis for that?</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/14">There have been rumours that the Government are considering making extra payments to people as an incentive or sweetener for them to move to card accounts. Will the Minister tell us whether that has been considered?</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/15">In the briefing to the parliamentary Labour party, the Secretary of State referred to the Government's intention to honour the full contract. If so, how will the phasing out take place? Honouring the full term of the contract presumably means that by the end of the contract no one will have a Post Office card account. That implies removing 1 million people a year from the card account for the next four years. Is that the Government's intention?</p>
	<p pid="b.488.6/16">Why not build on the success of the Post Office card account instead of pulling the rug from under people's feet? The Government should look for additional services to be provided through post offices, not cut the services that are already provided. We need a joined-up approach. The Government's rhetoric refers to supporting post offices, yet the DWP is removing the card account, the DTI is considering ending or reducing the social network payment that keeps rural post offices going, the Home Office has decided not to allow post offices to be involved in delivering passport services and the Department for Transport is not allowing all post offices to issue driving licences. The Government's words to post offices may be positive, but their actions are deeply negative. If they want to be seen to be taking post offices seriously, the Government need a joined-up approach that says, &quot;This is how we are going to support post offices and build on the tremendous network of outlets throughout the country.&quot; They should not undermine them at every turn.</p>

	<p pid="b.490.0/1">It is always a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> on securing this debate and on a superb speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/3">The future of the Post Office card account is escalating into a major political problem for the Government. More than one third of the Members of the House of Commons have signed early-day motions 147 and 1531, which express concern about the future of that account. The Post Office card account cannot be debated in isolation from the future of the sub-post office network, as many excellent contributions today made clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/4">I have no desire to play Punch and Judy politics on this issue. There is a great deal of cross-party agreement and I am prepared to accept that the Government have put many millions of pounds into social network payments and the urban reinvention programme, but there are still some serious questions that the Minister must address because Government rhetoric is simply not being matched by Government action.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/5">The Cabinet Office performance and innovation unit's report of June 2000 assured us that over the next five years, there would be development of</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/6" class="indent">&quot;a shared understanding of the role that post offices should play in the longer term&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/7">and that advice would be given to the Government on the options for the policy framework after 2006. It is now 2006 and there is not much sign of a framework. The Government have not said whether the social network payment will extend beyond 2008. They have not said whether Post Office Ltd will have its current duty to prevent avoidable closures in rural areas extended beyond March 2006. We are now told that after 2010 there will be no Post Office card accounts and that everyone should have realised from day one that that was the deal. Even worse, three pilot schemes have been introduced this year out of the blue, as hon. Members made clear, with no consultation and, as the hon. Member for Leeds, East said, without Parliament being properly informed.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/8">The pilot schemes are likely to have the effect of ensuring that well before 2010 a large number of Post Office account holders will have their accounts closed, 35,000 existing customers will receive a letter from the DWP asking for their account details, 3,000 new benefit claimants will not have a right to open a Post Office card account, and 2,500 existing customers will unilaterally be told that their payments must be paid into a bank account and not an existing Post Office card account. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1957" name="Robert Smith">the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> said, all that echoes the rather high-handed, bullying tactics deployed by the Department when the order books were phased out.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/9">Post Office card accounts are very popular and more than 4.5 million people use them. Some do so purely to support their local post office, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> said in a powerful observation. In other cases, as Age Concern's director general made clear, people opened Post Office card accounts because it was</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/10" class="indent">&quot;easier for older people without a bank account to receive their cash securely without the fear of becoming overdrawn or paying extra charges.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/11">That was the beauty of that simple, straightforward account. Many pensioners who did not have traditional bank accounts found that even basic bank accounts did not meet their needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/12">The paper from Citizens Advice on banking benefits makes it clear that basic bank accounts are not a panacea. There may be difficulties getting a credit score to obtain eligibility for such an account. There may be problems with identification documents and the length of time it takes to open an account. Pensioners in my constituency said that they did not want a basic bank account because they would be bombarded with banking bumph trying to sell them things that they did not want. That put them off the whole idea of getting involved with the basic bank current account system with Barclays or any high street bank. Those are reasons why the Post Office card account was the choice of so many people.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/13">We have heard that the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters was not told when the Post Office card account was created that it would be a temporary contract or that it might end in 2010. Most of us&mdash;the Minister is the exception&mdash;agree that that is the case. There was never a clear statement that the account would go beyond 2010, but nor was there a statement that it would not. In the Government's response to the Trade and Industry Committee's report, &quot;People, Pensions and Post Offices&quot;, in September 2003, they said:</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/14" class="indent">&quot;This is the first year of a seven-year contract and it is too early to speculate about what might happen in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/15">I took the trouble of listening to the Minister on that great programme, &quot;Moneybox&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-21">21 January</phrase>. You may think that I should get out more, Mr. Bercow, but it is a very good programme. It disclosed a lot of information and the Minister said of the contract for card accounts:</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Well, they were always an interim arrangement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/17">Paul Lewis, the interviewer, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/18" class="indent">&quot;Well you say it was always intended&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/19">to be interim</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/20" class="indent">&quot;but I asked your office for any evidence from 2000 to 2003. They couldn't produce any.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/21">The Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/22" class="indent">&quot;It's always been in the contract. Now we didn't speak publicly about the contract for commercial reasons.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/23">The Government are speaking publicly now, but it is a bit late. It really is unacceptable for the Minister to say that people knew about the interim nature of the account. How on earth could they have known something that was stated in a contract that nobody could see or know about for commercial reasons, as the Minister said on the radio? Such logic is usually found in the pages of &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/24">The Minister tried to get out of the hole he had dug for himself by saying that there are four years left on the contract and that the Government would now start helping people in a sensitive way to migrate to other accounts. The Minister talks about new accounts that will be developed by Post Office Ltd. That sounds fine, but, unfortunately, the sub-postmasters in my Suffolk constituency to whom I have spoken know only that they have no chance of planning their business for the long term. They fear that the pilots will be extended and that they will drive people away from POCAs long before 2010, with a commensurate loss of subsidy to urban and rural post offices. It is for that reason that the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters referred to the DWP tactics as underhand. I believe that there is another word for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/25">Direct payments removed more than &pound;400 million of annual revenue from the post office network. Not coincidentally, that move resulted in the closure of 2,500 post offices. The announcement of the termination of the POCA in 2010&mdash;in effect, before 2010, for the reasons that I gave&mdash;will be a further grievous blow to post offices. They will lose income; it is as simple as that. If post offices close, not only will pensioners stop accessing benefits and pensions through the POCA, but no one will be able to access money from basic bank accounts, or any bank account, because there will be nothing at all in the village, settlement or suburb.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/26">In conclusion, we need an urgent review of the future of the POCA and the strategy for the post office network. First, it would be useful to know on what basis the Government say that it costs &pound;1 a time to pay pensions or benefits on the POCA, compared with 1p on a traditional bank account. Sub-postmasters get about 15p for every &pound;100 withdrawn from a POCA, but no one seems to know what the remainder of the money is or whether it is a subsidy that the Government will continue in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/27">Secondly, we need a clear indication from the Minister today that he has spoken to his colleagues at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the DTI about doing a cost-benefit analysis of the overall cost to the whole of Government should the change go through and lead to closures of post offices. My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire also made this point. What about the loss of jobs? More than 14,500 sub-post offices employ more than four people, many of them part-time. What will happen to them, and what will be the social and economic costs of those job losses?</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/28">I conclude by quoting the words of Sally Reeves, who is an NFSP representative in East Anglia and the sub-postmistress of the excellent Stowupland post office in my constituency. She stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/29" class="indent">&quot;If you listen to the DTI and what they are saying about Government investment you want to give them credit for that. But when you hear the DWP talking about the scrapping of the post office card account . . . you ask yourself 'whatever happened to joined up government?'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.490.0/30">Perhaps the Minister can tell us.</p>

	<p pid="b.493.0/1">I congratulate you, Mr. Bercow, on your impartial chairing of this debate, given your signature on the early-day motion. I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> on securing this debate on the Government contract for the Post Office card account. Let me also thank the other Members who spoke: <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" name="Alan Reid">the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1692" name="Nia Griffith">the Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith)</phrase>, and the hon. Members for Angus (Mr. Weir), for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) and for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), all of whom have made points that I certainly expected to hear, precisely because there has been a great deal of misleading coverage and comment about the issue over the past few weeks. This debate gives me an opportunity&mdash;I know that hon. Members are waiting for me to use it&mdash;to give what I hope will be some reassurances about what is actually happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.493.0/2">People have been claiming that the end of funding for the Post Office card account will lead to the closure of thousands of Post Office branches, as I have heard again this afternoon; that people will no longer be able to get their benefit or pension at the post office, as I believe has been repeated this afternoon; and that we at the Department for Work and Pensions have in some way gone back on commitments on the Post Office card account. None of those things is true, so I am pleased to be able to put the record straight today.</p>
	<p pid="b.493.0/3">Government funding for the Post Office card account will continue until March 2010, as was always going to be the case. All existing Post Office card account customers will still be able to use the post office to collect their benefit or pension, if they wish to, by using other accounts that are already available or that are likely to become available in the future. There is no reason why the viability of post offices should be threatened if customers continue to draw cash at the post office after moving on from the Post Office card account.</p>
	<p pid="b.493.0/4">Many hon. Members spoke up on behalf of their local sub-postmasters or sub-postmistresses, all of whom have been reported to have expressed shock, dismay or surprise at what is happening, but that needs to be offset against what their national conference was told last year by Tricia Jenkins, the national president of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters. She said:</p>
	<p pid="b.493.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The post office card account does indeed have a limited life. When it finishes, we hope to convert existing POCA customers into using another Post Office Ltd. service. It could be that because POCA customers are used to banking, they might be prepared to switch to a bank account. And since we can offer a banking service, we would like to think we can keep those customers. So it is 'all change' in 2010, but it will not necessarily be all bad news.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.493.0/6">That is the president of the federation speaking.</p>
	<p pid="b.493.0/7">The POCA was introduced in April 2003 to help support some customers in the conversion from having their benefit or pension paid by order book to having it paid into an account by direct payment. The card account was aimed at those who did not already have a suitable account, and was designed as a stepping stone to help people who had not used a bank account to get used to banking before moving on to an account offering more features. It was intended that people's money would be paid into a card account for a period before they moved on to a more suitable account.</p>

If, when my Department was accused of putting up all sorts of barriers to discourage people from taking up a Post Office card account, we had been actively saying, &quot;Of course, it's a temporary arrangement,&quot; that would have been interpreted as yet another barrier to discourage people from taking up the account. The circumstances in which the account was introduced were perfectly clear. I set that position out; it was in the contract and was stated at the time.

	<p pid="b.496.0/1">The Minister says that the circumstances were perfectly clear in the contract, but there is no way that they were perfectly clear to the customer taking out a card account. In fact, the Minister is saying that the Government did not want to tell the customer, because we would have spotted them telling the customer and would have been alerted to what the Government were trying to do. Does he recognise that, in a sense, all our constituents with Post Office card accounts have been mis-sold a product? It was not made clear to them that the contract said that the account was only a temporary phenomenon, and that they were going to lose it.</p>

The reality is that discussions commenced with the Post Office last summer, in a manner entirely consistent with the contract that it signed. Both parties began to explore the options as to how would that migration process would be begun. The Post Office was fully part of the early discussions, which, incidentally, led to the pilots now taking place, because both parties were doing what they were obliged to do under the contract that had been signed.

	<p pid="b.498.1/2">As this debate has been restricted to half an hour, we need to consider the possibility of further debates on this fairly important issue.

	<p pid="b.498.3/2">Perhaps we took our eye off the ball as far as the detail of the Scotland Act 1998 was concerned, certainly as regards the representation of Members and the form of election. I, for one, made a fundamental error in not objecting at the time to the form of election proposed for that Parliament. I would not say that we were hoodwinked, but it was damn near. There is what I see as a major problem. We are in a crazy situation. In Ayrshire, for instance, there are some 21 added list Members and five constituency Members, so 26 Members of the Scottish Parliament represent the people of Ayrshire. In many instances, they all turn up at the same event, particularly events to do with the health board, and that is just madness.</p>

	<p pid="b.498.4/1">Will my hon. Friend bear it in mind that many of us share his concerns about the detail of the Scottish Parliament's electoral system? Nevertheless, we want to make sure that we do not undermine the great work carried out by the Scottish Constitutional Convention between 1989 and 1997. That came up with the additional Member system.

	<p pid="b.498.5/1">I agree in part, and I will come to that point later.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.5/2">Six years on from the 1998 Act, the Parliament is in place, and some good decisions have been made in it. However, there is absolutely no doubt that there were problems, and they were identified by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State; otherwise, there would not have been an Arbuthnott report, and a commission would not have been set up to examine how things were being undertaken. Given the composition of the commission&mdash;the 11 good men and true&mdash;I had a very bad feeling about what was likely to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.5/3">Our consideration of this matter is overdue. It is interesting that yesterday in the Scottish Affairs Committee most of the questions being asked by Committee members were on a narrow party line. The Labour party has given away power, including a major part of its ability to undertake things. It must be the only party that I have known in my political life to have given such power to its political opponents. I cannot believe that that was ever intended&mdash;it certainly would not have been so, had I more foresight in terms of how things are structured.</p>

	<p pid="b.499.3/1">I am sorry, but that is the very point that I am making. That is an example of a Member from the Scottish National party developing an argument along his party lines. That is the problem with the Scotland Act 1998, as it turned out.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.3/2">It could be argued that the genie is out of the bottle and it is the most difficult thing in the world to get it back in&mdash;it will take a genius to do it. However, it has to be done in the context of what the Arbuthnott report has released, which is open to debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.3/3">Last year I visited New Zealand, where I saw proportional representation, which has operated for some time, at first hand. Talking to all the parties involved&mdash;it is like a rainbow&mdash;and seeing how the Government operate in such circumstances, took me back 25 years to my days in the trade union movement, when we did all our business in smoke-filled rooms. Of course, after yesterday we will not be bothered with smoke-filled rooms. The decisions are all hatched behind closed doors and I do not think that that is good for democracy. On the basis of what I saw, there is no doubt that the tail is wagging the dog as far as the representation in that forum is concerned. That is not good for democracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.3/4">I could go on about boundaries, the number of MSPs that are required to do the job and what needs to be changed. However, although we talk a lot about this issue, the public are not really interested. I can tell hon. Members that I know for a fact that the number of people voting, not only in Central Ayrshire, but right across Scotland, is diminishing by the year as a result of all the complication. This needs to be looked at.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.3/5">The public are interested in having somebody that they recognise and know as the representative for whom they voted&mdash;and in whom they will continue to have confidence&mdash;being able to do the job for them. The public are not, in many instances, voting for the party pack that is on an added list; they are voting for the individual. From my experience of the system that is operating, we are seeing that for ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.3/6">What is the answer? I have thought about this long and hard and have come to the conclusion that we must give the people the choice. The report by Arbuthnott is called &quot;Putting Citizens First&quot;. Well, let us put them first and give them the opportunity to determine for themselves what voting system they want. I suggest that the Minister thinks carefully about having a referendum in Scotland, so that we overcome the situation with four different voting systems, which will confuse people.</p>

	<p pid="b.501.2/2">I suggest that the Minister takes away the idea of the referendum, which has to be looked at, rather than giving us an instant answer, and considers it on the basis of the report from Arbuthnott and the commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.2/3">Finally, I want to know the Minister's views on the report. I understand, from questions asked in the Scottish Affairs Committee yesterday, that the Committee has had nothing more than acknowledgement of the receipt of the report.

	<p pid="b.501.3/1">It is always a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow. I ascribe my membership of the House in part to the sterling work that you did on a certain Bill a long time ago, although whether other hon. Members regard that as your finest moment, I am not entirely sure.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.3/2">I obviously begin by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" name="Brian H Donohoe">the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase> on securing this debate on a publication that is still relatively hot off the press. However, he was beaten to it by our noble Friend Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, who managed to initiate a debate on the findings of the Arbuthnott commission's report at exactly the same time as Sir John was unveiling it at a press conference in Scotland. There must be something in the Ayrshire water to produce such prescient and astute politicians. I shall try to respond to the various points that other hon. Members raised and undertake to write in answer to the questions that I do not address.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.3/3">My hon. Friend asked two specific questions and a more general one about the Government's response. Let me deal with those questions straight off the bat. He said that there had not been a Scottish Grand Committee since November 2003. As far as I am aware, there have been no requests for a Scottish Grand Committee since then. Such matters are dealt with through the usual channels. I am not, nor have I ever been, one of the usual channels. However, it is within the right of any Scottish Member of Parliament to request a Scottish Grand Committee, and it is then up to the usual channels to allocate one. The fact that there has not been a Scottish Grand Committee for some time does not meant that the Government are preventing them, but that no one has requested one hitherto.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.3/4">My hon. Friend asked a straight question about whether the Government are considering holding a referendum. Let me say clearly&mdash;I know that this will come as a crushing blow to him&mdash;that the Government have no plans for such a referendum.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.3/5">My hon. Friend asked in more general terms about the Government's initial response to the analysis and proposals in the Arbuthnott commission's report. My answer to that will form the bulk of my response, but first I shall reiterate the welcome that the Secretary of State gave to the report on the day of publication. I thank Sir John and the members of the commission for the time and effort that they put into producing the report, which forms the substance of this debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.502.2/1">Does my hon. Friend understand that at least part of the disappointment that our hon. and right hon. Friends share about the Arbuthnott commission's conclusions is based not on getting the wrong answer&mdash;as Opposition Members might say&mdash;but on the fact that the commission seems to have rejected much of the evidence that was submitted to it, particularly by its focus groups? Does he understand that that is why many of us feel that the whole exercise was something of a waste of resources?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.502.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1994" speakername="David Cairns" colnum="502"  time="016:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h04.htm#60215h04_spnew21">
	<p pid="b.502.3/1">One of the things that we should pay tribute to the commission for is the fact that it published a large amount of the evidence on its website. The commission published the findings of the focus groups and of the surveys that it conducted. It is for any member of the public or Member of Parliament to balance what was in the evidence with what comes out of the report, and my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire has drawn his conclusions. The way in which the commission collected the evidence and disseminated it on the website redounds to its credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.3/2">As the Secretary of State said on the day of the report's publication and in response to oral questions in the House, the report contains a number of interesting recommendations. There is now an opportunity for full consideration and debate on the proposals. That is why I welcome this afternoon's debate and the chance to hear hon. Members' thoughts. The report makes 24 recommendations. Some are for the Government to consider, while others are for the Scottish Executive and the Electoral Commission. I will restrict my comments to the proposals that are for this House to determine.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.3/3">The recommendations are varied in scope and content. While some will attract universal support, such as those relating to the importance of educating voters and increasing turnout, others simply will not. That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has already made two things clear. First, if the Government decide to make any legislative changes in response to the report, they cannot be made before the Holyrood election in 2007. Developments are already under way for the 2007 poll, which will see the introduction of the single transferable vote on local government and the possibility of electronic counting of votes.</p>

	<p pid="b.503.0/1">Has the Minister therefore rejected the commission's conclusion that the local government elections should be separated from the Scottish elections?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.503.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1994" speakername="David Cairns" colnum="503"  time="016:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h04.htm#60215h04_spnew23">
	<p pid="b.503.1/1">That was the second of the two things that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made clear. Let me stick with the first one for a second. We say that it will not be possible to make changes in advance of a poll that is little more than a year away because the local government vote will be done by STV, which will require considerable attention, given that it will be the first time that it has been done. Electronic vote counting might be a possibility, as my hon. Friend is aware. The Electoral Administration Bill, which is working its way through Parliament at the moment, will have an impact on the way in which the run-up to that poll is carried out, and we are likely to promote secondary legislation to improve other aspects of electoral administration. Taking everything together, I do not think that there is any prospect of our legislating to change the system by 2007. In fact, we are not in a position to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.503.1/2">Secondly&mdash;this brings me to the point that my hon. Friend asked about&mdash;in response to the report's call for the decombining of the Holyrood and local government elections, which he mentioned, the Secretary of State has confirmed that we have no plans to open up the Scotland Act 1998 to adjust the timing of the Scottish parliamentary elections. Of course, the timing of the local government elections is a matter for the Scottish Executive. However, I can tell my hon. Friend that since report was published, the First Minister has made it clear that the date of the local government elections in Scotland will not be changed, and the relevant legislation will remain in place.</p>

	<p pid="b.503.2/1">On the generality of the Arbuthnott commission report, does the Minister recognise that in the few weeks since it was released, there has been an attempt to look top-down at the findings of the commission, and even to disparage some of its members? Will he go on record to say that he recognises that the committee went about its business assiduously and professionally? Its consultation was wide and varied and it came up with the proper conclusions in the light of the evidence that was presented to it.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15b.503.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1994" speakername="David Cairns" colnum="503"  time="016:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060215/halltext/60215h04.htm#60215h04_spnew25">
	<p pid="b.503.3/1">I am more than happy to pay tribute to the committee and the commission for the work that they did. I did so during the Adjournment debate secured in November by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">the Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase>, and I am happy to do so again. I have absolute confidence that the commission went about the report in a professional way, and with integrity.</p>
	<p pid="b.503.3/2">That is not to say that its recommendations command universal support. They do not, and I shall come to that. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> points across the House, but Sir John explicitly rules out, for the time being, the extension of STV, which I understand is his party's policy, so he would not be particularly overwhelmed with joy about that recommendation. I am happy to pay tribute to the report, but there is no escaping the fact that it has not commanded overwhelming support. I have not made any attempt to disparage the report and I have done nothing but praise the integrity of those who carried it out. At the same time, however, it is incumbent on me to point out that there is no consensus how we should proceed.</p>
	<p pid="b.503.3/3">Let me return for a second to the business of decombining the elections, which is not a bureaucratic or procedural point. There is a belief, which I share, that combining the elections is one means of seeking to maximise turnout. My hon. Friend said that he thought that turnout was decreasing because of the complexity of elections. That point has been made by others on other occasions. In the most recent elections, we have seen a reversal in the decrease in turnout, and the figures beginning to go up. That has happened in general elections, and it occurred in the by-election in Dunfermline, which had a very respectable turnout. I shall say no more about it, but the turnout was respectable, which gave me something positive to say when I was interviewed on television that night, other than how nice the weather was. We continue to believe that having the elections on the same day is one way of maximising turnout.</p>

	<p pid="b.504.1/1">Any local authority or electoral returning officer can always come forward to the Government with proposals to pilot such schemes. I think that in the May 2006 local elections in England, there will be about 16 pilots, which will include systems such as voting in supermarkets. However, I add the large caveat that the election in question is the first being done under STV, which is complicated to administer. Obviously, we must make it as simple as possible for people to vote, so we might not see an enormous amount of innovation this time around, but local authorities&mdash;and valuation joint boards in Scotland&mdash;might put forward different voting options. We will see that in the local elections in England in a few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.1/2">It is clear from this short debate that there are strongly held views on the commission's recommendations on voting systems and boundary matters. It is also clear that those strikingly divergent views do not come together in a consensus about the electoral process or boundary patterns. After considerable consideration of the STV system's merits, Sir John explicitly ruled out extending it to the election of Members to the Scottish Parliament at present. Some hon. Members will welcome that aspect of the report, but others will find it disappointing, as they have advocated that approach for many years.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.1/3">We have not heard a lot about this in today's debate, but the report does not promote coterminous boundaries between Holyrood and Westminster constituencies. It says that they are &quot;desirable but not essential&quot;. It was, in part, anxieties about the implications of having non-coterminous boundaries that led to the creation of the commission in the first place. Some hon. Members will welcome that conclusion, while others will not.</p>

	<p pid="b.505.0/1">If my hon. Friend the Minister had been privy to the discussion yesterday in the Scottish Affairs Committee, he would have heard that the commission was excluded from even considering having one Member of the Scottish Parliament to one Westminster seat.

	<p pid="b.505.1/1">No, I do not accept that the report is flawed because of that. There is some contention&mdash;I know that this was aired in the Select Committee&mdash;about whether the committee had too narrow an interpretation of its remit because it respected the essential nature of the devolution settlement, which has a proportional element. However, it is not valid to claim that the Arbuthnott report is fundamentally flawed. An element of proportional representation is an essential feature in it, but there are ways of delivering an element of proportionality in the system other than the recommendations that Sir John made.</p>
	<p pid="b.505.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire is, of course, the eponymous creator of the Donohoe solution, as history will record it. The commission examines that solution in pages 12 to 15 of its report, but does not support it. I appreciate that that is a disappointment to him, although it might please others.</p>
	<p pid="b.505.1/3">This debate has illustrated that there is simply no consensus on how to proceed. That is why I think it sensible to take some time to seek consensus, although that might not be possible as unanimity is rarely possible in these matters. When it comes to the very essence of democracy and how we go about electing those who govern us, it is incumbent on us to seek the broadest possible consensus, as we did with the Electoral Administration Bill that is making its way through Parliament, which is a broadly consensual Bill. We should therefore take our time in responding to the report. We should listen to what hon. Members have to say, but on the understanding that there is clearly no consensus on how to proceed.</p>

Modern terrorism means mass casualties, as we saw on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-11">11 September</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July</phrase>. We are exposed to an unprecedented threat of suicide attacks on innocent civilians using sophisticated technology and techniques.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.506.1/4">The concern is that the United States and, by implication, the United Kingdom, by acts of omission and commission, in pursuing what in policy shorthand is now called the war on terror, has turned a blind eye to the use of torture if the wider ends are considered acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.506.1/5">In giving evidence to the House of Representatives and the US Senate Committee on Intelligence, Cofer Black, a former chief of the counter-terrorist centre of the CIA, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.506.1/6" class="indent">&quot;there was a before 9/11 and there was an after 9/11. After 9/11 the gloves came off.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.506.1/7">The concern among many is that that is shorthand simply for the ends justifying the means. That is not a new dilemma in the history of civilisation or our nation's history. Sir William Holdsworth, in his &quot;History of English Law&quot;, observed:</p>
	<p pid="b.506.1/8" class="indent">&quot;We have seen that the use of torture, though illegal by the common law, was justified by virtue of the extraordinary power of the crown which could, in times of emergency, override the common law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.506.1/9">Indeed, one of the first acts of the Long Parliament in 1640, at the time of the civil war, was to abolish the court of Star Chamber, where torture evidence had been received.</p>
	<p pid="b.506.1/10">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-05">5 December</phrase>, US Secretary of State Rice, commenting on US policy on rendition, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.506.1/11" class="indent">&quot;it is the policy of the United States . . . to comply with its laws and comply with its treaty obligations, including those under the Convention Against Torture.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.506.1/12">The Foreign Secretary issued a statement the same day&mdash;they were doubtless choreographed&mdash;which sought to set out the UK Government's position on rendition but did no more than to repeat and reassert the position of the Government of the United States. The Foreign Secretary said&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.506.4/1">As I was saying before the Division, the Foreign Secretary said on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-05">5 December</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.506.4/2" class="indent">&quot;Secretary Rice's reply makes clear that US policy is to comply with the UN Convention Against Torture, and in this respect the United States Government complies with its constitution, its laws and its Treaty obligations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.506.4/3">As a statement, that does not really tell us anything more about the position of the UK Government, and as a memorandum from the Foreign Secretary's private office to the Prime Minister two days later, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-07">7 December</phrase>, which was subsequently leaked and published by the <i>New Statesman,</i> makes clear, this minimalist approach was clearly deliberate:</p>
	<p pid="b.506.4/4" class="indent">&quot;as far as possible,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.506.4/5">said the FCO memo,</p>
	<p pid="b.506.4/6" class="indent">&quot;we should stick to the terms of the Foreign Secretary's statement in response to Rice's.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.506.4/7">Even a casual glance at the Foreign Secretary's statement will show that it was not &quot;in response to&quot;; it was simply an unconditional, unquestioned adoption of the US position without qualification or reservation of any kind. It is this which causes Members on all sides of the House, and very many people outside Parliament, real anxiety</p>
	<p pid="b.506.4/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase> has established the all-party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition. It is an indication of the concern in the House about the issue that the group already has more than 50 Members of Parliament, and its vice-chairmen include the acting leader of the Liberal party, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1984" name="Menzies Campbell">the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase>, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" name="Chris Mullin">the hon.

	<p pid="b.507.2/1">I was quoting Professor Crawford's opinion, which was commissioned by the all-party parliamentary group and published in December. It is entitled &quot;Extraordinary rendition of terrorist suspects through the United Kingdom&quot;, and states that</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/2" class="indent">&quot;the United Kingdom is bound by its own obligations in respect of torture, and not by any view taken by the United States as to what constitutes torture . . . Under international law, States are prohibited from sending a person to a territory where it is believed that he will be tortured. This obligation . . . arises both under general international law and under international treaties to which the United Kingdom is a party.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/3">Professor Crawford went on to observe:</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The United States ratified the Torture Convention with an extensive reservation dealing with various aspects of the application of the Convention in United States law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/5">Therefore, it is not sufficient for the UK Government simply to seek cover from Secretary Rice's assurances. The test in the UK is not the US implied test of whether the risk of torture is more likely than not, but whether there is a real risk that a person would be tortured if returned.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/6">Moreover, it seems reckless of the UK Government to accept US assurances without reservation or questioning when we have all witnessed the way in which the US Government have operated Guantanamo Bay, whose procedures and presence offend every principle of international jurisprudence.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/7">I understand that the officials who prepared the Minister's briefing in response to this debate are from the Foreign Office's counter-terrorism department. They cannot be insensitive to the fact that Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld approved 24 interrogation techniques for use at Guantanamo Bay. In an article entitled &quot;US Abuse of Iraqi Detainees at Abu Ghraib Prison&quot; in the <i>American Journal of International Law, </i>Tom Farrer observes that the techniques are aimed at</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/8" class="indent">&quot;significantly increasing the fear level in a detainee&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/9">and</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/10" class="indent">&quot;attacking or insulting the ego of a detainee&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/11">It is clear beyond peradventure that the US Government have engaged in cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, both at Abu Ghraib and at Guantanamo Bay, yet they claim that that treatment does not amount to torture. The UK Government should not be associated with those semantics.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/12">In last month's edition of &quot;International Affairs&quot;, the journal of Chatham House, Alex Bellamy, who is a lecturer in peace and conflict studies at the university of Queensland and recently wrote a book called &quot;Just Wars&quot; and is an expert in that area of policy, observed that</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/13" class="indent">&quot;there is a significant amount of circumstantial evidence to suggest use of torture by the US and some of its allies in the war on terror is both widespread and systematic . . . a coordinated strategy of information gathering, based on torture&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/14">Bellamy went on to observe that</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/15" class="indent">&quot;there is evidence to suggest that successive US Attorney Generals have attempted to create a permissive legal environment for the use of torture . . . the current Attorney General, Roberto Gonzales, played a key role as White House Legal Counsel in sidelining the State Department's concerns about the use of torture. In a memorandum to the President on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-25">25 January 2002</phrase>, Gonzales argued that:</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/16" class="indent">'The nature of the new war on terrorism places a high premium on other factors, such as the ability to quickly obtain information from captured terrorists and their sponsors and in order to avoid further atrocities against American civilians. This new paradigm renders obsolete (the 1949 Geneva Protocol on the Treatment of Prisoners of War) strict limitations on questioning of any prisoners'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/17">Clearly, the United States has decided to abandon respect for international law. Indeed, President Bush clearly stated that in 2003 when he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/18" class="indent">&quot;International Law? I better call my lawyer . . . I don't know what you are talking about by International Law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/19">The issue for the House is whether the United Kingdom Government have also decided to abandon the principles of international law. Once torture becomes accepted in any legal system, it spreads like an infectious disease. It saves the labour of investigation and hardens those who become accustomed to its use. The Foreign Affairs Committee has accused the Government of failing to deal with its questions on rendition with appropriate transparency and accountability and has recommended that the Government end their policy of what the Committee described as &quot;obfuscation&quot;. Such behaviour by the Government raises the question of what they think they have to hide.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/20">The matters that I am talking about clearly need proper explanation. For example, minutes of the meeting between US justice officials and EU officials in January 2003 show that</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/21" class="indent">&quot;both sides agreed on . . . increased use of European Transit facilities to support the return of criminal/inadmissible aliens . . . and improving cooperation in removals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/22">Ministers seem to suggest that such allegations are without foundation, so why did the legal affairs committee of the Council of Europe publish, a matter of weeks ago, a report that concluded that</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/23" class="indent">&quot;drawing on all this concordant information and evidence we can say that there is a great deal of coherent convergent evidence pointing to the existence of 'relocation' or 'outsourcing' of torture. Acts of torture or severe violation of a detainee's dignity through the administration of inhuman or degrading treatment are carried out outside national territory and beyond the authority of the national intelligence services&quot; ?</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/24">Those are the conclusions of a committee of elected representatives drawn from throughout Europe, reflecting the whole range of political views.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/25">Former CIA agent Robert Baer was quoted by the BBC as saying that</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/26" class="indent">&quot;if you want a serious interrogation you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want him to be tortured you send him to Syria. If you want him to disappear . . . then you send him to Egypt&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/27">Does the Foreign Office consider that he was fantasising? Was a former British ambassador to Syria, Henry Hogger, making things up when in December, commenting on the case of Mahrar Arar, a Canadian citizen who was taken to Syria and tortured, he observed that</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/28" class="indent">&quot;what was going on in Syria at the time was not unlike the way it has been described&quot; ?</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/29">When Craig Murray, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, published on the internet copies of telegrams that he sent to London between 2002 and 2004, warning that information being passed on by the Uzbek security services was &quot;torture tainted&quot;, was he fantasising? Mr. Murray also published on the internet a document that clearly appears to be the text of a Foreign Office legal opinion seeking to argue that the use by intelligence services of information extracted through torture is not a violation of the UN convention against torture.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/30">Perhaps it was a similar approach to information extracted through torture that caused the Government to contest the assertion that the Special Immigration Appeals Commission should not receive evidence that has or may have been procured by torture inflicted by officials of a foreign state in order to obtain evidence. The judgment of the House of Lords, given on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-08">8 December</phrase> in the case of A (FC) and others v. the Secretary of State for the Home Department, should be required reading for every Member of the House and every Minister. The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, comprising Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Hoffman, Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, Lord Carswell and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, unanimously found against the Government. It is difficult to imagine a stronger representation by the Appellate Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/31">Lord Bingham observed that</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/32" class="indent">&quot;the English common law has regarded torture and its fruits with abhorrence for over 500 years . . . I am startled, even a little dismayed, at the suggestion . . . that this deeply-rooted tradition and an international obligation solemnly and explicitly undertaken can be overridden . . . The issue is one of constitutional principle, whether evidence obtained by torturing another human being may lawfully be admitted against a party to proceedings in a British court . . . To that question I would give a very clear negative answer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/33">Lords Nicholls said:</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/34" class="indent">&quot;Torture is not acceptable. This is a bedrock moral principle in this country. For centuries, the common law has set its face against torture . . . Torture attracts universal condemnation . . . No civilised society condones its use. Unhappily, condemnatory words are not always matched by conduct.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/35">Lord Hoffman said:</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/36" class="indent">&quot;The use of torture is dishonourable. It corrupts and degrades the state which uses it and the legal system which accepts it . . . many people in the United States . . . have felt their country dishonoured by its use of torture outside the jurisdiction and its practice of extra-legal &quot;rendition&quot; of suspects to countries where they would be tortured . . . the rejection of torture . . . has a special iconic importance as the touchstone of a humane and civilised legal system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/37">If a member of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords feels confident to say in terms in a judgment in a landmark case on torture, res judicata, that</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/38" class="indent">&quot;many people in the United States . . . have felt their country dishonoured by its use of torture outside the jurisdiction and its practice of extra-legal 'rendition&quot; of suspects'&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/39">can Ministers be surprised that hon. Members on both sides of this House and large numbers of people outside it are less than convinced when the Foreign Secretary simply repeats the mantra of the US Secretary of State that that country does not indulge in torture?</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/40">Lord Hope observed:</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/41" class="indent">&quot;Views as to where the line is to be drawn may differ sharply from state to state. This can be seen from the list of practices authorised for use in Guantanamo Bay by the US authorities, some of which would shock the conscience if they were ever to be authorised for use in our own country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/42">It must be of very real concern that at the start of the 21st century it is necessary for the most senior judges in the land to express the view put simply by Lord Brown:</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/43" class="indent">&quot;Torture is an unqualified evil. It can never be justified. Rather it must always be punished.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/44">There have been other recent cases in respect of which the Government's approach has been equivocal. There was the judgment on the torture and killing of Iraqis by British forces, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-22">22 December</phrase>. The Government argued unsuccessfully in respect of the right to rely on evidence extracted under torture and to be exempt from liability for torture carried out by British troops outside the UK. There is also the case of Mitchell and others <i>v. </i>Al-Dali and others. I will not say too much about that case. It has been before the Court of Appeal and I understand that it is going to the House of Lords, so it is almost certainly sub judice, but what is not sub judice but is a matter of public record is the letter of Geoffrey Bindman published in <i>The Guardian</i>. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/45" class="indent">&quot;My clients . . . seek redress against the officials responsible for torturing them in Saudi Arabia. Our Government intervened unsuccessfully in the Court of Appeal in support of the Saudi claim to immunity for the Saudi Kingdom and its officials. The Court of Appeal rejected immunity for the officials and the Saudi Kingdom is appealing to the House of Lords. Again, the British Government are seeking to intervene against its own citizens, yet Article 14 of the UN Convention Against Torture, requires every Government 'to ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/46">There are a number of questions that Ministers should answer and of which I have given this Minister notice, so there should be no surprises for him here. In the Foreign Office memo of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-07">7 December</phrase> to No. 10, officials concluded that</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/47" class="indent">&quot;we now cannot say that we have received no such requests for the use of UK territory or air space for extraordinary rendition.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/48">To whom do the Government believe that requests for rendition would be made? How was it that it took the machinery of government some weeks to resolve the line to take on the issue? What representations have the Government made to the US Administration about the practice of extraordinary rendition?</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/49">The US Government have now clearly acknowledged that they have rendered detainees to other countries for questioning; indeed, that practice is now well documented in a number of cases, such as that of Mahrar Arar, which I have already cited, who was kidnapped in Canada. Amnesty International has told me of some 78 Gulfstream V Turbojet flights that have stopped over in the UK since 2001 that could be connected to rendition. One could be walking down the street in any part of the world and be kidnapped. Have the Government asked the US Administration in terms whether, and if so how many, detainees have passed through UK airspace or airports?</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/50">Have the US Administration sought permission for any state flights to pass over UK airspace or land in the UK to transfer detainees? Has any agency in the US Administration, including the CIA, asked for such permission and have the UK Government ever granted a blanket permission for the passage of such flights? That is particularly important because the December memo to No. 10 admits that there is no way of the UK Government knowing whether any detainees captured by British forces in Iraq or Afghanistan have subsequently been transferred by the US to interrogation centres overseas.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/51">Whatever the US Government choose to do, the UK Government have obligations under international law.Have the Government at any time reminded the US Administration of the higher threshold that must be passed in order to meet UK legal obligations with respect to the UN convention against torture? Has an explanation been given that UK law will have been breached if there are grounds to believe that rendition may carry a real risk of torture and that the US interpretation that such rendition will become unlawful if it is &quot;more likely than not&quot; that the person will be tortured is insufficient?</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/52">Let us step back from the carefully phrased denials and examine what we know. Evidence has emerged that makes these concerns plausible: the snatched photos of the cages at Guantanamo and the photographs of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. The existence of secret CIA-run prisons in eastern Europe has not been denied by the Bush Administration. There is compelling testimony from people who claim to have been shipped abroad by the US and tortured. The UK Government have not questioned the definition of torture being used by the US Government, which differs from that set out in international human rights treaties, and appears not to extend to forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The UK Government show no inclination to investigate reports of US aircraft using UK airspace or airports for rendition purposes. Is it out of the bounds of possibility that the US might not have made formal requests for the use of UK airspace for such flights, but carried them out anyway?</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/53">My shopping list of what I would like the Minister to do is short&mdash;only three things. First, given the mounting evidence that UK territory has been used to assist in unlawfully transporting detainees to countries where they may face disappearance, torture or other ill-treatment, the UK Government should launch an immediate, thorough and independent investigation. Secondly, as part of such an investigation, the UK Government should ask the US Government to declare whether they have used UK airports, airspace or US military airbases on UK soil for the purposes of extraordinary rendition since 1998, with or without the approval of the UK authorities. That would include transporting detainees from, to or through UK airspace as well as servicing planes about to embark on or return from a rendition mission. Thirdly, what steps are being taken or considered to prevent future use of airspace and airports in the UK by aircraft being used for such illegal activities?</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/54">Finally, I urge the UK Government to co-operate fully with the parliamentary investigations into the issue and the Council of Europe inquiry led by its secretary-general, Terry Davis, himself a former Labour Member of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.2/55">I submit that the Prime Minister has repeatedly failed to give a straight answer to questions about possible British Government complicity, but seeing nothing, hearing nothing and saying nothing is becoming less and less of an option.</p>

	<p pid="b.512.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Bercow, and I very much welcome the opportunity that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> has given us to debate these issues today.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/2">Human rights form one of the cornerstones of this country's value system and one of the key elements in our country's social and legal structures, informing our policies, legislation, interactions with one another and our relationships with our international partners. The UK unreservedly condemns the use of torture, and is working hard with its international partners to eradicate that abhorrent practice by launching a global campaign for universal ratification of the UN convention against torture, as well as lobbying in support of its optional protocol; publishing and distributing a number of human rights handbooks specifically aimed at combating torture; and supporting anti-torture work by the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe. The UK also used its EU presidency to take forward an EU initiative to combat torture around the world. That included d&eacute;marches in 39 countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/3">The hon. Gentleman made much of allegations about illegal rendition. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has said a number of times to the House, our policy on rendition is clear. We do not deport or extradite any person to another state where there are substantial grounds to believe that that person will face a real risk of torture, or where there is a real risk that the death penalty will be applied. We have found no evidence of detainees being rendered through the UK or overseas territories since <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>. Nor have we found evidence of detainees being rendered through the UK or overseas territories since 1997 where there were substantial grounds to believe that there was a real risk of torture. We would not assist in a rendition if to do so would put us in breach of our national or international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/4">The hon. Gentleman suggests that we have been seeing nothing, hearing nothing and saying nothing. That is not the case. We have addressed the issue with the US Government. As part of our close co-operation with them over several years, including in recent months, we have made it clear to them that we expect them to seek permission to render detainees via UK territory and airspace, including overseas territories. We have made it clear to them that we will grant permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition would accord with UK law and our international obligations, and we have also made it clear to them how we understand our obligations under the UN convention against torture and the European convention on human rights. We are clear that the US would not render a detainee through UK territory or airspace, including overseas territories, without our permission. The US has sought such permission in the past, as the Foreign Secretary has told the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/5">The hon. Gentleman cited the Foreign Affairs Committee's suggestion that the Government have a policy of &quot;obfuscation&quot; on the issue. That could hardly be further from the truth. Preliminary searches of recent records produced no evidence of US requests to use UK airports or airspace. As the search continued back in time, we found four cases in 1998. The Foreign Secretary lost no time in updating the House as new information came to light, and he will continue to do so. The whole world loves a good conspiracy theory and is always reluctant to let the facts get in the way of a good story. The hon. Gentleman suggested that it would seem reckless to accept US assurances. I shall doubtless annoy the cynics by saying that we do indeed accept the assurances of our close ally.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/6">That does not mean that we always agree, however. Indeed, we sometimes differ on matters of policy, and we say so. On Guantanamo Bay, the Prime Minister has stated that he sees it as</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/7" class="indent">&quot;an anomaly that has to end&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/8">We have made it clear that we regard the circumstances in which the detainees continue to be held in Guantanamo Bay as unacceptable, and the US Government are fully aware of our views.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/9">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib. He will recall that US servicemen and women have been disciplined, prosecuted and convicted for what happened there. The US Detainee Treatment Act, which President Bush signed into law on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-30">30 December 2005</phrase>, provides that no individual in the custody of the US Government or under their physical control, regardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which it defines as the cruel, unusual and inhuman treatment or punishment that is prohibited by the US constitution. That legislation makes a matter of statute what President Bush has made clear was already US Government policy, and we welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/10">As for our own laws, the hon. Gentleman suggests that the Government did not welcome the unanimous finding of the House of Lords that evidence that has or may have been procured by torture is not admissible before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. On the contrary, it has never been the Government's intention to present to court evidence that we believe may have been obtained by torture. We believe that that would be wrong. The effect of the judgment was to reinforce that clear policy with an exclusionary rule of law. The Government have welcomed the clarity that their lordships' judgment of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-08">8 December</phrase> has brought to this important and difficult issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/11">The hon. Gentleman also spoke about mounting evidence to indicate that the Government are complicit in cases of extraordinary rendition. He cited the inquiry led by Senator Marty, chair of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly's legal affairs and human rights committee. Senator Marty produced his information memorandum on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase>, which was debated in the Parliamentary Assembly on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January</phrase>. The hon. Gentleman did not report what was said during the debate, in which several British members spoke about the lack of substance and evidence in Senator Marty's reports. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government are co-operating fully with Senator Marty's inquiry, as with the inquiry launched by the secretary-general of the Council of Europe, my good former colleague Terry Davis.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/12">In addition to those inquiries and a temporary committee of inquiry established by the European Parliament, the Government have also been co-operating with the inquiry on rendition allegations co-ordinated by the chief constable of Greater Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/13">The hon. Gentleman suggests that we asked the US Government to make a public declaration. It is not for us to make such a demand of another Government, especially about intelligence and security-related matters. However, I repeat the following points. We have found no record of US requests for rendition through the United Kingdom since May 1997, other than those about which my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has informed the House. We have made it clear to our US colleagues that we expect them to seek permission to render detainees via UK territory and airspace, including overseas territories. We have made it clear that we will grant permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition accords with UK law and our international obligations. We have made it clear how we understand our obligations under the UN convention against torture and the European convention on human rights. We are clear that the US would not render a detainee through UK territory or airspace, including overseas territories, without our permission.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/14">The hon. Gentleman concluded by insisting that the Government have failed to give a straight answer to questions about complicity. I repeat my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary's clear statement of policy: we would not assist in any rendition case if to do so would put us in breach of United Kingdom law or our international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/15" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/16" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at eighteen minutes to Six o'clock.</p>
