<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-14a.297.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" speakername="Kevin Barron" colnum="297"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090514/halltext/90514h0001.htm#09051466000273">
	<p pid="a.297.2/1">May I say how pleased I am to be in Westminster Hall to debate a report from the Select Committee on Health? The last time that we attempted to have such a debate on the Floor of the House, it was knocked down the pecking order by two statements, and we barely had an hour left for it. At least, we have ample time to debate the report and the Government's response today.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/2">Hon. Members might be aware that &quot;High Quality Care For All: NHS Next Stage Review Final Report&quot; was published by the Department of Health on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June 2008</phrase>. That was the latest of many reviews of the national health service. The Department stated that the review was different from others because it was led by an eminent surgeon&mdash;Lord Darzi&mdash;and was the subject of a wide-ranging consultation. For probably the first time, that consultation was not just with NHS managers or senior civil servants, but with clinicians themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/3">I was contacted about the shape of the consultation that took place in my region of Yorkshire and Humber, because people felt that the representatives from the acute sector were too prominent on the original board. That alleged imbalance was put right. Indeed, the Government responded to some people's concerns that the primary sector of health care was not represented and, for the first time, many clinicians were consulted. Will my hon. Friend the Minister say how many were consulted? I am not sure how many clinicians throughout the country were consulted, but doing so was probably a first for the national health service, and is a good thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/4">The report's main focus is on improving the quality of care provided by the NHS. Variations in quality have been known about for a long time. As Lord Darzi acknowledged, those variations continue despite the doubling of NHS expenditure in real terms since 1997. Lord Darzi also believes that, during the past decade, health policy has rightly focused on access and argues that it is now time to improve quality. I will come to our comment about that, but the focus has been on access. Even five years ago, in my constituency, the wait for things such as orthopaedic surgery on knees and hips was years&mdash;not months or weeks, as it is currently. There has been a big move in relation to access, and that is to the credit of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/5">The Committee published its report on the review on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-13">13 January</phrase> this year. We took oral evidence from a wide-range of witnesses, including the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, the British Medical Association, the chief executives of three strategic health authorities, academics and national health service manager representatives. We also held an evidence session with Professor Lord Darzi himself and David Nicholson, who is the chief executive of the NHS. Many of the review's key recommendations have been made in previous reports and White Papers, but, nevertheless, we still welcome the extensive consultation undertaken as part of the review and the emphasis that it places on improving quality throughout the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/6">The Committee's main finding was that there are doubts about the capability of primary care trusts to implement Lord Darzi's recommendations successfully. Despite the Department's world-class commissioning programme, which aims to improve PCT commissioning, the NHS does not afford PCT commissioning sufficient status. As we said in the report, we found that to be &quot;striking&quot; and &quot;depressing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/7">Like most things in the NHS, some aspects of it are good and some are not so good. We cannot sign off any report by saying that commissioning must be present in all aspects of the quality improvements that we would like to see in the NHS. It would have been wrong to come to that conclusion. Some parts of the NHS are quite sensitive about the comments made about the lack of comprehensive commissioning. Indeed, that issue will cost me a couple of hours next Friday morning, when I will meet someone from a national organisation and the chief executive of my local PCT to discuss what they think are some of the report's implications. That is not part of this inquiry; it is just something I am happy to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/8">If the people who I meet in any way think that the evidence that we took was inadequate or we were wrong in our conclusions, I will be more than happy to go along with that. I think that our conclusions on commissioning were well thought through. Perhaps it was a bit emotive to use the words &quot;striking&quot; and &quot;depressing&quot;, but at least we brought the issues forward, so we can further discuss the ability of the NHS overall&mdash;or, indeed, of individual PCTs&mdash;to commission for quality. I will come on to that in a moment, because it is a different issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/9">We are also concerned that the review provides little detail about costs and that it provides many priorities without ranking them. In the NHS, everything is a priority&mdash;if someone is ill, what is wrong with them is a priority. We thought that there should have been some prioritisation in the review. However, it was not surprising that that was not the case, because it has happened in many past reviews.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/10">On quality costs, although Lord Darzi argues that improving quality saves money in the long term, that is not always easy to demonstrate. Of course, if we do not know the costs of these things, it is difficult to demonstrate that. An assumption is being made by Lord Darzi that, if quality is improved in the NHS, costs will be saved. That is a difficult assumption to accept without good and reasonable evidence. Certainly, during the years that I have been on the Health Committee, many of our reports have occasionally commented on the woeful omission of good, cost-effective evidence before decision making takes place. There has also sometimes been a lack of effective clinical evidence, which is something that we clearly need to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/11">The review proposes to seek improvements in quality through better measurement and the provision of financial incentives for providing a high quality of care. We strongly support the principle of using financial incentives, but we recommend that the Department should proceed with caution. Schemes such as advancing quality and PROMs&mdash;patient-recorded outcome measures&mdash;that link the measurement of clinical process and patient outcomes, must be piloted and evaluated rigorously before they are adopted by the wider NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/12">My reading of the NHS, which I truly support as an institution and an organisation that looks after the health of this nation, is that it is equitable in most respects&mdash;although not all. Such a situation has been going on for many years, but not much evaluation is done before things are rolled out, which is one of the reasons why many people who work in the NHS&mdash;as people have done for 60 years&mdash;get somewhat demoralised on occasions, particularly when a missive comes down from Richmond house without much justification other than, &quot;We think that this is a good idea.&quot; It seems that evaluation, knowing what works and piloting good schemes is the way forward in that respect. The evidence should be taken to those parts of the NHS that could do better and we should say, &quot;We'd like you to improve what you're doing on the basis of this evidence, which we have proven works in similar circumstances.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/13">The review also reiterated the Department's plans to create 150 general practitioner-led health centres&mdash;one for each PCT in England. We welcome the provision of additional primary care services and acknowledge that there are strong arguments for increasing provision in under-doctored areas. However, the expansion of supply needs careful management and evaluation to determine whether it leads to better evidence-based medical interventions for patients and whether it reduces the disparities in health care access and utilisation between different classes. I do not want to drift off into our report on health inequalities. It has presumably been sitting on a Minister's desk, but we are expecting the Government's response to it soon. We believe that there should be better evidence-based medical interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.2/14">It should also be recognised that investment in primary care might increase demand for hospital care, as deprived people get better access to care and as referrals increase with more diagnostic tests. That is an interesting concept. If one considers the number of people that the NHS has served over the years at GP or another level, notwithstanding that other health professionals such as pharmacists speak to people about their health needs, even in times of plenty, when unemployment was low&mdash;before the current recession&mdash;there was no lack of attendance at GP surgeries. Just because people are better off financially and perhaps in many other ways, or just feel much better about life, it does not mean that they do not go to the doctor. That is an interesting point. More contact may mean that there will be more referrals to the secondary or hospital sectors.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-14a.300.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-14b.300.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-14a.300.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" speakername="Kevin Barron" colnum="300"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090514/halltext/90514h0001.htm#09051466000275">
	<p pid="a.300.0/1">I shall move on to that. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. This is probably one of the areas about which the Government feel a bit sensitive. Although some PCTs would undoubtedly benefit from more primary care services, particularly those in areas that are under-doctored or that have a high burden of disease, it is less clear how others would benefit. We are not convinced by the Department's argument that all PCTs should have a GP-led health centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/2">Whether a PCT has a centre should be decided locally on a case-by-case basis, as a witness stated, using the best clinical evidence available and a full assessment of the costs and the impact on patient access. PCTs should not make their decisions on a whim. National criteria should be set out to ensure that the benefits and costs of their decisions are known. I and the Committee were disappointed that neither the Government nor the witnesses who appeared before us as representatives of doctors could tell us what criteria should be used to decide whether a PCT needed a GP-led health centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/3">I have no doubt that other Members in this Chamber, like me, might have had in their constituency a campaign run by the medical profession when the proposal was introduced. Before the local government elections last year, I had one doctor from a practice of five&mdash;not all five doctors&mdash;putting out letters saying that people should demonstrate in the ballot box against the proposed changes in primary health care. The letter was about a new primary care health centre in Rotherham that would be open seven days a week for 12 hours a day.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/4">If we look at the disease burden of the three constituencies that cover Rotherham, there is a good case for a centre, in my view&mdash;this is anecdotal, to some extent&mdash;or we can look at the health profiles of the communities, which are not very good in most circumstances. The only things that make the Rotherham and Sheffield health profiles look good for the region are profiles of places such as Hull and Bradford, but they do not look good when the detail of the problems that we have are studied.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/5">I had a public meeting with that doctor and some members of his association locally. I believe that we agreed that it would probably be a good idea to have the new primary care health centre in Rotherham and that there is a need for it. One of the witnesses who was a representative of one of the professions told us that he worked in a part of East Yorkshire that is, by and large, well off. That does not really mean that everyone is in good health. He said that one centre was going into his PCT, but that there was probably an argument that they ought to have two or three in Hull. Given the profile of the city of Hull and the surrounding area, I think that he was probably right.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/6">It was greatly disappointing that the discussions that we had last year, which have ended now&mdash;I am pleased about that&mdash;were based on assumptions and not on any agreed criteria about where centres should go. Decisions should be based, by and large, on the health needs of the population, not on the structures of the NHS. All the members of the Committee felt strongly about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/7">Another area that we looked at&mdash;at this stage, it is a train coming down the track&mdash;is the Department's decision to conduct trials of personal budgets for health care. We welcome those trials if they are done rigorously, and if policy makers wait for the results before beginning any large-scale roll-out of the programme. We would be happy with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/8">One or two members of the Committee received briefings prior to the debate. I want to quote from one that I received from Diabetes UK:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Diabetes UK believes it should be clearly enshrined in legislation that Personal Health Budgets of any kind (notional, third party or direct payments) remain voluntary for pilot schemes and in the event they are rolled out further.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/10">I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Minister has seen the briefing. Diabetes UK goes on to state:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Having a personal budget for the entire care package for a complex, changing and progressive condition such as diabetes, could potentially result in individuals receiving suboptimal clinical care if their budgets run out, or a process of self rationing in order to achieve all desired goals within budget.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/12">I thought I ought to mention that.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/13">I know that my hon. Friend will tell us that the proposals are part of the Health Bill that is in the other place at present&mdash;it has not yet reached us. First, I would like to congratulate the Government on piloting the scheme. I hope that the results will be measured and evaluated properly before the scheme is rolled out.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/14">I thought that I ought to mention what some of the major charities that work with people with long-term conditions feel about that prospect. They are not saying no, but it is clear that we must be careful to ensure that it does not disrupt the needs of people with long-term conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/15">The review also makes several proposals for improving work force planning and the quality of leadership in the NHS. The Committee welcomes the Department's focus on those areas following the severe criticisms in our report, &quot;Workforce Planning&quot;. However, we note concerns that planning will be concentrated in the Department. Strategic health authorities have a key role in work force planning, and we believe that the Department should take steps to ensure that regional NHS employers are given a role in identifying future work force requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/16">When we were doing the work force planning inquiry, we looked at the projections made for the increases in the work force that were very much needed when the Government came to office in 1997. I recall that one of the figures&mdash;this was announced in 2000&mdash;was that we wanted another 20,000 nurses within five years. Within four years, we had 64,000 more nurses in the system&mdash;a 340 per cent. overshoot on what the politicians at the centre predicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/17">The Committee tried to investigate why that happened&mdash;this is in a different report. By and large, it happened because there was little or no strategic planning for the work force inside the NHS. We think that the Department should use the reconfigured SHAs as one way to improve work force planning, and we hope that that will be taken on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/18">We argued that it is unfortunate that the review does not place more emphasis on the importance of recruiting and developing better managers. In many inquiries, the Committee has heard concerns about the quality of management in the NHS, and witnesses to this inquiry echoed those concerns. I am not having a go at management, or saying that managers are not needed. They certainly are needed in our NHS. I know that managers, and the number of them, have often been easy targets for politicians of all parties, but we should be looking at the quality of managers and what they are doing to ensure that patients get better-quality treatment than they have had in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/19">We said:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/20" class="indent">&quot;Some managers lack the analytical skills or motivation to handle and interpret the wide range of performance and routine administrative data, such as Hospital Episode Statistics, that they have to deal with. With the introduction of PROMs and other quality related measures this issue is becoming ever more important. The Department must address the issue of weak management skills in this area with urgency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/21">If we are going to measure the outcome of a patient episode from a quality point of view, as opposed to a quantitative point of view, we need to know how to measure and what we are measuring, and we need to ensure that quality is high on the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/22">The Government response was published in March 2009. They argued that PCT commissioning would be improved through the Department's world-class commissioning, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/23" class="indent">&quot;It is a ground-breaking and ambitious programme that... will help PCTs deliver better services, which are more closely matched to local needs, resulting in better quality of care, improved health and well-being and a reduction in health inequalities across the community.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/24">We have heard similar claims before in such responses.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/25">If my hon. Friend looks at the Government's response to the Committee's inquiry on dental services, he will see that such claims were made at that time, too. The Government also stated that practice-based commissioning would be supported and extended, even though it had not proved popular with many GPs. Is that improving now? I saw some statistics last week that showed that, in respect of the measurement of practice-based commissioning, practices were doing it, but not for everything. There are issues with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/26">The Government also accepted our recommendation that incentive schemes for improving quality, such as PROMs and commissioning for quality and innovation, should be properly trialled and evaluated before their widespread implementation. I understand that, strategically speaking, there is a pilot scheme taking place in your constituency, Mrs. Anderson, in respect of the quality up in the north-west of England. I met the chair of the SHA for the north-west at a gathering and said that I might spend one of my days in the recess not laying on a sunbed in a country off the Indian ocean, but going over the Pennines to have a look to see what is happening with that trial. Although this report is now gone, I have no doubt that hon. Members would be interested in how that SHA is measuring quality, how it proposes to do so and the likely effect of that on other parts of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/27">The Government reiterated their commitment to extending choice and personalisation in health care and said, again, that this would be piloted. I welcomed that earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/28">Subsequently, since those developments, PROMs for hips, knees, hernias and varicose veins have been rolled out from April 2009. We expect that data in relation to those first roll-outs should begin to emerge in late autumn. Does my hon. Friend have a view on that? Are we likely to see data and what type of data will be useful?</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/29">I understand that the Department has put out a tender for PROMs for chronic diseases, so we intend to pilot and roll-out further PROM measures for other conditions. When I became a member of the Health Committee in 2005, I had been actively involved in health care as far as my constituents were concerned since I was first elected to the House, and my general assumption was that the NHS spent most of its money on new hospitals, new theatres in hospitals, new innovations or new drugs of the more expensive kind. For example, we are debating the use of end-of-life cancer drugs and how much more expensive they are. In fact, we spend about 80 per cent. of our money in the NHS on none of those things: we spend it on management of chronic conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/30">Some people have two, three or even four chronic conditions. That is where we spend most of our money, from the taxpayer's point of view. It is right and proper that we should be looking at that area in terms of how PROMs will work. I will welcome the chronic disease pilot when it comes along. If my hon. Friend is still in post&mdash;if I am still in post&mdash;when it comes along, I shall be more than interested, as an individual, to see exactly how something that I hope will manage and improve the quality of health care for people with chronic conditions is being piloted.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/31">We do not yet know how much PROMs will cost and who will be evaluating the large investment in it. I return to something that I must have mentioned at least three times now: a lot of the time we do not know, although we should know exactly, how much things cost. So, I hope that these pilots will teach us something before there is any general roll-out.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/32">We understand that other quality measures are now published, including hospital mortality rates for certain conditions and GP satisfaction surveys. I do not know how clinically accurate those surveys are. However, they are certainly having some influence in my locality in terms of access to local GP surgeries that are not tied into the new centres that are being built. That is a good thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/33">Something hit the press about five weeks ago in my constituency: a surgery was dubbed by regional BBC television as the worst surgery in Britain. That surgery is still using 0800 numbers and nobody can ever get through. There was a massive queue, starting at 8 am, for people to see their GP and, until it appeared on television, if it was raining, people had to stand outside in the rain to get in.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/34">The practice's first reaction was to open the doors at 8 am, which is hardly rocket science. Nevertheless, it has done that, so at least the good people of Dinnington do not have to wait outside in adverse weather conditions. I hope that that practice has put something a bit more practical in place in respect of people phoning and that it is getting rid of a system that makes it difficult for people to get through on the phone when wanting access to their local GP. Out of all the surgeries in my constituency, that is the only one that I have ever had complaints about in terms of access&mdash;and I am going back many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/35">I understand that we have no plans for evaluating CQUIN, although that is going into many commissioning processes throughout the NHS at the moment. I would like to hear the Minister's view on that, if he has a view at this stage. I was at a gathering on Monday down here in London, talking about the NSR, and somebody said&mdash;I should have kept my notes&mdash;&quot;We are collecting the CQUIN data from nine areas. We are not sure what it is intended for at this stage, but we think that if we are collecting data from nine areas, that must be a good thing.&quot; I questioned whether it is a good thing, if the intention in respect of putting CQUIN into current commissioning is not known. Perhaps my hon. Friend will say what the intention is. I do not know what data are being collected, but I was told about this by somebody who works for the NHS in London. It would be useful if we had that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/36">Just prior to the debate, I received a little note from Professor Alan Maynard, from York, who often advises the Health Committee. I often say&mdash;with some truthfulness&mdash;that he tends to appear at Committee sittings more frequently than some Committee members, but that might be a bit unkind. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I see one or two of my hon. Friends smiling. Professor Maynard's note said:</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/37" class="indent">&quot;There are some indications that improving does not always save money&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/38">He said that Lord Darzi's</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/39" class="indent">&quot;contention that improved quality was always cost saving is dodgy&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/40">because people are likely to grab hold of the low-hanging fruit, which they have had a tendency to do for many years. Once of they have got hold of that low-hanging fruit from the lower boughs of the tree, that is taken as evidence that something works. However, the further up the tree they go, the more expensive the fruit might be to get hold of.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/41">Professor Maynard believes that there is no straight read-over and that money might not necessarily be saved. Having said that, that is not the point of the exercise. The point is to put quality rather than quantity on the NHS agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/42">We said in our report that there was no reason why we should not have included quality when we provided quantity during the past decade, but that, by and large, is now a matter for historians to debate. The important point is that what came out of the NSR was an intention to ensure that when our constituents use the NHS, things will not just be done quicker than previously, but the outcome will be clinically better and the quality of that outcome will be measured.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/43">I hope that everyone will understand that, and that those who have a positive view of the NHS and who use it, particularly those who go into hospital, will be able to say in a few years, &quot;It was the best outcome that I could have had,&quot; and not just that it was the quickest outcome or that the nurses and doctors were fine.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-14a.304.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" speakername="Richard Taylor" colnum="304"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090514/halltext/90514h0002.htm#09051466000276">
	<p pid="a.304.0/1">It is a huge privilege to speak second after the Committee's Chairman, Mrs. Anderson, because I do not have to take account of what other hon. Members might have said. I am grateful for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/2">My first words are of congratulation for the Department on its response, which is full and in order. I have criticised it previously for fragmenting our reports and making its comments in an order that is amazingly difficult to follow. I have the distinct impression that, unless the word &quot;recommendation&quot; is included, the Department does not respond, but it has responded to these conclusions and recommendations in full, and I am grateful for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/3">I welcome the emphasis on quality and leadership, and I shall spend most of my time on those two aspects. The Committee's Chairman questioned the proof of quality-saving costs. Without proof, it is obvious that, if the quality of care is right, care is likely to be safe, efficient and low cost. Paragraph 36 of the response states:</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/4" class="indent">&quot;High quality and value for money are not competing alternatives; they are one and the same thing. Better care equals better value.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/5">An obvious example is that cutting down on litigation as a result of better quality saves money.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/6">That quality needs to be addressed is all too obvious. We have recently had examples in mid-Staffordshire, and some time ago, we had examples in Brighton. I fear that poor quality may be more widespread than just two cases. With your permission, Mrs. Anderson, and as time is, thankfully, not tight, I shall read a whole letter that I have received from constituents in the past day or two. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Dear Dr. Taylor,</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/8" class="indent">A few weeks ago we were devastated by the death of our only son. (We are not saying the standard of care he received wasn't good in many respects, but there were areas that could have been...improved upon.)</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/9" class="indent">We would arrive to see him, to find him lying in a soaking wet bed, or worse. He was unable to walk at this time so couldn't get to the bathroom. I offered to take a commode to him, but was told no the nurse would do it. 30 minutes later I asked again but by the time it arrived it was too late. It was made worse by the fact&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/10">that</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/11" class="indent">&quot;when the cleaner was polishing the floor she went only to the first bed, leaving the other two beds not cleaned under.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/12" class="indent">Our son had an infection under his nails and was unable to pick things up. This the staff knew about, so why were pills left in the little plastic cup. They would be left from the morning and lunch time. Maybe it was because he had no water jug or cup so he had nothing to drink. His Consultant told us he must drink plenty. He was given a warm drink which he had to drink through a straw, but his dad had to fetch water and a mug most days. He would drink 4 or 5 glassfuls which we had to hold for him. We know he wasn't the only person they had to look after, and it's said nurses are rushed off their feet. Lots of working people have long stressful days, and I know people who went into nursing as a vocation but sadly those days have gone. When someone is training for this job, I'm sure they must learn what is expected from them, and the meaning of the word nurse means to take care of and hopefully give a person dignity, which sadly our son didn't have at time.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/13" class="indent">We hope that if others of us should need to go into hospital in the future, that the cleaners do what they're supposed to do and our right to dignity is upheld.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/14">Thank you, Mrs. Anderson, for allowing me to read that long letter. What does one say in reply? It is not an official complaint, but I will pass it on to the commissioning and providing trusts. Sadly, I have been passing on such complaints for a long time. If they are formal complaints, there is an investigation, probably an apology and an expression of aims to do better, but I continue to receive such letters.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/15">Today, I received another, much shorter letter. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/16" class="indent">&quot;1 had an operation November last year to remove a possible...adenoma from my parotid gland. I was extremely unhappy with my treatment...The aftercare was disgraceful&mdash;the drain in the wound wasn't working, but despite me asking numerous times, one was never re attached. I had salivary fistulas and an open wound till mid January, but they just told me to 'squeeze' it every day! I was given no guidance on cleanliness, dressing the wound etc. It was appalling.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/17" class="indent">I asked the surgeon to check my neck in January as I felt that the tumour was still there&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/18">The surgeon</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/19" class="indent">&quot;refused to listen and explained that the only lump they found was the lymph node, which they removed, so I was wrong, end of story.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/20" class="indent">I was not satisfied, so I asked my GP...to refer me for another MRI. I received the results of that...and the tumour is still there.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/21">Why is basic quality lacking? Why are compassion, dignity and communication lacking? Stress and overwork are not an excuse. Demoralised staff are the fault of the leadership. Is there too much emphasis on scientific training for doctors and nurses without adequate training in interpersonal skills, the need for compassion and sympathy, and the importance of dignity to the helpless?</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/22">I do not blame the chief executive at the hospital that I am talking about because I have high regard for him, and other chief executives in the area have said that, if anyone could turn things round, he could. Who am I blaming? I am afraid that I am blaming the clinical staff and the clinical leadership, and I will return to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/23">Much of the Government's response is about commissioning, so quality must be written into the contract, and the commissioners must be able to enforce that contract. Will quality observatories in each SHA help? How will they know about the sort of care that constituents do not make formal complaints about because they do not know what to do? If they come to me,<i></i>I pass those complaints on.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/24">The Government's response reiterates much that has been said about quality, and paragraph 50&mdash;&quot;High Quality Care for All&quot;&mdash;sets out the seven aspects of the quality framework, but I am worried that those seven aspects may not pick up the sort of basic lack of quality that I am talking about. One is</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/25" class="indent">&quot;bringing clarity to quality&mdash;making it easy to access evidence about best practice by asking NICE to develop and kite-mark quality standards&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/26">I do not believe that NICE will be able to rule on not leaving patients in wet, soiled beds.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/27">The other aspects include:</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/28" class="indent">&quot;supporting clinicians to measure quality to support improvement...requiring quality information to be published...recognising and rewarding the delivery of high quality care...safeguarding basic standards through a new independent regulator, the Care Quality Commission&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/29">Patient-reported outcomes will pick some things up, but they are obviously very limited to start with. I am not sure that commissioning for quality and innovation will help, because we need basic quality before innovation. I am also not quite sure how the NHS constitution will help people such as my constituents, but perhaps the Minister can clarify that.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/30">The only answer is inspirational leadership by all groups of clinical staff, and that is covered by recommendations 21 to 24 of the report. Paragraph 107 of the Government response says:</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/31" class="indent">&quot;Far from taking a centralised approach to leadership development, we believe that leadership should happen at every level of the system and that leadership development should start at the level of the individual. All NHS staff have a responsibility to continuously learn, seek development and career opportunities, spot talent and support the development of others.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/32">My big question is what has happened to the local leaders? Do the ward sister and the consultants on a ward actually talk to one another? Do they do ward rounds together? Does the consultant tell the sister when the nursing standards are low? Does the sister tell the consultant when a junior doctor is hopeless? Sadly, I suspect that the answer to all those questions is no, and that is what we want to look at&mdash;we want to bring back basic quality care. The first allegiance of consultants and nurses on the wards must be to the patient and the other staff. I just hope that the review will address the restoration of basic quality care for all, while remembering compassion, dignity and communication.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-14a.307.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="307"  time="015:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090514/halltext/90514h0002.htm#09051466000277">
	<p pid="a.307.0/1">It is a shame that the House authorities have put the swine flu debate on in the main Chamber, because more hon. Members would have been here if they had not. I do not know whether we can make representations so that we can avoid doubling up in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/2">Although there were some reservations about the next stage review, it was well received on the whole. Much of the tribute for that must go to Lord Darzi, because the process was very much driven by him. Initially, I thought that it was a brilliant idea to have him conduct the review. Indeed, one could see the light bulbs popping on over some Ministers' heads as they thought, &quot;Let's find a doctor and make him a Lord. If he does the review, it will have much more credibility.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/3">Call me cynical, but that is the way I felt at the time. I thought that the process would surely get buy-in from the whole health service, but GPs initially said, &quot;Ah, but he is a surgeon,&quot; and even surgeons said, &quot;Ah, but he's the wrong type of surgeon. He's a tertiary surgeon. He works on a specific bit of the bowel.&quot; I wondered whether it was ever possible to please anybody, and it is partly a tribute the man himself that he managed to bring the review off.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/4">Various review streams were being carried out in different strategic health authorities, and it must have been an administrative nightmare to bring them together into some kind of cohesive whole. We sometimes underestimate the sheer hard work that goes into something like the review, and I pay tribute to all involved. Although the Committee found fault with some things, there was a consensus that the review was a good thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> commented heavily on the issue clinical leadership. I have been on Committee visits and other visits to countries where hospital boards are led by a strong medical component. That arrangement seems to lead to a more clinically driven process, and one cannot overestimate the importance of that. I am talking not just about doctors, and I am glad that the hon. Gentleman also mentioned nurses. I once visited a local hospital in connection with hygiene, and I was given free rein to go into any ward I wanted, so it was very much a pot-luck visit. What struck me very powerfully was that some wards were run with a rod of iron&mdash;the nurse in charge had complete control and authority&mdash;but others were not. For the sake of patients, we need to invest heavily in dealing with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/6">When I was elected in 2000, people waited at least a couple of years for a hip replacement, and they waited months in a cardiac ward for urgent cardiac surgery, hoping to survive, but that we do not see that now. Although we criticise targets, I concede that they might have been necessary at that time to introduce outcome-driven targets, which were probably the only way to focus on what needed to be done. None the less, some targets did skew priorities. Now, however, waiting lists are low, and I hope that budgets will not be affected too much, so we can concentrate on improving clinical care and perhaps have a more clinically driven process.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/7">It was entirely positive that the consultation did not involve just the great and the good and the worthies in their profession&mdash;the same old names that we see on every committee. The review went wider and tried to engage health workers in different localities and to involve patients and the public. We could argue about whether it did that as well as it could, but it tried, and that set a useful benchmark for the future. The review's engagement with the strategic health authorities also meant that the focus could be a little more local. I am not usually a great fan of SHAs, but the engagement with them was useful in this case.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/8">Getting the commissioning right will be crucial to the review's implementation. It has frequently been noted that people seem to complain about the quality of commissioning wherever one goes in the health service. The Committee's report highlighted that, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/9" class="indent">&quot;PCTs lack analytical and planning skills and the quality of their management is very variable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/10">We should bear it in mind that the report was published fairly recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/11">The Government response was a little weak and a little defensive about commissioning. It acknowledged that the Government were aware of the problem in 2007, but then went on at great length about world-class commissioning. That part of the response is the most disappointing; it is a fine exercise in NHS management speak and makes much of vision, competencies, assurance and status. I do not doubt the Government's good intentions on commissioning, but the Minister must accept&mdash;particularly when he looks at the review of how PCTs were doing on world-class commissioning&mdash;that commissioning is patchy.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/12">Services are often commissioned by people who know little about them. I recall speaking to local commissioners about dentistry. They were new in the job and knew little, at the time, about dentistry. They did not even know how many units of dental activity a dentist could get through. They said, &quot;We are going to commission so many thousand units of dental activity,&quot; and when I asked them how many dentists that meant, they sat scratching their heads for a while. If people with so little understanding of what they are doing are commissioning services, we are clearly not going to commission services of any class&mdash;let alone world class. There is also a danger that some of the newer, more innovative services that people are trying to develop will not be commissioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/13">I want to talk about quality and patient-reported outcome measures. I hope that the Minister will update us on that. The four areas that have been outlined were supposed to have been initiated by April. Niall Dixon, of the King's Fund, described the implementation timetable as &quot;very challenging&quot;. How far has implementation gone, and what is the sample size? Can we have more information about how the data will be used? The Government response gave as much information as was available at the time, but things will have moved on since then. It would also be helpful, as has been mentioned, if the Minister would outline costs. Lord Darzi estimated &pound;6.50 per person, but other witnesses who came before the Committee gave estimates ranging from &pound;2.50 to &pound;10. It would be useful to have a clear idea of the likely reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/14">Another aspect of the NSR report&mdash;to do with choice, personalisation and access&mdash;was also well-intentioned, but it is unclear how it will pan out. In the interim report it was announced that 100 additional GP surgeries would be developed in under-doctored areas. No one could argue that that was a bad thing. I certainly would not; I might ask why there were to be only 100. More controversial, as has been said, was the new GP-led health centre in every PCT&mdash;a one-size-fits-all solution. According to my reading, that was supposed to be a matter of improving access, tackling inequalities and fostering team working; so it might be useful to see whether it has worked out. There is a slightly schizoid tension in Government between the top-down imposition of a centre in each PCT and the mantra that enables responsibility to be abdicated: &quot;Ah, but each PCT will decide where it will go locally.&quot; Well, they did not actually want them locally; and there are some PCTs with huge problems&mdash;some of the spearhead PCTs&mdash;that could probably have done with a couple more of them. There seems to be no overall planning of the matter; it is neither fish nor fowl. If the Government are serious about tackling inequalities it would be better to concentrate more on the under-doctored areas, because the Committee's report on inequalities highlighted many problems in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/15">The desire for access and greater team working was not as well thought through as it might have been. I am not sure whether the consequences were thought through. Very little thought was given to the impact of a polyclinic on the local health economy. If existing doctors and pharmacies were to go out of business, would not the public have less choice? Their only choice would be the new GP-led health centre, which might not be as close for people who had to walk or rely on public transport. A significant proportion of the people affected might be disadvantaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/16">There are legitimate concerns, but the campaign that the BMA led on the matter was&mdash;I am not allowed to say this about hon. Members, but I think I may about the BMA&mdash;dishonest, disingenuous and nothing short of disgraceful.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-14a.309.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="309"  time="015:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090514/halltext/90514h0003.htm#09051466000279">
	<p pid="a.309.1/1">I think I did, actually. I was vociferous with my local doctors. Every hon. Member was contacted by the GPs in their area who were up in arms about what they all called polyclinics; they did not seem to know what they were&mdash;there is great confusion about polyclinics and GP-led health centres. I went to some surgeries in the south of Hampshire, and said, &quot;I think the clinic is going to be in Basingstoke. No one from the locality is going to go there.&quot; There is a good reason for putting it in Basingstoke, because a lot of housing is planned there. A frenzy was whipped up, with no real thought about whether it was realistic. GPs must be careful before they cry wolf, because there will come a time when we do not believe them. This is such a case. I give credit to the surgery in my locality that did not join in the feeding frenzy, taking the attitude: &quot;We know there is no risk to us; we think we are a good surgery and our patients will not want to go to Basingstoke.&quot; There is nothing wrong with Basingstoke, but it is a long journey from Romsey. That campaign by the BMA was unhelpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/2">As to team working, I concede that there are advantages to a variety of health practitioners working together in one location, but that is another approach that ignores the wider health economy. There will be a feeling that there is no mechanism to enable people outside the loop, who could work with the GP health centre and build up links, to do that. The way to get health professionals working together is to start when they are at university. Many schools of nursing at universities are trying, with varying degrees of success, to do that. Students regard aspects of such courses as tokenistic. I took part in a BMA-organised debate in Southampton, which was well attended by medical students. It was good to see that they were interested and engaged enough to come out on a Thursday night. They were quite scathing about the joint working. It was not that they already had an arrogant attitude towards working with other partners. They just felt that it had not been well thought through. When the Committee was in New Zealand we made a visit to someone&mdash;I think it was a doctor&mdash;who had tried such an approach. I think that a little more thought had gone into what he did. He had not mixed everyone together at the beginning of their training, but had put doctors at the beginning of their training with nurses and pharmacists who had been training for longer, and set exercises that meant that the student doctors had actively to engage with those pharmacists and nurses, and appreciate their expertise. Such approaches should be considered more closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/3">The other concern about polyclinics and GP-led health centres is that they are being introduced with no pilots or evaluation. I have never quite understood why some initiatives are introduced with pilot after pilot&mdash;and when it is clear that they are doing quite well there is another pilot, so that it takes years to introduce them&mdash;whereas other, untried, initiatives are introduced wholesale. It would be helpful if the Minister clarified how the Government decide what will be piloted and what will appear everywhere. The Committee's report raised concerns that</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/4" class="indent">&quot;roll out will precede the results of the evaluation, which has the potential to waste taxpayers' money and be grossly inefficient.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/5">Obviously, in the current financial climate, we cannot afford to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/6">The Government response in paragraphs 77 to 79 was a little disappointing. Those paragraphs only defended the Government's position. There was no mention of a review. The Government did not even say, &quot;Well, we're not going to do one, so tough.&quot; It would therefore be helpful if the Minister elaborated on whether there will be any evaluation and, if early health centres are shown not to work, what will be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/7">I shall briefly mention personal health budgets. Despite what I have said about piloting, I think that it is absolutely right to pilot those. I have been a great fan of individual budgets in social care, but they are not for everyone. Some people would rather have the responsibility taken off them. For those who like individual budgets, they are brilliant and they have made a huge difference to people's lives. Hampshire has been at the forefront of piloting them. However, the lessons from social care cannot necessarily be transferred wholesale to health care, for a number of reasons. People live with a range of long-term conditions. We do not all neatly fit into a box, so it is not easy to decide what the budget should be. If someone has three or four conditions, are there economies of scale; can some of them be managed together? Is it the case that someone's situation is more complex and they need more funding? Also, the budgets could be a back-door route to rationing if there was not careful monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/8">Despite my criticism of the BMA, I think it only fair to say that it is asking sensible questions about the budgets. What happens if the budget runs out? Who is responsible? Who will have access and how will they have access? Will they be able to access the budget for the next year, in advance? If they spend less, what will happen to the money? Will the patient get a pat on the back and be able to keep it, or will they have to return it to the NHS pot? How will all that be administered? The BMA also raises the point that I have raised. How will the calculations be made? Will there be a consistent methodology between PCTs? We have all seen the differences in the commissioning of various services by PCTs. How can we price health? Not everything can be easily put into a one-size-fits-all tariff. There are realistic and genuine concerns in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/9">I shall finish with a few words about the NHS constitution. No one could argue with the general idea, but it does seem a bit motherhood and apple pie. It is all very well having a nice document and handbook, but if we are trying to improve the patient experience, we really need to be concentrating even more on clinical leadership, which has been mentioned. Just producing the book will do no good at all if it is not linked with clearly defined ways of inculcating that leadership and ensuring that the thinking behind the constitution, which is well meant, is part of everyday thinking. Otherwise, sadly, we will be sitting here in debates in years to come and the hon. Member for Wyre Forest or his successor will be reading out letters similar to those that he read out today. We would all wish to avoid that.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/10">The nature of these debates is that we often comment on the difficult parts, but I want to end my remarks by saying that, on the whole, the next stage review was a very good thing and I wish all those who have the task of implementing it the best of success.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-14a.323.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="323"  time="016:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090514/halltext/90514h0005.htm#09051466000289">
	<p pid="a.323.0/1">To a certain extent, I agree with my right hon. Friend. He is right to highlight the fact that many parts of the country, because they have been either spearhead or under-doctored areas, have received not just a new GP-led health centre, but one, two, three or even four new GP surgeries. The criteria for that have been based on the level of deprivation, disease and the ratio of GPs per head of population. The criteria and the driver for the new GP-led health centres was a real feeling on the part of the Government and the public&mdash;it was borne out not just by the annual GP service but by MORI and the deliberative events that we did in the context of the next stage review&mdash;that having tackled waiting times and some of those really big quality and capacity challenges that the NHS used to face in the past what the public most wanted was the ability to see a GP at a time that was more convenient to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/2">We had a twin-track approach. Part of that was getting as many GPs as possible to open in the evenings and at weekends, which we have done through the extended hours programme. We had a bit of an argy-bargy with the BMA over that, but in the end it agreed to sign up. I think there is only one PCT in the whole country&mdash;it may be in Worcestershire, but do not quote me because I may be wrong&mdash;that is not up to 50 per cent. of GP surgeries offering extended hours. The average now is 75 per cent. For those people who live in an area in which they do not have 100 per cent. of GPs offering evening and weekend openings but who want to stay with their own GP, why should they not have the ability to visit a GP in the evenings and at weekends as well? Similarly, a lot of people who commute face difficulties. Hon. Members will be aware from their postbags that a lot of people say, &quot;Why can I not register with a GP where I work rather than where I live?&quot; Of course there is a problem with that because of practice boundaries and the cost of double registration and so on. The new GP-led health centres will provide a useful service for those people who may commute to the nearest local town, be it Banbury, Oxford or wherever, and will be able to visit a GP-led health centre there as well as one at home if that is more convenient.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-14a.324.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="324"  time="016:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090514/halltext/90514h0005.htm#09051466000293">
	<p pid="a.324.2/1">I do not want to engage in argy-bargy over this. He might not do it now, but I invite the hon. Gentleman to change his party's official policy of allowing GPs to decide their own opening hours. That would be a massive step backwards. We have achieved a lot in the last 18 months to improve access to primary care. We do not want to go backwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/2">Before I leave the issue of London, if he has studied the GP patient survey, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West will be aware that Lewisham has one of the highest levels in the country of dissatisfaction over access to primary care services. The average level was 18 per cent., but in Lewisham it was 23 per cent. Nearly a quarter of his constituents are not happy. The survey was carried out before the introduction of the programme of extended hours and GP-led health centres so I hope that the figure will improve next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/3">The NSR marks a dramatic development in the relationship between the centre, PCTs and local service providers. It is a move away from the central direction that was needed to successfully tackle historic issues such as waiting lists, to an empowering of local leaders and a devolution of power and decision-making to as close to the patient as possible. The Select Committee report is right to highlight how important effective commissioning is in achieving the goals of the NSR. It is for PCTs to make the decisions that are in the best interests of their patients. However, the system relies on PCTs having the necessary people and skills to use that power effectively. The Select Committee was right to highlight how many PCTs are not as strong as they could be.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/4">The world-class commissioning programme is aimed at raising the standard of commissioning in PCTs across the country. A year in, it has helped PCTs to plot a clear path towards the high standards of commissioning that we all expect. The next two to three years will see better commissioning skills within PCTs and improvements to local health outcomes and to outcomes overall.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/5">The Department is working with strategic health authorities to provide PCTs with a range of world-class commissioning tools, such as improved data, guidance on strategic planning and topic-specific commissioning guidance for areas such as stroke, cancer and primary care. Most PCTs now have a board development programme and each region runs commissioner training programmes. Many PCTs are also working together to improve their analytical and commercial capacity, to better commission services from a single provider or for a particular care pathway.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/6">The hon. Member for Romsey asked how we will evaluate the role of local government. In our surveys of local government and NHS organisations that are involved in the process, 90 per cent. of respondents agreed that world-class commissioning will help them to become better commissioners of services and that it will improve the governance of their systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/7">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness spoke about practice-based commissioning. I accept that that is a vital part of world-class commissioning. As he is aware, in March we published &quot;Clinical commissioning: our vision for practice-based commissioning&quot;, which sets out the role of practice-based commissioning in world-class commissioning. That has been well received by the NHS and by independent commentators. The NHS Alliance commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/8" class="indent">&quot;This confirmation and reinforcement should dispel any doubts about whether PBC is here to stay&mdash;it is. This must now mark the end of discussions of the role of PBC, and the start of the real action throughout the English NHS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/9">Nick Goodwin, the senior fellow at the King's Fund, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/10" class="indent">&quot;The vision outlined by the government...confirms its commitment to PBC&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/11">and</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/12" class="indent">&quot;its strategic importance within the wider commissioning agenda...The guidance helpfully places PBC as a key tool for PCTs to influence and lead strategic service change through commissioning.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/13">Practice-based commissioning is a firm and popular foundation from which to build. A recent independent survey of almost 1,900 practices by MORI showed that 64 per cent. supported PBC, with just 16 per cent. opposing it. It showed that clinicians are becoming more involved in commissioning, with 61 per cent. of GP practices commissioning a service through PBC as of February this year, compared to 56 per cent. in the previous quarter.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/14">The PBC development framework and a national PBC improvement team are in place to help PCTs develop practice-based commissioning. We will be holding them to account through the world-class commissioning assurance process, which will ensure that PCTs provide practices with the support and resources they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/15">Hon. Members have raised the cost of the NSR, as did the Select Committee report. In our view, the NHS cannot afford not to take the recommendations forward. The national and local visions that were developed as part of the NSR process focused the NHS on prevention, constantly improving quality and innovation. That will enable the NHS to better deliver value for taxpayers' money. I am sure we all agree that that is necessary to meet the challenges facing the health service and the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/16">Implementing the 10 regional visions of &quot;High Quality Care for All&quot; is now the core business of the NHS. The NHS budget for England will increase to over &pound;100 billion by the end of the year. All the NSR proposals will be funded from within that budget. Prioritising the most effective treatments, reducing errors and waste, and keeping people healthy and independent for as long as possible all contribute to quality care, and to a more efficient and productive health service. High quality and value for money are not competing alternatives; they are often one and the same thing. That is increasingly important in an economic downturn.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/17">There has been discussion about whether high quality always means saving money. I agree with the point the Select Committee Chairman made when he quoted Alan Maynard. He said that high quality is not always cheaper than poor quality. As the hon. Member for Wyre Forest said, although quality sometimes costs more, there are big overall savings to be made through better quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/18">Savings can be made if the right treatment is given in the right setting first time round, if the length of stay is reduced by the right support being provided and if the rates of prescribing generic drugs are increased. Care can be organised to ensure it is of a high quality. Simple things can be done such as having protected meal times and freeing up staff time through the productive ward programme. Those are just a few examples of how high-quality productivity, good outcomes and less wastage of resources go together.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/19">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest is right that prioritisation will be critical. We do not just have priorities at local level. Although there are now fewer of them, we still have national targets for waiting times. We also have the annual operating framework, which states what we believe are the top priorities that should guide the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/20">Hon. Members mentioned the patient reported outcome measures. That scheme is currently limited to four elective procedures: hip and knee replacements, and groin hernia and varicose vein surgery. There are no commitments to extend the scheme but the Department is actively exploring the potential for PROMs in other areas such as long-term conditions. Any decision to extend the scheme will be evidence-based.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/21">The cost of implementing PROMs is expected to represent less than 0.5 per cent. of the total spend on the four elective procedures that they cover. The national scheme started in April 2009. Indications are that implementation is going well, and the scheme should be fully embedded by April next year. It will be subject to ongoing review. Incidentally, I forgot to say that GP-led health centres will also be evaluated; a number of hon. Members asked about that. The PROMs scheme will also be evaluated to test and demonstrate its value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/22">Implementation is already under way. All but a handful of providers began collecting PROMs data on schedule in April. The data can be incorporated into quality improvements, such as the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation incentive scheme, in the same way as other quality data.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/23">My right hon. Friend the Chairman of the Select Committee highlighted the importance of leadership in the NHS. We believe that leadership is central to fulfilling the vision of the NSR. I accept that past initiatives to improve the quality of leadership in the NHS have not always succeeded. They have often failed because they have focussed on too small a group of people over too short a period. However, I believe that we are better placed than before to drive the leadership agenda forward. We have a clear 10-year plan based on the regional clinical visions and a new emphasis on quality that makes it much more attractive for clinicians to become involved in leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/24">The NSR will ensure that clinicians are fully prepared to take on senior leadership roles within the NHS. It will embed leadership in undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and development programmes at different stages of clinicians' careers. The NSR is designed to support local health organisations in identifying, developing and recruiting the best leadership talent across their regions. The national leadership council, to which I have referred, will intervene only where it can add value. Its role is to ensure that the system supports high-quality leadership and to challenge it where it does not.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/25">As I said, the NSR supports local health organisations in identifying, developing and recruiting the best leadership talent across their regions. At its core, the guidance is about creating a deep and diverse talent pool from which we will draw our next generation of NHS leaders. All responsibility is devolved to the NHS locally, and managers will face much greater local scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/26">I was glad to hear someone&mdash;it was either the hon. Member for Wyre Forest or my right hon. Friend the Chair of the Select Committee&mdash;speak up in defence of managers. We need good managers in the NHS, and they often get a lot of stick. Although the vast majority of managers meet high professional standards, I am afraid that a minority sometimes suffer lapses in performance or conduct that threaten to undermine the confidence of their staff, their organisations and patients. An advisory group chaired by Ian Dalton, chief executive of the NHS north-east strategic health authority, will consider how senior NHS managers can demonstrate publicly that they have reached and are maintaining high professional standards, in order to ensure and enhance confidence in the profession.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/27">The clinical excellence awards scheme is currently under review. We will examine how leadership skills can best be reflected in the criteria for awarding CEAs. The national management training schemes recruit and develop talented individuals who have the potential to become directors or chief executives within the NHS. The scheme has already produced some of our most outstanding leaders&mdash;the current NHS chief executive, David Nicholson, is an alumnus&mdash;and the scheme came fifth in <i>The Times </i>top 100 graduate employers in 2008 as voted by graduates, up from sixth in 2007. I would not be surprised, given the current economic climate, if it continued to rise up the league table. It is a very reputable and high-quality scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/28">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked about innovation. He is absolutely right: creating an environment in which innovation can flourish is vital to improving quality. We announced the creation of five new academic health science centres in March. Last month, the Government launched a range of measures to drive innovation and ensure that innovative ideas and practices are disseminated across the service. They include a new &pound;220 million innovation fund to support faster innovation and the universal spread of best practice; a new legal duty for SHAs to promote innovation, which will be important in driving innovation through the system; and a series of challenge prizes to reward those who have excelled in creating and diffusing innovative ideas and encourage others to do likewise.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/29">I saw the challenge prizes rubbished in the press when they were announced, but the idea is an exciting and interesting one. We are not giving people lots of money for doing things that they should be doing anyway; we are encouraging innovation and imagination at the local level, so that ideas can come up from the bottom, as the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness himself highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/30">We are also introducing a new IT system, NHS Evidence, to improve access to information and support for better clinical and commissioning decisions. Medical Education England provides independent, expert advice on training and education for doctors, dentists, health care scientists and pharmacists. MEE is supported by professionals and has developed as a result of extensive consultation with stakeholders. We are developing similar bodies for the other professions that will be in place by September 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/31">I am incredibly grateful not only for the Select Committee report but for the contributions and comments made today. This has been a constructive discussion. I expect that we will continue to have a robust debate about GP-led health centres for a while, at least until they are up and running everywhere in the country, and then I hope that people will make a different judgment on them. I invite the Health Committee to revisit the issue when it feels that it has something interesting to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/32">The quality of today's debate reinforces how important the future of the NHS is to us all. I have been heartened by the strong support for how the NSR was conducted and the vision that it sets out. This debate and the Health Committee report will help us considerably in getting the implementation right. That is the most important thing about all reviews and reports: not that we publish them, but that we get the implementation right and see it through.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.2/33">There will, of course, be challenges ahead, but I am confident that because the review has generated a deep feeling of local ownership and genuine enthusiasm, we will deliver its vision for the NHS. By placing power in the hands of local PCTs and patients, we will make high-quality care for all more than the title of a report. It will be exactly what we will achieve.</p>
