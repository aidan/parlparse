<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-26b.206.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for International Development"  colnum="206"  time="010:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100126/halltext/100126h0003.htm#10012651000452">
	<p pid="b.206.0/1">In the usual way, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> on securing this debate. I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase>, the hon. Members for Castle Point (Bob Spink) and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) and the Opposition spokesmen, the hon. Members for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) and for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell), on their contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/2">I will reply to a number of the observations made by the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster before I come to the substance of his remarks. I have been interested in microfinance for a considerable period, starting in part with my chairmanship of the UK Co-operative party. The Co-op party has a long-standing interest in credit unions and social enterprises that can help enable access to low-cost finance for people in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/3">The hon. Gentleman made some interesting remarks that, in a sense, highlighted the continuing potential for microfinance, not only in developing countries, but here in the UK. I hope he will forgive me if I draw the attention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and her ministerial team to his remarks about the potential for microfinance in the UK. For a short period, I was responsible for consumer affairs as well as development-an interesting mix if ever there was one-and as part of that I considered what else we could do to crack down on illegal moneylending. That involved helping to ensure not only that responses from the police, housing associations and so on were clear and united, but that effective alternatives to the use of illegal moneylenders became increasingly available. I was delighted that the Treasury made additional finance available for cheap loans, but I suspect that my right hon. Friend will be able to do more justice to the potential for microfinance in the UK than I can during this short debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/4">Some time ago, I had the privilege of meeting Professor Yunus and sharing a platform with him. There is no doubt that the work of the Grameen bank has inspired a considerable interest in microfinance and its potential across the developing world. As other hon. Members have described, microfinance has been taken up by organisations such as RESULTS UK, which does an excellent job.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/5">However, I must part company a little with the hon. Gentleman: I do not think there is a choice between aid and trade. That is a false choice. There is both a role for aid to encourage trade and a role for trade-indeed, trade must be the long-term route out of poverty for developing countries. We can use aid budgets to do many things to help accelerate the development of trade, and we are considering exactly that. I would not want the House or those who follow our proceedings to run away with the notion that the Department for International Development does not face tough questions. We are regularly examined by the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office, and there are a series of different ways in which our various programmes are evaluated. As a Minister in DFID, I have certainly never felt that I am not under scrutiny all the time-I know my officials have a similar view.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/6">The hon. Gentleman raised the interesting subject of the debates taking place in some quarters about whether we should continue to give aid at current levels. The hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield pointed out that, of course, there is a very strong moral case, of which Haiti is the latest reminder. However, in the past five or 10 years alone, the notion that we can stay within our island and not worry about what happens in countries around the world has disappeared, if it were ever true before.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/7">The hon. Member for Castle Point brought home the truth of that with his reference to Afghanistan. We know that drug lords in Afghanistan have occasionally been the only source of credit in local communities and that 90 per cent. of the heroin that ends up on Britain's streets starts off in the opium poppy fields of Afghanistan. To bring us back in a circular route to the debate, the microfinance programme that we are supporting in Afghanistan, which has helped more than 440,000 Afghans to get access to loans, is just one way that aid for another country can help to make a difference and protect the UK. So there is both a moral case and a case in terms of our self-interest for continuing to invest in development assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/8">The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster made a number of comments about Bangladesh and the size of the aid programme there. I do not accept that our aid programme in Bangladesh is in some way unaccountable, but I accept his point that we must keep the number of programmes we have under review at all times. I will obviously draw his remarks to the attention of the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1939" name="Michael Foster">the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster)</phrase>, who has responsibility for our programmes in Bangladesh. However, I suspect that the nature of the hon. Gentleman's visit meant that he did not have a chance to have a lengthy conversation with staff in Bangladesh. That might have given him more reassurance about the way in which we are keeping what we do in that country under close review.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/9">Nevertheless, I welcome the opportunity that this debate provides to raise awareness of the difference that microfinance can play in transforming the lives of so many of the world's poorest people. Roughly 2.7 billion people have no access to formal financial services and instead depend on an income that is both irregular and unreliable. As other hon. Members have said, those people sometimes also depend on risky informal financial services, such as rogue moneylenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/10">Across Africa, fewer than one in five people use formal banking, and in countries of particularly acute poverty the figure is fewer than one in 10. As other hon. Members have said, that makes it harder for such people to start businesses or to contribute to their country's economic growth, and it makes them particularly vulnerable to natural disasters. For many people, a small loan and a savings account can make all the difference. As we have said, access to those things can prevent a farmer from being forced into opium cultivation, a child from being sent out to work instead of getting a proper education or, indeed, a local business from having to stay small rather than expand and create more jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/11">We need to recognise the potential and the limits of microfinance. Microfinance is not the only type of financial service that we need to increase the reach of, but nevertheless it is an important one, which can lead us to recognise that poverty and risk do not have to go hand in hand. The real challenge for those involved with microfinance is one of sheer scale, and in order to achieve depth and breadth of reach a number of things must happen. First, banks and investors must get more involved in the sector. In recent years, there has been some positive progress in that direction and many international banks have already increased their participation in the sector-more than 100 microfinance investment funds have been set up-but we need more of that to meet the level of demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/12">Secondly, Governments and regulators have a responsibility to remove any unnecessary policy or legal barriers to the expansion of financial services. Through our funding of the financial sector reform and strengthening initiative, DFID is providing help on regulatory issues in the financial services sector to more than 60 countries. Governments are also in a position to test new technology, such as using branchless banking to pay wages and pensions, which can help the extent of the reach of microfinance initiatives. There is no reason why branchless banking-perhaps using mobile phone technology-could not be extended to microfinance. Customers would benefit from the speed and ease of access, and banks themselves would enjoy greater flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/13">Thirdly, Governments can encourage the private sector to set targets for extending access to financial services to more poor people. For example, in India, just four months after the Government had urged banks to offer no-frills accounts to low-income people, 500,000 such accounts had been opened. That needs to be replicated across the developing world although, of course, we must recognise that no two countries have identical requirements and the solution must always be tailored to meet specific needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/14">Fourthly, we need to teach more people about financial services. Some people can feel ill-informed, anxious or confused when dealing with financial matters. That is particularly relevant when talking about people in the developing world who may be using financial services for the first time. However, it is also relevant to people here in the UK, which is one of the points the hon. Gentleman implicitly made. With regard to the developing world, that is why we set up a financial education fund over a year ago to help people across Africa to understand better the financial choices available to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/15">The provision of services brings its own challenges, and microfinance businesses might need help and guidance as they expand their reach, so the Department, together with the World Bank, is currently developing a fund, to which the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk alluded, to support microfinance providers in Africa. We want that fund to invigorate approaches to microfinance, encourage innovation and ensure that people have the training they need. Ultimately, that should mean that financial services become more widely available to those who have traditionally been considered unbankable. I have already discussed that initiative with the all-party group on microfinance, chaired then by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1764" name="Robert Syms">the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms)</phrase>, and I remain ready and willing to listen to comments from any Members who have an interest in the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/16">I will now respond to some of the specific points that other hon. Members have made. The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, who usually chairs the all-party group that I mentioned, highlighted the important contribution that microfinance can make to the achievement of the millennium development goals, and I completely agree with her point. If we want to achieve the principal millennium development goal of halving the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, we must substantially increase access to financial services. Microfinance has a key role to play in that. She also made an important point about micro-insurance. That is one small part of helping communities and the world's poorest to be better able to withstand the rising impact of climate change globally, and that is one of the areas that we are working on.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/17">The hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk mentioned the work that the Department is doing with CGAP, which is effectively the world's think-tank on microfinance. We are co-operating with 32 other donors on CGAP's work. He rightly drew attention to the impact of the global financial crisis on the world's poorest people. As Members of Parliament, we of course will focus first on the needs of our own constituents, but he is right to remind us that almost 100 million people, according to the World Bank's estimate, have been pushed into extreme poverty by the global financial crisis, the vast bulk of them in developing countries. Microfinance is clearly one part of our response to help get back on track to achieving the millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/18">The United Nations Secretary-General is convening in September at the UN General Assembly a review of our progress internationally towards meeting the millennium development goals. Ten years in to that 15-year ambition to achieve those goals, that will clearly be a hugely important summit. I hope that by then we will have put into legislation our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent. of our national income on development assistance, because that will send a powerful signal to the international community.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-26b.210.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="210"  time="010:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100126/halltext/100126h0004.htm#10012651000456">
	<p pid="b.210.1/1">I am not sure what amendments the hon. Gentleman is suggesting, but I will be happy to listen to specific suggestions from him or the International Development Committee. We have made clear our determination to achieve the 0.7 per cent. target, but I have never been entirely convinced that his party, when in power-not that I think it will get into power anytime soon-would follow through on that commitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/2">That brings me to several points that the hon. Gentleman made. I will start with his questions about the Doha development round. As he knows, in July 2008 we were very close to getting an agreement on the headlines-the modalities-of a trade deal. Pascal Lamy, the head of the World Trade Organisation, estimates that we were 75 per cent. of the way towards a deal, and we have come close several times to being able to see Trade Ministers meet. We secured agreement in the G20 meetings that there would be a stocktake in early 2010, and we await word from Pascal Lamy on when that will take place. There was a ministerial meeting of the WTO in Geneva in late 2009, and while the Doha round was not formally discussed at that meeting, it was discussed in a series of bilateral talks in which we and other countries pushed for further progress. Meetings of officials continue to take place in Geneva and I hope that Pascal Lamy will feel sufficiently confident about the progress that has been made to bring Ministers back to Geneva to try to reach the final part of the agreement that we need.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/3">There are huge potential benefits for not only developed countries, but developing countries. The example of cotton is perhaps the most graphic. Countries such as Mali and Burkina Faso, which depend on cotton exports, could see huge potential increases in the level of cotton exports if we could only make progress on getting cotton tariffs brought down, particularly in the US, in some parts of Europe and in other OECD markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/4">The hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield also rightly mentioned Haiti. As the Prime Minister said at questions last week, we clearly need a review of how the aid effort has worked in Haiti. I humbly recommend to the hon. Gentleman a recent speech made by the Minister of State for International Development on that issue at the Central Emergency Response Fund conference in New York last December. We see disasters of the magnitude of that which has struck Haiti on average once a year, as well as a series of other emergencies, so we clearly need to look at what else we can do to increase the effectiveness of the international aid system. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me a copy of his Green Paper-it will continue to be a useful guide for him when he is still doing the same job in opposition after the election.</p>
