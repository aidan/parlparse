	<p pid="a.416.0/1">There have been advances in some areas, and we should pay tribute to the work that has been done. Unfortunately it is limited to parts of the country, and many people are forced to survive in the only way they know&mdash;by growing poppies. Failure to address the impact of the poppy trade has led to a revival of the Taliban, who profit from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/2">The west and the international community have been slow to acknowledge the link between insurgency and poppy cultivation, even five years after entering Afghanistan. In the report that came from the previous NATO summit, in Riga in November, there was one small paragraph that mentioned poppies. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/3" class="indent">&quot;We recognise the linkage between narcotics and insurgents in Afghanistan&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/4">which was a good start, but it simply went on</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/5" class="indent">&quot;and will continue to support the Afghan Government's counter-narcotics efforts, within ISAF's mandate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/6">I do not believe that that is good enough, and nor do many others. General James Jones, the former head of NATO, saw poppy crops as &quot;Afghanistan's Achilles heel&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/7">Some of the agencies that have been put together to try to combat narcotics operations in Afghanistan look good on paper. From the international perspective, there is the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which is simply a monitoring and information service. It does not do anything to tackle drugs operations, it simply reports on what is happening. There is the Counter-narcotics police of Afghanistan, but it is only 1000-strong in a country the size of Spain. There is the Afghan eradication force, which is a successor to the central poppy eradication force, but it is only 700-strong.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/8">There are various poppy elimination programme teams&mdash;about a dozen eight to 10-man teams that are spread around the country&mdash;but their impact is limited. There is also the Afghan special narcotics force, but that is also small considering the scale of the problem that it is confronting. From a financial perspective there is the counter-narcotics trust fund, which allows the international community to pour money into Afghanistan to combat narcotics. The structure is there, but it is far too small to deal with the scale of the problem that we face.</p>

	<p pid="a.417.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. On my visits to Afghanistan, I have been astonished at the levels of corruption that I have seen. We cannot be surprised, considering the decades of war that we have witnessed there. We cannot expect Afghanistan to turn overnight into a civilised, democratic society. That will not happen. If we look back at our own history, we will see that it took some time for us to wean out all forms of corruption, and it sadly exists at all levels in Afghanistan: local, regional and national.</p>
	<p pid="a.417.1/2">I have seen reports that up to 17 of the 249 members of the lower house of the Afghan Parliament are former warlords and still benefit from the drugs trade. That problem will not disappear, and it is difficult for President Karzai to balance and to maintain the peace. If those people are not somehow included in reconciliation, they may challenge the Government and cause more problems.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-11a.418.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" speakername="Tobias Ellwood" colnum="418"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070711/halltext/70711h0001.htm#07071179000533">
	<p pid="a.418.0/1">My hon. Friend, who is very knowledgeable about these matters, makes a valid point. We have seen a bit of an open argument between the United States and Britain on that very issue. I got the impression, having visited Washington in April, that the Americans are coming around to our way of thinking. They are now realising&mdash;unfortunately, through experience&mdash;that they are not winning hearts and minds by eradicating crops and thinking that the tough-stick approach will work. They are realising that there needs to be an alternative if we are to win that battle.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/2">Certainly, in parts of Afghanistan, including Helmand province, our present strategy is failing for exactly the reason that my hon. Friend illustrates. The absence of security, the proximity to the border, the scale of corruption and the limited options for farmers mean that the challenge gets bigger each year. We have allowed Helmand province to become the supreme poppy grower of the world, responsible for producing one third of the planet's heroin.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/3">It is time for a rethink. It is time for the Government to regroup and to consider the matter again. Perhaps the Minister can confirm whether Britain remains the G8 lead nation for the counter-narcotics strategy in Afghanistan. We have 7,000 troops in Helmand province. They are well placed to lead any new initiative, and the current $1 billion spent on counter-narcotics could be better utilised. I wish to make a proposal in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/4">Hon. Members will be aware that poppies can be turned into not only heroin but several recognised medicinal products, including diamorphine and codeine. Ironically, there is a shortage of diamorphine in this country. I found that out through a parliamentary question. Indeed, an established UN-licensed poppy scheme is already up and running in places such as Turkey and India. However, I do not believe that that should be a long-term goal for Afghanistan, and that is where I differ from several other interested bodies that have expressed thoughts on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/5">The current situation in Afghanistan is too unstable for us to have any long-term licensing systems up and running. That would just lead to an increase in counter-narcotics. The scale of the problem would be uncontrollable. However, there is a way of temporarily honing the concept. If we were to visit Lashkar Gar and find a metal factory that was turning out guns, would we destroy the factory, or would we say to the people, &quot;Why don't you make tractor parts or something else?&quot; The same applies to the poppy growers. They are able to make opium and heroin, but they can certainly make other products that could be of benefit to the international community.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/6">I propose inviting farmers to sign up to a six-year programme. Each year, they would be required to replace one sixth of their poppy crop with another product. That would be repeated every year, eventually weaning them off poppy cultivation completely. Markets would need to be established to purchase the poppy crops and the alternative produce. Poppies would be turned into medicinal products locally and then exported. Farmers who failed to sign up to the programme would face immediate eradication of their poppy fields.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/7">The proposal involves a carrot-and-stick approach. It must be introduced with the support of the local jirgas, which are the power bases in the towns and villages&mdash;something that has been ignored up to this point in the rolling out of democracy across the country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-11a.422.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" speakername="Paul Flynn" colnum="422"  time="009:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070711/halltext/70711h0002.htm#07071179000545">
	<p pid="a.422.3/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> on his visionary, practical and courageous approach. We owe him a debt of gratitude for injecting a note of reality into a war that all sides have treated with an air of delusion and wishful thinking. I will not go as far as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> and call the hon. Gentleman my friend, but I realise that we live in astonishing times where the walls of party tribalism are collapsing. In my party we are getting used to working with Comrade Sir Digby Jones and Comrade leuan Wyn Jones in the Welsh Assembly, and we hope that that will be productive. I find myself agreeing with a great deal of the document on drugs produced by the Conservative party because it at least acknowledges the failure of drugs policy since 1971 in this country. I am gratified to know that fellow Conservative Members of the Council of Europe are at least likely to vote for a new convention on drugs that I hope will go through the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in September.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/2">The Minister should give a response of apology and contrition, but those are not responses that politicians usually give so I am not too optimistic about that. Instead, we will possibly hear the continuous manic optimism about the war that we have had from the Government and the Opposition for a long time. As many hon. Members will remember, we went to war for a very good reason: to ensure that the Taliban could not protect al-Qaeda, who were in the country, and that was entirely justified in my view. We also went into the war because 90 per cent. of the heroin on the streets of Britain came from Afghanistan and a solution to that was promised. That is hard to believe now. The situation after six years and after we, British taxpayers, have spent &pound;260 million on the eradication of narcotics is that we have the highest harvest of poppies ever&mdash;an increase of 59 per cent. last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/3">Furthermore, the price of heroin on the streets of Britain is the lowest that it has ever been&mdash;and still 90 per cent. of it comes from Afghanistan. In no way can that record be described as a success. There were successes on the way, but we always took three steps backs. That is the bottom line now, and no one can pretend otherwise with any conviction.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/4">We are seeing the Colombianisation of Afghanistan; we should look at what happened in Colombia when we believed that we could cut off the supply of drugs. For an argument better than anything that I can provide this morning, look to Lord Birt's strategy unit report to the former Prime Minister, which said that it had not been done&mdash;it has never been achieved. If we did achieve a reduction in Afghanistan it would be the squeeze-balloon principle. There would be an increase in production in Myanmar, north Pakistan, Kazakhstan and so on, in the same way that reductions in Colombia, which have now been reversed, resulted in increases in production in Peru and Bolivia.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/5">The problem is on the demand side. We, rather than the fields of Afghanistan, are sucking in the heroin and fuelling the problems on our streets in London, Chicago and so on. Afghanistan has suffered greatly because of our false policies and our delusion of omnipotence. The Minister spoke recently about this subject, so we know what he is likely to say this morning. He spoke about tackling corruption in Afghanistan&mdash;that is delusional. Anyone who seriously believes that they can eliminate corruption in Afghanistan&mdash;it is possible, but very unlikely that he believes it&mdash;should be treated and gently ushered away by men in white coats. It is totally unattainable. We cannot do it. Corruption is endemic; it has been there for centuries, and will continue for centuries. Our other policies are very similar, and are not practical.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/6">As I said, I support the presence of our troops in Kabul. Members present might recall a debate in Westminster Hall, in February 2006, before we went into the Helmand province. At the time, I believed that we had made great progress on reconstruction, women's education and so on. We should consolidate that progress, which I believe is possible. However, it is not possible to ensure that Karzai's rule extends to every corner of Afghanistan. Sending troops into the Helmand province was mission impossible, as it has proved to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/7">Perhaps the Minister will reflect on his attitude when we went into Afghanistan. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-07">7 February</phrase>, he answered a question about the progress that had been made on drugs. As always, his answer was true, but only partly so. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/8" class="indent">&quot;Last year saw a 21 per cent. reduction in the area of opium cultivation in Afghanistan.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/9">That is absolutely right. However, we saw only a 2 per cent. reduction in production. The area cultivated was cut down, but production went down by only 2 per cent. Since then, of course, things have got worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/10">On the same day, I asked the Minister probably the most serious question that one could ask about this matter:</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/11" class="indent">&quot;A 20 per cent. decrease in the area cultivated but only a 2 per cent. decrease in the amount of heroin produced: are we not on mission impossible, sending troops into the Helmand province, and will that not result, perversely, in an increase of violence that drives local farmers into the hands of the Taliban?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/12">That was a plea to think again given the risks that we were taking. The Minister's reply was a joke. It might even get a laugh this morning:</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/13" class="indent">&quot;No, but with respect to my hon. Friend, his policies would lead that way. It is not enough to assume that if people eat the right kind of muesli, go to first nights of Harold Pinter revivals...and read <i>The Independent</i> occasionally, the drug barons of Afghanistan will go away.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-02-07.727"><i>Official Report</i>, 7 February 2006; Vol. 442, c. 727</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/14">That got some laughter in the House, but I do not think that the families of the 56 soldiers who died after going into Afghanistan, or those of the record number of people on our streets who die using Afghan heroin would find that very amusing. That was the flip response to the very serious requests and speeches being made. I believe that going into the Helmand province was a doomed mission, and said so at the time. That question needed a serious response.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/15">Let us look at the figures. Before we were in the Helmand province, up to February 2006, we lost seven of our courageous troops, mostly as a result of accidents. Nearly all of the 56 who have died since we went into the Helmand province have done so as a result of conflict. And what do Ministers do when a policy cannot be defended? In a typical speech, I am afraid, in Washington, to an audience that I am sure was willing to be cosseted and comforted by his words, the Minister talked about an &quot;holistic approach&quot;, a &quot;joined-up rule of law&quot;, and a coherent, &quot;comprehensive approach&quot;&mdash;he mined deeply at the seam of clich&eacute;s. Members do that. They do not come up with practical policies, suggestions for change or expressions of regret at the lives lost and money wasted in Afghanistan, but attack it with a barrage of jargon and clich&eacute;s.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/16">The Minister came up with one glimpse of reality. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/17" class="indent">&quot;We are all aware of the reports suggesting there are some people in parliament and in the government&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/18">of Afghanistan&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/19" class="indent">&quot;with links to the trade.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/20">Well, congratulations! As the hon. Gentleman knows, corruption in Afghanistan goes to the heart of Government. Not so much Karzai himself, whom we all admire, but the people he has appointed as police commanders and provincial governors are, in many cases, drug dealers, former warlords, warlords now, and, in one case, a paedophile. One man was singled out for praise last November in the House when I suggested that bad people were running Afghanistan outside Kabul. It was suggested that I was being disrespectful to Mohammed Daoud, whom the then Secretary of State for Defence described as a man of idealism on whom we could really rely. A fortnight later he was sacked and replaced by someone more acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.3/21">If we really believe that we can root out corruption in Afghanistan&mdash;drugs and corruption are said to be two sides of the same coin&mdash;we are wrong. That is a mission that cannot be achieved. We must deal with the reality: we can defend the progress made around Kabul and the immediate area, but we will never succeed beyond that. There is absolutely no evidence that we can succeed. We know that in the Helmand province there is very little, if any, reconstruction, because non-governmental organisations will not go there.</p>

	<p pid="a.426.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> on obtaining the debate. I shall use the discipline that you and I have learned in the Council of Europe, Mr. Hancock, and finish my speech in four minutes, to give other hon. Members an opportunity to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/2">My only reticence about my hon. Friend's suggestion is that it recalls the good old days of the Tory party conference when I was young. People used to speak against motions&mdash;such as for the return of the death penalty&mdash;because they did not go far enough. In the present instance, my only misgiving is that the pilot is just for one section of Afghanistan. If it is the right approach, it seems to me to be common sense that we should roll it out across the whole country. There are no two ways about it, the problem is huge.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/3">This morning, I saw a BBC report about the eradication of the crop that referred to losing the poppy war. That is how it seems when we consider that Afghan farmers&mdash;or whoever it is&mdash;are chopping down the poppy crops by hand, yet we know how huge is the country and how large is the expanse that is given over to poppy production. The results achievable through chopping poppies down by hand are just a drop in the ocean, and will certainly not lead to eradication of the crop.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/4">Spraying has been suggested as an effective way to control poppy production. That happens in Colombia, and we hear the same sorts of complaints from Afghan politicians as from Colombian politicians, who said that they were against spraying of crops because of the potential health hazard to farmers. It is difficult to control where the spray goes and legitimate crops might be contaminated.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">The hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> intimated that corruption is massive in Afghanistan. Members of the Afghan Government speak against crop spraying simply because&mdash;for whatever reason&mdash;they are a part of the production problem. They are themselves corrupt and they are taking backhanders. Having said that, it is difficult to put oneself in the position of those who are up against the Taliban. The Taliban are terrorists who intend to kill people; they are there to make people's life impossible. None of us have to put up with the sorts of fear that farmers and other people in Afghanistan have to put up with. When the Taliban say &quot;Jump!&quot;, the response is &quot;How high?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/6">There is another analogy with Colombia. We must never forget that Karzai's Government does not have control of the entire country. I was part of a group that was taken to Medellin in Colombia, which is a city that the Government lost control of for a long time before regaining it. The fact that a country has one name does not mean that its Government have control everywhere, like the Government of the United Kingdom. Here, we introduce legislation and it is enforced fairly well throughout the country. That is not the case in other parts of the world, so a balance must be struck.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/7">The suggestion made by my hon. Friend is a useful one. It was discussed at the Council of Europe, where it was also suggested that we buy up the entire poppy production of Afghanistan&mdash;a suggestion that you supported, Mr. Hancock, as did other Council of Europe members. The idea was that it would cost less to do that than wage a war that we are losing. We know that the demand side is huge; some 11 million people are estimated to be addicted to heroin, of whom 3.3 million are in Europe, and I suspect that those figures are somewhat conservative. We must make a concerted effort to try to introduce policies that will be effective in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/8">I pay tribute to our troops in that country; they are doing a fantastic job. However, we should reconsider our policies on drug eradication, and my hon. Friend's suggestions go a long way to making concrete proposals that I believe will be effective.</p>

	<p pid="a.430.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> on triggering this excellent debate. All speakers on both sides have expressed an interesting variety of views, and although hon. Members have not always been in total agreement, their contributions show that everybody cares passionately about this subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.0/2">If we were ever in any doubt as to the seriousness of the situation that we are discussing, the resignation of the Afghan counter-drugs Minister and the record opium haul announced last month bring the situation into sharp focus. The impact of the crop spreads from the mountains of Afghanistan to the estates of Edinburgh in my constituency, and anyone who has seen the film &quot;Trainspotting&quot; will know exactly what I am talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.0/3">The 49 per cent. increase in opium production in Afghanistan has set a new record in world production. The country now accounts for 92 per cent. of global illicit opium production, while more than 12 per cent. of its population is involved in poppy cultivation. The opium trade is worth about $3 billion, although only a fraction of that goes into the pockets of farmers. It is estimated that the opium trade makes up about a third of Afghanistan's total economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.0/4">In a country as poor as Afghanistan, opium has a corrosive and corrupting influence on any institution that it touches. Other hon. Members will have read reports that some of the biggest drug barons are reputedly members of the national and provincial governments and even include figures close to President Karzai.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.0/5">The scale of the problem is huge, and the question is how we approach it and what solutions we can offer. As other hon. Members have said, everyone accepts the scale of the problem, but there is major disagreement about the best way to tackle it. Eradication is one possibility, but a growing school of thought suggests that, as the situation deteriorates, the only course will be the aggressive eradication of poppy fields across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.0/6">The United States has been a key proponent of a more aggressive eradication campaign involving aerial spraying. If the only aim were to destroy the plants, perhaps that would be the best way to proceed. However, when between a third and a half of the Afghan economy depends on the opium trade, with 12 per cent. of the population involved and with unemployment already at more than 40 per cent., to adopt such a heavy-handed tactic would, in my view, be a social and economic disaster and would have massive knock-on implications for the security situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.0/7">The sight of UK or US soldiers or even Afghan Government workers forcibly destroying crops and therefore livelihoods would provide an immediate boost to Taliban recruitment propaganda. UK commanders routinely warn that an aggressive, eradication-based approach would drastically worsen the security situation. In Helmand, British military commanders have consistently warned that attempts to eradicate the poppy crop without providing alternative incomes will simply increase hostility to foreign troops and boost Taliban support. I support British officials on the ground who say that their priority is to attack the drug traffickers and their laboratories before embarking on a programme to provide Afghans with alternative crops.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.0/8">The option mentioned by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East is very interesting. It is one argument put forward by the Senlis Council.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-11a.439.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1506" speakername="David Jones" colnum="439"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070711/halltext/70711h0004.htm#07071179000579">
	<p pid="a.439.3/1">All motor insurance companies are subject to an obligation to submit data to the database within 14 days of the</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/2" class="indent">&quot;inception, change, cancellation, lapse or renewal&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/3">of all motor insurance policies, and penalties exist for failing to provide such details.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/4">By virtue of regulations introduced in 2003, insurers are liable to a fine of &pound;5,000 for failing to provide information, for making a statement that is known to be false in a material particular, or for recklessly making a statement which is false in a material particular. The target time for providing data to the database will be reduced to seven days from the beginning of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/5">According to a parliamentary answer, already,</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/6" class="indent">&quot;94.4 per cent. of all appropriate records are provided to the...database...within seven days.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-07-02.924"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 July 2007; Vol. 462, c. 924W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/7">It seems at first sight that the database is being maintained to a highly accurate level. However, given that there are some 33 million insured vehicles on the roads and, based on the Department's figures, there is a 5.6 per cent. level of inaccuracy, it follows that the insurance details of around 1.5 million vehicles may not be accurately recorded on the database at any one time. That is hardly surprising because tens of thousands of motor vehicles change hands every day, and thousands of policyholders change their insurers to obtain a better deal. The consequences of such inaccuracy can be serious. I was first alerted to the problem, and was prompted to apply for this debate after I was approached some three weeks ago by my constituent, Mrs. Maureen Smith, of Rhos-on-Sea. Her story illustrates the difficulties that can arise from a database that is not accurately maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/8">Mrs. Smith had lent her car to her daughter, Mrs. Helen Parry. Mrs. Parry, who is 29, maintains her own motor insurance policy, which permits her to drive a vehicle owned by another person, with that person's consent. On her way home, which was only a few miles away, Mrs. Parry was stopped by North Wales police officers, who were apparently carrying out a routine check. The officers, on being given particulars of her identity, told her that a check on the database indicated that she was not insured to drive the vehicle. Mrs. Parry explained that, although the car belonged to her parents, she was insured to drive it under the terms of her own policy. The officers checked the database again and told Mrs. Parry that that was not the case because she was not insured, so they seized the car. She was relieved of the keys and was obliged to stand in the rain at the side of the road until her mother, the car owner whom she had called on her mobile phone, appeared on the scene. For the sake of completeness, I should mention that Mrs. Parry, who is a nurse, was at that time 20 weeks pregnant.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/9">On arrival, Mrs. Smith told the police officers that, irrespective of their views of the legality or otherwise of Mrs. Parry driving the car, they were aware that she, Mrs. Smith, was insured to drive it and asked for her keys back. The police officers refused to return the keys, and Mrs. Smith was obliged to attend Llandudno police station, where she had to pay a &pound;105 fee for the release of her own vehicle. At the same time, Mrs. Parry, her daughter, produced documentary evidence that she was indeed insured to drive the vehicle. By then, she had been issued with a fixed penalty of &pound;200 and her licence had been endorsed with six penalty points.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/10">To the immense credit of North Wales police, when they discovered the error, they arranged for Mrs. Parry's endorsement and penalty to be cancelled and for Mrs. Smith's &pound;105 to be returned to her. To be fair to North Wales police, they went beyond the call of duty and presented her with a large bouquet of flowers.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/11">It seems that the information provided by Mrs. Smith's insurers. Direct Line, to the motor insurance database, was erroneous, and I have since discovered that the details of around 400,000 motorists insured by that company had not been provided to the database within the required time frame, so it is unclear how many other policyholders have experienced similar difficulties. Direct Line told me yesterday that it has now supplied the required information to the database, albeit very late.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/12">Another example of the problems that can arise from inaccuracies in the database was recently outlined to me by Mrs. Jane Groves of Liverpool. Last month, Mrs. Groves decided to change her insurer from Asda to the Post Office, naming her partner on the policy as an authorised driver. She did that by telephone, as many policyholders do. Two days after she had changed her insurer, her partner was stopped by the police, who had consulted the database and discovered that the Asda policy had been cancelled, but not that the new policy had been issued. Mrs. Groves's car was seized, and it was not until she received a faxed copy of her motor insurance certificate from her new insurer some two days later that she was able to recover her car. She also had to pay a release fee of &pound;105, but so far has not had it refunded. Indeed, she may well never have it refunded because the seizure was legal as it was based on the information on the database.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/13">I have asked the Home Office for the number of occasions on which vehicles have been seized under section 165A of the 1988 Act, but was surprised to be informed that that information is not collected centrally. I suggest that the Home Office should arrange to collate such information because I suspect that there may be a large number of such cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/14">Indeed, another constituent of mine has contacted me to say that recently he had a lucky escape from such a seizure, and I have also been told of a wedding party in Sheffield which was deprived of its vehicle on the way to church because of a similar problem. I am consequently grateful for having had the opportunity to highlight the problem today.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/15">I repeat that I consider section 165A of the 1988 Act to be necessary and desirable. The database is an essential component in the drive to rid our roads of uninsured drivers. They are a menace to others, and they cost honest motorists hundreds of millions of pounds per annum. The problem lies not so much with the database, as with the way in which it is used by the police, and the promptness with which insurers update it. It is accepted that the database will always be less than 100 per cent. accurate; that must be the case, and there are many reasons why.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/16">At the lowest level, there is the inevitable administrative delay while the insurer supplies the necessary information to the database to record the issue of the new policy. That normally takes place well within the target 14 days. Indeed, the seven-day target, which will be introduced in 2008, is already met in the vast majority of cases. However, there have been occasions&mdash;I have been alerted to one such incident by a constituent of mine, Mr Anstey, of Old Colwyn&mdash;on which the insurers have failed to provide details of the amendment to the database for many weeks after the policy was issued. I have already referred to what appears to have been a flagrant omission on the part of a major UK insurer.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/17">Certainly, penalties exist for failing to provide the information, but such penalties should be imposed far more vigorously to ensure that insurers comply with their reporting obligations. Further, although penalties exist for failing to provide the information, or for recklessly providing inaccurate information, penalties do not exist for providing inaccurate information negligently. Police officers ought also to be aware of the problem of delay and to exercise a degree of common sense and discretion when, for example, the policy has apparently lapsed very shortly before the motorist is stopped. Mrs Groves's case is a prime example, and in such cases, further inquiries ought sensibly to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/18">Police officers ought not to be heavy-handed in their use of the database. However, in many police forces there is a target-driven culture, with officers encouraged to amass a certain number of points during a particular period, and with a varying number of points given for various offences. Certainly, such a system prevailed in north Wales until recently. It amounts almost to an encouragement to police officers to seize the vehicle, issue the fixed penalty notice and leave it to the motorist to argue the toss later. That cannot be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/19">Finally, I suggest that insurance companies that do not do what is necessary to help to maintain as accurate a database as possible by providing accurate information in a timely manner should be obliged to compensate motorists for losses incurred when a vehicle is seized as a consequence. The database, in short, should be treated as a very useful tool, but not as infallible; police officers should be told of the need to use it with discretion and common sense. There should, further, be uniformity in such guidance. Again, in an answer to a parliamentary question, I was surprised to learn that, at present, the issue is left to individual forces as an operational matter. If police officers do not use discretion, injustices of the sort experienced by Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Parry, Mrs Groves and, I have no doubt, many others will continue to occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/20">I am pleased to have had the opportunity to raise the issue in this short debate, and I look forward to the Minister's response to my points.</p>

	<p pid="a.442.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1506" name="David Jones">the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing this important debate. He has reflected very well the experiences of his constituents, who obviously suffered some distress.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/2">It would be helpful if I first said a little more about the motor insurance database. As the hon. Gentleman said, it was established by the insurance industry in 2001 as a way of trying to tackle some of the problems of motor insurance evasion. Like me, he knows that our constituents are very worried about the issue. We receive numerous complaints from people who think that in their street, there is a vehicle that is not insured. The issue causes a great deal of anxiety, and it is good that a system exists to try to tackle it.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/3">Until the end of 2002, the data on the database were provided on a voluntary basis by the industry, but in 2003 the Government approved the Motor Insurers Bureau as the motor insurance information centre required by the European motor insurance directives. The role has been strengthened, because following on from that, it has become a statutory requirement for all insurers to provide the MIB with details of all motor insurance policies issued, together with details of all vehicles covered by such policies. There is also a legal obligation on policyholders to provide the requisite information.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/4">The database is owned and operated by the MIB, which in turn is owned by the insurance industry. Apart from operating the motor insurance database, the MIB's other activities include processing claims from the innocent victims of uninsured drivers and untraced&mdash;hit and run&mdash;drivers, under agreements with the Secretary of State. The bureau also acts as the UK green card bureau, dealing with claims from accidents caused by foreign motorists visiting the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/5">The main uses of the database are, first, to provide to a person injured as a result of an accident with a motor vehicle, details of the insurance company involved; and, secondly, to provide information to the police for enforcement purposes to tackle the significant social problem of uninsured driving.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/6">The hon. Gentleman set out clearly the bad experiences of his constituents, which resulted from incorrect data supplied to the police by an insurer. The problem also occurred as a result of the insurer failing to update correctly the motor insurance database. Such incidents are distressing, and it is right that we and the industry do everything we can to minimise the likelihood of their occurrence.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/7">The provision of data to the MID is the responsibility of the insurance industry, but it has made substantial efforts to ensure that the database is fit for purpose. It is also true that the insurance industry is exceeding our current data submission requirements by delivering 97.5 per cent. of data within 14 days. Almost 99 per cent. of all new records are on the database within 14 days, and 94.8 per cent. of all appropriate records are now placed on the database within seven days. It is ahead of our expectations to meet the target of 95 per cent. by January next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/8">The hon. Gentleman is right that we should be concerned about the accuracy of the database, and ensure that it is fit for purpose. Fit for purpose includes accuracy and timeliness, of course, but we must also consider its effectiveness in tackling known problems, and the effectiveness of the safeguards that are built in to ensure that, as far as possible, experiences such as those of Mrs. Parry and the other people whom the hon. Gentleman mentioned are kept to a minimum or, we hope, completely avoided.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/9">If we consider the figures, it is worth remembering that the police make some 3 million inquiries per month on the database, which is more than one per second, and that more than 1,500 vehicles per week are seized for being used without insurance. The number of vehicles wrongly identified as uninsured is not known, but the police have assured us that such instances are rare, and fewer than a handful of cases have been brought to the attention of the Home Office or the Department for Transport since June 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/10">Our view that police seizure powers and their use of the MID are working well is strongly supported by the drop in the number of claims made to the MIB by the innocent victims of uninsured drivers. As the hon. Gentleman said, the database and the system are fulfilling their key aim. In 2006, the number of claims dropped by 4.2 per cent., and so far this year, uninsured driving claims have similarly decreased. I am sure that he welcomes that.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/11">The database is also an integral part of the checking process for motorists wishing to use the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's electronic vehicle licensing system, which depends critically on the MID. The system has made a difference for the 9.5 million motorists who have successfully used it. Our evidence so far suggests that the information provided by the MID is very good. For the police, it is proving extremely valuable in tackling the problem of uninsured driving.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/12">As for safeguards, the police have every interest in not seizing vehicles incorrectly. Not only is it a waste of their time, but it incurs storage costs and creates bad public relations. We must accept that the police will do their best not to cause motorists unnecessary distress. The MIB helpline provides a quick way to obtain insurance information, but checks can still be made directly with insurers. The MIB also uses a system to audit individual insurers' update performance and seeks to enforce increasingly tight standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/13">I think that the hon. Gentleman recognises that it will probably not be possible to avoid every single incident. We must be realistic in acknowledging that. We should also recognise that such unfortunate incidents should not detract from the MID's general assistance to the police in detecting uninsured drives. It is always regrettable when a vehicle is seized in error, and I recognise the distress and inconvenience that it can cause, but we have one of the highest rates in Europe of uninsured driving. Seizing 1,500 vehicles a week sends an important message that people must be insured. Despite all that, he raised some important points, and I do not want him to think that the Government are in any way complacent about them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-11a.451.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" speakername="Charles Hendry" colnum="451"  time="014:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070711/halltext/70711h0006.htm#07071179000590">
	<p pid="a.451.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. My constituency has not suffered in the floods of the past few weeks, but we suffered quite seriously in the floods of 2000, as did the neighbouring constituency of Lewes. The thoughts of my constituents are with the people who have been so terribly affected by the recent floods. Their hearts go out to them and they understand the devastation that has been caused and felt.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.0/2">I wanted to make a brief speech to talk about what has happened since the 2000 floods and the lessons that can perhaps be learned from them. We were all terribly impressed by the immediate reaction. The then Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" name="Elliot Morley">the right hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley)</phrase>, came down within days and toured the site. Shortly afterwards there was a meeting in Downing street, organised by the then Prime Minister, who brought in the leaders of all the affected local authorities and gave them an absolute commitment that lessons would be learned, money spent and steps taken to prevent such floods from happening again. He could not prevent it from raining&mdash;even that Prime Minister could not do that&mdash;but he promised to put in place relevant measures to prevent the flooding from happening again. We then had another visit from the then Minister, who echoed that promise at a meeting in his office to talk about the issues of concern. Since then absolutely nothing of concrete, literally, has been built to prevent future flooding. That is a great lesson that we must learn, because the same has been the case in many constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.0/3">We had a consultation process and everybody agreed that what was needed was upstream storage to prevent a huge volume of water from coming into the town of Uckfield or the small surrounding villages that had been affected. A model was built, on which one hundred and something thousand pounds were spent, and it cleverly proved that if one poured water into the model, it would eventually come over the top somewhere. Without &pound;100,000 being spent, we think that we could have told them that.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.0/4">Now, nearly seven years on, there is a proposal for a small bund in the town, and I am encouraged by the approach that the Environment Agency is taking to that. It would stop minor flooding but not the type of serious flooding that we saw in October 2000. The reason why such flooding would not be prevented, we were told, is that we simply do not score enough points. Uckfield is a busy market town in the middle of Sussex, yet it does not score enough points because not enough houses were flooded. We need a system that takes into account the real needs on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.0/5">Nearly seven years on, the flood risk remains and the likelihood has increased. We were told in October 2000 that flooding would be experienced once every 50 or 100 years but we now know that, with global warming and climate change, such events can be expected more regularly. People continue to have problems insuring their homes, because no defences have been put in place. Insurance companies have said, &quot;We will insure your homes if money is spent on flood defences, but if not, we are not prepared to provide the insurance.&quot; The biggest employment area in East Sussex, the Bell lane industrial estate, finds it difficult to attract new investment because of the risk that businesses may again be flooded and destroyed. Above all, we want the Minister to say today that he will honour the commitment that was made by the then Prime Minister and the then Minister that defences would be put in place to prevent such flooding from happening again.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.0/6">I wanted to be brief, because I am well aware that many other Members wish to speak. In opening the debate, the hon. Member for Selby said that he wanted to ensure that funding did not ebb once the great floods of 2007 started to be forgotten. That is exactly what happened to many of our communities that were flooded in 2000&mdash;we feel that we have been forgotten. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that he understands the commitment that was made by his predecessors and intends to honour it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-11a.457.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1814" speakername="Angela Smith" colnum="457"  time="015:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070711/halltext/70711h0007.htm#07071179000594">
	<p pid="a.457.0/1">Let me start by making it clear that there was damage and suffering across the country, which should remind us all of the importance of not claiming precedence for any one area in terms of its suffering. In that sense, it is unfortunate that Hull has claimed to be the forgotten city, because many areas have suffered serious flooding, and they include not only Hull, but the north and south banks of the Humber, Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley, Doncaster and elsewhere. We are all in this together, and it is important to remember that.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/2">Let me refer briefly to what happened in Sheffield. I want to do so partly to place that on the record; we have so far been unable to do so. I note that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase> is here today. It is important that we put what happened in Sheffield on the record because it underlines the significance of this debate about flood defence and flood prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/3">The industrial damage in Sheffield has been well documented in the media. Corus had to close. Georgia-Pacific, a paper mill in my constituency, is now up for sale. Cadbury Trebor Bassett was also affected. Meadowhall, one of the biggest retail malls in the country, is still suffering and is now only partially open. Furthermore, it is often forgotten that hundreds of smaller engineering companies depend for their business on larger companies such as Forgemasters and Corus. Some of those smaller companies were also underinsured.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/4">Many jobs in the city are at risk. The city has regenerated over recent years and desperately needs the help promised yesterday by the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. Those jobs are critical; indeed, the most important point over the long term is probably that we preserve them and prevent them from disappearing. The future of South Yorkshire's economy is at stake.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/5">It is often forgotten in all this that small charities and community centres are badly damaged in such circumstances, and they are not always well insured. The Newton Hall community centre in Chapeltown in my constituency was flooded twice, on Friday the 15th and Monday the 25th. People there are now worrying about whether they can continue their good work in the local community. In addition, the A6102 Middlewood road north suffered a 60 ft landslip and will, even with the best of efforts and immediate funding&mdash;the funding needed for just that one small stretch of road is in the region of &pound;2 million&mdash;not be open until 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/6">One old people's home in my constituency was evacuated twice, on Friday the 15th and Monday the 25th. Its residents are dementia sufferers, and their distress will be obvious to all, so I do not need to explain it. On top of that, a nursing home in Stocksbridge was flooded on Monday the 25th.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/7">There were moments of light humour. One woman in Winn Gardens described to me how she found a frog on her mantelpiece once the flood water receded, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside will remember that. However, residents from Mill lane, Deepcar, and Station road, Oughtibridge, were evacuated from their homes, and they are still not back. Most seriously of all, Falding street in Chapeltown was flooded twice, on Friday the 15th and Monday the 25th. It was flooded not by the River Don, but by a local beck, and that underlines the seriousness of the situation. The cause of that flooding appears to have been a blocked culvert, which underlines the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase>, and I shall return to that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/8">There were heroes in all this. An individual called Craig Stenton not only rescued a boy from the beck in Chapeltown on Friday the 15th and saved his life, but rescued a local family from Falding street on Monday the 25th. Members of the family could not get out of their house, so he took them out on his shoulders and in dinghies. There were heroes, and the situation brought out the community spirit.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/9">What do we need to do? There are several things that we need to do, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> underlined many of them. First, we need a rigorous reassessment of the flood risk. I got some maps for my area from the Environment Agency website. I live at the top of the Don valley and I am told that my flood risk is 0.l per cent. That proved to be true on Monday the 25th. The residents at the top of Winn Gardens were told that their flood risk was low, and that, indeed, proved to be the case, because the flooding of Winn Gardens stopped halfway up the estate. The people at the bottom of Winn Gardens were told that their risk was very high&mdash;so far, so good. The people of Falding street, however, were told that their risk was moderate, and of all the residential areas in Sheffield, theirs suffered the most. They have nothing left of their homes&mdash;their floorboards and everything else has gone. I visited the area twice, and the memories of what I saw&mdash;the raw emotions of the residents of Falding street&mdash;will remain with me for ever. So, too, will the bitter taste that the contaminated mud and muck left in one's mouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/10">People who live close to rivers, becks, streams, the sea and the coast need the best possible information and assessments from the Environment Agency. We therefore need a reassessment&mdash;perhaps in recognition of climate change&mdash;of what the genuine risk may be. That risk needs to be more widely publicised, and we need a debate about the issue. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs also needs to front-load its spending on flood defence and flood prevention. However, it needs to allocate that budget according to a rigorous assessment of risk and in a transparent manner&mdash;we need a debate about what is necessary and where the priorities are.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/11">If we had asked any citizen of Sheffield whether they thought that they would ever be flooded, they would have said, &quot;No, we live on a hill.&quot; Sheffield is built on seven hills, and nobody thought that it would ever be flooded. We have never suffered this before. The only other great flood in Sheffield was in 1864 and was the result of a dam bursting its banks because it had not been properly engineered or finished. However, we have never suffered before the flooding that we experienced recently and we need a reassessment of the risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/12">We need to do more to make home owners and tenants aware of the level of risk that they face, and to give advice on how to minimise that risk. A pilot scheme is under way at the moment involving a &pound;500,000 flood resilience grant from DEFRA. That is being tested and entails advising people on how to protect their homes from flood with water-resistant floors and walls, putting sockets higher up the walls to protect the electrics, and so on. Members of the House need to be made aware of the outcome of the pilot. If it proves to be a worthwhile exercise, and to save money in floods, we should roll it out, and I look to DEFRA to provide the funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/13">We need to examine water management infrastructure again. My hon. Friend the Member for Selby pointed out that drains are the responsibility of local authorities, rivers and becks are the responsibility of the Environment Agency, and sewers are the responsibility of the water boards. That does not make sense. We need an over-arching body to oversee the maintenance of those waterways, and I agree with him that the local authority is probably the most appropriate body. However, we need to reconsider how effectively local authorities maintain their drainage systems. The comprehensive performance assessment includes in its performance indicators the cleanliness of public space and the condition of unclassified roads, but not the maintenance of the drainage system. My hon. Friend the Minister was a local government Minister so he may understand what needs to be done about that. Perhaps he will pass the message on.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/14">We need a flood defence strategy that gives the necessary protection and gives insurers no excuse to refuse insurance to anyone in this country who lives in a potential flood area. We need to work with the insurance companies to ensure that they stick by their statement of principles and that the Government's work is, if hon. Members will excuse the pun, watertight, with the result that the insurance companies will come up with premiums that are manageable and affordable for everyone.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/15">I live in S6 in Sheffield. I phoned up for a renewal of my insurance policy last week and was refused insurance even though my flood risk is less than 0.1 per cent. DEFRA needs to do something to ensure that the Association of British Insurers gets a grip on what is happening with insurance companies, and that they stick by their statement of principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.0/16">Finally, I want to mention the moorland management project that my hon. Friend the Member for Selby referred to. It is true that much of the water that came down the River Don on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">Monday 25 June</phrase> originated in the Peak district. We have degraded our blanket bogs to the extent that they are now emitters rather than absorbers of carbon. They have been drained, over-grazed and polluted by the acid rain from Manchester and Sheffield, and, although my hon. Friend the Minister lives on the wrong side of the Pennines, he at least understands the problem. DEFRA needs to put more money into moorland management and the restoration of the blanket bogs, because, more than anything, along with adequate drainage systems and flood defences, it is the restoration of our natural moorland habitats in the Pennines that will probably protect large parts of the urban populations in the north.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-11a.463.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" speakername="Christopher Huhne" colnum="463"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070711/halltext/70711h0008.htm#07071179000606">
	<p pid="a.463.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Hancock, it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. I will try to be as brief as possible to give the Minister time to reply to the many interesting and important issues. I have two key points to which I should like the Minister to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/2">The first key issue is that of the co-ordination of flood defences and flood prevention. The reality is that in many areas there has clearly been surface water flooding. For example, in Hull, which I visited last Tuesday, the floods were simply caused by an enormous inundation&mdash;4 in&mdash;of rainfall in one day. Monsoon levels of rainfall overwhelmed an already high water table caused by the large amount of rain in the previous weeks and overwhelmed the drainage system. In addition to that, I am told&mdash;I would like confirmation from the Minister on this&mdash;that one of the pumping stations operated by Yorkshire Water could not operate at full capacity because it was not proofed against the inundations suffered in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/3">There are a number of clear lessons to be learned. One is that we need to bring the water companies into the planning process and ensure that it is properly co-ordinated. Local authorities, drainage boards, the Environment Agency, the water companies, and therefore Ofwat, all have a responsibility for prevention and flood defence measures in low-lying areas. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> pointed out that Yorkshire Water was only invited to silver command on Wednesday and that there has not been joined-up thinking between the relevant bodies. The truth is that the Government were aware of that some time ago because in March 2005 in its first response to the Autumn 2004 consultation exercise &quot;Making Space for Water&quot; the Government clearly state:</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/4" class="indent">&quot;So as to facilitate an holistic approach that is risk-driven, the Government will work towards giving the Environment Agency an overarching strategic overview across all flooding and coastal erosion risks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/5">That must obviously include surface and ground water flooding. The timeline at the back of the Government's response clearly states that there should be an</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/6" class="indent">&quot;Extension of Environment Agency's strategic role to other forms of flooding and coastal erosion&mdash;legislative and organisational considerations&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/7">and a consideration of the impact. The timeline for that was due to finish at the end of 2006, but such is the revolving door of Ministers going through the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&mdash;usually on promotion to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office after some incredible mishap&mdash;it seems that nothing has happened about completing that. I know that the Minister is new to his role, but it is terribly important that he does not just say what the Government said in 2005, but that he delivers the joined-up co-ordination that is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/8">The second point that I shall make in the one and a half minutes remaining to me concerns the budget. The truth is that last August there was a &pound;14 million cut in the flood defence budget. We know the consequences of that from the evidence that Barbara Young, the chief executive of the Environment Agency, gave to the Select Committee on Public Accounts. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/9" class="indent">&quot;one of the casualties of our cuts mid-year last year was the pace at which we were able to do catchment flood management plans.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/10">Ultimately, that had an effect on capital expenditure because there were delays in, for example, feasibility work. Whenever that has been raised in the House, Ministers say, &quot;But the capital budget was not cut.&quot; That is a disingenuous response because the truth is that the overall flood management budget was cut. I am told, and it has not been denied by any DEFRA Minister in either of the two statements that have been made, that the Treasury was on the prowl and was waiting for more cuts just before the latest floods. Indeed the Environment Agency sent out to the regional boards a document requiring them to plan on</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/11" class="indent">&quot;flat cash in line with our current 2007/08 baseline&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/12">this was sent out last month&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/13" class="indent">&quot;with any growth limited to capital investment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/14">The truth is that the only reason that we have had a U-turn and an increase in the budget to &pound;800 million, which I am delighted about, is precisely because of the recent floods. It is crucial to establish&mdash;again perhaps the Minister can enlighten us on this&mdash; whether the Treasury is up to its old tricks on the budget. It has given us an &pound;800 million figure for 2010-11, but no figure for next year or the year after. The last time the Government announced a substantial increase in the flood defence budget they did exactly the same thing; they made a big increase in the last year of the three-year plan and had a low build-up to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/15">From what we have heard today, it is clear that a much more substantial commitment to public funding for flood defences needs to be made and to start as soon as possible. This issue needs to be far higher up the Government's list of priorities. More people have been killed in the floods over the last few weeks than in the terrorism incidents that have perhaps unfortunately overshadowed the need to plan for flooding. The fact that the flooding incidents happened slowly, unexpectedly and less dramatically than the terrorist incidents does not mean that they are any less of a serious matter of national security. Climate change means that we will have more enormous inundations and monsoon-like rainfalls and it is precisely because of that that we need to ensure that we are properly prepared. The Government are not properly prepared either in terms of co-ordination or budgets and it is about time that they were.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-11a.465.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1896" speakername="Anne McIntosh" colnum="465"  time="015:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070711/halltext/70711h0008.htm#07071179000607">
	<p pid="a.465.0/1">This is a timely debate and I congratulate my constituency neighbour, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase>, on securing it. He has touched a chord. All of us would wish to remember not just the loss of life, but, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1814" name="Angela Smith">the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith)</phrase>, said, the loss of possessions, the intrusion into homes and those removed from their homes for some time.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/2">In particular, I hope that the Minister will comment on the losses in rural and farming communities, where insured losses are estimated at &pound;10 million, but where uninsured losses will probably reach &pound;15 million. I join those who have paid tribute to the emergency services.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/3">The Chief Fire Officers Association labelled the non-joined-up thinking after the flooding as &quot;institutional confusion&quot;. Will the Minister say that there should be an end to the confusion and that there should be one lead body and lead Department? At the moment, too many Departments are involved&mdash;DEFRA, the DCLG, the Department of Health, the Home Office, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the Treasury and, potentially, the Cabinet Office, through its resilience responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/4">Let us consider also the local response: district and county councils, unitary councils, internal drainage boards, environmental health services, social services, private insurance companies, the Environment Agency, the Highways Agency, and the police, fire, ambulance and health services. If we learn nothing else from the tragedy of the most recent floods, can we please end this confusion and have one lead body? I would argue that one of the emergency services&mdash;the fire service would seem to be a good start&mdash;could work with and co-ordinate everyone else. We need also one lead Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/5">Will the Minister ensure that we learn those lessons? My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase> has mentioned already the flood alleviation scheme in Pickering in his constituency, but a further three such schemes in north Yorkshire have not gone ahead, about which the Minister should perhaps feel a little embarrassed. One is in Thirsk in my constituency. Another scheme would have benefited the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> and residents living in Hedon and Burstwick, near Hull. The Hull tidal surge barrier was perhaps the biggest such scheme and would have helped the whole of the Hull area.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-18">18 January</phrase>, a press release on the Environment Agency's website promised that those schemes would go ahead. For his own benefit, the Minister might like to find out why the schemes for Pickering, Thirsk, Hull, Hedon and Burstwick did not go ahead. I think that it detracts from the excellent work of the Environment Agency and all of the emergency services when we learn that those schemes were due to happen this year, but did not proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/7">Furthermore, will the Minister look at the abysmal and flawed warnings that are often given? The Environment Agency relies on very modern equipment and asks people to refer to its website. From the houses that I saw in Toll Bar, however, I do not think that a home computer was top on the list of priorities for home furnishings. For the most part, people did not have access to home computers. Many people, if they were not at home, did not receive flood warnings, either by phone or mobile phone.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/8">Can we consider an updated system, such as the one that worked very well after the floods in 2000 on the outskirts of York&mdash;in areas such as Rawcliffe in the Vale of York&mdash;where parish councillors acted as voluntary wardens and went round giving flood warnings? I understand that in Toll Bar, the police were wandering around giving flood warnings as the floods were actually entering people's homes. That is another lesson that we have to learn. We need the most modern and effective system for reaching people in time so that they can evacuate their homes and take their possessions with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/9">On planning permission, the Environment Agency is a statutory consultee, but will the Minister take the Government one step further and give it the power to block planning applications in inappropriate places such as on functional flood plains? It simply is not fair that the owner has to be aware of it, and I do not think that it is relevant to make the developer liable either, which was a question put to the Prime Minister today. Let us consider the Thames Gateway, where it is proposed to build houses and blocks of flats on stilts. If we know that they are going to flood, is it really fair to invite people to live in them? I ask the Minister to look very carefully at how those planning decisions are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/10">On affordability and availability of insurance, for many people in deprived areas, insurance can literally be unaffordable. Toll Bar, in particular, is a very deprived area. It is a former mining community. I think that many parts of Hull and Sheffield might fall into similar low-income categories. It is not out of a lack of good will that people did not want to insure their homes; they had to make a lifestyle decision and they felt that they could not afford insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/11">Will the Minister ensure that in future cover is extended to those who have been flooded and remain at risk of flooding? Some businesses in north Yorkshire suffered hugely between 2000 and 2005. Will he ensure a level playing field? I welcome the support that the Government are giving through business grants to areas of south and east Yorkshire, where businesses have suffered. However, I believe that that money should be made available to others. May I provide him with the names and addresses of businesses that suffered between 2000 and 2005 because either they did not have insurance or they have not gone back to operating full-scale businesses such as dental practices? May I make representations to him about that? I hope that he will have regard to them and take them on board. Also, given the losses and heartfelt pleas made today, will he promise a full Government inquiry into the damage caused, and look at how much was caused because flood defence schemes, such as those mentioned today, did not go ahead?</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/12">I gather that many pumping and electricity stations are built in areas prone to flooding. Sometimes, pumping stations are not functioning because the electricity substations are flooded. Perhaps that is an additional point for the Minister. I know that that happened in Selby and Beverley. I hope that he will take that on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/13">Finally, allowing the Minister plenty of time to wind up, may I ask him to promise to streamline the decision-making process and put one body in charge in order to remove confusion, and to have a one-stop shop for advice so that people know who to turn to for sandbags, skips and portaloos? That will enable victims of flooding, on the day and in the following months, to know exactly who to turn to. Furthermore, will he have regard to waterlogged land that has been contaminated? I know that a partial derogation has been granted, which the farming community welcomes strongly, but will his Department also allow farmers to enter waterlogged land that may be set aside, so that they can salvage what crops they can? There is perhaps a misunderstanding there. If they do so, farmers might infringe cross-compliance rules for flooded land that is set aside.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/14">It is absolutely true that &pound;14 million was cut from the flood budget. Let us remind ourselves why that money was cut: because the Government failed to implement the single farm payments on time. It is perverse that through the fault of one part of the Department, other areas, up and down the country, have suffered subsequently.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/15">Will the Minister review the fact that farmers are paying a levy to internal drainage boards to drain ditches and other areas such as the outflow of main tributaries? Many of the rivers that flooded have not been dredged for years and are full of debris and choked with plant matter that prevents and impedes water flow, and the result is flooding of farmland.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.0/16">On a positive note, one of the Minister's predecessors, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" name="Elliot Morley">the right hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley)</phrase>, enjoys in his own constituency a pilot scheme whereby flood alleviation scheme money is provided&mdash;partially, I think, through the EU European development fund&mdash;to allow upstream land to flood. The scheme allows farmers to be reimbursed for the resultant loss of land from production. It seems rather bizarre that a former Minister with responsibility for flooding has such land. Will the Minister say whether we can have some of that money in the rural areas that we represent, and will he ensure that the schemes, if successful, are trialled throughout the country?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-11a.471.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1978" speakername="Gavin Strang" colnum="471"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070711/halltext/70711h0009.htm#07071179000614">
	<p pid="a.471.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to bring to the House the case for keeping open the Jobcentre Plus benefits delivery centre in my constituency&mdash;a benefits centre acknowledged to be one of the most efficient in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/2">It might be helpful if I sketched out a little of the history of benefits delivery and processing on the east side of Edinburgh. Until a few years ago, there were two offices that people living in Portobello and the surrounding area could visit in connection with unemployment and benefits: a job centre in Windsor place, Portobello, and a social security office, Phoenix house, on Portobello high street.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/3">Following the 2004 spending review and the Gershon report, the Department for Work and Pensions was obliged to reduce the number of its staff by 30,000 full-time equivalent posts by the end of March 2008. Half of those&mdash;15,000 full-time equivalent staff&mdash;were to come from Jobcentre Plus. An efficiency programme was put in place, and about 630 offices were earmarked for closure, among which originally were both Portobello offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/4">I was pleased that the efforts made by myself, as the local Member of Parliament, and by the trade union, the Public and Commercial Services Union, led to the Government pulling back from the proposition that Phoenix house would be one of the offices to be closed. Talking to managers in the Department for Work and Pensions at Edinburgh level, Scottish level and head-office level proved to be constructive. At the time, the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus was David Anderson; so far I have not yet sought a meeting on this issue with the new chief executive, Ms Lesley Strathie.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/5">This is the first time that I have put this issue on the record in the House of Commons, but I must say that I was not at all happy about the final geographical distribution of offices throughout the city of Edinburgh implemented as part of the Jobcentre Plus roll-out. It is true that the representations made by the union and I resulted in the retention of the office at Phoenix house, Portobello. The site is a good one: the building was purpose-built by the then Department of Social Security; it is highly accessible by public transport; and there is a good availability of staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/6">What I deeply regretted, and still do, is that the decision was taken that Phoenix house would cease to be an office that is open to the public, and that my constituents from Newcraighall, Craigmillar, Niddrie, Portobello, Craigentinny and the greater Portobello area could no longer visit it for advice and help. Given the deprivation in the east of the city and the number of cases being handled per week at Portobello, which is significantly more, for example, than at the Wester Hailes office, a better balance would have been to have had an improved facility at Leith&mdash;a good public office, as exists now; let me emphasise that&mdash;and to retain the office in Portobello as a centre also open to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/7">My constituents now have to go to the Edinburgh High Riggs office or to the Leith office. That aside, the important decisions that were taken maintained a configuration of offices that still saw a role for the vital Portobello Phoenix house office. No longer open to the public, the Portobello office has become a benefit delivery centre, dealing with social fund claims. It is by no means a small office. It is a significant operation in Portobello, with about 95 staff. The team processes social fund claims; indeed, from <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-04">4 June</phrase>, all social fund applications in the Edinburgh, Lothian and the borders area have been processed at the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/8">Given the backdrop of where the Government are going nationally, with benefits processing being done at large centres, the decision to do all social fund processing for Edinburgh, Leith and the borders area at Phoenix house is wise and constructive in the circumstances. It is now a settled and practical arrangement that is wholly consistent with the existence of major processing centres at Bathgate and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/9">My hon. Friend the Minister will be aware that we are in the middle of a sharp contraction of DWP staff in the Edinburgh area. Her colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" name="James Plaskitt">the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt)</phrase> wrote to me in May to advise me that the debt management unit with 28 jobs at Argyle house in the centre of Edinburgh in my constituency will close in March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/10">When the Department was closing the Castle terrace office, which was also in the centre of Edinburgh in my constituency, the staff were offered the opportunity to move to the large processing centre at Bathgate in west Lothian or to Portobello. Clearly, that was an important career decision, which I understand had to be made at the end of last year. At the end of the process to facilitate the closure of the Castle terrace office, a number of staff indicated that they would accept redeployment to Phoenix house, Portobello. The senior DWP official informed them that Portobello was</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/11" class="indent">&quot;a long term feeder centre with the emphasis on the long term&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/12">Knowing the Minister's interest in good industrial relations, and her concern that we treat people decently, I am sure that she agrees that the undertaking to staff is important. Those people are now working at Portobello. They moved there because they viewed it as a good prospect for the future. I repeat that they were told that it was</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/13" class="indent">&quot;a long term feeder site with the emphasis on the long term&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/14">No doubt they were aware that the Portobello office is highly efficient and is recognised as such at a Scottish level, so they would have assumed that the jobs that they were moving to were reasonably safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/15">Everyone to whom I have spoken, including the Jobcentre Plus senior management, has praised the efficiency and skill of Phoenix house staff. They are highly able people and many have decades of experience in their field. I am conscious that the Minister and the Secretary of State moved to their Department only a couple of weeks ago, but I am sure that the Minister will already be familiar with the way in which Government policy on contributory and non-contributory social security benefits is being implemented in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/16">I received a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-07">7 June</phrase> from the Jobcentre Plus district manager confirming that the transfer of the processing of all social fund applications for the entire Edinburgh, Lothian and the borders area to the Portobello office was to be completed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-04">4 June</phrase>. That was good news, but unfortunately the letter went on to inform me that the office was to be closed because all that work was to be moved to Glasgow Springburn by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/17">It is remarkable that any Department should treat its employees in that way. If that had happened in the private sector there would be an outcry. I doubt whether a single Member of Parliament or trade unionist in this country would regard the proposal as fair and reasonable. Let us be clear: the work is being taken away from one of the most efficient offices in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/18">The plan is to reduce the number of sites in Scotland dealing with benefit claims to eight mainstream benefits processing centres and two social fund processing centres with no sites in Edinburgh. Under the new plan, all social fund applications for the Edinburgh, Lothian and borders area will be transferred to Glasgow. We can reasonably assume that virtually none of the Phoenix house staff would find it practical to transfer to Glasgow. As is standard practice, staff have been told that efforts will be made to redeploy them.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/19">My hon. Friend will probably set out some of the packages and additional money that will be available if people are prepared to travel longer distances and alter their child care arrangements. Obviously, the Government are making money available to try to facilitate people moving to other offices, but it will not happen in Edinburgh. Frankly, I think everyone realises that without one of the 10 major benefit delivery centres being located in Edinburgh, there is little prospect of those civil servants being able to stay in public service. Most of the staff are too young for early retirement, and the reality is that most of the 95 staff will be made redundant if the plan goes ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/20">Let us consider the proposal from the point of view of efficiency and the public purse. Under the plan, an efficient office will be closed. Dozens of redundancy packages will be paid out and, over in Glasgow, new staff will have to be recruited from the street and trained for the work. I am sure that anyone looking at the proposal would conclude that there is little sense in it. The expense of redundancy packages, recruitment and training will be large and entirely unnecessary. That is not an acceptable way to treat employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/21">Staff have worked at Phoenix house on the basis that it was a long-term prospect. They have put in place the social fund operation and are running it well. Now, just as the transfer of the area's social fund work is completed, the Phoenix house team is told that it is to lose its jobs and that new staff are to be recruited elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/22">I remind my hon. Friend that some staff moved to Phoenix house precisely because it was seen as a long-term prospect, and the DWP told them that a few months ago. The job losses will be devastating for the staff and their families, and the closure of such a large operation will be bad news for the local area because the staff bring a lot of business to local shops and banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/23">The staff who lose their jobs will have great difficulty in finding comparable work. It is important to understand that Edinburgh is not homogenous. Like most of our cities, there are areas of affluence with strong economic growth owing to the strength and stability of the UK economy. I believe that that economic growth&mdash;in Edinburgh it has been predominantly in the financial sector&mdash;is because of the long-term management over the past 10 years by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, now the Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1997" name="Gordon Brown">the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr. Brown)</phrase>. However, the recent growth&mdash;I think my hon. Friend knows this&mdash;has been predominantly in the west of the city, and the jobs that are going are in the west of the city and in the central area.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/24">If my hon. Friend has had the time to pore over the statistics and compare Edinburgh with other cities in the United Kingdom, she will have grasped that it cannot be overlooked that a large number of people in Edinburgh are dependent on the benefits system. As Jobcentre Plus points out, the region</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/25" class="indent">&quot;also contains several Wards at the lower end of the poverty spectrum&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/26">The east of the city holds some of the most deprived areas in Scotland. The most recent Scottish index of multiple deprivation report showed that the most employment-deprived place in Scotland is Craigmillar in my constituency, an area that I have had the privilege to represent in Parliament for more than 30 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/27">Whichever way we look at the proposal to close Phoenix house, it is unacceptable. Ninety-five people, many of them highly experienced staff, will lose their jobs. That is clearly bad news not only for the staff, their families and the local area, but for the work of Jobcentre Plus and the DWP. The proposal makes little financial sense, entailing as it does so much unnecessary expense, and it makes little sense to service delivery, because it replaces an efficient operation staffed by fully trained personnel with a new office staffed by new recruits.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.1/28">I am grateful for having had the opportunity to raise the matter today, because it is an important issue in my constituency and beyond. I am grateful for the opportunity to put the case for Phoenix house, the Portobello benefits delivery centre, today. I very much hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take into account what I have said, so that the proposal will be reconsidered.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-11a.479.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" speakername="Nigel Evans" colnum="479"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070711/halltext/70711h0010.htm#07071179000620">
	<p pid="a.479.1/1">I am delighted to be under your authority once more, Mr. Hancock, in this important debate on the case for a referendum on the EU constitutional treaty. It could not be more topical. Today, <i>The Times</i> quotes Mr. Barroso, President of the European Commission, as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/2" class="indent">&quot;We are not the United States of Europe&mdash;we are unique in the history of mankind! Sometimes I like to compare the EU as a creation to the organisation of empires. We have the dimension of empire, but there is a difference. Empires were made with force with a centre imposing diktat. Now what we have is the first non-imperial empire. We have 27 countries that fully decided to work together and to pool their sovereignty. I believe it is a great construction and we should be proud of it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/3">The article's next paragraph, even more tellingly, says:</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Nervous aides to the former Portuguese Prime Minister inquired after his press conference whether this description might feature in British media reports.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/5">They need not have asked. Clearly, it was going to feature in many British reports about exactly what that European politician had to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/6">It is important to listen to what European politicians say, because it appears&mdash;I hope to expand on this later&mdash;that while the Government are saying one thing to the British people, politicians throughout Europe are proud of what they are creating in the European Union. They are not ashamed of parading it and advertising it as something that their people want. From what I can make out after talking to people from other EU countries, they do want to advance it. The big question&mdash;it is why I secured this debate&mdash;is whether that is what the British people want. That might not be the case. I do not know. I shall not pre-judge what the British people would say in a referendum; I only ask that they get that referendum in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/7">This debate follows a week in which our new Prime Minister vowed to give</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/8" class="indent">&quot;more power to Parliament and the British people&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/9">However, the Labour party is going back on its manifesto promise, asserting that the treaty is not a matter on which the people need to decide. Ruling out the referendum in that manner shames the Government at the same time that it removes power from the British people, contrary to what the new Prime Minister said.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/10">If the treaty is so good&mdash;we have been told on many occasions that it is a good treaty, and that it is what people want&mdash;then let us have a referendum to establish it. We were told that we would have one before the treaty referendums in France and the Netherlands, and we know what happened there. For France to say no is quite spectacular, and it should be listened to. The Dutch said no as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/11">Dropping the word &quot;constitutional&quot; from the title does not mean that the promise of a public referendum on the subject can be broken. In two elections for the European Parliament and a general election, the promise of a referendum has been in the manifesto. It is disingenuous to play with words as the Government have done and to think that what is happening now is just an unimportant tidying-up exercise. Who would think that Tony Blair, in his dying days as Prime Minister, could renege so easily on that promise? It does not astound me that politicians in this country are held in such low esteem when a Prime Minister and a Government can promise a referendum, hold that promise through two elections and throw it away in their dying days. That is shocking.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/12">The new Prime Minister even said that there was no need for a referendum, because there was no referendum on the Maastricht treaty. However, the new Foreign Secretary admitted that that treaty involved a smaller transfer of power and that the constitutional treaty would give away much more. More important than that, there had never been a promise of a referendum on the Maastricht treaty, so no promise was broken. However, there was a promise that the British people would have a vote on this constitutional treaty, and it is being broken.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/13">We hear talk of red lines&mdash;and, of course, we should protect our human and social rights, foreign policy and tax benefits. However, that has always been the Government's position. Everybody else is concerned about the rest of the treaty, the part that the Government seem determined to brush under the carpet. That smacks of back-door politics. The majority of other European leaders have been candid in their appraisal of the new treaty. I have managed to snatch a copy of <i>Le Monde</i> from the breakfast room; I shall put it back immediately after this debate. An article in it mentions Jo Leinen, a German Socialist who welcomed the outcome of the intergovernmental conference, which, according to him,</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/14" class="indent">&quot;pr&eacute;serve en grande partie la substance du trait&eacute; constitutionnel&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/15">Broken as my French is, even I understand what that means: the bulk of the constitution has been retained. Angela Merkel said on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The fundamentals of the Constitution have been maintained in a large part&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/17">Steinmeier, the German Foreign Minister, said that the treaty would</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/18" class="indent">&quot;preserve the substance of the constitutional treaty&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/19">Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero said:</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/20" class="indent">&quot;A great part of the content of the European Constitution is captured in new treaties&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/21">Bertie Ahern said in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-24">24 June</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/22" class="indent">&quot;I think it likely that a referendum will be held...thankfully, they haven't changed the substance&mdash;90 per cent. of it is still there.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/23">Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen said:</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/24" class="indent">&quot;That which really matters&mdash;the core&mdash;is left&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/25">Finland's Europe Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/26" class="indent">&quot;There is nothing from the original institutional package that has been changed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/27">EU Commissioner Margot Wallstr&ouml;m said:</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/28" class="indent">&quot;It is essentially the same proposal as the old.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/29">Just a couple of weeks ago, I was in the Council of Europe when Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering, the President of the European Parliament, said that the substance of the treaty remains. I think you were there, Mr. Hancock, when he said that in the chamber. Mr. P&ouml;ttering was somewhat disappointed at the fact that the symbols and hymn were not to be retained as part of the constitution. However, MEPs speaking in Strasbourg yesterday accepted that they will change the procedures of the European Parliament to ensure that there will be a place for the flags and the hymn. Irrespective of whether they are in the treaty, the flag and hymns will play an important part.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/30">How is it that the leaders of Germany, Spain, Ireland, Denmark and Finland, as well as an EU Commissioner and the President of the EU Commission, can see that nothing has changed? It is a case of &quot;cannot&quot; or &quot;will not&quot; from our Government. What is important is that while our politicians here tell the British people that there are fundamental differences between what is being put before us now and the constitution, all those other politicians tell their people throughout the whole of Europe that nothing much has changed and the constitution's substance has been retained. Either the Government here are not telling the truth to the British people, or all those European politicians are not telling the truth to their people. What is certain is that both sides cannot be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/31">I have received from the Minister two parliamentary answers to questions about how many letters he has received on this issue and the main differences between the two treaties; frankly, neither answer says much, and I suspect that there will be a lot of that in the next couple of weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/32">We know that under the new constitutional treaty, there will be an EU President, that an EU diplomatic service will be rebranded as the &quot;External Action Service&quot; and that the EU Foreign Minister will instead be named the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. According to Bertie Ahern, that is the original job proposed but with a long title. We will still be signing up to cut our power to block EU legislation by 30 per cent. There will be a European public prosecutor, and safeguards on enhanced co-operation will be removed. There are new powers of veto for the European Parliament in 50 new areas. There will be new, increased EU powers over social policy, economic co-ordination, employment policy, trade policy, public health and public services; increased power for Europol; new powers for the European Court of Justice over asylum and immigration; the end of the veto on legal migration; and a new mutual defence commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/33">Given the time available, I have mentioned only a selection of the changes&mdash;but make no mistake, the British public will be hugely affected. They should be consulted. It looks as if the Government believe that if they ignore the issue long enough, it will go away. On <phrase class="date" code="1990-11-23">23 November 1990</phrase>, Margaret Thatcher said of Labour Members:</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/34" class="indent">&quot;For them, it is all compromise, 'sweep it under the carpet', 'leave it for another day', and 'it might sort itself out', in the hope that the people of Britain will not notice what is happening to them, and how the powers would gradually slip away.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1990-11-22.451"><i>Official Report</i>, 22 November 1990; Vol. 181, c. 451</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/35">How right she was then, and how disappointing it is that now, 17 years later, the Government have not learned from their past mistakes.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/36">The Conservatives have long campaigned for a referendum; we believe that the British people want one. As I said, European leaders have admitted that the new treaty is essentially the same document as before. I believe that we now have a Prime Minister who can show himself to be different from his predecessor. We know that he has been trying to do that at every stage. I have seen more of the right hon. Gentleman in the House of Commons Chamber since he became Prime Minister than I saw our former Prime Minister in the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/37">We know that the new Prime Minister is trying to show that he is a House of Commons man. He has already said that he wishes to give a greater say to the British people. He has promised to listen, and he now has the opportunity to state that he has done so and will give the referendum that his predecessor always promised to the British people. If the new Prime Minister wants to ensure that his Government have any credibility and if he is serious about restoring faith in British politics, he could do both by simply changing the policy of the outgoing Prime Minister and bringing in the old policy&mdash;that the British people will have a vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.479.1/38">As I said, I am not here to prejudge the outcome of a referendum on behalf of the British people. The Government believe that the constitutional treaty will be good for the United Kingdom and I suspect that all the other European Union leaders feel exactly the same. The Irish will get a vote because that is part of their constitution; I believe that the Danish will have a vote as well. All I am asking the Government is that they should stick to the referendum that they promised, and that will be the thrust of everything about this debate until, I hope, the Government change their mind. Let the people decide, and when they have made their decision, let us listen to them.</p>
