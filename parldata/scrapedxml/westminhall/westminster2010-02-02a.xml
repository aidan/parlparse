	<p pid="a.1.1/1" class="italic">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.-(Mr. George Mudie.)</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" speakername="Nicholas Soames" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0001.htm#10020246000516">
	<p pid="a.1.2/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to debate the impact of immigration on the population of the United Kingdom-a debate that needs to happen more regularly. I called for the debate because our country truly faces a turning point of historic proportions, which will profoundly affect the future of our children and subsequent generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">In fact, this is a crisis, of which members of the public are instinctively aware and about which many of them are rightly uneasy, but the Government are in almost total denial about it. I refer to the impact of mass immigration on our population, which will inevitably have the most serious consequences for our public services, our environment, our quality of life and even the future stability of our society. In some places, that is clearly already the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">I want to deal with three issues: first, the reliability and relevance of population projections; secondly, the impact of population growth at the projected level; and thirdly, the measures that the all-party group on balanced migration, which is co-chaired by me and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>, wishes to see put in place to tackle the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">First, on population projections, I regret to say that the Minister of State has become increasingly wild and incautious in his remarks as the debate has developed. In a recent article for the S<i>unday Mirror</i>, he said-this is a particularly vulgar quote-</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/5" class="indent">&quot;If Cameron wants to put a cap on our population, then he'd better start issuing condoms, getting euthanasia clinics in place or even introducing a Chinese style 'one-child' policy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/6">This is much too serious an issue for it to be a matter of &quot;Cameron&quot;, even in an election year. The facts should not be politicised in that way. That is why I and others formed the all-party group-it now numbers 40 Members, some of whom, I am grateful to say, are in their places this morning-to press for an objective, careful, rigorous and humane approach to immigration and for cross-party agreement on what needs to be, and what must be, done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/7">The Minister's approach also ignores the fundamental fact that if present levels of immigration continue, immigration will account for 68 per cent. of our population growth over the next 25 years. The reality is that immigration and population have become inextricably linked. I regret to say that the Minister's remarks are a very unimpressive attempt to camouflage the failure of the Government's immigration policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/8">Let us examine the facts. The Office for National Statistics-the official body responsible for these matters-projects that the UK population will reach 70 million in 20 years' time. The Government's response is to wriggle; they say that projections are not forecasts. Of course they are not, but they do tell us what is likely to happen in the absence of a major change of policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/9">The Government also say, quite correctly, that some ONS projections have been wrong in the past. Of course they can be wrong, and the further ahead they look, the greater the risk of error. That is why the Government like regularly to quote a 1965 projection of the population in 2000-35 years ahead-which assumed that the baby boom would continue and which was therefore seriously wrong. However, on a 20-year time frame, the ONS has been accurate to within plus or minus 2.5 per cent. over the past half century. At the very least, that suggests that its projections should be taken seriously. It is absolutely intolerable, and an unedifying spectacle, to see Ministers attempting to rubbish the work of valued public servants just because it does not fit their political narrative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/10">What distinguishes our present situation from any other period in our history is the massive impact of immigration on the size of our population. The well-known waves of immigration in past centuries were not remotely on the scale that we are seeing at present. The Huguenot and Jewish immigrations were spread over about 50 years and amounted to only about 1 per cent. of our population at the time. The east African Asians, who have been so spectacularly successful here and who have integrated so well, numbered 27,000, spread over two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/11">Net foreign immigration into this country is now at 21,000 a month. That amounts to nearly 1 per cent. of our population every two years-25 times higher than at any time in the last 1,000 years. As a result, immigration now heavily outweighs the other two factors-births and deaths-in terms of population growth.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.2.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" speakername="Peter Bottomley" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0001.htm#10020246000517">
	<p pid="a.2.0/1">I ask my hon. Friend to reflect, either now or later, on how that net immigration of 21,000 compares with the number of people returning or coming from overseas and registering with GPs. That figure has reached 600,000, but the maximum number for people returning to this country is 69,000. That indicates that immigration is substantially higher than the Government's immigration figures suggest.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.2.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" speakername="Nicholas Soames" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0001.htm#10020246000518">
	<p pid="a.2.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who makes an extremely important point. Of course, we are talking about not just those who register, but the large numbers who, as we know, do not register or appear in the figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/2">Death rates are fairly steady. Birth rates vary more widely. Since reaching a historic high in the baby boom of 1964, the total fertility rate has fluctuated within a fairly narrow band.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/3">Migrationwatch, which has done so much to raise the tenor and rigour of the debate, has done research for our cross-party group. It has done some calculations on the effect of varying the birth rate while holding the death rate and net immigration constant at the level of the most recent principal projection by the ONS. Those calculations demonstrate that even if birth rates fell to the lowest level for a century, our population would still hit 70 million, not in 2029, but in 2036. Of course, the likelihood of a fall in the birth rate is reduced by the fact that one in four births is now to foreign-born mothers, who have 35 per cent. more children on average than British-born mothers.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/4">The conclusion, therefore, is inescapable: the only way to limit our population is to bring immigration down substantially. Indeed, it must be reduced from last year's figure of 160,000 to 40,000 or less if we are to avoid a population of 70 million. It is also important to understand that failure to bring immigration under control will mean a continually growing population of well beyond 70 million, and even up to 80 million or 85 million, in the latter part of this century.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/5">What is the Government's response? They tell us that immigration is already coming down, partly as a result of their new points-based system-&quot;partly&quot; is the word. Net foreign immigration fell by 80,000 between 2007 and 2008, the last year for which statistics are available. Of that decrease, 70,000 was due to a greater number of eastern Europeans returning home. That, of course, had nothing to do with the Government's immigration policy, because eastern Europeans are not subject to it. Even that decline is now in some doubt, however, because a Polish professor is suggesting that any return of migrants to Poland has been much smaller than British figures suggest. As for the points-based system, these are early days. We await the outcome for 2009 with interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/6">What is clear, however, is that tier 4-students-is in serious difficulty. The BBC quoted a freedom of information request showing that the British high commissions in Mumbai, Delhi and Dhaka issued nearly 20,000 student visas between June and August this year. It went on to quote an Asian immigration lawyer, who said that</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the majority of these students are not genuine, especially from the Punjab. They come here to work in the guise of student visas&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/8">He said that he was now worried that the problem is causing great resentment among the local Indian community who settled here in the 1960s.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/9" class="indent">&quot;There is some tension in our community&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/10">he said.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/11">It is true that the Government have removed a couple of thousand educational institutions from the list of potential sponsors, but the checks on individual applicants are still far too weak. Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to tell us when we may expect to see the Government's review of student visas, which was originally promised for last December. While I am on the subject of the points-based system, I shall take the opportunity to commend the Government on one significant step forward-their proposal to introduce a second points-based system for economic migrants who decide that they would like to settle in Britain. That will introduce a welcome element of flexibility to the issue of work permits without, in the long term, adding to our population.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/12">I have focused on the numbers because they are a vital element in the debate. They are what the Government seek to ignore or dodge, as the mood takes them. However, they cannot be dodged and must not be ignored. That brings me to my second topic-the impact of population growth at current and projected levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/13">Population growth is already impacting on our schools. There is a rush to build more primary school places. Maternity units are affected; in some places mothers have to be turned away. Housing is also affected-nearly 40 per cent. of new households will be the result of future immigration. Housing is an increasingly serious problem. There is already a grave shortage, particularly of social housing, the waiting list for which in England has risen by 70 per cent. in seven years. We are told that there are still plenty of green fields in England and that only 11 per cent. of our land is built over. It may be so, but it certainly does not feel like that.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/14">I want to offer one more, very important, quote:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/15" class="indent">&quot;Great parts of this country are already over populated, the transport system is a nightmare and some social services are barely able to function. Yet the government remains in denial about the massive social implications of unchecked immigration, a piece of social engineering that might yet stand as the only lasting legacy of new Labour&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/16">That comes from a lifelong supporter of the Labour party, a former editor of the <i>Daily Mirror</i>, Mike Molloy, writing in a newspaper last week. It is not a matter only of impressions. England as a whole is now, with Holland, the most crowded country in Europe. We are nearly twice as crowded as Germany and four times as crowded as France. One need only go to those two countries to see that that is the truth. The public understand very well that we simply cannot go on like this without a serious deterioration in our quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/17">What more should we do? First, there should be an overarching political commitment to take the measures necessary to get immigration down. No single measure will achieve that. There is no silver bullet. Secondly, there should be a serious effort to tighten the chaotic state of student visas. As I mentioned, some bogus colleges have been eliminated from the list of potential sponsors, and those that can still sponsor students now have some new responsibilities. That is welcome, but the universities and colleges that issue the key document-the confirmation of acceptance for studies-are the very same bodies that have a clear financial interest in the admission of foreign students to the UK. We must return to a situation in which there is also a check by a UK-based immigration officer before a visa is issued, especially in countries of immigration concern. Those highly trained and exceptional immigration officers have the local knowledge that will help them to detect bogus applications-something that an admissions tutor based in Britain is clearly incapable of doing. On work permits, we would like the bar to be raised in the points-based system, at least for as long as we have 2.5 million of our own people unemployed in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/18">That leaves marriage as the third major category. Clearly there can be no question of preventing genuine marriage by a British citizen to a foreign national, provided that both are of a suitable age-at present 21. However, the days when we could allow marriages to be arranged overseas for the purpose of immigration must now come to an end. It is not helpful to the individuals concerned, who can often come under the most severe and unhappy family pressure. Nor is it any help in integrating those communities into our society. It is time to move on-a view shared by many in the communities concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.1/19">The public are right to be deeply concerned. In a recent survey, 85 per cent. were worried about the UK population reaching 70 million, and 50 per cent. were very worried. They want a Government, of whatever party, who face up to the reality of the numbers and take firm and effective action in response. That is also what the all-party group wants.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.0/1">I want to begin by paying tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase>. At a time when most people did not want to discuss immigration, he secured immigration debates in this Chamber and in the House. It was largely through his pioneering bravery that I, too, became more vocal in the debate. I am looking for slightly different answers to the questions that he poses. I hope that by the end of the debate, when we have heard all three party spokesmen, we shall have a clear idea of the programmes that will be offered to the electorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.0/2">I also hope that, as this debate will probably be our last on the subject before the general election, all three parties might want to apologise to the country for what they have allowed to happen to it. I am not saying that the policy was deliberate at first, or that it was engineered, as suggested in the quotation used a moment ago by my friend, the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex. However, what appeared to be an open-door immigration policy has wrought havoc in many sections of our community, particularly among the poorest. As we are now in an age when we feel that we should apologise for what, in our current judgment, we see to have been appalling actions, even though we could not have had any effect on them, the electorate might welcome some more up-to-date apologies for what has happened to their country.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.0/3">In some areas, Britain has changed. I do not blame the immigrants-the new arrivals, who came here to make a better life. I blame us, the political class, not only for not seeing that as an issue, or perceiving what the long-term consequences would be, although that was bad enough. I also blame us for a much more deep-seated failure to have any coherent sense of what the nation stands for. Because we did not have any clear idea of what Britain stood for, except for some vague and wonderful concept of our having always been tolerant-and I must say that my own experience does not lead me to believe that that was more than skin deep-we failed to take on from the Edwardian age what we now think it means to be a citizen of this country. None of us can blame the new arrivals, who were often invited by us to come here without knowing what we stood for and with no benchmarks to judge their standards by, for simply continuing to protect and promote the culture that they brought with them. The fault is not theirs, but it is certainly ours.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman is right to mention tolerance, which is a great tradition of our country. Pressures on jobs, housing and public services have been mentioned, but a more marginal consequence of immigration is that our traditions and culture are under threat-by the increasing use of sharia councils, for instance. That does nothing to promote equality. We should not be tolerant of that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.5.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" speakername="Frank Field" colnum="5"  time="009:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0001.htm#10020246000522">
	<p pid="a.5.2/1">No, but think of what happens in Afghanistan. If the voters there feel that the &quot;elected&quot; Government cannot deliver common or garden justice, they will seek other forms to give order and principle to their lives. It is easy to get headlines by saying that we should not have sharia law here, but we ought seriously to consider why some people look to other ways of imposing discipline, order and fairness, and what lessons that might have for our widespread and more accepted judicial system.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.2/2">First, as I said, I look for an apology from all three political parties. At worst, they participated in the silence while this great change was happening to our country. Secondly, they should apologise-<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Hon. Members should not laugh. Immigration on this scale has forced down wages.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.0/1">I was not laughing, but snorting with derision. Immigration was fine when the right hon. Gentleman and the Government whom he supported were elected in 1997. There was nothing wrong then. The problem has arisen in the past 10 years. I know that an election is coming up, and that the right hon. Gentleman, for largely historical reasons, will be running as a Labour candidate and will therefore be supporting the Government, but for him to ask other parties to apologise for the mess created by his own party is a bit rich.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.1/1">The thought that I will be running &quot;historically&quot; as a Labour candidate has driven the Whip from the Chamber. Perhaps he is going to write it down on tablets of stone.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/2">We have to make a distinction between the machinery left by the previous Government and the actual numbers. Indeed, one very good thing happened recently when the Conservative leader said that he wished to reduce net immigration to the levels of the early 1990s, not the late 1990s. Although I deplore what has happened since Labour came to power, I am not blind to the fact that the issue did not start with us; there was an acceleration in net migration under the previous Conservative Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.6/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is a fundamental weakness in the assumption that led to the Conservative party's signing the Maastricht treaty and that underpinned the logic of the Treasury and the Bank of England-I do not mean politically, but as institutions? I am thinking of the assumption that the economy would benefit from cheaper and younger labour. Flawed economic logic has underpinned policies from both parties across the generations.</p>

	<p pid="a.7.0/1">I am grateful for all interventions, but particularly for the one just made by my hon. Friend. By allowing large numbers of unskilled labourers into this country, our immigration policy has fed the habit and weakness of British industry, which as a result has not taken labour upmarket and has not put a premium on high skills. All those crucial decisions for our economic future were put off because there was an endless supply of people; that not only meant low wages, but helped to beat down wages. It is those at the very bottom of the pile, who have had to bear the brunt of this wonderful, open competition, whom I wish to champion in this debate-to some extent, at least; it is not only they who concern me.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/2">The third failure caused by our not getting to grips earlier with the number of people wishing to come here to work is that welfare reform was made even more difficult to accomplish; indeed, one might say that it was made impossible. Since 1997, more than 3 million additional jobs have been created, but the number of workless people of working age has fallen only from 5.6 million to 5.2 million. Given how the economy was expanding, it could not have been a better time to have pushed through welfare reform with a process of tough love, but we failed to grasp the opportunity; it was impossible to grasp it because of our immigration policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/3">I hope that we shall hear what the political parties wish to put in their manifestos. The all-party group on balanced migration believes that it is necessary for all three parties to subscribe to two main proposals if we are to reassure the electorate that, late in the day, we are getting a grip on the number of people coming here. The first is that we need not only a cap, and some idea of the numbers that we think can come here to work and be assimilated, but a points system-the Government have decided to use one-as a way of rationing who should fill those places.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/4">The second proposal is to break the link between coming here to work and almost automatically becoming citizens. In other words, we should welcome the proposals now being considered by the Government that people can come here perhaps for four years and then return home. That would be an advantage to them and certainly to the British economy. The idea that working here should automatically lead to citizenship has led to the long-term growth in population, as have the changes in the birth rate mentioned by my friend, the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/5">My last point is not to do with the all-party group on balanced migration. I wish to speak about something that I believe will come to dominate the next Parliament-the free movement of labour in Europe. We are now seeing the limits of and the strains caused by the free movement of capital. Perhaps before the general election, we will see the inner cabinet of Europe having to preserve their currency by taking over the main negotiations on Greek debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/6">We are in an age that was never envisaged by those who told us that it would be good for us to sign up to the single currency. I pose a question. We hear all sorts of soft talk about countries such as Turkey gaining admittance to the European Community. Having free movement of labour among a group of western European countries that, generally speaking, have the same standard of living is a totally different proposition from having free movement of labour in a European Union where the standards of living are hugely different-so diverse that it is difficult to put the matter in arithmetical terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/7">Although we would not expect the matter to feature in the coming election campaign, those who are lucky enough to be returned by the voters will need seriously to consider it. We should not do so under the guise of trying to attack the EU. Those who are sceptical-and those who are friends of the EU-need to look at whether a policy of endlessly increasing the borders of Europe will allow the free movement of labour that was envisaged in those early days, when there were only six core countries with similar standards of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/8">Let me end by reading out the results of an immigration survey that is to be released tomorrow by the Townswomen's Guild, which has become concerned about the issue. Members will know that Townswomen's Guilds were established to reach those parts of the country that the Women's Institute did not touch, although now both organisations have much more of a joint membership.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/9">The Townswomen's Guild asked its members what the levels of immigration should be in this country. I have to confess to the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex that the results do not totally support the position of the all-party group on balanced migration, which is anxious to get policy commitments from all three parties that will prevent the population rising above 70 million. Only 17 per cent. of a record number of members of the Townswomen's Guild who responded to the questionnaire thought that that was a satisfactory position. Nearly 80 per cent. sought a much greater reduction. More than 50 per cent. wanted no net migration and nearly 29 per cent. wanted no immigration whatever.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.0/10">The membership of the Townswomen's Guilds are part of the backbone of England. If we, as politicians who have represented such groups during this Parliament and hope to do so in the next Parliament, do not take seriously such a message, the game is well and truly up for democracy.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.0/1">I warmly welcome today's debate, and thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase> for introducing it. It gives us the opportunity to discuss openly the challenges that we face over immigration control. Unfortunately, as has been alluded to by both my hon. Friend and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>, some politicians discuss this topic only when quick and populist headlines are required. That is regrettable because it reduces the legitimacy of immigration as an important issue to be discussed rationally and pragmatically. It also leads Government to produce confused and contradictory policies that are too lenient in some cases and too tough in others. Moreover, it fails to address the economic needs of our country, or prepare local authorities for the challenges on the ground. Most importantly though, it isolates the British public who are left feeling that the only outlet for their worries about immigration is to be found on the extremes of the political arena.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/2">Let me make it clear that our borders should be open, to an extent, to hard-working, skilled professionals from abroad, but closed to those who will not contribute or integrate. We should also look more favourably on those who play by the rules by firmly rejecting the notion of an amnesty on illegal immigrants.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/3">Immigration is the single biggest issue in my inner-city constituency postbag. It gives me daily exposure to what is, at times, the chaos in the Home Office. I regret to say that because the Minister has been extremely helpful to me on a number of occasions, and has taken great care with some of the cases that have come through. None the less, there is a problem in the Home Office that may, within a few months, face my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1379" name="Damian Green">the Member for Ashford (Damian Green)</phrase>, so I hope that he, too, is listening to what I have to say. My team here at the House of Commons often despair at the day-to-day failings of the system. The last time I spoke in this House about immigration, I touched on a few specific cases. All too often the Home Office has failed to serve the correct paperwork in relation to deportation attempts. I shudder to think of the cost of each of those attempts.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/4">Many cases in my daily postbag prompt the question why the Home Office is so desperately inept at enacting its own decisions. Bizarrely, while we seem to find it, at times, impossible to remove people who have no right to be here, employers in my constituency have untold difficulties in securing passage for some of the highly skilled migrants to whom they have offered jobs. Such employers have looked for personnel in the UK, but are forced to employ skilled people from abroad as the domestic pool cannot often fulfil their need.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/5">Despite stumping up increasing amounts to make applications for visas or for leave to remain-the fee for a paper application is now &#163;820 and the cost of a face-to-face appointment a staggering &#163;1,020-highly skilled migrants and their partners inform me that they are facing ever longer delays. Once an application is made, and that cannot be for fewer than 28 days before a visa is required, passports are retained by the Home Office. Any attempt to request the return of such documents for travel or businesses purposes results in the withdrawal of the application and the loss of fees. Getting any information on a likely time scale is near impossible for a full 14 weeks after application, and there is very little accountability in the management structure. Business folk in my constituency now say that their international companies are choosing to recruit highly skilled global personnel for the German or French offices rather than negotiate with the unpredictable and costly British Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/6">Two meetings I had yesterday with constituents about their particular cases lead me to believe that the Government are now deliberately delaying applications in the hope that the published immigration statistics immediately ahead of the general election will show a decreasing number of successful applicants. That is cynicism at its very worst.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.0/1">I can assure the hon. Gentleman that that is certainly not the case, and would not even be possible. He has brought to my attention a number of problems with the system, and we are sorting them out.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/2">May I just make a policy point? The hon. Gentleman talks about the highly skilled workers that fall under tier 1 and, to some extent, tier 2, which is where his own party's cap would apply. Does he support that policy? Surely that makes his point even worse given that tier 3, the unskilled workers, is suspended. In other words, there is a cap on that which is zero.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.0/1">The Minister makes a fair point, but I am trying to open up a broader discussion on immigration issues. Everything that I have tried to say reflects the somewhat schizophrenic nature of the Home Office, where known flouters of the rules are left to live freely, while individuals who contribute or could bring great benefit to the UK face a brick wall. The message that our immigration system sends out is completely askew. We must make it clear-perhaps I disagree here with my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex-that Britain is open to highly skilled migrants, hard-working international students-who will be ambassadors for this country in the decades to come-applying to legitimate institutions, and those asylum seekers and refugees willing to play by the rules.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.1/1">I just want to make it plain that one of the most important proposals that the balanced migration group has put forward is that we must break the link between people coming to work here and people being able to settle here. That is key. Of course, they should come here; we welcome them and recognise that they have very important work to do. It is that link between coming to work here and settle here that needs to be broken.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.10.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="10"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0002.htm#10020246000535">
	<p pid="a.10.2/1">That is a fair point. I am saying that we have no idea who is coming into this country, and those who come here and stay illegally effectively settle. As things stand, there is a clear incentive for people to lie low for as long as possible and resurface only when they believe that they have a strong basis for staying here-a connection to a community, a family and relationships. The imposition of an amnesty would only reinforce that message. Although I have a strong relationship with the Mayor of London, and admire him to a large extent, I fundamentally disagree with him in this regard. Rewarding such behaviour goes against the British notion of fair play and would be a slap in the face to all those immigrants who have strived so hard to play by the rules, including the settled immigrant populations here.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/2">I now wish to turn briefly to the very real practical problems that mass, unplanned immigration is causing on the ground. At 24 per cent., Westminster-my own local authority-has had the greatest proportionate increase in population since 2001 of any local authority in England and Wales. That is a problem because population figures as part of the census calculation for next year will form a key part of the equation used by the Government to distribute grants to local councils. Westminster city council has repeatedly warned the Government that current methods of counting migration are simply not keeping pace with modern patterns of population movement. The consequence sees the council locked into a three-year grant settlement that leaves it paying some &#163;6 million each year for those unaccounted people living within its boundary. As my hon. Friend said, the impact on services, such as housing, community protection, schooling and adult services, and on the quality of life in areas of high migration is significant. I warned about such problems in October 2008, which was well in advance of the forthcoming census, but Westminster city council maintains that despite our lobbying efforts, the 2011 census has still not been adequately tested for hard-to-count areas. Unless the Government address this problem urgently, I believe that they risk losing public good will, not only in Westminster but across the country, particularly in built-up areas, which would have serious consequences for the cohesion of our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/3">I should add that these types of issues are becoming more common for local authorities well outside central London and indeed any city centre. Although Westminster city council has a long history of dealing with some of the challenges of a hyper-diverse and hyper-mobile population, a new, unstable and diverse mix of residents is especially hard for suburban local authorities to cope with, which should be kept in mind by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/4">The relatively clement economic picture that has existed until recently has allowed us to turn a blind eye to many of the problems that I have described; the right hon. Member for Birkenhead made that point earlier. However, a continued refusal to get to grips with the immigration system risks causing conflict in British communities which I fear will haunt us for decades to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/5">Today's debate comes at a time when the British National party is garnering ever more support, despite the frenetic attempts of politicians to silence it. Not only do I believe that some of those attempts approach being undemocratic-we must remember that freedom of speech is a cornerstone of democracy-but they ignore the real reason for the surge in the BNP's popularity. The real reason is that the BNP is positioning itself not only as an anti-immigration movement but as an anti-politician and anti-consensus movement.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/6">If we had always made room for sensible and rational discussion about immigration, we would have had an incentive to sharpen the immigration system and improve it, not only for the benefit of the indigenous population-white, black and brown alike-but for the benefit of those who are seeking new lives in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.2/7">In my view, those who seek to silence debate on this topic by crying &quot;racism&quot; should be under no illusions about the current immigration system. At present, it is failing everyone-British companies, the taxpayer, legitimate migrants and illegal immigrants alike.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.0/1">It is a huge privilege for me to follow three excellent speeches by three great parliamentarians-<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>, and my hon. Friends the Members for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) and for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)-who all have very well deserved reputations in this House. Indeed, I believe that, in years to come, people will look back at the speech today by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex and regard it as visionary, for telling us what will happen and reminding us that politicians down the years have ignored the pleas of our nation on this issue, as the right hon. Member for Birkenhead also pointed out.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/2">It is worth bearing in mind what we are actually talking about today, because the vision that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex has set out is that the population of our great nation will rise to a staggering 70 million people in 20 years' time, up from today's figure of 61 million. Indeed, we will be able to cap our population at 70 million only if we do something about it; if we do not do anything the number will be far higher. So, even if we take action now, we will be bolting the stable door after a large part of the horse is already out of the stable.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/3">That is a tragic situation for our country, because it means that there will be huge problems facing us in the next 20 years, which we will have to deal with. There is no way that we can keep the population at 61 million. Another 9 million people are going to be in this country, even if we take effective action now.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/4">The issue is space, not race. The one positive benefit of immigration from the new entrant EU countries in the past few years is that we can start to talk about immigration once again, because now white people-essentially, the immigrants from those new EU countries are white-are immigrants too. I suspect that every Member in Westminster Hall today has been accused in the past five or 10 years of being racist, mainly by politicians on the left, because we dared to speak out about the wave of immigration affecting our country. However, because we now have a large number of white immigrants in this country, suddenly it is okay to talk about immigration once again.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/5">The problem is the scale of the immigration-the number of people heading our way-and it is going to overwhelm our indigenous culture in ways that are frankly unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/6">At the crude end of the debate, the problem is reflected in talk about the burqa. I must say that I have huge sympathy with those who want action taken against people who want to cover themselves up in public. How ridiculous would the House of Commons be if we were all to wear burqas? How would Mr. Speaker be able to identify which Member to call next?</p>

	<p pid="a.12.1/1">The voters might well prefer it, but it is the religious equivalent of going around with a paper bag over your head with two holes for the eyes. In my view, it is offensive to want to cut yourself off from face-to-face contact with, or recognition by, other members of the human race. We should certainly look at ways to tackle that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/2">There are other ways in which new entrants are not integrating into our society. Earlier this year, I was on attachment with the Royal Navy, and a member of Her Majesty's armed forces was taking me from one base to another. He was a young Muslim lad from the middle of Birmingham, and he told me on our journey that he has not been able to speak to his mother since he told her that he had decided to join Her Majesty's armed forces, because he has been completely cut off. He has lost contact with all his friends at home and he dare not go back to the neighbourhood in which he grew up. Such is the alienation of immigrant communities in our country living in densely populated areas, often without proper contact with the British way of life as we have all come to know it. The reason for that alienation is the scale of immigration into our country at one time. If there are a small number of immigrants arriving and spreading themselves out across the country, of course there will be integration. But if there are large numbers of immigrants arriving in a small number of places where they often do not speak English or integrate into the British way of life, there will be huge problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/3">There are other staggering statistics. I believe that I am right in saying that the official Department for Transport projections are that by 2025 there will be 30 per cent. more vehicles on our roads. Can you imagine that? At peak times now, London is almost at gridlock and small market towns such as Kettering, which would not have had a traffic jam 10 years ago, regularly have traffic jams at peak times. It is a nightmare to travel on the tube at peak times. Our trains are full, this country is full up and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex said, we cannot go on like this.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/4">I very much hope that the next Conservative Government will be robust in tackling this issue, because if we do not get it right our population will not just stop at 70 million-it will go even higher.</p>

Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>, who I have listened to in previous debates and who has influenced my thinking on immigration over the years, quite rightly made reference to the conspiracy of silence of political parties on this issue. That conspiracy had its impact on me during the last general election, when I put out a leaflet entitled, &quot;Unlimited immigration?&quot;, to raise the issue. I found myself being eviscerated in the liberal press-Channel 4 and <i>The Guardian</i>-and indeed by my Labour opponents.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/3">Subsequently, I think that we have seen a welcome change during this Parliament among politicians and there has been a willingness to talk about the issue. Furthermore, although I think that there has been acceptable criticism of the Minister regarding his comments in the <i>Daily Mirror</i>, he has engaged a great deal more with the country on this issue, which is important.</p>

That incident was covered widely in the broadsheet press. The case was eventually thrown out, but it illustrates how difficult it is for MPs to deal with this very real problem that people out there are thinking about; it is one of the main problems that constituents are thinking about.

	<p pid="a.13.2/1">I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention, because it prompts me to say two things. First, I did something that was probably a bit more mild-mannered than what he did. Well before the last general election, I happened to put a letter around about an issue with a planning application. The letter said that migration, as part of the London plan, influenced housing targets. I was called in by the police about that letter and the police said that if I put it out again, I would receive a caution. I felt that that was like being in a banana republic; it was not appropriate in terms of political correctness. Indeed, I subsequently made it an issue in the general election. Far too often, the police service identifies itself with one political party or another, which is a dangerous practice-and resonant, bearing in mind the experiences of the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> referred to the British National party. It is not sufficient for political parties to call the BNP names. That has happened not here, but in my local press, in which a Conservative councillor described the BNP as vile. That may well be a fair reflection of some of the people involved in the BNP, but we must nevertheless come to accept that there is a rationality to some people's voting BNP and that we cannot curse them for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/3">As a scenario, let us suppose that someone comes from a white working-class family on a satellite housing estate with limited access to work. They are out of work, partly because the state has not provided a good-quality education over the years. They find themselves on benefits and undermined by better-educated migrants. If they want to come off benefits, they will have to take a cut in pay. Perhaps the quality of employment would be so poor that they dare not risk coming off benefits for fear of not being able to get back on them again if they lose the job that they are given. Unfortunately, as a result of the conspiracy of silence that we as politicians have progressed, such people feel that the BNP speaks for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/4">Therefore, it is vital that we address the issue of migration and discuss whether the policies proposed will be effective. Unfortunately, the Conservative party misleads the electorate by suggesting that a cap will be effective. Exceptions are inevitable, particularly those involving marriage and relatives, so it is not possible to say that a cap can be introduced whereby if we run out of spaces by May, people must wait till January next year to be considered for migration. A points system can be used effectively if politicians decide that migration should be reduced significantly, and that is what needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/5">In Croydon, migration is in many ways our business. The UK Border Agency is based there-I emphasise the important role of the Public and Commercial Services Union in its good and professional work force-and there is a strong tradition of tolerance. Recently a notice went up in the UKBA commemorating a lady called Mary Apragas, who spoke of the importance of protecting genuine asylum seekers, not just offering asylum. Our migration service plays an important role in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/6">Asylum is a controversial issue in Croydon. It is a shame that the Minister has turned a deaf ear to our concern that extra pressures might be placed on our public services as a result of the closure of the Liverpool office and the concentration of walk-in asylum seekers in Croydon only. Will he at least concede that over the coming year we can measure the effects on a pilot basis? I appreciate that asylum figures have fallen significantly under the Labour Government, but they are nevertheless worthy of measurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.2/7">Finally-I want to provide others with an opportunity to speak-it should be borne in mind that that point comes in the context of our belief in Croydon that the Office for National Statistics figures used for settling how much grant is given to local government may well underestimate our population by 36,400 if GP figures are considered. Some 26,000 national insurance numbers were given to overseas workers in Croydon over the past four years, which suggests that the population in Croydon is much larger than expected.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.0/1">I am grateful that there are a few minutes left for two of us to speak. I have a few footnotes to the remarkable debate that we have had, which was led by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>. I have a huge admiration for him. He has consistently pointed out that the scandalous expansion of our population has mostly afflicted the white working-class poor. They are the people who have paid the rate for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/2">Having repeated that, I am afraid that the statistics do not bear it out. I was totting up the numbers in the House of Commons Library brief as the right hon. Gentleman was speaking. The average rate of net migration under the last Conservative Government was barely 13,000 a year. Under Labour, it is 180,000 on paper, but because there are no embarkation controls for most of that period, it is much higher in practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.1/1">I am not denying the hon. Gentleman's point, but those figures are for net migration, which is affected hugely by the number of people who leave the country, such as the 500,000 British people who go to live in Spain and so on. We must put the numbers into that context.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.15.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" speakername="Julian Brazier" colnum="15"  time="010:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0003.htm#10020246000544">
	<p pid="a.15.2/1">The fact is that net migration was 180,000, even ignoring those who stayed illegally whom we do not know about. If examined closely, the figures for housing are actually much worse than they appear. In round terms, over the past five or six years, between 500,000 and 600,000 have arrived and between 300,000 and 400,000 have left. According to the Government's own figures, about one third of new housing is accounted for by net migration. It follows ineluctably that the whole requirement for new housing comes from gross migration: in other words, the natural growth in households is roughly balanced by emigration. Indeed, one of the reasons most frequently cited by people leaving this country is congestion and overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/2">I will make two other brief points; I hope to give my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> a couple of minutes to speak. First, the courts have been no friend to this country in the matter. I have several excellent English language colleges in my constituency, as well as the highest concentration of higher education students in the country. If a series of court rulings absurdly makes it impossible for us speedily to deport students who overstay, we will find ourselves in a ridiculous position in which a Government of any shade will be bound to react with ever more restrictive curbs. Of course, curbing the number of people who learn English will rapidly knock on to curbing the number of people who can come here to enjoy degrees, which would be bad not only for our universities but for forming links with UK plc, as many such people go on to become opinion formers.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/3">My grandfather was an officer in the Indian army, the largest volunteer army in human history. It fought loyally despite including people from almost every known religion and a range of different ethnic groups. I believe strongly that it is possible for Britain to be a happy, assimilated and hugely diverse country, but we must learn lessons from countries such as America and Australia, which have a long history of immigration.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/4">Everybody who comes in legally should be able to speak English. We should insist on it for people who arrive for marriage. We should tighten language controls. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase>, my party's leader, pointed out early in his leadership campaign, it is absurd that vast numbers of benefits documents should be translated. We should be teaching people English. We must move away from the idea of multiculturalism and, as well as curbing overall immigration numbers, return to the idea that we should all be of one company.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase> for again giving us the opportunity to discuss this important topic. People's concerns about immigration have too often been glossed over or avoided altogether. If we are to prevent the rise of parties such as the BNP, whose values are anathema to Britain, we must place the issue at the centre of debate. People seek fringe parties not because they are inherently racist or bigoted; they do so because those parties heed their concerns as ours, across the piece, do not. We must re-orientate the debate to talk honestly of Britain today.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.1/2">In a recent survey on the Isle of Wight, immigration emerged as the No. 1 issue. I am sure that that is so with members of the public in other areas, and with good reason. Of 498 respondents on the Isle of Wight, 10 per cent. agreed that asylum seekers should be allowed to work whether they were genuine or not, and 90 per cent. disagreed. It was agreed by 9 per cent. that illegal immigrants who have been here a long time should be given citizenship; more than 90 per cent. disagreed. It was agreed by 92 per cent. that politicians should be more honest about immigrants and how immigration affects our country. They felt that such issues were too important to not be talked about. Members of all parties must make it clear what their policies are. I am grateful that today we are at last getting into some of those issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase> on initiating this debate. There have been many high-quality contributions, in particular that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>, for whom I have a lot of respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/2">I will nail down clearly my party's policy, which is important given the coming general election. It is important that we all make it clear where we are going and what we need to do. I want to disabuse the right hon. Gentleman of his idea that the Liberal Democrats want a totally open door on immigration; that has never been the case. It is true that during the problems in east Africa and Asia, we said that we had to honour our obligations. I do not apologise for that. It is also true that during the debate on Hong Kong, we said that if passports had been issued, they should be honoured. However, at no stage have we said that there should be total, free and unfettered immigration.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.2/3">We disagree with people who call for an artificial cap. We certainly disagree that concentrating on a certain population figure is the way to deal with the problem. That is not to say that we want to see the population of the country grow inextricably. Clearly we cannot have the levels of immigration we have had for the past 12 years. We want to see a concentration on this debate. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> that we should focus on immigrants who bring skills that the country needs and who can contribute to the country, rather than on an artificial cap.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.1/1">We believe that the debate on population obscures the real issue. It is easy to say that there should be a limit of 40,000 immigrants a year or a population limit of 70 million, but we have to ask why there has been such a large explosion of people coming into this country. It is primarily because, in 1994, the Conservative Government dismantled the exit controls in this country. Even now, we do not have a proper idea of who is coming into and, more importantly, who is leaving the country. If identity cards are fully introduced, it will be 2014 before we have that information. That is why we have a problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.2/1">I would hate to see the hon. Gentleman doing the Minister's dirty work for him. In 1994, the controls were taken off within the EU. In 1998, under this Government, the controls for the rest of the world were taken off. The 2014 deadline is for e-Borders, not ID cards.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.3/1">Regardless of that, the fact is that both Labour and the Conservatives dismantled controls and therefore lost control of the system. We have always concentrated on having a workable immigration policy that is fair and clear for all who apply. It was very disappointing that the recent second report of the Home Affairs Committee found that yet another 40,000 cases have been discovered-probably in a cupboard-some of which date back to 1993.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.3/2">Our concern has always been that the measures needed for a fair and effective immigration policy are not in place. First, the UK Border Agency must be given full powers as a working police force. It should not just deal with people as they come up to our borders, but work more closely with our European partners. I want the Government to sign up completely to the Council of Europe convention on human trafficking. Much can be achieved by working with our partners in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.3/3">Secondly, we would increase the fees for work permits. Our fees are among the lowest and are particularly low in comparison with America and Australia. Rather than have a fixed rate, the fees taken would be a percentage of the salary. With highly skilled migrants, the problem for a company of paying the fee would be outweighed by the great benefit that the person would bring. We would use that money to help upskill people in Britain who do not have such skills.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.1/1">We do not support the policy of a complete amnesty for all migrants introduced by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. We have said that we will set up a path to earned citizenship, under which certain clear conditions must be met. That policy is based on clear economics. If we accept the London School of Economics figure that there are 600,000 illegal immigrants in this country and consider that it would cost &#163;11,000 to deport each one, we are talking about spending roughly &#163;7 billion on their deportation. Given that many of those people have families, have worked in this country and have paid taxes, providing that they have not broken the law-<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> If they break the law, they will be deported. That is the policy now and we support it. We support an earned citizenship route, not carte blanche amnesties.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/2">Our policy is that there must be greater concentration on the points-based work permit system that has been introduced. As in Australia and Canada, we would extend that to a regional points-based system. In Canada, it is difficult for migrants, highly skilled or not, to go to Vancouver or Quebec because going to highly populated regions is discouraged. The effects of over-population on schools, hospitals and GPs in parts of London have been mentioned. A flexible points-based system that takes account of the population and employment needs in each region would be much fairer. That would be far better than the bald system set out by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex of only 40,000 immigrants a year coming into the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/3">Can you imagine, Mr O'Hara, Manchester City having to announce that Ronaldinho could not join the team because the cap on the number of immigrants for the year had been reached? My organiser, who is a Manchester City supporter, would be horrified to learn that because of a quirk of the system, a top football team could not recruit a highly skilled migrant. That is at the root of the problem with the balanced migration group's call for an artificial cap.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/4">We want tight controls and for illegal immigrants to be deported. We want a system that is flexible, fair and responsive to needs. We do not believe that the proposals of the balanced migration group would achieve that. We want the extension of the points-based system to a regional level and for the UK Border Agency to have the powers to operate as a working police force so that it can undertake the work it is handicapped in doing because of the quirks of the system. If we can have that, immigration will be reduced. However, such a situation will not happen immediately because, having turned the tap on, we cannot suddenly turn it off.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/5">I agree with the point made by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex about the operation of student visas: that is an area of Government policy that has clearly failed. However, I also agree with the Home Affairs Committee that we do not need more legislation to make the system work; instead, more attention should be given to the administrative systems on the ground and delivering what is already in place. If that happens, we will have a policy that works and there will not be a breach of the 70 million population figure. I would rather concentrate on making the system work than on an artificial figure because, at the end of the day, if we do not get the system to work, we will not have a cat in hell's chance of maintaining that figure.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.0/1">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase> has been tireless in pursuit of the belief that immigration is an important issue, and he was characteristically eloquent in expressing his views today. I begin by reassuring him and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> that a Conservative Government would not introduce an amnesty either. We need to be clear about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/2">For much of the debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex talked about projections. Those projections inspire much of the fear that has caused the growth of extremism, about which hon. Members from all parties have talked. That projected increase is on a different scale from anything that we have seen recently. In the past 20 years, our population has grown by 4 million; over the next 20 years, our population is projected to grow by about 9 million, which is more than twice as fast.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/3">I agree with the point, made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase>, that it is the scale of the change that inspires many of the tensions. The Home Secretary has said that he does not lose sleep over Britain's rapidly rising populations. However, if we carry on like this, those trends will put huge pressure on our national infrastructure in key areas such as housing, public services and transport, and the problems will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/4">Population growth is clearly caused by a variety of factors and is a combination of higher life expectancy and higher net immigration. The Conservatives believe that it is essential to take action on the latter to ensure that our population changes and grows at a more sustainable rate. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase>, the leader of the Conservative party, has stated that he does not support the thought of our population being as high as 70 million and said that the current level of net immigration is too high.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/5">As several of my hon. Friends have said, we believe that Britain can benefit from immigration. We want the brightest and the best to come and work in this country, but we do not benefit from out of control immigration. Our policy is therefore to target reducing immigration, so that the figure for net immigration is in the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands of the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/6">That is the significant shift that we want to achieve because, as has been expressed many times, what has happened over the past 10 years has been unprecedented in our history. Let us consider the gross figures of people coming in-512,000 people came to the UK as immigrants in the year to 2008, which is little change from the 527,000 in the year to December 2007. So the recession has had less effect than one might think, and it seems that the underlying trend is a stronger factor than even the catastrophic economic situation in which this country now finds itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/7">I turn to the challenge of what needs to be done, which was mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>. A Conservative Government would take a number of steps to manage migration directly, based on four different policy strands. I very much accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex that there is no single magic bullet and that we must concentrate on the matter across the board to reduce the numbers. We would control economic migration through an annual limit on non-EU immigration, and promote integration-a point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase>-through an English-language test for marriage visas. We would prevent abuse of the student visa system with tough reforms and we would tackle illegal immigration with a national border police force.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.1/1">We are discussing that issue with business. We would put in place a quarterly release system, unlike the American system where there is just an annual release, which causes problems. Our system would mean flexibility within the year and the overall limit. I spend a lot of my time talking to business about how such a scheme would operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/2">Let me deal with the issues in turn. I shall start with the matter of limits. There would be an annual limit on the numbers of people from outside the European Union allowed to come here to work. That limit would take into consideration the effects of a rising population on our public services, as well as the needs of business. Instead of ripping up the system and starting again-that would be disastrous in terms of the sheer administrative capacity, which has also been mentioned-we would build on the points-based system. That system is designed to make sure that people who are beneficial to this country come here.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/3">We would add a second stage to the system. It would control numbers with regard to the wider effects of immigration on society. The figure would be calculated after an annual consultation exercise with a number of bodies-obviously including business, but also including the providers of those public services that are so directly affected, including local authorities. A further step that we could and would take to control immigration directly is the imposition of transitional controls for new EU entrants. Other countries applied them in 2004 and had fewer of the stresses and strains that we did, even in relation to that cohort of extremely hard working and, by and large, respectable and good people who came here from eastern Europe. We would apply transitional controls on any further expansion of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/4">Of course, as well as having a better controlled immigration system, we need welfare reform and improved skills training, so that we are not simply ignoring millions of British workers who do not have the appropriate skills. I pay tribute to the work of the right hon. Member for Birkenhead in that field. That needs to be the other side of the coin.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/5">However, economic migration is only part of the story. A significant amount of immigration results from those coming to the UK for family reasons. In 2007, more than 42,000 spouses and fianc&#233;s came to the UK, of whom two thirds were female. Approximately 40 per cent. of those wives and fianc&#233;es came from the Indian sub-continent. Although we must, of course, recognise an individual's right to marry anyone they choose, we have considerable concern about the importation of young women, who are often from rural backgrounds and do not speak any English at all. Those women cannot play a full role in British society when they come here. They need and deserve better protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/6">The Government's Commission on Integration and Cohesion's interim report found that:</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The most commonly identified barrier to 'being English' in our polling was not speaking English - with 60% of respondents identifying language as a key issue&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/8">We all know that the inability to speak English affects not only the individual themselves, but their children. Everyone coming to this country must be ready to embrace the core values of British society and become part of their local community. A Conservative Government would introduce new measures for those coming to the UK as spouses, including an English language test to ensure that only those whose command of English allows them to play a full part in British life were able to settle in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/9">For years, the Government have ignored warnings from me and my Conservative colleagues about abuses of the student visa system for immigration purposes. The Minister has taken some action on that but, as we know from the emergency action that the Government had to take over the weekend on suspending visas from the subcontinent, it is clear that the system is still in complete chaos. The Minister has been saying for a year that he is being tough on that issue, but almost every month he has to come up with new measures, because the system has failed and is continuing to fail.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/10">We have suggested a range of measures that would lead to more effective control of the system, including a demand that those coming to institutions that we are not convinced are respectable should pay an up-front bond, which will be paid back only when that student leaves the country at the end of their course. That would be much more effective than the Government's action.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/11">The fourth measure on preventing illegal immigration would be the introduction of a specialist border police force. Experience has taught us that the specialisation of police services is the most effective way of fighting new types of crime, and of all the specialist policing skills that this country needs, a specialist border police is needed more than any other. I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex and other hon. Members across the House that a Conservative Government would make significant, radical changes in how this country deals with immigration and unsustainable population growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/12">I want to say just a few words on extremism. People have said that we need to talk about immigration more to stop the growth of extremism. I think that it is action, not words, that will stop the rise of extremism; I mean a change in policies. The measures that I have outlined-an annual limit, a national border police force and an English language requirement-will reduce net immigration significantly and therefore have a significant and permanent effect on population growth in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.0/1">This has been a terrific debate, and I think that we all endorse the tribute paid to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase>. He is absolutely right that we must not only debate the matter, but have policy action on it. I commend him for that. I like to think that, as Immigration Minister and ever since I was elected to the House, I have shared his point of view; I have never accused a colleague or anyone outside the House of racism for raising the issue of immigration. Indeed, I believe that it is racist not to raise the issue, because that is patronising. Anyone who represents a constituency such as mine will recognise the truth of that statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/2">I strongly agree, as do the Government, on the point made about the English language. Indeed, it was in a conversation with the then Home Secretary during the riots in my constituency that I was able to influence the Government to change our policy in that regard. It is the right thing to do by the immigrants-it helps them get on in life, which is what immigrants, on the whole, want to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/3">It is also right to address the issue of extremist parties. We must not only debate the issue of immigration; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> made an intelligent point on that. I also agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1379" name="Damian Green">the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green)</phrase> that showing the British public that migration policy is managed will enable us to talk better about how we can diminish discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/4">Discrimination against immigrants is often fuelled by the perception-and in some cases, the reality-of a lack on managed migration, so if we are to achieve our goal we must do what we are doing. I sympathise with those Members who say that they have been attacked as racist for raising the matter, because that happens to me by the hour-and not just in liberal forums, but in communications from members of the public. That is the nasty underbelly of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/5">I turn to points of policy. The Government agree that a population of 70 million is not desirable, but let me just pour some calm on that figure and examine where it comes from. The definition of an immigrant used by the Office for National Statistics, whose independence I respect, is, in my personal view, the wrong definition to use, particularly from the point of view of balanced migration, because its definition of an immigrant is someone who is coming to this country for 12 months or more. Therefore, the 512,000 figure to which the hon. Member for Ashford referred includes all the students who are coming here temporarily.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.0/6">The largest group of immigrants, according to the ONS definition, are the British people returning home, who numbered 85,000 last year, and we must bear that fact in mind. We must get exactly to the heart of the policy of the all-party group on balanced migration to address that fear, and we must do that by breaking the link between temporary and permanent migration. We need to do that, and our policies are driving towards that point, hence the two points-based systems and the changes to the route to citizenship. Surely it is right to measure immigration in those categories of temporary and permanent.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.0/1">Surely the Minister must recognise that his own Government's human rights legislation has driven a coach and horses through that otherwise laudable policy. The breach is just not there if the courts can say that even an overstaying student has his right to family life breached by being told to go home.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.1/1">I do not think that you would allow me to go into human rights, Mr. O'Hara, but if the hon. Gentleman looks at our policy, the challenges and how we are addressing the issue, he will see that that is part of the policy equation. However, his own party must come up with answers on that point as well. I will make another point to allay the fear about 70 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.2/1">I want to underscore the importance of having a second stage and of cutting the link between coming here to work and then being a citizen. Until we establish that, is it not proper that the ONS definition should rule, because that is what actually happens now?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.23.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" colnum="23"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0004.htm#10020246000561">
	<p pid="a.23.3/1">I will move on to that definition. People talk about a projection. The ONS is not making a forecast on the population of this country. Indeed, in 1960 it projected that the UK population would be 76 million by the year 2000. Those figures come about because the ONS and the statisticians take the figures for the previous three years and project them forward over the next 20 years. Therefore, if we had a big influx of Poles over the 2006-08 period, the projection is bound to go up. As the Poles are going back, that projection is now coming back down; interestingly, that is expressed by the year 2029, as opposed to 2028. It is true that previous projections have not been borne out. That is not to say that fears over population growth and the impact of immigration are unfounded; those two statements are not logically contradictory. That is why the policy proposals that we have put in place are already working.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/2">The Opposition's policy is confused. They talk about a cap on net migration, but one cannot cap net migration without restricting the movement of the British people going overseas. Around 700,000 of us live in Spain, and around 500,000 of us live and work in Germany, so the net migration figure is a function of people moving out and people moving back. The cap on migration that they talk about, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> pointed out, is in reality only a cap on tier 1 and tier 2, which makes up one seventh of immigration-and they are the very people whom <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> needs in his constituency to fuel British commerce. Therefore, that policy is based on a false premise.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.0/1">In all practicality, is there really that much difference between the two main parties' migration policies? Will the Minister also refer to my earlier point about the asylum seeker centre in Croydon?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.24.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" colnum="24"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0004.htm#10020246000563">
	<p pid="a.24.1/1">The difference between the policies is that ours is workable. That is the reality. The introduction of electronic border controls and the foreign national ID card has done more, and the numbers are coming down. The significant increases in migration to this country followed the Commonwealth Immigration Act 1961 and the Immigration Act 1971. The people in the ghettos to whom the hon. Member for Kettering referred were not brought into the country by this Government. They were brought into my constituency by the 1961 Act and 1971 Act and the failure of the British Nationality Act 1981, so the problem is not a party political one in reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/2">The workings of our policy can be evidenced by what is happening in Croydon. I shut the Liverpool office so that new applications would be dealt with in Croydon while fresh applications, which in my view are sometimes not robust, would be dealt with in Liverpool. The asylum intake is an important part of net migration to this country, and asylum applications are now at their lowest level- [Hon. Members: &quot;It was tiny!&quot;] It was not tiny. It was 29,000 10 years ago. It is now at the lowest level since 1993. It is not tiny. It is actually just under the total level of tier 1, which is the only thing the proposed cap would address.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/3">I agree with the analysis of the hon. Member for Ashford on the numbers of family members, although they also tried in 1961 to put a cap on the immigration from the Indian subcontinent. It is easy to say that, but one has to have a policy to do it. The English language test for spouses, which I proposed, is coming in, as is the use of English for visa applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/4">As for the point on students, as we clamp down on students and close the 2,000 bogus institutes, of course organised and disorganised people will try to get around things through scams, which is why I have closed those visa offices. It is because we have the new system that I can.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this Adjournment debate about planned major improvements to a transport route that is of considerable importance not only to many of my constituents in Bedford and Kempston but to hundreds of thousands of other people along the route and those who use its many connections. It is also crucial to the economy of London and a wide area north and south of the capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/2">Since I first sought this debate, we have unfortunately experienced the serious deterioration of the rail service operated by First Capital Connect. Therefore, before completing my presentation, it would be entirely remiss of me not to take the opportunity to raise some points about that, not only to reflect the inconvenience suffered by my constituents and others but because what has happened raises some legitimate questions about capability to deliver the much improved service to passengers promised by the Thameslink programme. I shall return to those matters later.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/3">I am pleased to see many hon. Members present for this debate, especially fellow members of the all-party Thameslink route group-my hon. Friends the Members for Crawley (Laura Moffatt), for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper) and for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins), and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1754" name="John Horam">the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam)</phrase>-and others such as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1532" name="Bob Laxton">the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton)</phrase>. I apologise for not referring to the others who are here. I do not think that they have signed up to the all-party group, but they can do so later.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/4">Some of us have benefited from opportunities to inspect aspects of the Thameslink programme works, for which we are grateful to Network Rail, First Capital Connect and various construction companies. The Thameslink service has become such an accepted part of the transport infrastructure of south-east England that it is easy to forget how relatively recently it came about. The electrification of the midlands suburban route between St. Pancras, Moorgate and Bedford had already been started by a previous Labour Government in the late 1970s, when the idea of joining it up with what was then known as the Southern region began to be discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/5">British Rail engineers devised a plan to reopen the Snow Hill tunnel route between Farringdon and Holborn Viaduct stations, a route that had not seen a passenger train since Lloyd George was in Downing street, and from which the last freight service had been withdrawn in 1970. The plan initially was for some kind of shuttle between West Hampstead and south London, but the project eventually grew to become Thameslink: a full-blown network of services linking Bedford and Luton in the north with Gatwick and Brighton in the south via the City of London, with an additional loop serving Wimbledon.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.2/1">I apologise that I am not a member of the hon. Gentleman's all-party Thameslink route group. Someone who represents East Croydon station should definitely be a member of such a group. Would he agree that the small public sector investment in that station was important because it ended up relieving a great deal of stress and strain in terms of cross-London passenger traffic? Does that not emphasise how important it is for the Government to continue to be supportive of such initiatives? Huge amounts of money are being proposed for Crossrail, but north-south movements are just as important as east-west movements in the whole south-east and London area.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.26.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" speakername="Patrick Hall" colnum="26"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0004.htm#10020246000567">
	<p pid="a.26.0/1">The hon. Gentleman anticipates my comments, although I shall not speak against any other project. Crossrail is important as well, but I agree with the fundamental point that we must commit to this programme, and I will say so later on.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/2">I shall give a little of the history, because it is sometimes helpful to put things in that context. A special fleet of dual-voltage trains was ordered from British Rail Engineering which were able to draw electrical power from overhead cables north of Snow Hill and from the third rail to the south of it. Full service was introduced in 1988 and became an immediate success. Indeed, we all recognise that it quickly became the victim of its own success: overcrowding and standing room only became the norm at peak times. I would have liked to illustrate that with passenger numbers for 1988, when the service started, for 2000 and for last year, but, unfortunately and unacceptably, I have been informed that the Department for Transport will not release such figures on the grounds of commercial sensitivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/3">Whether overcrowding is official or not, commuters on the Thameslink route certainly have good reason to feel that they endure unacceptably overcrowded conditions at peak times. The Bedford to Brighton line features in the top 10 most crowded in every survey. Indeed, some research by Network Rail has revealed that 50 per cent. of regular peak-time Thameslink users claim that sometimes the train is so full that they cannot get on it at all. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Like London underground.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/4">Overcrowding was recognised by British Rail, which sought to address it and to widen the scope of the Thameslink service through the Thameslink 2000 programme, which, unfortunately, became mired in the fallout from the chaotic privatisation of the railways and also the complexity of dealing with issues around the Town and Country Planning Acts, especially in south-east London. But, eventually, thanks to the hard work and determination of many, mostly in the public sector, and the robustness of the business case itself, in 2007 the Government were able to give the go-ahead for the Thameslink programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.0/5">The main part of the Thameslink route covers 140 miles of railway and 50 stations between Bedford and Brighton. It interchanges with major rail hubs at St. Pancras and London Bridge, plus international airports at Luton and Gatwick. The core section, from St. Pancras to Blackfriars, carries more passengers than Heathrow airport every day. The Thameslink programme aims to deliver a massive increase in rail capacity through longer trains and high-frequency services, and, in so doing, should indirectly help to tackle overcrowding on other railway lines and parts of the London underground.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.1/1">The hon. Gentleman rightly makes the case for the benefits of extending Thameslink to each and every one of the 50 stations from the Sussex coast up to mid and, indeed, north Bedfordshire, but does he recognise that ensuring that we have sufficient capacity in the centre of London-this obviously applies to the Crossrail debate as well as to the Thameslink debate-is of crucial importance if there is not to be the overcrowding to which he referred earlier?</p>

	<p pid="a.27.0/1">Indeed, the whole of the programme is predicated upon delivering that capacity through engineering changes and improvements in the core, in central London.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/2">The scope of the Thameslink network opened up by engineering improvements in the core, which have just been referred to, will greatly increase beyond the Bedford-Brighton corridor, extending to Peterborough, Cambridge and King's Lynn in the north and to a large number of destinations south of London. Work is well under way in delivering the Thameslink programme. The first phase was completed on time and on budget in March 2009, and essentially prepared for the main construction phase that we are now in, but we should not take that preparation for granted, as it was all about enabling services to run as smoothly as possible during the main construction phase.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/3">We have already benefited from a superb new station at St. Pancras International, which replaced the appalling King's Cross Thameslink, and we will soon see delivery of a new station at Blackfriars, which will span the Thames. It will be ready in time for 2012. Farringdon station has been transformed, including preparation for an interchange with Crossrail, which will greatly increase connectivity for millions of people throughout the Thameslink network as well as east-west along Crossrail itself.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.1/1">The hon. Gentleman knows that I have had disagreements with Thameslink over its choice of the route through London Bridge and the consequent potential effects on Borough market. The battle was fought and lost, so we will have to wait to see whether Borough market survives with the character that it has had. However, the extension from Blackfriars to the south bank is extremely welcome and will do what has been necessary for a long time to link that station to others, although it is a short walk to the Jubilee line, and to make all sorts of other connections possible. That is a very exciting opportunity, and those of us on the south bank look forward very much to the station's opening.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.2/1">I am sure they do. As far as the Thameslink programme is concerned, some people think that Bermondsey is the centre of the universe. I am pleased to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> in this Chamber. I did not mention his name when I began my speech because I do not think that he was here then, but he is a welcome member of the all-party group that I mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/2">Outside London, work is proceeding to extend station platforms to accommodate the new 12-car trains. Phase 3 is London Bridge, which is the most congested place on the whole network: the result of the unplanned approach to railway construction in the capital during the 19th century, creating a railway headache that no one has really sought to tackle until now. London Bridge is crucial to the success of the programme and will unlock the railway and release capacity for 24 trains an hour through the core.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/3">I recently submitted 10 written parliamentary questions to the Department for Transport to check on the progress of this vital scheme. I compliment my hon. Friend the Minister on the fact that most were answered within 24 hours. I should have asked about passenger numbers-and I will. His Department told me that some 1,500 construction workers are currently employed full time on the Thameslink programme, with a further 500 to 700 working part time.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.0/1">I suspect that my hon. Friend will give us some more information about the number of workers employed on the scheme. Does he share my concern that possible redundancies of some of Network Rail's engineering staff could compromise not only the Thameslink programme, but important maintenance work in the whole Southern region?</p>

	<p pid="a.28.1/1">I understand that there are concerns about maintenance on the whole rail network. This is not the place to go into detail on that, although those concerns are certainly shared by many hon. Members. By having such a debate, we put these issues firmly on the agenda and help to get them addressed later, which I hope will happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/2">Mentioning the people employed in the Thameslink project helps to reinforce the point that public transport infrastructure schemes can provide much-needed employment during a recession, when the construction sector is always the first to feel the pain. I have also been informed that an additional 80 train drivers will need to be recruited to operate the additional services from around 2013 onwards. I will say something about driver vacancies and recruitment before concluding.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/3">Through written answers I have learned that the first of the new 12-car and eight-car trains is expected to be delivered by the end of 2013. There is some time to go before that happens and I hope that my long-suffering constituents will be able to stomach that wait, but at least it is coming.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/4">The programme is costing between &#163;5.5 billion and &#163;6 billion, which is a little more than was originally estimated. This information apparently led to briefings or leaks to <i>The Observer</i> newspaper, which reported on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-15">15 November 2008</phrase> that the Thameslink programme was facing</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/5" class="indent">&quot;&#163;750 million of cutbacks in a Treasury crackdown on costly infrastructure projects&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/6">and that</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/7" class="indent">&quot;According to&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/8">unidentified</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/9" class="indent">&quot;rail industry sources, the number of trains passing through central London at peak times could be cut from 24 services per hour...to 20&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/10">which would be most unfortunate.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/11">There has also been speculation about the orders for the new trains and the 1,100 new carriages for the Thameslink network as a whole, which are due to be awarded either by the end of March or during the summer or autumn. I hope that we get some clarity on that situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.0/1">It is crucial for my constituents and for the rail industry in total that this order goes to the only UK-based train assembler or manufacturer that is left in the country. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] I find it ironic that after 150 years or more of the rail industry, if this order went to a company outside the UK, it could be the end of train manufacturing here in the UK and with it could go many jobs: 2,500 in Derby and 12,000 or thereabouts in the supply chain. It is crucial that this contract goes ahead and equally crucial that it is awarded to a UK-based company.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.1/1">I understand my hon. Friend's point and share his view. Of course, the process for dealing with bids must be above board.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/2">When Bombardier failed to deliver the 23 new train units last March I visited it and was impressed: it put its hands up, did not blame anyone else and said that it had made mistakes. In fact, some of Bombardier's suppliers had got into serious difficulties because of the recession and it took over some of the supply chain to ensure that the delivery was completed. Only two weeks ago the last of the 23 trains was delivered, which has caused all kinds of knock-on effects. I was impressed by Bombardier's positive attitude and the fact that it made no excuses whatsoever.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.7/1">If my hon. Friend wishes to secure an Adjournment debate on the case for public ownership of the national asset that is the rail network, I shall be there with him.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.7/2">We all know that concern about public finances is high on the political agenda. The Government's deficit-reduction plan will include tough departmental cuts and the official Opposition have stated that the country has run out of money, that we face a decade of austerity and that an emergency Budget will follow within 50 days of a Conservative election victory. I state as firmly as I can that the Thameslink programme must be delivered: no delays, no dilution. It is essential on social, economic and environmental grounds. The business case depends on completion of the major works at London Bridge, which must not be cut. Indeed, it turns out that the programme is integral to supporting the economy as we emerge from the recession. If anyone doubts this, they should ask the passengers along the route, including my constituents. Up to &#163;6 billion is a lot of money, but this is an extremely cost-effective use of money. To cut back on the final phase-London Bridge-would put the brake on the part of the programme that will deliver the biggest benefit. It would be short-sighted, foolish and a tragedy to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that we cannot stop-start railway projects, which are long-term projects that, once committed to, should be followed through and, if curtailed, would be a cost to the public purse. Does he agree that it would help if, prior to the election, all three parties committed to proceeding with the Thameslink programme as planned? May I say, to start the ball rolling, that the Liberal Democrats do so?</p>

	<p pid="a.30.1/1">I certainly endorse that example of parties working together in the country's interests, because that is what should happen sometimes. We will have an opportunity today to hear about that if someone picks up that helpful suggestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/2">Before concluding with questions to the Minister, I shall speak about First Capital Connect. I appreciate that there will be an Adjournment debate on the subject tomorrow, so I need not go into great detail, as I could, but issues arise that are relevant to how trains will operate on completion of the Thameslink programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/3">I acknowledge the disruption, inconvenience and additional cost borne by many of my constituents and thousands of others from mid-November to the end of January. That arose principally from the decision of drivers, mostly at the Bedford depot, to work only their contracted hours, and not to volunteer to work on their rest days. That was connected with FirstGroup's decision to offer a pay award that included a 0 per cent. increase for the first year. However, negotiations were still proceeding with ASLEF, and there was no need, in terms of collective bargaining procedures, for the unofficial action. It seems that the situation was bound up with frustration owing to disruption and delay of promised training, triggered by Bombardier's failure-it was not entirely its fault, as I acknowledged-to deliver 23 new class 377 trains between October 2008 and March 2009, and principally because of knock-on effects of First Capital's taking on the new Bedford-Sevenoaks service. That combination created difficulties in delivering the driver training that FCC had promised. Suffice it to say that FCC must now demonstrate to the public and the Government that it will get on top of its industrial relations and help to restore the good will that is essential to running the railway.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that First Capital Connect should have been swifter in coming forward with a compensation package for regular travellers on the line, and does he share my hope that even now it will widen the scope of that package?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.31.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" speakername="Patrick Hall" colnum="31"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0005.htm#10020246000585">
	<p pid="a.31.0/1">Because things were happening so fast daily, and with the exceptional weather, it was probably difficult to please everyone instantly. People always want more compensation, and the latest offer, which I believe is about to go online, is much more generous than was mooted earlier. Some of my constituents may not be happy with it, but on balance I have concluded that the compensation package is now reasonable and fair. FCC has taken on additional staff to cope with the demands and claims, and I believe that it is determined to learn lessons for industrial relations and compensation from its dreadful experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/2">The period during which drivers started to work to contract, leading to the emergency timetable and the 50 per cent. reduction in the service from Bedford, led to all sorts of claims about driver numbers and vacancies. I have heard all sorts of suggestions about the number of unfilled vacancies, which I have not yet got to the bottom of, but I am determined to do so, and it is in the public interest that the House does so. Whatever Department of Transport officials say is commercially confidential, I ask the industry to be clear and open with the public, because that will help to restore confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/3">When FCC took over the franchise in 2006, it proceeded to recruit 30 extra drivers-13 were recruited after April 2009, and 16 more were recruited after November-beyond the normal recruitment level needed to cope with retirement and so on. The extra trains integral to the Thameslink service will generate further recruitment needs. I have been assured that FCC has in place mechanisms to review the establishment regularly to ensure that the enhanced service made possible by the Thameslink programme is delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/4">FCC must acknowledge that the difficulties created for passengers by the drivers' work-to-contract episode, and later the snow and ice, were greatly exacerbated by an incompetent communications system. Again, I am confident that lessons have been learned, and that improvements will be made over the next several months. FCC is spending money on that. I have referred to the point about compensation made by my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/5">I shall conclude with some questions to the Minister. Will he confirm the Government's unwavering commitment to completion of the whole of the Thameslink project as already programmed? Will he tell me, now or later, what proportion of the overall benefit will be delivered by completion of phase 3, which is officially, if clumsily, known as key output 2-that is, London Bridge? Will he tell me why delivery of the 1,100 new carriages in the form of 12-car and 8-car units does not coincide with the planned completion of the Thameslink programme? The latter is 2012, but the new trains are apparently due at the end of 2013. Will the Minister confirm when the preferred bidder to supply the new trains will be announced, and when the contract will be placed?</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/6">The Minister will know that First Capital Connect encountered further problems during the cold weather because the sliding doors on the class 319 units froze tight due to snow penetration. That did not happen throughout the network on trains fitted with plug doors. As the 1,100 new carriages will have sliding and not plug doors, will he reconsider that specification?</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/7">FCC is addressing the need for improvements that it can deliver on passenger and station staff information, but industry-wide issues are being examined by the Minister's Department, with Network Rail and train operators as a whole. Is he in a position to apprise me and the House of progress and a programme of action?</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/8">Will my hon. Friend tell me what might happen to the Bedford depot and sidings when the 12-car trains are introduced? I understand that there is insufficient space to accommodate trains of that length, which are of the fixed formation type, so they cannot be broken up.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/9">Finally, it is in the public interest to know about passenger numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/10">There is always more to add, but despite the problems of the past two and a half months, we are approaching a time when the congestion and overcrowding of the past 20 years will be overcome. That is good and positive news, and an outcome to which I hope everyone is committed.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">the hon. Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase> on securing this debate. He is an energetic chairman of the all-party group on the Thameslink route, and I am an enthusiastic supporter of that group. As he said, the core part of that important project is the bit between St. Pancras and Blackfriars, but the third stage, to which he referred, is the improvements that we will get up to 2015-unfortunately rather a long way away-to the Borough market junction and London Bridge station, which are equally important to the project. I am an enthusiastic supporter of the project because I represent people in south London and Orpington who use that service. As the hon. Gentleman knows, there have been huge problems with congestion of services through London Bridge station over many years because of the historic bottleneck resulting from unplanned development of railways during the 19th century. The problem was not tackled during the 20th century, and it is amazing that we have had to wait until the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/2">Perhaps I can read out a short section of a letter that amply exemplifies the problems faced by my constituents. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-08">8 January</phrase>, a lady wrote to Southeastern Trains about a train journey that took place between London Bridge and Orpington on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-07">7 January</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/3" class="indent">&quot;I wish to make a strong complaint about the overcrowding on the above train...I was unable to move or breathe easily. It was not possible to remove my hat, gloves or answer my mobile phone. With lots of layers of clothing on and my coat&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/4">obviously, January 7 was a very cold day-</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/5" class="indent">&quot;I was unable to stop myself from overheating. I can honestly say you were lucky no one was injured in my carriage...There was no security or help from the platform before leaving London Bridge...Thoughts were going through my mind of the Heysel stadium&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/6">It does get that bad on some of these overcrowded commuter trains at certain times of day or night. That letter, written this year, indicates the daily problems that my constituents are facing, which, hopefully, will be alleviated in years to come by the Thameslink programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/7">The problem is not simply one of overcrowding on a daily basis, but of some of the choices that the Southeastern Trains operating company has to make. For example, it has had to cancel the only services between Orpington, Petts Wood and New Cross-an important area of employment for my constituents with Goldsmiths college and so on-to put in a new service to Lewisham to serve Canary Wharf. Obviously, Canary Wharf is also a source of employment for my constituents, but Southeastern Trains has had to choose between the two because the capacity constraints on that line are such that there cannot be both. That is frankly ridiculous in the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/8">That is the overcrowding problem that we face. As we know, the notes sent out by Network Rail for this debate stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/9" class="indent">&quot;The track and signalling around London Bridge is the most complicated and congested in Europe. By 'untangling' the rail infrastructure at London Bridge we can deliver the massive capacity increase that 100,000s of passengers need and a high frequency service through central London.&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/10">That is what we are looking for. I appreciate the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase>-who is also a member of the all-party group on the Thameslink route-about the serious conflict between Borough market and the needs of passenger services in that area. It is a great pity that the problem has had to be resolved with some disadvantage to Borough market. The market is a wonderful piece of London's heritage, and although the solution that has been reached means some truncation of Borough market, I hope that it will none the less mean that the service can provide for what is an important part of south-east London's history.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.0/1">I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's sensitive reference to that issue. Only time will tell, although we will lose some listed buildings and the whole configuration will be different. I accept the case for having more lines to London Bridge, but the only issue that has not yet been resolved is that of ensuring that the South London line has enough platforms and can continue its loop round from Victoria. The Minister is aware of that point, as I have been to see him. That is the one remaining piece of engineering organisation that, if it could be resolved, would considerably help people in our part of the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.1/1">I am sure that the Minister will hear what the hon. Gentleman has said. The final point made by the hon. Member for Bedford, quite rightly, is that this programme should not be cut. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">The hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> strongly supported that, and it is certainly uppermost in our minds. This programme should not be cut and we should be committed to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/2">Unfortunately, I must point out to the hon. Member for Bedford that his Government have presided over an economic crisis that has led to the spending of billions of pounds that could otherwise go towards this sort of infrastructure. Equally, they have squandered public funds on a heroic-perhaps I should say unheroic-scale, as a result of which, productivity in the public sector has gone down. There is a problem that we must face realistically.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/3">The sort of solution we need was set out on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-26">26 January</phrase> in the <i>Financial Times</i>, which pointed out that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has already announced cuts in capital expenditure of about one half over the next four or five years. Our worry is that the project under discussion could be included in that sort of cut. It was pointed out that we could match up the funds of the pensions industry, for example, which need long-term revenue to service, with the income flows from such transport infrastructure. That could provide an alternative source of financing for these big projects, apart from public sector funds. Unfortunately, we have a rather unhappy history with the private finance initiative, which, again, has not been handled well by the Government. If we are to save such projects, alternative ways of financing the transport infrastructure must be taken into account and used imaginatively. It is vital that such projects go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/4">Recently, I was on a trip with the Foreign Affairs Committee to Madrid and Lisbon, and I saw for myself the effect on a capital city of modern transport services and roads-of course, in those cases there was access to large amounts of European Union funds. One can see the galvanising effect that that sort of infrastructure has on quality of life, as well as on the economic performance of those cities. London desperately needs that sort of spending on such schemes. That is why I am an enthusiastic member of the all-party group on the Thameslink route, and I hope that the scheme will go ahead in its entirety.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.0/1">I shall try to be as brief as possible to enable other hon. Members to speak. First, I congratulate my hon. Friend-and my genuine friend-<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">the Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase> on securing the debate and on what he has said today. Like him, I am a massive enthusiast of railways in general, and the modernisation of Thameslink in particular. I have thousands of constituents who, like my hon. Friend, travel every day by Thameslink. I have been a commuter on that line for the past 41 years, and I still use it every day. Therefore, I know the problem. Some years ago, I think I had an influence in persuading Ministers to build the box station at St. Pancras International, pointing out that if we had not done that, Eurostar services would have been seriously damaged. The line is a serious provider of passengers straight on to Eurostar. Because of that box station, those of us who live on the Thameslink line can pop over to Paris at short notice-something I have done myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/2">The improvement of the through-London service is excellent and vital, and I am happy about the concept. However, I must raise some concerns about the engineering and the technology. Friends of mine in the industry-engineers in particular-have said that there are serious problems. From time to time I read magazines such as <i>Modern Railways</i>, which give me a bit of insight into how things work. Trying to get 24 trains through that middle section is a major problem. That is a large number of trains, and it is not a simple through-route. There are two routes feeding in from GNER and from the midlands to King's Cross and St. Pancras. Sequencing all those trains and ensuring that they get through on time and can stop, offload, onload and move on will be a serious problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/3">To an extent, that has been partly recognised, but there are other problems. That section of the line has some of the steepest gradients in the country. Will we have sufficient power to allow trains to get through those gradients sufficiently quickly? I understand that most trains have eight driven axles for a four-car unit, but we may need to increase the number of driven axles-which increases costs-to ensure that trains can cope with those gradients at sufficient speed to get through the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/4">The switchover from overhead AC power lines to third-rail DC drive also takes time. I see that every day at Farringdon. That is another potential problem that can slow trains down. As I have said, that has been recognised to an extent. There is some suggestion of having automatic train operation between Kentish Town and Blackfriars. Automatic train operation has not been tried in Britain on a mainline service. It is used on the Victoria line, but not elsewhere. It has not been tried, and certainly not on a complex system such as Thameslink, where there are two railway lines coming into one at St. Pancras. Automatic operation in a dry, straight tunnel with no complications is one thing, but where there are problems with weather such as wet track, leaf fall or frost if some of the track is exposed, something called defensive braking will be required in the automatic operation to ensure that the trains do not slip and that they get through. Again, that could cause delay and would certainly add enormous costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/5">I therefore suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that what we need at this stage, before things go wrong and we say, &quot;Oh dear, we can't deal with this; there's a problem&quot;, is a thorough review of all the engineering problems in the system by BR-trained engineers in all the specialisms required, not by project managers and people who have little experience in railways, and without pressure from Network Rail or contractors to gloss over details. We must get this right, and I ask the Minister to secure a thorough engineering review by an independent group of engineers with all the necessary skills to ensure that we do not make mistakes and that we get it right.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.0/1">I hope to be able to advise my hon. Friend. This may not negate the need for the engineering review that he is calling for, but I understand that the intention is to have a section of track available to test the automatic train operation technologies well in advance of any intention to implement them.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.35.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="35"  time="011:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0006.htm#10020246000593">
	<p pid="a.35.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that. It is welcome. One other point is that there are signalling and electrical power problems. Already there have been line-side fires in the tunnel between Farringdon and City Thameslink. That, I understand, is caused by arcing from the third rails, because the delivery for electricity to those tracks is at one end of that section of track rather than, typically, in the centre, which means that the voltages must be higher to drive the current longer distances. Those points have been made to me by engineers who understand these things-I have some technical knowledge myself-and they are serious matters. If one line-side fire stops 24 trains an hour, a two-hour blockage stops 48 trains, and if 48 12-car trains are suddenly stopped, we have a real crisis. We cannot afford to have things going wrong on a line of this importance any more than we could afford serious problems on some of the major underground routes. At least sometimes there are alternatives to underground routes. There may not be alternatives for Thameslink. I have raised those matters with the Minister to ensure that he is aware that there are potential engineering problems and to ask him to investigate the possibility of having a thorough review.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.36.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="36"  time="011:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0006.htm#10020246000594">
	<p pid="a.36.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">the hon. Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase> for the opportunity provided by the debate. I shall make just a short contribution, but I am one of those colleagues who have been involved in all the discussions about Thameslink for many years. I just gently say that of course the project used to be called Thameslink 2000; we have slipped a little in relation to its delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/2">I want to make several points. One is that at the fantastic new St. Pancras station-I agree about how wonderful it is-there is still, for both British and international travellers, some confusion about which lines run from where. Obviously, the Eurostar is clearly signed, but it is not entirely clear, from all entrances, where people should catch other services from, and that information can be crucial to people's timetabling and their ability to get from ticket office to train and from one line to another. Although that is not directly a Thameslink responsibility, it is relevant to users of Thameslink and interconnecting passengers, so I make a plea that Thameslink use its good influence, and Network Rail and those who manage St. Pancras also act to ensure that there is a clear set of signs so that people can be clear about which trains leave from the upper level, about which trains leave from the lower level at the back and about Eurostar.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/3">Secondly, in relation to London Bridge, which is the biggest issue affecting my constituency and has been referred to already by the hon. Members for Bedford and for Orpington (Mr. Horam), I shall not refight the battle that we fought. We argued that there was an alternative route that might have been a good one-either the Herne Hill route or a new route by a new bridge over the Thames. That could have avoided the problem of having to demolish many listed buildings at London Bridge. However, it is important that as part of the new project London Bridge station is reconstructed. I think that it is still the station in London that has most passengers through it every day. It is phenomenally busy and congested, and many of the trains into and out of it are, as the hon. Member for Orpington rightly pointed out, phenomenally busy and congested. That can be very unpleasant and, indeed, dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/4">The local community that lives around the station will have to pay the price of all the works, which have started on the site next door. The tallest building in London is being built there at the moment. I am referring to the Shard of Glass at London Bridge. The community is signed up to that project, on the understanding that phase 1 will be completed before 2012. There will be a pause during the Olympic period and there will be a second phase after that. I absolutely endorse the plea from the hon. Member for Bedford and others that we do not see the project grind to a halt after phase 1. I am very grateful for the commitment by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> that makes clear the importance that we attach to the completion after 2012 of the rest of the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/5">Thirdly, there is a bit-I say &quot;a bit&quot;; it is not insignificant. A further part of the work is on the line out of London Bridge station, as part of the works in Bermondsey. Again, that is entirely supported by me and the community. We just want to signal and register our support for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/6">Fourthly, I have indicated the real excitement that there is about the opportunity of Blackfriars station extending across the river. That is being sold and presented very well by Thameslink, which has put posters across Blackfriars bridge making it clear that it will be the first cross-river railway station either ever or for a very long time-I cannot remember, although I ought to. That in itself is exciting. It is frustrating that we did not win the battle all those years ago when the Jubilee line alignment was determined, meaning that there could have been an interconnection at the station, on the south side, so people would not have had to come out of the station but could have linked to another. The local community is paying a small price at the moment in terms of pedestrian disruption, but the community negotiated with Thameslink and Network Rail; it is understanding of that. As long as the timetable is kept to, it is entirely understood and appreciated.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.37.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="37"  time="011:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0006.htm#10020246000596">
	<p pid="a.37.1/1">I am pleased to hear that. The Minister is very welcome to visit my constituency socially, as well as for political reasons, at any time. As someone who, wearing another hat, chairs the Mayor of London's Thames festival, which now has just short of 1 million visitors in September every year, I know that ensuring that the pedestrian flows along the riverbank work well through all the building work is important to ensure that there is no inconvenience. Again, we shall need to ensure, as Blackfriars station comes on-stream on the south side, that we have the most effective signs and intercommunication, so that people understand the great benefit of getting off at Southwark underground station on the Jubilee line and making that connection. We need to ensure that that works well, even though it is a few hundred yards out in the open.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/2">Fifthly, I turn to signalling, a point that was made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase>. I was keen, when the opportunity arose again in the time of the Conservative Government, to ensure that we had an extension to the London underground. In the end, it was not the initially preferred solution, but the Jubilee line extension was certainly welcome. We had to fight to ensure that it was not just a fast line that went from London Bridge and Waterloo straight to Canary Wharf, and we managed to win the battle to get stations in Southwark and Bermondsey, which are also welcome. Ten years on, we are celebrating 10 years of the extension, but there are many closures for re-signalling work. That will obviously produce a good outcome but, although I am no engineer, I want to flag up the importance of ensuring that we get the signalling work in place such that there will be a longer period through which it will be expected to work without disruption, because little is worse than having a fantastic new line that then needs upgrades and on which there are weekend closures and other disruption fairly shortly after it has been put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/3">My last point is one that I have made to Network Rail and to Thameslink. At the moment, there cannot be a seamless connection, because of the works done, from the south to the north, particularly at weekends or at night, when people might be able to get to London Bridge but then find that there is no service that goes all the way through, and they have to reconnect at St. Pancras. It is therefore very important to ensure, again, that the information is clear in advance. Having once gone with others to catch a plane, I know that if a service is not there when people think that it will be, they will miss not just their train, but their flight from Luton, Gatwick or elsewhere. Can we therefore make sure that there is really good advance information all the year round at all stations along the line about what happens at weekends and at nights when there is no connection? People will then know exactly what to do and what the quickest connecting route is. Can we also ensure that all the other transport operators work together with Thameslink and Network Rail?</p>

	<p pid="a.38.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">the Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase> on raising this important issue. As a member of the all-party group, I have learned exactly what the Thameslink programme will mean for our constituents, which is why we have put in extra work looking at improvements, watching out for the things that will affect our constituents and trying to intervene through debates such as this. It is a pleasure to be here, although I shall take only a couple of minutes to speak, so that all hon. Members get an opportunity to contribute to this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/2">We are here because of our constituents. The lives of some have been disrupted by what, in many ways, is the First Capital Connect debacle, and people have had a difficult time. It is hard for us as Members of Parliament fighting for improvements to Thameslink to see our constituents experience that totally avoidable disruption to their lives; all those of us who travel into London every day understand exactly what they are going through. Having their rail journeys disrupted is truly upsetting and can make the rest of their day a miserable experience. That is the last thing that we want.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/3">We understand what the &#163;5.5 billion of improvements will mean. Those of us who were lucky enough to take a cab to look at the magnificent improvements around King's Cross and at the amazing work that is going on there were immensely proud to see that we can have first-class rail travel services. As I said, we are all here for our constituents, and although we have a firm eye on the Olympics and on the important improvements that can be put in place for people travelling into London-certainly from Gatwick airport-that is a bit of a side issue; we are talking about our constituents and ensuring that their journey times are good.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/4">Of course, we also want to ensure that our constituents' journeys are safe. Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase>, I have been concerned about the loss of engineering jobs at Network Rail. That is because we have been listening to people who know and love the railways and who understand what that loss might mean. I am delighted that the Office of the Rail Regulator is now keeping a close eye on what Network Rail is up to, to ensure that my constituents are safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/5">We need to know that the Thameslink upgrade programme will be completed in its entirety; if it were not, that would be a travesty of justice. We have sold the whole programme to our constituents on the basis that their lives as members of the travelling public will be massively improved soon, in five years. That is what people deserve. We know the prosperity that the changes will bring. When we were at school, we understood how important the Stockton-to-Darlington railway was and what improvements and prosperity it brought to communities. In the same way, we know that the current programme will improve the way in which people live and work in the south-east. That is why we are so desperate to see the programme finished in its entirety.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/6">I completely understand that those who have to make a decision about the two remaining competitors for the Thameslink rolling stock project must be extremely careful, but I do not have to be. I should say that I am convinced that the Bombardier project needs to be selected. I went on an Industry and Parliamentary Trust transport group visit to look at the trains being constructed in Derby, and I was utterly blown away by the professionalism that I saw. As we know, there have been difficulties, but those involved have held their hands up, and we can move on. I am firmly putting my flag up for the Bombardier team and I hope that it gets the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/7">The Thameslink programme is enormous. If we go to the Network Rail and Thameslink programme website, it is hard even to conceive of the number of projects that are running at one time-it is tremendous. People should look at the magnificent depot proposed for Three Bridges, which is the central station in my constituency. The project will provide 300 new jobs, but I need the Minister to reassure me that it will go ahead so that we can look forward to restoring Three Bridges and making it the major hub that it was many years ago. When I was a small baby, my parents moved to Crawley New Town, and Three Bridges was at the heart of the train service. We look forward to those days returning. The Minister has been fantastic on train issues, and I ask him to reassure us that the Thameslink programme is safe in the Government's hands.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/8">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> asked, can we ensure that information is there for passengers and gives them the opportunity to know when there will be disruptions? Major improvements mean disruption for our constituents, so we need to let them know what is going on. I have been impressed by the information that has been put in place so far, but that needs to continue. Let us see the Thameslink programme benefit all our constituencies, so that we can be proud of it for many years to come.</p>

I acknowledge-no, more than acknowledge-the comments made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> about awarding the contract to Bombardier, which is a UK-based company.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/2">It is clear from the debate that some hon. Members in the Chamber have far more knowledge about the ins and outs and the nuts and bolts of the Thameslink route than I do. My expertise, if I have any, comes from my home city of Derby. I want briefly to reinforce the points that I made in my intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/3">Although Bombardier in Derby has a reasonable amount of work, it will be disastrous if the company fails to win the Thameslink contract, because it would effectively run out of work over the next couple of years. As a result of what is happening in the world economy, the UK wants to rebuild its industry, to get people back into work and to sustain them in work.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.0/1">I absolutely support my hon. Friend's point that the contract should go to Bombardier. However, this is about not only Bombardier, but British manufacturing and the loss of skills. If we ever lost that manufacturing capacity, it would be almost impossible to recreate, and our balance of trade deficit, which is already massive, would become even larger. We would be on the way to ceasing to be a manufacturing nation, with seriously damaging consequences for the long term.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.1/1">I agree entirely. That is why it is vital that a UK-based company should win the work.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/2">I am on record as being somewhat critical-that is perhaps an understatement-of some of the ordering processes at the Department for Transport. The most recent example involved the inter-city express contract being awarded to Agility Trains, a consortium that includes Hitachi of Japan. The contract was said to have the potential to create 12,500 jobs, but as we will find out in due course, there will be no manufacturing jobs or supply-chain jobs for UK plc. There might be a few hundred jobs maintaining the trains, although that would apply whoever won the contract, because maintenance depots would have to be established. I am particularly critical about that.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.3/1">I have a crucial question for the Minister: can he give us a clear indication of when the contract will be awarded? Derby is a centre of rail expertise. Perhaps it is also, to a degree, a centre of rail gossip; much of that is accurate, and the word out on the bush telegraph is that a decision to award the contract is likely to be made at the end of March. Can the Minister confirm that that is so, and, if not, will he make it clear when the decision will be taken-although, of course, a period of negotiation is likely beyond that time?</p>

	<p pid="a.40.4/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">the hon. Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase> on his speech and on the work that he has done with the all-party Thameslink Route group. I checked this morning, and I am a member of that group; I am happy to be so.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.4/2">My remarks are predominantly about the long-term plans-not too long-term, I hope-for the improvement of the railway line, but I want first to make one or two brief comments about First Capital Connect, because that is relevant to the Thameslink project.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.4/3">It is clear that First Capital Connect has let passengers down badly. There are serious issues about the rostering of train drivers and whether they will be expected to work overtime as a matter of course, which effectively creates vulnerability to working to rule. There is also the serious issue of whether more money should have been spent on training more train drivers. That is relevant to the parliamentary question, tabled by the hon. Member for Bedford, about the number of extra train drivers who would be required to operate the enhanced Thameslink service.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.4/4">The Minister gave a figure of 80, but I should be interested to know whether that assumes the existing working pattern for drivers or, as I hope, a more sensible approach to working pattern and arrangements for drivers. In passing, I should say that the consequences for the south of London have not perhaps been as bad as those for the north of London, partly because Southern has coped well with the unexpected problems that it has had to deal with because of First Capital Connect's inadequacies. The Minister will be aware that there is a considerable movement under way in the House in favour of First Capital Connect's having its franchise removed. I refer to the early-day motion tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase>, which many hon. Members-of all parties, I think-have signed.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.4/5">Because the debate relates to the timetable and the 2015 dates and stages set out by the hon. Member for Bedford, it would be useful if the Minister said something about his intentions for the First Capital Connect franchise. It can end naturally in 2012, or be extended to 2015. It is, I think, clear that the Minister and the Department wanted to extend it to 2015, because of the coterminosity with the end of the Southern franchise, which was clearly in their minds.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.4/6">Many of my constituents, and those of other hon. Members present for the debate, might be unhappy to be told that there will be another five years with that company in charge, given how abysmally it has performed so far. A third option, of course, would be for the Minister to remove the franchise early, as happened with the Great North Eastern Railway and National Express. Some early clarification on that point would be helpful. If the Minister cannot give an answer today, can he say at what point the Government intend to make a statement of intention about the First Capital Connect franchise?</p>

	<p pid="a.41.0/1">The hon. Gentleman may have heard my question, following one from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, in Transport questions last week. The Minister was definitely open-minded about the future of the franchise. Indeed, the possibility of taking it back into public ownership was not ruled out.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.1/1">I heard that he was open-minded, but also that he was uncertain about the conclusion, which is why I thought it might be prudent to push the matter again today.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/2">The Thameslink programme is clearly a major investment, with major public benefit not just for rail passengers but for the economy of the areas that the route serves. It has had a long gestation. Rail schemes that were formulated decades ago seem to have taken an enormous amount of time to proceed. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> mentioned the fact that Thameslink used to be called Thameslink 2000, and that it is now 2010 but we still do not have it.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/3">It is important for all Members of Parliament to accept that we cannot stop-start rail projects of such magnitude. They need long-term planning and commitment, and stop-starting costs money in cancellation fees. It is also, frankly, an incoherent way to run public policy on railways. For those reasons, and because there has already been delay, and given the difficult financial situation to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1754" name="John Horam">the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam)</phrase> referred, which doubtless will continue under the next Government of whatever colour, it is important not to take short-term decisions that damage the country in the medium and long terms and are financially incompetent. It is clear to me that there should be no reduction in the Thameslink programme as planned. That is the position that my party formally adopts, and will adopt for the general election. It would be helpful today, for future planning, if the Conservative spokesman and the Minister were to give similar assurances.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/4">There is no point in my repeating the specific questions put by the hon. Member for Bedford and the hon. Member for Luton, North, but they were germane to the nuts and bolts of the scheme and I hope that the Minister will respond in detail. If he cannot, I hope that perhaps, as a courtesy, he will write to all the Members who have attended the debate, with specific answers to those important questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/5">The question of the sliding doors was raised, and I confirm that it is a serious issue. It is important at the present design stage that that matter should be properly addressed. Either the doors should be changed or a mechanism should be introduced to prevent the sort of problem that occurred with the sliding doors of the 319s-which, by the way, are regarded in the trade as dustbin trains. That is the current terminology. I see that we are to get some of them cascaded down to the Brighton to Eastbourne route by the Government. Perhaps <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1454" name="David Lepper">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, may take an interest in that matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/6">The hon. Member for Orpington spoke about the funding of future transport schemes. It is important to make it plain at this point that, notwithstanding the economic difficulties that the country faces, there is a sensible economic case-perhaps even more so because of the economic circumstances-for investing in jobs, and particularly those that bring an environmental benefit, in the light of the challenge of climate change. That is why my party will make the creation of green jobs a priority at the general election.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/7">Railway investment fits firmly into that scenario. For that reason, I should be interested in the Minister's confirmation of plans for the introduction of new rolling stock. We have been promised 1,300 new carriages on many occasions. A bit like Billy Bunter's postal order, they never quite turn up; we are hoping that one day they will. Perhaps the Minister can give an answer about that and deal with the inconsistency in the timing, between 2012 and 2013, that has been mentioned in relation to Thameslink.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.0/1">I have no doubt that some are in service, but that is not quite the point that I was making, which was about the delivery date and in-service delivery date for the 1,300 vehicles that were referred to. That matter is difficult to pin down-a bit like jelly.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.0/2">An important point that arises from the debate so far relates to through-London services. A couple of hon. Members have touched on that important issue. If we are to have major capacity constraints, as we do on the network all round London-and it is not easy to see a solution in terms of creating extra capacity at the termini in London-it is important to have efficient, fully working through-London services. Such services, with termination points either side of London, allow far more trains to be used than services that terminate at a London terminus, whose turn-around times mean that a much more limited number of trains can be got in and out of the station. Through-London services are important for enhancement of capacity, which is why the points made by the hon. Member for Luton, North, in particular, are important.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.2/1">They do, and the opening of the Snow Hill tunnel has been a transformation. We ought to build on such changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/2">The Thameslink programme is crucial to London, as is the Crossrail project. It is important to have consistency and predictability. It would be a service to our constituents if all parties were able to commit to the project and remove any uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.3/1">It is a great pleasure, Lady Winterton, to see you in the Chair. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">the hon. Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase> on securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/2">I shall not touch upon First Capital Connect rail services today, because we have an hour-and-a-half debate on the subject tomorrow. I shall target my remarks particularly on key output 2 of the Thameslink project, and later I shall ask some questions of the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/3">The hon. Member for Bedford was right to state that it is a long-running saga. The project was formerly called Thameslink 2000-some thought that it should have been Thameslink never-and it is now the Thameslink programme. If it is to happen, it will be delivered by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/4">A number of interesting and thoughtful contributions have been made to the debate, and I shall refer to them during my remarks. The Thameslink programme is split into two key delivery phases-key outputs 1 and 2-and as the hon. Member for Bedford so correctly said, the preparatory phase was delivered in 2009. Key output 1 includes the building of a new station at Blackfriars, the transformation of Farringdon and a number of platform-lengthening schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/5">One of the pleasures of contributing to such debates is that I speak not only for my party but for my constituents, who are affected by Thameslink. One matter that has been referred to a number of times is the ability to allow through traffic. On a parochial basis, speaking on behalf of my constituents, I have a question for the Minister. The Secretary of State kindly promised that when the draft timetable was published he would consider whether the Sutton loop could allow through trains to St. Pancras, rather than every train having to stop at Blackfriars. Will the Minister confirm that my constituents can still rely on that promise?</p>

	<p pid="a.44.1/1">I shall keep that promise tucked away.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/2">Key output 2 is crucial. A number of Members have referred to it, and questions have touched on the subject. This debate gives the Minister the chance to confirm or deny many things. The main part of key output 2, as we heard, is the rebuilding of track, the rebuilding of London Bridge station and the letting of the rolling-stock contracts. In total, the latter would facilitate the running of 24 12-car trains an hour through the core section. The programme will include signal alterations, new platforms and the complete reorganisation of the underground station. It is all very exciting.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/3">Today's debate is welcome because, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1532" name="Bob Laxton">the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton)</phrase> said, the railway industry is one of rumour and bush telegraph; it has also given rise to a huge number of railway magazines and learned journals. I have a number of questions for the Minister; he may wish to answer them or at least clarify the Government's position.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/4">The works on the track and at London Bridge station are key parts of the Mayor of London's strategy, and they support the entire economic and transport capacity of London and the south-east. However, it is widely rumoured, not only in the article referred to earlier, that the rebuild and the track works are considerably over the budget set by Network Rail and the Government. The cost evaluation has been undertaken through Network Rail's guide to railway investment projects-GRIP-process.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/5">Will the Minister tell us whether GRIP stage 3 is now complete? Will he say what is the scale of the overruns against the original allocated budget for key output 2-is it &#163;500 million, &#163;600 million, &#163;700 million or &#163;800 million? Will he confirm that Network Rail's proposed solution is not to bring the costs back into line but to de-scope the project? Will he confirm that the Mayor of London has written to the Secretary of State, pointing out what many Members have said-that only if full output is achieved for the allocated budget will we get the real benefits of the project, otherwise the viability of the scheme will be undermined?</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/6">It is widely anticipated-I am sure that the Minister will be aware of this-that Network Rail will seek to change the plans for London Bridge construction. In the original output 6A, the specification proposal was for nine through platforms rather than six. I understand that the sponsor team has iterated that specification and reiterated it to Network Rail. Network Rail has not come up with a plan to deliver nine through platforms within the allocated budget and with acceptable passenger congestion. Will the Minister confirm that Network Rail does not propose building nine through platforms? Will he give an estimation of the impact on through trains, with trains not being able to stop at London Bridge, if we do not get the full scaling of the project?</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/7">There is a major design issue here. If those through platforms are not delivered, I understand that a redesign of the entry and exit points to the underground station will be necessary, which will involve a renewed planning application. Will the Minister confirm that that is so, and if so what will be the overall delay to the scheme? Will he confirm that it is the Government's intention to ask Network Rail to respond to option 6A for London Bridge with a realistic operational and cost proposition? If the Government do not intend to do so now, exactly when will it happen? We heard earlier about the Bedford depot, but will the Minister deal with the rumour that the Hornsey depot, which is crucial to the stabling of trains, is also under threat from local planning requirements, and that the local council is likely to refuse that application?</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/8">Thameslink, through its procurement process, is supposed to deliver 24 12-car trains an hour. Rumours are circulating on the bush telegraph that the number is to be reduced from 24 to 20. Will the Minister tell us that that will not happen? Will he confirm that preferred bidders have been asked to retender on the basis of 20 trains, or have the Government given no advice on that? Will he say whether he has taken consequential legal advice on the Thameslink procurement contract? If there is to be a de-scoping of the contract for the Thameslink programme, will the whole contract have to be retendered? Many of us have asked when the Minister will be making the Thameslink procurement announcement. Can we expect it at the end of March? If so, can we take it that 24 trains an hour will be delivered?</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/9">While on the subject of procurement, the Minister did not answer the question about the 1,300 vehicles-nor did I expect him to. However, I wish to test him on a couple of other procurement matters. Will he confirm that the financial bidder for Agility Trains has withdrawn, and that the Government are retendering that contract to rolling-stock leasing companies? Will he also confirm that the Government do not intend to buy the extra 42 Pendolinos to allow the west coast main line to run 11-car trains rather than nine-car trains?</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/10">Finally, on the subject of signalling, will the Minister confirm whether Network Rail proposes abandoning automatic train operation and giving no consideration to ERTMS, the European rail traffic management system, but have decided instead to revert entirely to manual signalling? What implications will that have for the effectiveness of the delivery of the Thameslink programme?</p>

	<p pid="a.45.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">the Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase> on securing this debate. As chair of the all-party group on the Thameslink route, he obviously has a particular interest in the subject. I will try not to be diverted by questions on the recent performance of First Capital Connect, because there will be an hour-and-a-half debate on the subject tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/2">I welcome the opportunity to outline the good progress that is being made in delivering this vital programme that will transform the travel experience for many thousands of commuters in London and the south-east of England. The Thameslink programme is one of the Government's key transport priorities announced in the 2007 White Paper, &quot;Delivering a Sustainable Railway&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/3">The programme is a crucial part of our strategy to tackle chronic overcrowding on commuter routes-<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1754" name="John Horam">the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam)</phrase> illustrated that well in his contribution-to provide capacity for future growth; and to deliver long-term benefits for passengers, the environment and the UK economy. Such a strategy is being achieved through a comprehensive modernisation programme, which will provide new and longer trains, upgraded stations and more frequent services through the centre of London, with up to 24 trains per hour in both directions.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/4">The Thameslink programme aims to reduce crowding on current Thameslink and other commuter services; and to provide for the introduction of new cross-London services, so improving public transport accessibility in south-east England. For example, it will be possible to take a train direct from Cambridge to Gatwick airport, which must be good news for my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase>. The programme will also reduce the need for interchange between mainline and London underground train services and therefore reduce overcrowding on the underground, especially the Victoria and Piccadilly lines and the City branch of the Northern line. It will improve the reliability of train services operating through the core route section between London Bridge or Elephant and Castle and St. Pancras.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/5">The programme itself delivers very substantial transport and revenue benefits in the region of &#163;10 billion over the life of the programme. Those benefits are primarily due to the increased capacity and frequency that the scheme provides into and through central London, which, I think, answers the question of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase>. The strength of the business case is such that everyone should support the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/6">To deliver such benefits, major project works will be required in central London, which some have described as the equivalent of doing open-heart surgery on the centre of London. The most significant works will be at London Bridge station, where it will be necessary to widen the railway viaduct at the western side of the station at Borough, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/7">Blackfriars and Farringdon stations are also being rebuilt and platforms are being extended at a large number of stations, both north and south of London, to enable them to be used by 12-carriage trains. Moreover, a new state of the art fleet of trains is being procured to replace the existing fleet and provide the capacity for the 24 trains per hour service. They will be the next-generation electric commuter trains and will be fully accessible for mobility-impaired users. I note the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford about freezing conditions. The new trains must be able to cope with 24 trains per hour through the core. They will have high specifications, which will deal with issues such as freezing conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/8">I am pleased to say that significant progress has been made in delivering the programme, which has been split into three distinct phases. Key output 0 was an enabling phase and saw the introduction, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-22">22 March 2009</phrase>, of a new Thameslink train timetable requiring dual voltage trains. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> referred to the challenges of operating with the dual voltage train regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/9">Key output 1 involves the construction of Blackfriars and Farringdon stations, which, together with platform extensions along the midland main line, will allow longer 12-carriage trains to operate from Bedford to destinations south of London, and there will be up to 15 trains per hour through central London. The infrastructure capability from such works is due to be available at the end of 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/10">Key output 2 provides the full functionality of the Thameslink programme. There will be 24 trains per hour through the central core section, which will be achieved through the resignalling and reconstruction of London Bridge station and its approaches together with a new fleet of approximately 1,200 vehicles. That stage is scheduled to be completed from December 2016.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/11">The first enabling phase of the programme was successfully introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-22">22 March 2009</phrase>. It involved the closure of the bay platforms at Blackfriars and the closure of the Thameslink Moorgate branch. That was achieved by linking the north and south services together and running them through the core central London Thameslink route using additional new dual voltage trains.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/12">The key output 0 element of the programme was delivered on time and on budget despite supply difficulties with the new trains. Much of the success can be attributed to excellent co-operation across the rail industry, where temporary measures were put in place to supply dual voltage trains to mitigate supply problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/13">I am pleased to report that all the required 23 dual voltage trains have been delivered and are now in service with First Capital Connect. All temporary rolling-stock mitigation measures that were in place since March 2009 have now been withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/14">The objective of key output 1 is to deliver interim benefits before the full scheme-key output 2-is completed. By December 2011, key output 1 will deliver the infrastructure capability to operate longer 12-carriage trains from the midland main line through the central core route and beyond. The scope of the works includes lengthening platforms on the midland main line to 12-carriage trains; major rebuilding of Farringdon station, including new ticket halls and interchange with Crossrail; the total reconstruction of Blackfriars station, including new underground station, new platforms spanning the Thames on a widened bridge and an additional south bank ticket hall; and enhancements to rail systems involving signalling, power, communications and track, which should address some of the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/15">Network Rail made excellent progress over the Christmas period in completing critical works at Blackfriars where a new bridge was installed, at Farringdon where work to enable the integrated Crossrail ticket hall began, and at St. Pancras where new signalling was installed. Network Rail forecasts that the works for key output 1 can be completed to budget and on time. The 12-carriage infrastructure capability will be delivered by the baseline target date of December 2011. Such an improvement will provide significant crowding relief benefits to commuters on the midland main line and will be the first significant step change in capacity arising from the Thameslink programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/16">The full functionality of the Thameslink programme, which is 24 trains per hour through the central London core section, is achieved through the resignalling and reconstruction of London Bridge station and its approaches, together with a new fleet of approximately 1,200 carriages, referred to as key output 2, and is scheduled to be delivered from 2016.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/17">Key elements of scope include: major reconstruction of London Bridge station and approaches, including a new flyover at Bermondsey and a new viaduct at Borough market; a link to the east coast main line, north of St. Pancras Thameslink station; 12-carriage length platforms on outer areas south of London and on the east coast main line to Cambridge; enhancements to signalling, communications, power and track; stabling and depot connections; and automatic train operation through the core central London section. That answers the concern of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" name="Stephen Hammond">the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)</phrase> about the future of ATO.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/18">In relation to depots, let me tell my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford that the Bedford depot will be kept in the short term to service the residual class 319 fleet until the full fleet of new trains arrive. In the long term, it will be kept for stabling for the eight-car element of the fleet of new trains.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/19">Let me tell my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley that the project at Three Bridges is progressing well, and that no problems have been identified there.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/20">Work has already started on widening the viaduct at Borough to the west of London Bridge station. That section of track is one of the most congested in the country, and is currently the key bottleneck for existing Thameslink services. For the remainder of key output 2, planning and optioneering are progressing very well, with final options being examined in detail by Network Rail. Significantly, a major upgrade is due to start at London Bridge station in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.2/21">The hon. Member for Wimbledon asked me innumerable questions, which I may have to write to him about.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.1/1">I am delighted to have the opportunity of introducing this short debate on an incredibly important subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/2">I have been involved with multiple sclerosis issues for many years now. I am chairman of the all-party group on MS and patron of two MS organisations, the North Wiltshire branch of the Multiple Sclerosis Society and Mutual Support, which is the military forces' branch of the MS Society. I am glad to have the opportunity to bring a very important issue related to MS to the Minister's attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/3">In doing so, I want to start by paying tribute to the outstanding work of the MS Society, without which it would not be possible to raise these issues. It is a first-class organisation and shortly I will be talking about the manifesto that it intends to publish-later this week, I think-in the run-up to the forthcoming general election, which will raise a variety of issues related to MS. I know that all Members of Parliament will be sent a copy of that manifesto in due course and hopefully they will find time to pay attention to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/4">Of course, this is not a party political issue of any kind at all. It is one that we in this place ought to pay attention to, because there are ways of making things better for the 100,000 or so people in England who suffer from this most debilitating disease. Sometimes I feel that cancer and heart disease achieve a higher profile in public awareness or in Parliament, but MS, in many respects and for many people who suffer from it, is no less debilitating and no less wicked a disease than those two more high-profile ones.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.49.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" speakername="James Gray" colnum="49"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0008.htm#10020246000618">
	<p pid="a.49.3/1">This is an Adjournment debate, so if the hon. Gentleman does not mind I will not give way, as I have a lot to get through. I thank him all the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/2">MS is a curious disease. However, we are getting closer to understanding what causes it and therefore to finding a cure, or at least a partial cure. There are oddities with MS. For example, the further one gets from the equator, the less likely one is to suffer from MS. Also, if one lives in a largely vegetarian society, such as those in Japan or China, one is much less likely to develop MS than people who live in western Europe. It is because of such curiosities that we are beginning to achieve some understanding of this dreadful disease, and as a result we can begin to find a cure..</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/3">Today's debate, however, is not about the attempt to find some cure for MS; it is about those drugs that ameliorate the symptoms of the disease. In particular, I am referring to the disease-modifying drugs, such as beta interferon and glatiramer acetates. Some 10 years ago, there was a terrible postcode lottery associated with those types of drugs. I remember very clearly being much engaged in the campaign to allow them to be prescribed on the NHS. I remember the particular example of Stephanie Millward, the Olympic swimmer from the village of Box in my constituency, who was not allowed to have beta interferon prescribed for her MS. She lived about 100 yards away from the border with Bath and at the time the local health service in Bath was prescribing beta interferon. That was a terrible postcode lottery and we campaigned very hard against it.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/4">As a result of that campaign, we came up with a new scheme, the risk-sharing scheme. Under that scheme, it was established that, although the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence had said that beta interferon and the like were not cost-effective for the treatment of all MS sufferers, if the drug companies producing the drugs could demonstrate that the drugs were effective, the cost element could be balanced out at a later stage, as it were, by the NHS being given a discount for the provision of the drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/5">That is a broad-brush description of the scheme that we agreed to some 10 years ago. I remember that, seven years ago, there was a reception in Portcullis House and we all welcomed the introduction of the scheme, which was a very good outcome both for MS sufferers and for the NHS. Having said that, the purpose of this debate is to consider whether the risk-sharing scheme has worked to benefit either those people suffering from MS or the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/6">The scheme has delivered some benefits. To begin with, more people have been prescribed beta interferon or the other disease-modifying drugs than would otherwise have been the case. For example, Stephanie Millward has been prescribed beta interferon for the last seven years. I see her very often and she tells me that it has definitely improved the symptoms of her MS. So, it is a good thing that more people have had such drugs than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/7">There have been one or two positive side effects of the scheme. There are now about 200 specialist MS nurses provided to the NHS, which is hugely beneficial. They do a superb job and it is very important that we find ways of keeping them going in our local communities, although they have been somewhat challenged in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/8">Has the risk-sharing scheme really and truly worked, however? Do we now know more about whether beta interferon and the other drugs work? Do we now know whether they work for particular types of patient? Also, is the scheme cost-effective?</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/9">One would have thought that, after a seven-year scheme such as this one, the Government would be ready to come forward with a few answers to those questions and would be able to say that the scheme is working, that it is working for some patients, that it is saving us money, or that it has made the world a better place. That is why those of us in the MS community, as it were, find it very curious that we still do not know the answers to those questions. The Government have delayed publishing the first analysis of the scheme. I hope that the Minister, in his winding-up speech, will be able to tell us when the Government plan to publish that.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/10">Those people who know about these things-particularly those who work for the MS Society and other such organisations-have detected what seem to me to be absolutely fatal flaws in the scheme as a whole. The whole methodology of how the scheme was put together is flawed. It has taken us seven years to realise that, but the statistical and methodological inadequacies of the scheme mean that, even when the Government come out and publish the interim report on whether it has worked, we will question whether an accurate conclusion has been reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/11">Of the 5,000 people who were part of the tests under the scheme, quite a large number are sadly no longer with us and others are unable to say whether the scheme has worked. Since there was no cohort of people who were not suffering from MS but who were tested on the drugs, it is very difficult to say statistically whether the scheme has worked.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/12">The first two-year cost-effectiveness analysis of the scheme, which took a very long time to produce, finally appeared in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> in December 2009. That analysis appears, at first sight, to show that the progression of the disease was worse than predicted for those people who were on the disease-modifying drugs and it was also worse than it was for those people with MS who had not taken the drugs. So, at first glance at that BMJ article in December, it would appear that the scheme has not worked and that the drugs themselves do not work. However, the article goes on to undermine its own conclusions by saying that the methods used in coming to them were flawed, so the conclusions can be questioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/13">What is more, under current plans the scheme will run for another five years and the same flawed methodology will be used for that time. So, conclusions reached in 2015 as to whether the scheme is a good thing will be made using flawed statistical analysis. In any case, by 2015, when those conclusions come out, most of the drugs in question will have reached the end of their patent date, and so it will no longer be interesting to know whether they have worked.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/14">Furthermore, the cost adjustments that the drug companies may or may not have to provide to the NHS at the end of that time are not retrospective. The scheme will have been running for 10 or 15 years; it may be concluded that the drug companies should pay money back to the NHS; but because the scheme is not retrospective, it will not matter. Any cost adjustments will apply only looking forward from 2015, not looking back. Therefore, there is no financial benefit for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/15">Perhaps the scheme is working for people with MS. After all, its purpose was to try to demonstrate that the drugs are available to people with MS on an equitable basis. However, a glance at the league table of the drugs' availability across Europe demonstrates that Britain is near or at the very bottom. Anywhere else in Europe, people with MS stand a better chance of getting the drugs on their national health scheme. We do not supply the drugs ourselves; the scheme that we implemented to judge whether they work is not working because the arithmetic that it uses is flawed; and people with MS here are less likely to get the drugs than those in France, Germany or elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/16">In addition, the prescribing theory for the drugs is out of step with medical science. They are injectable drugs, but since the scheme was implemented, a variety of non-injectable oral drugs to treat MS or its symptoms have been introduced. It is widely presumed that within a year or two, the oral drugs will be better than injectable beta interferons for treating symptoms. In other words, the scheme is desperately trying to prove whether a drug works, but by the time the proof arrives, the drug will be out of date anyhow. It is entirely flawed.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/17">The Association of British Neurologists has said that oral drugs are well advanced along the pipeline and that, in two years, they rather than injectable drugs will be the right drugs to prescribe for MS. People with relapsing-remitting MS will have up to 10 drug options within two years. The MS Society and the MS community want equity of availability of oral drugs, but the continuation of the risk-sharing scheme for injectable drugs may well mean that oral drugs become more difficult to obtain or prescribe for MS patients than if the scheme were scrapped.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/18">The NICE guidelines on MS risk-sharing drugs have stagnated while we await the data. The NICE clinical guidelines on the standard of care that people with MS in England and Wales are entitled to expect are now hopelessly out of date because the risk-sharing scheme is not even scheduled to be updated until 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/19">What do I hope the Government will do? I must not make a party political point in a debate such as this about what an incoming Government, of whatever party, might do after the general election. The scheme cannot be mended. It has been in place for seven years; its statistical flaws have been present for seven years. It cannot be mended in the hope that it will become better by 2015, when it will end. The scheme, frankly, is knackered. It is flawed and it is not doing the job that it was set up to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/20">Advances in medical science-along with advances in policy such as patient access schemes, which are a rather good thing allowing patients to access the drugs that they need-have overtaken what we thought at the time was a good scheme. The scheme has become outdated and sclerotic. Its outcome will be little more than an academic exercise of limited benefit to people with MS.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/21">Some 100,000 people in the UK suffer from this most appalling and debilitating disease. They want better than they are getting. MS must become a priority today for the next five years; it must not wait five years to become a policy priority. That point is brought out clearly in the excellent manifesto that the MS Society will publish later this week.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.3/22">The fact is that despite the great strides made in medical science over the past few years, the disease-modifying drugs risk-sharing scheme is out of date and sclerotic. It does not work for the national health service or people with multiple sclerosis. Anyone with half a brain would call for its abolition.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.0/1">As is traditional, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> on securing this debate. The effective treatment of multiple sclerosis is important for the Government, for health professionals and, of course, for sufferers of multiple sclerosis and their friends and families. As chair of the all-party group on multiple sclerosis, he has been closely involved with the Multiple Sclerosis Society, whose concern about the risk-sharing scheme appears to have prompted this debate. I associate myself with his expressions of support for the good work done by the MS Society, which is an important national health service stakeholder. We certainly regard the treatment of MS as a priority for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/2">My Department has been working with the MS Society to understand its perspective better and, if possible, to address some of its concerns. It may help, therefore, if I set out the Department's position.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.0/1">Does the Minister accept that many of the points made by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire also apply to motor neurone disease? I thank the Government for the significant support that they have given the Motor Neurone Disease Association in its efforts to find better forms of care and a cure for the disease. I exhort the Minister to carry on the strong relationship between the association and relevant Departments that has done much to give hope to those experiencing motor neurone disease.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.1/1">I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concerns. I assure him that we as a Department wish to continue the close working relationships that we have developed in dealing with motor neurone disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/2">Multiple sclerosis can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There is no conclusive diagnostic test, and symptoms may also indicate other conditions. A thorough clinical examination is key to diagnosing MS, and the progression of the condition is variable and unpredictable.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/3">There are four different categories of multiple sclerosis: benign, primary progressive, relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive. Since the first drug for treating relapsing-remitting MS was licensed in 1995, views have differed about the clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatments. That has led in turn to variable access for patients and justifiable allegations of postcode prescribing. For that reason, the issue was one of the first to be referred to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence when it was established in 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/4">In January 2002, NICE published its appraisal guidance on the use of four treatments for multiple sclerosis: the beta-interferons Rebif, Avonex and Betaferon, and the drug Copaxone. NICE was unable to recommend those treatments for NHS use at 2002 prices, largely because it was not possible for NICE to reach a positive evaluation of the drugs' long-term cost-effectiveness from the short-term results available from existing clinical trials. NICE then invited the Department of Health and the Welsh Assembly to consider how the drugs could be made available to patients in a cost-effective manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/5">In February 2002, the UK health Departments and the four relevant pharmaceutical companies set out the agreed basis for a risk-sharing scheme that would allow the four treatments to be prescribed according to the Association of British Neurologists' 2001 guidelines. The scheme established a 10-year monitoring study to collect data on the progression of the disease among treated patients. The aim is to help assess the uncertainties that concerned NICE.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/6">At the time, the scheme was supported by all the relevant parties, including those who represent health professionals and the MS Society. Under the scheme, all people with MS who meet the criteria developed by the Association of British Neurologists are eligible for treatment if their clinicians consider that they will benefit. A statutory direction requiring the NHS to fund such treatment was expected to eliminate some of the vagaries of postcode prescribing for the treatments, and we are not aware of any evidence to the contrary, including from the MS Society.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/7">If the treatments in question do not perform as expected over the life of the scheme, the manufacturers will share the risk of failing to achieve the anticipated outcomes by subsidising their future cost to the NHS. Gauging whether the drugs are performing better or worse than anticipated is the most difficult aspect.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/8">The MS risk-sharing scheme has brought together patient and professional groups, the Department of Health and the pharmaceutical industry in a unique way. It has improved significantly the overall care and support available to people with MS. It has given more than 12,000 people with MS access to drugs to treat their condition, funded an increase in specialist MS nurses and strengthened the development of a UK network of more than 70 specialist MS treatment centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.1/9">The MS risk-sharing scheme is extremely complex. Data are being collected on about 5,500 patients.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.0/1">I think the Minister will find that 5,500 was the number of patients at the beginning of the scheme in 2002. Sadly, a significant number of those have died or have left the scheme. How many people are currently being studied under the scheme?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.54.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" speakername="Mike O'Brien" colnum="54"  time="012:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0009.htm#10020246000623">
	<p pid="a.54.1/1">I do not have the current figure, but I am advised that data have been collected on those people. Some of them are no longer with us. However, the data are being analysed to identify the efficacy of the drugs. The fact that somebody has passed away does not mean that their data are irrelevant to the analysis. In fact, they may be of enormous relevance in identifying how effective a drug is.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/2">The first two-year interim analysis of the scheme was published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-02">2 December 2009</phrase> in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>. Acting on advice from the scheme's independent scientific advisory group, the study concluded that it was too early to reach firm conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of the drugs. That is not surprising for a scheme with a much longer time scale. The scientific advisory group is addressing several important methodological issues that are integral to the scheme, including the need for an additional comparator data set to ensure that there can be appropriate comparisons. I hope that its work will lead to more meaningful results when the next analysis takes place later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/3">Only one other treatment has been licensed for MS and is available to sufferers. Tysabri received a positive recommendation from NICE in 2007. The NHS is therefore obliged to fund treatment considered by clinicians to be within the terms of that recommendation. We will, of course, investigate any concerns that primary care trusts are refusing to fund the use of Tysabri as recommended by NICE. NHS figures show that the observed use of the drug is rising and, when they are available, the 2009 figures are likely to reach or exceed the level predicted by NICE. If there is any evidence of postcode prescribing, we will be anxious to see it.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/4">I note the point about comparisons between countries, but with all these drugs it must be recognised that different patients and their clinicians take different views on the balance between a drug's benefits and its side effects. That leads to some legitimate variation in use. We must be careful not to ascribe to postcode lotteries variations in clinical views about the use of particular drugs. Clinical judgments should not be confused with the way in which the financing of a system or scheme works.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/5">As the hon. Gentleman said, there are two new oral therapies. Cladribine and Fingolimod are being developed for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. Cladribine, also known by its brand name Leustat, is an anti-cancer agent used in the treatment of leukaemia. It is not yet licensed for the treatment of MS, but it is currently in clinical trials. Fingolimod is a new oral treatment, which is currently in phase 3 clinical trials for relapsing-remitting and primary progressive MS.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/6">Both drugs have been referred to NICE for appraisal, subject to receiving a licence from the regulatory authorities. If they are recommended by NICE, the MS risk-sharing scheme will not detract from their appropriate use. Although the trial results for the drugs are promising, it is impossible to say whether they will remove the need for the drugs in the risk-sharing scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/7">The process of developing drugs is happening in parallel with the risk-sharing scheme. Not all drugs necessarily go into the risk-sharing scheme. We are anxious to work with the MS Society to develop a process that works, by which drugs are made available to people with MS. We cannot pretend that the data are available when they must still be analysed properly. NICE must be satisfied that it is in a position to take a view.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.0/1">The Minister is saying that the right drugs must be given to the right people at the right time, and I am sure that all sensible people would endorse that view. I judge from a hint in his remarks that if over the next two or three years medical science developed drugs more effective than those being used under the risk-sharing scheme, there is a possibility that the scheme would be abandoned in favour of those newer drugs.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.1/1">That is potentially right, although I cannot give the absolute reassurance that the hon. Gentleman seems to want. New drugs are coming forward that operate outside the risk-sharing scheme. The issue is whether the clinical trials produce enough data to enable NICE to take a view on the efficacy of the drugs and their cost-effectiveness. If that is possible, approval might be given, as it has been for drugs that treat other conditions and one that treats MS. Consent will be given only if there are adequate data.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/2">I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that we are using the risk-sharing scheme to evaluate drugs that are being overtaken by other drugs. That should not invalidate the risk-sharing scheme; if in the meantime it is producing an outcome that benefits MS sufferers, such as giving them access to the drugs, and if that is cost-effective for the NHS, that is good. The issue would be of legitimate concern if we were trying to funnel every drug into the scheme, but we are not. We are saying that we should look at the data, evaluate the evidence and examine the extent to which particular drugs work. NICE has the independent role of doing that. If it is able to approve particular drugs, it will approve them and they will become available to MS sufferers outside the risk-sharing scheme. I hope that that provides him with some reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/3">I have listened with great care to the hon. Gentleman and I understand his concerns and those of the MS Society. The risk-sharing scheme has brought significant benefits to people living with multiple sclerosis across the UK. We are determined to make further progress on these issues and will continue to work with patient groups, professionals and pharmaceutical companies to ensure that, through the risk-sharing scheme and other approaches, we continue to provide good quality NHS services and drugs for people with MS.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.0/1">If it were brought to the Minister's attention by officials or other people that some of the methodology used in the analysis of the statistics in the risk-sharing drug scheme was wrong and that the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of the drugs could not be assessed, would he consider dropping the scheme?</p>

	<p pid="a.56.1/1">The appropriate organisation to talk to about the methodology is NICE. The object of having an independent body to consider such issues is that it will have access to all the data, it will not be subject to political pressures and it will respond to objective scientific analysis and, we hope, cost-effectiveness. As a result, if there is a problem, NICE should be able to address it. That is where the information should go. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to give the information to the Department, I will be happy to forward it to NICE on his behalf.</p>

	Education Maintenance Allowance
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.57.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" speakername="John Robertson" colnum="57"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0009.htm#10020246000628">
	<p pid="a.57.1/1">I am delighted to have secured the debate and to have the opportunity to exchange views with my hon. Friend the Minister. I look forward to hearing his comments on the wider issues that I shall raise. I would like to discuss the future of the education maintenance allowance scheme and the effects of cuts on the young people who rely on it. I will mention the fears of charities and other non-governmental organisations that represent further education students, and tell the Minister my experience of what has happened in relation to cuts made to the EMA north of the border. That is an example to keep in mind of what could happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/2">The Government have a record second to none on funding further education. For those listening today who are unaware of EMAs, let me give a brief explanation of what they are and why they are such an essential part of further education support. EMAs are means-tested allowances of &#163;10, &#163;20 and &#163;30 a week that are paid to 16 to 19-year-olds who stay in education and come from families where the annual household income is below &#163;30,000. The EMA payment is conditional on attendance. The policy intent of the EMA is to broaden participation and improve the retention and attainment of young people aged 16 to 19 in post-compulsory education. EMAs were introduced nationally in September 2004 to reduce this country's post-16 drop-out rate, which was one of the worst in the developed world at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/3">What success has the EMA scheme had since 2004? Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that attainment in GCSEs and A-level by recipients of the EMA has risen by 40 per cent. since its introduction. That figure is even greater for those living in the most deprived neighbourhoods. In addition, RCU market research services carried out research on the national scheme and published a report entitled &quot;Evaluation of EMA National Roll-Out 2007,&quot; which concluded</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/4" class="indent">&quot;that EMA has had a positive impact on the retention, achievement and success of certain groups of learners...traditionally associated with lower levels of achievement such as: male learners; learners from minority ethnic groups; those with backgrounds of high deprivation and learners on lower level and vocational courses.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/5">Ipsos MORI published a report in 2008 entitled, &quot;Evaluation of Extension of EMA to Entry to Employment and Programme Led Apprenticeships,&quot; which reached similar conclusions to the RCU research. It stated that the EMA has reduced the number of NEETs-those not in education, employment or training-and has</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/6" class="indent">&quot;motivated learners to...work harder.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/7">So, as hon. Members can see, the scheme has been widely recognised by independent authorities as a success, and the arguments by those opposed to the scheme are easily silenced.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/8">It was with mixed emotions that I welcomed last week's statement by the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, in which he announced plans to spend &#163;580 million on the EMA in order to fund a further 80,000 places, because he also mentioned that, from 2011, poorer pupils who qualify for the EMA-a payment of between &#163;10 to &#163;30 each week, as I said-will no longer receive an extra &#163;100 for every six months they stay in education.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/9">Charities and organisations that represent young people receiving the EMA are extremely concerned about recent announcements to scrap the &#163;100 bonuses, particularly when the evaluation evidence for the bonus scheme found that around two thirds of EMA recipients who were questioned agreed that the bonus system made them work harder. The same proportion said that they attended more lessons because of the EMA attendance bonus rule. Furthermore, those who work closely with students on the EMA inform me that payments and bonuses are an important part of what allows them to continue in further education. I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on that matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/10">Unfortunately that is not the only fear regarding EMAs. There is a growing fear among all those interested in the subject that when the school leaving age is raised to 18 in 2015, the need for an incentive will become redundant. Will the Minister also comment on that and say whether it is to do with the problem that the EMA is classed as an incentive rather than a welfare payment, because receipt of an EMA does not affect other family benefits? The Government should consider reclassifying EMAs as payments that are intended to be supportive, rather than solely an incentive, so they can be viewed in the same way as jobseeker's allowance. Otherwise, when the school leaving age is raised to 18 in 2015, EMAs will become defunct as an incentive.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/11">My hon. Friend should consider, for example, those who are living independently at an early age, as they may need particular support. Access to financial support may be one of the main barriers to participation in education. In general, some of the key barriers include course fees, travel expenses, the cost of food and other essential items, and costs associated with a course or placement, such as equipment. There is a lack of comprehensive advice and guidance for young people on their entitlement to benefits. For those living with families on low incomes, the overall impact on family finances should be considered. In some instances, young people have been discouraged from taking part in education. That is why I believe that the EMA should be guaranteed beyond 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/12">Let me give a Scottish example. I am aware that we live in a time when finances are tight and budgets must be pruned, but I believe there is a good example showing why such action should not be taken on EMAs. As my hon. Friend will be aware, the EMA system is devolved and each Administration have their own policy responsibility for it. However, not all Administrations have been as considerate as this one in protecting students who come from low-income families during the recession. For example, this academic year, in my constituency of Glasgow, North-West, the EMA has been cut by 20 per cent. My MSP colleague, Bill Butler, has informed me of the upsurge in constituents who are worse off because the Scottish National party-led Administration have cut the EMA budget by 20 per cent. and there have been changes to the scheme's eligibility criteria which lowered the threshold for the &#163;30 payment and axed the &#163;10 and &#163;20 payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/13">Those &#163;10 and &#163;20 payments may seem insignificant to some in the House, but a survey carried out by the NUS in 2008 found that 65 per cent. of participants on the highest EMA rate of &#163;30 stated that they could not continue to study without the EMA. As already stated, the maintenance allowance removes some of the barriers to participation in education, and the &#163;10 and &#163;20 brackets are useful in that case, particularly for covering costs towards transport, food and many other things.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/14">Furthermore, unfortunately there are fears that the progress made will be undone by the SNP Administration enforcing changes to the eligibility criteria. That will cut support for those receiving &#163;10 and &#163;20, and cut the allowance to families with an income of between &#163;20,351 and &#163;22,403 with a child, who currently receive the maximum &#163;30. Figures released by the Scottish Government last Wednesday on the EMA show that the old system developed under Labour was successful, with 39,110 college students and school pupils from low-income families taking up the allowance in 2007-8, which means the figure has increased from 38,760.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/15">The figures also show that the allowance helped school pupils from low-income families stay on in education, with 77 per cent. of school pupils on the EMA scheme for a full year completing the attendance rates and learning expectations set out for them, compared with 70 per cent. in 2006-07. The proportion of those receiving &#163;10 and &#163;20 payments who completed the scheme increased to 82 per cent.-the figures for 2006-07 were 74 per cent. for those on &#163;10 payments and 73 per cent. for those on &#163;20 payments. I know that the Minister has no responsibility for the administration of the EMA in Scotland, but the figures show what could happen if support is removed from students on the EMA. That view is supported by NUS Scotland, which believes that those cuts to the EMA scheme by the SNP Administration will lead to almost 8,000 students dropping out this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/16">What are the views of other parties on the EMA? We know where the SNP stands on it, as I have just said. The views of their Westminster friends, the Conservatives, are not dissimilar. The Leader of the Opposition has previously refused to give a straight answer on the EMA, notably during a Sky interview in 2007. Things looked briefly hopeful two weeks ago when he was pushed to answer on whether he was committed to the EMA and responded that he was. However, it did not take long for that to change: only last week, I am informed, when the shadow Minister responsible for the matter, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1623" name="David Willetts">the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts)</phrase>, was asked about it by the NUS's Shane Chowen at an event on further education, he responded that it was</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/17" class="indent">&quot;difficult to commit to it in the current climate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/18">I guess that should come as no surprise, as previously the Conservative party and those on the right have held a highly negative view of the EMA.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/19">Only last year in the House, the shadow schools Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1429" name="Nick Gibb">the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)</phrase>, described the EMA as a &quot;fiasco&quot;. The shadow Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1575" name="Chris Grayling">the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase>, has described it as doing</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/20" class="indent">&quot;absolutely nothing to help solve this country's chronic skills shortages.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/21">Furthermore, the shadow Children, Schools and Families Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase>, has even called the EMA a &quot;flop&quot;. If they had done their homework, they would have known about its success.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/22">It is also important to mention the views of those who influence the policy of Opposition parties. Right-wing think-tanks have been even more disparaging about the EMA in the past year. Policy Exchange, a favourite think-tank of the Leader of the Opposition, called for the EMA to be axed in its publication &quot;Schools Funding and Social Justice&quot;. There is not much justice for students there. Reform, another favourite of the Conservative Front Bench, advocates scrapping the scheme, telling <i>The Guardian</i> last year that</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/23" class="indent">&quot;this is not an effective way of spending over half a billion pounds of education budget.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/24">Perhaps if it asked the students who receive EMAs and their parents they would get a different answer. Two other influential groups on the right, the Institute of Directors and the TaxPayers' Alliance, called for the EMA to be axed late last year in their joint document &quot;How to save &#163;50 billion&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/25">If we want a better barometer for the feelings of Opposition parties, we should look at their lack of support for my early-day motion 422 on the matter. More than 80 Members have signed that early-day motion, but only one Conservative and three Liberals are among them. I wonder which party really cares about the education of young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/26">In conclusion, I have to ask some questions of all those connected with the EMA-I know that the Minister cannot answer for Opposition parties, but hopefully when their spokespeople read the debate they will write to me with their answers. Why would Opposition parties want to stop people from low-income families staying in education? What are their real motives and plans for the EMA? Why can they not commit to the EMA scheme? No ifs, no buts, just commit to it. What will the Minister do to take into consideration the concerns of those student leaders worried about the financial loss that will be incurred by the removal of the bonuses in 2011? Does he agree with me that, because of the EMA's importance to students from low-income families, it should be supported beyond 2011? I look forward to hearing from him and to the correspondence from Opposition leaders.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.0/1">May I begin by saying what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Lady Winterton? I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase> on securing the debate-I hope that his cough gets better soon. He has hit the nail on the head in the debate, as the education maintenance allowance is an important and often overlooked aspect of education policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/2">I would hardly accuse my hon. Friend of overlooking the issue, though; he is renowned in the House and elsewhere for his passion for social justice, and he has been incredibly energetic in campaigning in support of EMA, both in the House and elsewhere. He referred in his excellent speech to his early-day motion 422, which has been signed by more than 80 hon. Members. I would like to pay tribute to his work on that matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/3">I think that my hon. Friend would agree that we all want young people in this country to be able to go on to further education, regardless of where they live, their background or their family income. There is, and has been for many decades, a direct correlation between household income and participation rates in education and training post-16. Those from low and middle-income households have often been deterred from going on to college because they simply could not afford it. They could not afford to pay for things such as equipment or transport, and EMA has helped to start to break that link. It is clear, therefore, that EMA has had a huge-arguably unprecedented-impact on students of this country, with regard to participation and attainment.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/4">We know that EMA works. It was subject to one of the most extensive and robust evaluations of any education initiative ever undertaken in England. The allowances have helped raise participation, retention and attainment of qualifications among young people, particularly from lower-income households. Evaluation from the pilots found that EMA was successful in raising participation by about 4 per cent., and attainment by between 2 and 2.5 per cent. Since the EMA pilots, participation in full-time education has risen markedly year on year for 16 to 17-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/5">It is fair to say that we have to look at other forces that might also be at work in that regard; it is difficult to pinpoint a specific policy and say, &quot;That is the reason for increased participation.&quot; However, it is true that EMA was the largest single policy initiative specifically designed to raise post-16 participation in that period, and it has been hugely significant in allowing young people to gain the skills that they need. It remains an important and necessary part of the offer that we provide to young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/6">About 45 per cent. of 16 to 18-year-old learners in full-time education currently receive EMA. As of the week beginning <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-18">18 January</phrase> last month, almost 600,000 young people had received an EMA payment. That is almost 80,000 more than at the same time last year. That huge increase will have a positive impact on skills levels for people in this country for decades to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/7">I could talk about hundreds of thousands of people and the billions of pounds that we have invested in learning for 16 to 18-year-olds, but it actually comes down to individual lives and individual young people being given opportunities. One example that sticks in my mind is that of a young man named Jordan, a catering student from Bolton, who now works for one of Britain's most renowned seafood chefs. On receiving his EMA, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/8" class="indent">&quot;This is a dream come true for me. Receiving EMA made a big difference and helped to pay for my college trips and cookery equipment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/9">There are hundreds of thousands of people like Jordan across the country who could testify in the same way.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.61.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" speakername="John Robertson" colnum="61"  time="013:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0010.htm#10020246000630">
	<p pid="a.61.0/1">That is a good example. Would my hon. Friend agree with me that that money also gives stability to people who perhaps did not attend school regularly? The small incentive that they receive for attending further education puts them in good stead for the future. They will, in effect, have been to work in further education and will have that background when they go into employment in future.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.61.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="61"  time="013:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0010.htm#10020246000631">
	<p pid="a.61.1/1">I will answer that in two ways. First, I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend; he also touched on the point in his speech. EMA is not a handout, as it offers something for something. There are recognised and agreed standards for behaviour, attendance and punctuality, which are all important in order to receive the EMA. In modern life, business depends on that maturity, and EMA can help to inject that level of maturity for 16 to 17-year-olds. Secondly, he is absolutely right that is gives that degree of certainty, which, for those from fluctuating, low-income households, can really mean the difference between staying on in college and not going to college and ending up with lower prospects for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/2">In a nutshell, that is why we introduced an EMA guarantee. It means that learners who have had a successful household income assessment are guaranteed the same level of EMA for up to three years. As my hon. Friend said, the guarantee provides young people from lower income groups with an assurance of financial support while they undertake further education. Such an assurance can be important, because it enables young people to have certainty about what support they can receive as they progress in 16-to-19 learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/3">I hope that I have made it clear that the EMA has helped more and more students to take part in further education and training. However, it was right and proper for my hon. Friend to probe and question the Government and other parties on the future of the policy, so I want to take this opportunity to outline where I see the EMA going in terms of the future of our ambitious reforms to support more students to take similar paths in their education.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/4">Let me be frank. I do not agree with the Opposition's policies on this matter. As my hon. Friend said, the EMA is a devolved matter. Scotland and Wales will come up with their own policies on it, but I do not agree with what is being done in Scotland. Some of the examples and illustrations that my hon. Friend gave really concern me. People from lower and middle income households will be deprived of the chance to stay on in school, college or training from the age of 16 onwards. That is not what this Government want, and I heartily disapprove of such a policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/5">I am not entirely certain about this, but I believe that the Conservatives wish to abolish the EMA. As my hon. Friend said, the shadow Minister for Schools and Learners, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1429" name="Nick Gibb">the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)</phrase>, has gone on the record as saying that it is a fiasco. The shadow Children, Schools and Families Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase>, said that it is a flop. The Leader of the Opposition, who rarely mentions 16-to-18 policy at all, stated to the Young Foundation:</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Well we're in a state of quite severe flux on this whole area of 16 to 18 education, so I can't give you a straight answer&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/7">on the EMA.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/8">We give 16-to-18 education more importance and certainty than that, so let me give my hon. Friend a straight answer: we will invest a total of &#163;8.2 billion in 2010-11 to fund learning for an unprecedented 1.6 million young people, and we will increase funding for 16-to-19 learning by 0.9 per cent. in real terms, in both 2011-12 and 2012-13, to allow us to continue our commitment to the September guarantee, which guarantees a place in college or training for 16 to 17-year-olds. That reflects the importance that this Government attach to the whole issue of 14-to-19 education. Our ambition is for every young person aged 16 to 17 to participate in education and training, thereby building the skills and qualifications that they need to succeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/9">My hon. Friend touched on another important point. I can understand the risks and concerns in respect of our historic commitment to raise the participation age, which has been talked about in this country for more than a century. We will raise it first to 17 in 2013 and then to 18 in 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/10">How will that impact on EMA? Again, my hon. Friend was right to mention this, so let me give a straight answer and be very clear. Some young people will always need support, financial or otherwise, to participate in and take advantage of the wide range of potential learning opportunities out there. Once the participation age is raised, young people will still have the option to work full time, as long as they continue to participate in learning part time. We must ensure that their learning choices are not hampered or constrained purely because of their economic or financial circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/11">Let me be as blunt as I can in reiterating a phrase that my hon. Friend used: no ifs, no buts. We will continue the EMA when the participation age is raised. It has helped more young people than ever in the history of our country to stay on in learning, and it will continue to be important in the future. The fact is that this Government remain absolutely committed to safeguarding EMA.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/12">My hon. Friend, whose contribution to this debate was balanced, mentioned his concern and the concern of others about the ending of bonuses as part of the EMA offer by January 2011. We will not shy away from taking tough decisions in order to support the participation of even greater numbers of young people. The savings that the ending of bonuses will produce, alongside additional investment announced in the Budget and pre-Budget report, will mean that an extra 80,000 learners will be able to claim EMA from 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/13">I have to be blunt with my hon. Friend: evidence has shown that the bonus payment was often viewed as some kind of reward-something that, obviously, was nice to have, but not as essential as the weekly payment for participation in learning. The weekly payment, whether &#163;10, &#163;20 or &#163;30, is the key factor in allowing people to stay on in education and learning, whereas the bonus was often used for social expenditure, for buying mobile phones, iPods and so on. It was only occasionally used as a contribution to term-time costs. It is difficult to generalise, I cannot mention specific circumstances and I have had letters clearly stating that that is not the case. However, we have to look at the wider context of other offers and other help, support and assistance such as child benefit and tax credits, and at the increase in the discretionary learner support fund that we have provided to help and support young people in college who find themselves in difficult financial circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/14">I would like to thank my hon. Friend for this opportunity to debate an important but often overlooked aspect of policy. I know that he wants to ensure that students get the support that they need to go into further education or training, without financial matters being a barrier. I am committed to ensuring that the EMA will continue to give crucial support to the students who need it the most-no ifs, no buts. I hope that I have demonstrated our clear commitment to EMA and to ensuring that people from lower and middle-income households continue to receive it. I look forward to hearing from my hon. Friend about the Opposition's response.</p>

	Schools Funding (Cornwall)

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.65.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="65"  time="013:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0010.htm#10020246000633">
	<p pid="a.65.1/1">Thank you, Lady Winterton. It is nice to get the leeway of a few extra minutes. That is very welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/2">I want to speak about an issue that has been of great significance to me for the 23 years that I have been a Member of Parliament: delivery of education of the best quality possible in our schools in Cornwall. The context now is one of severe funding constraints that are partly historic and that partly look forward to the realities of the likely impacts of the credit crunch and deficits on spending in the next spending round, particularly on the capital side. The Government, whoever may be in power, will have to deal with that, and with how those constraints are filtering down to create pressures in Cornwall right now. A review of schools has been initiated that may lead to the closure of smaller schools in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/3">In terms of funding per pupil place in school each year, Cornwall is the 141st worst-funded local education authority in England, right down at the bottom of the list. Alongside it are similar poorer rural communities in Devon, Somerset and other places across the country. I share the strong sense that the present funding system does not adequately address the needs of rural communities; in particular, it does not adequately address the needs of the poorer and most disadvantaged rural communities, where poverty can be intermingled with apparent wealth, and where it exists in what most people regard as extremely pleasant surroundings. That does not make things any easier for individual families or for the schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/4">My village school at St. Dennis does an absolutely fabulous job in all respects, but, like Whitemoor and Roche schools up the road, it has to cope with an intake of very disadvantaged children who need all kinds of special support. It has to deliver that in the context of much lower funding than that delivered in urban deprived communities. Cornwall council has just initiated a review of primary schools, the implicit threat being that a number of schools potentially face closure, partly in the name of tackling surplus places and high cost, although I am sure that that will be described in terms of the quality of educational opportunity offered to children.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/5">I want to challenge the Minister to make a solid commitment to improving funding for the rural, disadvantaged communities that I am talking about, and I do so only too well aware of the financial context. More importantly, I recognise that village schools cannot be properly valued by a simplistic model that attaches so much emphasis to surplus places across a local education authority. One core reason for that is that, in a community with a large number of small schools, a large number of surplus places overall may not correspond to many empty seats in any one school.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/6">It is not possible to rearrange the provision of education in a rural setting in the way that that is possible in an urban setting, where it might be easy for children to go to another school: if one school closes, another will be near on hand. In rural areas, the closure of a village school is devastating for the children and the community, because it often means a lengthy bus trip, at best, to a school that is relatively remote and it often means the heart being ripped out of the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/7">Let me provide a little background. As of January 2009, there were 237 primary schools in Cornwall, ranging in size from those with 499 pupils to those with just 11. More than 36,000 pupils are on roll, but they are dispersed in a number of schools of different sizes over a wide area. On attainment levels, the community is disadvantaged, with many children with all sorts of difficulties entering the primary schools. That is reflected at key stage 1, with a slightly below-average national score, but a good score in a contextual analysis. By key stage 2 level 4, attainment is broadly in line with the national figures, despite that disadvantaged entry, and at key stage 4 in secondary schools the children do well in a contextual basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/8">So there is no question but that the schools deal well with a difficult intake and help push the children further in respect of the national comparison. That does not just happen because the children are in the hands of the wonderful staff and teachers in the schools; it is also a reflection of the kind of communities that the children live in, where there is disadvantage and poverty and all sorts of problems, but also a stronger community and neighbourhood than those in which children in poorer more urban areas all too often live. As a result of that, no primary schools in Cornwall are in special measures and only one school has a notice to improve-and it looks as if that will be removed shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/9">The estate includes a lot of old schools: 20 primary schools still do not have a hall, there are 104 temporary classroom buildings and the backlog of maintenance is estimated at some &#163;25 million. Although we welcomed the pathfinder status for Cornwall and although there has been investment, there is still a lot to do. In this context, understandably, Cornwall council is concerned about future capital allocation and is well aware that surplus places will be one of the core drivers of whether money is made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/10">If the surplus places are not removed, the money is unlikely to come through for the improvements that are obviously needed in the context of so many schools being without even a school hall, for example. With surplus places at 11 per cent. and a forecast for that figure to increase over the next four or five years, there is, as a result of national funding programmes, real pressure on the country to do something about the issue. The difficultly is that the surplus places are, by and large, scattered over large numbers of schools and are not concentrated, meaning that the pressure is on to cut some schools out of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/11">Added to that is the reality of the costs of delivering education to children in relatively small schools. The outcomes in small schools are good. I have long hosted meetings annually with Members of Parliament in the House of Commons for a number of organisations that campaign on behalf of small schools. We have consistently shown the data showing good outcomes from small schools. There can be bad outcomes when those go wrong, but when such schools are well run they produce better than average outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/12">One argument often made for closure is that small schools with a small teaching staff cannot adequately provide for the wide age range among children, but the data show that that is wrong. The flip side is that in Cornwall the cost per pupil for delivery, comparing the difference between the largest and smallest schools, ranges from just under &#163;2,500 per pupil to some &#163;15,000 per pupil, with the average being about &#163;3,500. There are real costs in the delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/13">The truth is that delivering education in small village schools is fundamental to the sustainability of many smaller communities. Take the school away and there is no provision for families to stay there: they cannot do it because they cannot get their children back and forth. Take the school away and often the hub for a lot of other services and facilities for the village is removed. The school is the meeting place and there are opportunities to use IT in a lot of community schools. More could be done to build on that.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.0/1">Lady Winterton, I apologise for not being here at the start of the debate. I was elsewhere attending a meeting on water charges and was somewhat caught out.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/2">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for securing the debate and for all his work over many years, particularly on small schools. On his point about services in the community depending on village schools, from my experience of talking to small shopkeepers, parents going back and forth during the day pop into the shop and use it. The journeys to and from school have a knock-on effect on the wider economy: other services depend on that footfall in the centre of the village that the village school provides.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.1/1">That is exactly right and it is acknowledged in the county. This has been a long-term process. I am not seeking to make a series of party political points: Labour has sought to invest in improvements to education, but has not tackled the underlying funding system, which misses the problems for small rural schools, and which it inherited from the previous Conservative Government. This is not an issue in respect of which one can say, &quot;The Conservatives were good and the Labour party has been bad for rural communities.&quot; The Labour party has invested more in funding schools-there is no question but that that is so-and we Liberal Democrats campaigned for that and supported it. However, the structural system for funding was not designed to support smaller rural communities, particularly impoverished ones, and still does not. In 1997, the gap between the funding of Cornish schools and the national average was about &#163;100 per pupil less each year. That gap has now widened, because the formula has remained the same even though the amounts have increased, to a shortfall of some &#163;300 per pupil for Cornwall.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.2/1">Is my hon. Friend aware of the data on academic achievement that back that up? Research undertaken by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> showed that disadvantaged secondary school pupils in rural areas are failing to keep up with the improvements of their counterparts in more urban areas simply because of lack of investment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-02a.67.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="67"  time="013:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100202/halltext/100202h0011.htm#10020246000637">
	<p pid="a.67.3/1">Although I will return to some issues about Cornwall council, the whole context of my argument at this point is that the Government have been sympathetic to investment in education, as have we-the Liberal Democrats argued for that. The Government have sought to address the problem of disadvantaged pupils, but primarily in the context of urban disadvantage, and they have simply not delivered to small rural disadvantaged communities. For example, the dedicated school grant contains no protection for maintaining small schools and class sizes in the circumstances that I have described, with the result that for Cornwall council some &#163;10 million is allocated in small school protection to deliver quality and to maintain village schools, but that is not supported directly by Government funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/2">Huge financial pressure falls directly on Cornwall council. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">the Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase> described clearly the benefits of such schools, and I have described the costs. I also described the gap between the level of funding that we receive and the national average, let alone the level of funding received in urban areas of deprivation, which is vastly higher than the national average. The shortfall is not just against the national average; it is even more against similarly deprived communities in different circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/3">Compared with the national average, the shortfall in school funding is about &#163;24 million every year. That is the difference between what we would receive and what we do receive as a result of the funding formula. That formula is essentially unchanged since it was designed by the last Conservative Government. That is the context in which Cornwall council is starting to move towards what I fear will be closure of some schools and a severe hit on the budgets of some smaller schools. Already, funding changes are being made, which will take money from some smaller schools and make them even more vulnerable to closure.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/4">I suggest that there is a better solution. One element is cash, for which I look to the Government, and the other is a more imaginative approach. I address that comment particularly to Cornwall council, but the Government could show leadership. I plead with the next Government, whether a Labour Government or a change of Government, to review the central factor of the formula. My party has just announced changes to introduce a pupil premium, which would be worth just over &#163;20 million a year to Cornwall and would address directly the funding gap, but it would be targeted at disadvantage and provide an extra premium for all pupils from impoverished backgrounds such that they are eligible for free school meals. That would effectively provide an extra &#163;2,500 for each pupil.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/5">I know the difference that that would make in schools throughout Cornwall, particularly those with a disadvantaged intake. I spent a day working in Whitemoor school a year or so ago, and I saw direct the issues that it had to tackle and the amount of time and effort needed from classroom assistants and teachers simply to get pupils to the point of learning. That pupil premium would make a real difference, but whether that or another approach is right, rural poverty and deprivation is a fundamental issue that must be addressed in the funding formula. It is time for a review.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/6">No funding system can fully address the extra cost of running smaller schools, so we must be innovative. When the Liberal Democrats were running Cornwall council, it pioneered approaches such as clustering schools to share administrative costs, providing packages to support head teachers to do their jobs effectively by operating across more than one school, and having specialist teachers across more than one school to provide expanded opportunities for pupils to interact with teachers with different specialist skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/7">Just because small schools are costly, we should not assume that there are no solutions. There are, and they are being implemented throughout the country. The easy option should not be taken when innovative solutions are available. I know that the Government have provided support for that, and I hope that the Minister will say clearly and loudly today that Cornwall council should continue to pursue innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/8">Surplus places are a real issue in rural communities because they are scattered, and it is not possible to amalgamate three schools into two without an impact on the communities that they serve in a way that does not apply in urban communities. Again, the easy option of closing a small village school should not be taken. Such schools are the most costly and are relatively remote, so the easy option of redistributing pupils to larger schools in bigger communities may seem to solve the problem, but it strips out from a village an essential part of its community. It is more difficult to tackle surplus places in urban areas and in oversized schools, and it is tempting to take the quick and easy option of closing a smaller school, but I plead with Cornwall council and the Government to find a more imaginative solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/9">The first question should not be, &quot;What do we do about a school that does not have sufficient pupils?&quot; We should ask why it does not have sufficient pupils, and there are usually two core reasons. First, it may have acquired a less than good reputation, so the solution is not to shut it down, but to do something about what has gone wrong with its quality. When a small school that is reliant on one, two or three teachers goes wrong, it goes wrong comprehensively, but in a larger school part of it may continue to function well because of the large range of staff. Equally, putting things right can be done comprehensively more easily than in a larger school. Pupil numbers may have fallen because parents are not choosing it, which is usually because they know something that may not yet have shown up in official statistics, and that should be put right.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/10">Secondly, families in rural communities can no longer afford to live in villages, so there are not enough children for the school, which may have nothing wrong with it. It may be of high quality and well supported by the community, but if there are not enough children, the initial response should be not to think about closing it down, but to think about what can be done to help families to live in a working community. More often than not, what is needed is affordable housing because people who work on farms, in plumbing and building, or in shops and pubs, are forced out of the community by the unaffordability of homes. The best solution for keeping village schools open is to deliver affordable homes in small communities-often just six, eight or 10 are needed-to allow local families to continue to live and work there.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/11">That approach is different. It stops asking the question, &quot;What shall we close down to sort out the problem of surplus places?&quot; and asks, &quot;How can we maintain vibrant communities with successful schools in our more impoverished, small rural communities where it is expensive to live and where there may be surplus school places?&quot; I hope that the Government will take that approach, and I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity today to recommend it to Cornwall council.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.0/1">If I do not answer any of the questions asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase>, perhaps he will intervene, and perhaps his two hon. Friends will do the same. I congratulate him on securing this debate, and note the attendance of his hon. Friends the Members for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson) and for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy). From the correspondence and press cuttings that I have seen, I know that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have campaigned tirelessly and worked hard to try to secure the best education outcome for young people and families in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/2">Obviously, we take the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman seriously in Cornwall as in all other areas. The Government have invested heavily over the past 13 years, and before addressing the specific points, I would like to point out that we have seen a real-terms rise in per pupil funding in Cornwall of 38 per cent. since 1997. Following that, in 2005 we introduced the dedicated schools grant, which will increase 2008-09 levels by 12.8 per cent. to &#163;4,043 per pupil in Cornwall by 2010-11. Added to that, Cornwall has benefited from around &#163;100 million of capital investment over the current spending review period, including &#163;18.5 million to support the delivery of the primary capital programme. The hon. Gentleman will also know of the exemplar project to rebuild Camelford school.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/3">The main thrust of the hon. Gentleman's speech was about the dedicated schools grant, notwithstanding the point about the pupil premium. He will know that the DSG is being reviewed, as we want to develop a new formula for the distribution of money from central Government to different areas from 2011. As he will know, a three-year period was specified and set out for 2008-09 to 2010-11, and we are looking to see how we can redistribute moneys from 2011 onwards in a way that is perhaps fairer than it is under the current system.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/4">We carried out a consultation, and certain principles arose from that on which we will consult again. For example, we must consider whether we give a single amount per pupil across the country, or whether we have activity-led funding and look to see how much each pupil costs in an area. One can then look at issues such as sparsity, deprivation, high-cost pupils and additional educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/5">One problem that the hon. Gentleman will have-as will hon. Members from all parties-is that while some of his colleagues argue for a fairer distribution of the money, that is actually something that would disadvantage him even further. That is true of all political parties. To find a fairer funding mechanism, where people do not simply go and see whether they get more or less from it, is difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.0/6">I know Cornwall, and I know that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues will have tried to influence the outcome of the review. However, I suggest that he continues writing to relevant Departments and putting pressure on them and on the local authority, to try to secure the fairest and best possible outcome for Cornwall. The review is ongoing, and there will be a further consultation on it in the next couple of weeks, to which he may wish to contribute.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.0/1">I am sure that the Minister has the same experience as me-there is no Member of Parliament who does not believe that their constituency is unfairly disadvantaged in comparison to others. There was a similar issue regarding health, and there we have seen a change which, over time, significantly increases the funding. I reiterate for the Minister that when the Government were elected, the funding formula disadvantaged rural, impoverished communities such as ours, meaning that we got 95 per cent. of the national average per pupil. As the Minister said, funding has gone up, but we now have only 92 per cent. of the national average. There is a clear bias in the system, but with health-and more generally-the Government have recognised that ours is an impoverished community and, I am afraid, the nearest equivalent to inner-urban poverty in a rural setting.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.1/1">I accept the point that poverty does not exist only in urban areas and that there is rural poverty. I also accept that there is a need for a review of the way in which money is distributed to local authorities and to schools. My point is that it is an ongoing process; no conclusion has been reached, and the points that the hon. Gentleman has made, and no doubt part of the point of the debate, are an attempt to influence the outcome of that review. The outcome is not decided yet, and he needs to continue to make his case.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/2">Let me address specifically some of the points raised by the hon. Gentleman about primary school closures in his constituency and in Cornwall more generally. Obviously, the closure of a school can be controversial, and we have tried to ensure that the proposer of such action is required under legislation to undertake a public consultation. From May 2007, new arrangements for local decision making took effect, and they must be followed whenever a change in school provision is suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/3">However, the provision of schools and schools places in an area is ultimately a decision for local authorities, not the Government. Councils have primary responsibility for school-place planning, and a duty to secure the best standards for all pupils. I take the hon. Gentleman's point about the good standards in many of Cornwall's schools, notwithstanding the pressures on finances and resources that some of them feel they are under. The council has responsibility for determining the most appropriate organisation in an area.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/4">In terms of protecting rural schools, there is money within the dedicated schools grant for sparsity, which enables us to target extra spending. Cornwall received &#163;5.44 million in its schools settlement for sparsity. We fully expect-this is perhaps one concrete thing that I can say to the hon. Gentleman-the sparsity factor to be included in the new formula, whatever that is. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman might make a suggestion about how that sparsity factor is worked out, and whether it could be done so more advantageously. Importantly, the sparsity factor will remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/5">The Government introduced a presumption against school closure 10 years ago. Statutory guidance now requires decision makers to have regard to that presumption, and to take account of other factors when considering the future of rural schools. The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for North Cornwall made the point about schools having an impact on the community and on local businesses, rather than being solely an education matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/6">Of course, the presumption against school closures does not prohibit closures, and the proper statutory process has to be followed. As the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell pointed out, there are surplus places in Cornwall, and that is an issue for the council to address. My information from the Department suggests that there are 4,450 surplus primary school places in Cornwall, which is 11 per cent. of the total capacity, so there is a significant difficulty, irrespective of the funding regime. However, I take the point that sometimes such decisions should not be made only on the basis of place numbers but should take other factors into account.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.0/1">On spare places, is it not also a concern that many of the village schools are old buildings? On my understanding, places are calculated on the basis of the square footage of the entire school, not just the classrooms. Inappropriate buildings compound the problem by allocating places where there is not even space for teaching. Does that not need to be taken into account?</p>

	<p pid="a.72.1/1">Of course all those things need to be taken into account. That is why it is better for the local authority to determine school organisation in an area-in consultation with local Members of Parliament, local councillors and the public-as it knows best how to do so, and will know the particular buildings of every school. That is a matter for people to consider as decisions are made on the best way forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.2/1">My hon. Friend's point was that the 11 per cent. figure is deeply misleading. There are schools that could not accommodate the theoretical number of pupils because the structure of the building is not appropriate. It is merely based on the square footage, but if we were building a modern school, it would look very different. The figure of surplus spaces is exaggerated, and in a school of 30 or 40 pupils we are talking about three or four seats. That might be the kind of flexibility that is needed for a revolving community.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.3/1">I accept that point. The argument is not about bringing that number to zero. It is used as a figure across the country as a guide to the particular problems regarding surpluses. As I have said, it will then be a matter for the local authority to consider as it takes forward the school organisation plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/2">The hon. Gentleman asked me about the necessity for Cornwall county council to be imaginative and consider things such as federations, sharing of governance and all the other arrangements around the clustering of schools that can lead to school improvement, and to significant savings and efficiencies. I join the hon. Gentleman in asking Cornwall county council-and local authorities up and down the country-to consider those imaginative sorts of governance arrangements, which are primarily about school improvement but can also provide some of the efficiencies needed to maintain schools that otherwise might face closures. I would support that.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/3">I thank the hon. Gentleman again for this debate. He made a very important point. There is a more general issue about the reform of the dedicated schools grant, and I urge him to try and influence that.</p>
