<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.73.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/921" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="73"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.73.3/1">I congratulate the newly-appointed Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1176" name="James Purnell">the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell)</phrase>, on efficiently carrying out his duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.3/2">I am grateful for the chance to raise this issue, which came to my attention as a constituency matter. Clearly, it also has national implications, and I shall make some general points about the national position shortly. Some problems are, however, specific to my constituency, although their seriousness illustrates the general problem. Indeed, I can see by the number of colleagues from both sides of the House who are present that it affects many constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.3/3">To put it straightforwardly, no dentist in my constituency is taking on new national health service patients. In recent weeks, one practice has become so frustrated at the uncertainty surrounding the introduction of the new contract that it has pulled out of NHS work altogether. Inevitably, the effect on local provision has been disastrous.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.3/4">The problem is illustrated by the primary care trust's figures. Right hon. and hon. Members will be aware that the Government have set targets as part of their commitment to ensuring access to NHS dentistry. When someone living in an urban area phones NHS Direct saying that they need an NHS dentist, they are supposed to be provided with one within 10 km of where they live. A year ago, the Ashford PCT was able to meet that target in 98 per cent. of cases; in the latest quarter for which it has figures, however, that percentage had already fallen to 64 per cent.&mdash;well below the Government's target of 90 per cent.&mdash;and it is heading downwards at a rate of knots. Clearly, that is not acceptable, although I should make it clear that I have no criticism of my local PCT, which is working extremely hard to do what it can within the severe constraints that it faces. It is trying to extend the hours of emergency cover, but that is simply not enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.3/5">As hon. Members would expect, I have received many letters, e-mails and complaints about the crisis in dentistry in my constituency, but I shall quote only one, which illustrates what is, I am sure, a familiar story to colleagues from all parts of the country. Mrs. Barker writes:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.3/6" class="indent">&quot;My dentist whom I have been with for 7 years has now turned private, only accepting patients who sign up to Denplan. Children will not be taken unless their parents are patients at the surgery and agree to Denplan. I believe that this can cost between &pound;10-&pound;30 per person per month . . . I contacted NHS direct for advice and to try and locate an NHS dentist but was told the nearest ones are Sandwich, Canterbury and Hadlow.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.3/7" class="indent">I have Multiple Sclerosis and I am currently having a relapse. This therefore means I am off work. Because of the nature of this illness I cannot predict the recovery period. I am unable to drive at present due to my illness and therefore trying to access a dentist some considerable mileage away is impossible.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.3/8" class="indent">My concern is for my children. I have dutifully taken them to the dentist on a regular basis and I want to continue this, to encourage them to look after their teeth . . . I feel desperately upset that I am unable to provide my family with a dentist that will look after us on a regular basis without it costing approx &pound;50 a month/&pound;600 per year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.3/9">I am sure that such letters will be familiar throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.3/10">I make a plea to the Minister to see Ashford as a special case precisely because the Government designate it as an area of fast population growth. Already, under the Deputy Prime Minister's sustainable communities plan, 800 new houses a year are being built in Ashford, and the plan is for roughly 1,000 more new houses every year for the next 25 years. We know that about 2,000 more people will be living in Ashford this time next year, and not one of them will be able to find an NHS dentist in the town. For the people of Ashford, easy access to NHS dentistry is a mirage. I know that the Minister will not find that acceptable, so I ask her to suggest to the strategic health authority that the allocation of resources in Kent and Medway this year and in the years ahead needs to reflect an urgent crisis, which will become more acute in years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.3/11">In my survey of the local situation, I mentioned the new dental contract. The contract negotiations provide the link to the wider national picture. This debate is particularly timely after Monday's announcement of yet another delay in the introduction of the new contract. The Minister will be aware of how frustrated dentists are, and that that frustration and uncertainty have already been reflected in the number of dentists leaving the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, and for enabling us to have this debate. Is he aware that the British Dental Association has welcomed the latest delay?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.74.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/921" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="74"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.74.1/1">I am aware that the British Dental Association said that it thought that the situation is entirely unsatisfactory, which is why the talks broke down in December. The association obviously welcomes the fact that the delay has been introduced. However, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating when it comes to whether serious talks can start that resolve the many frustrations that have caused dentists to become so unhappy. Last July the report of the primary care dental work force, the latest work force review, said that in 2003 there was a shortage of 1,850 dentists in England alone, and predicted that by 2011 that shortage is likely to more than double to between 3,640 and 5,100.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/2">The Government have taken notice of that survey and have announced a plan to recruit 1,000 extra whole-time equivalent dentists by October this year through a number of measures, which I am sure the Minister will address at the end of the debate. However, we need to put that in context as a problem that affects different parts of the population in different ways. It is the most vulnerable communities that are least likely to have decent access to NHS dentistry, and the community dental service is worse off in terms of vacancies. The BDA has reported that 10 per cent. of posts in the community dental service are vacant, and the average time that those posts remain vacant is 12 months. Clearly that is a worrying situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/3">It is also clear that many dentists' frustration is deep-seated. Research carried out towards the end of last year shows that 60 per cent. of high street dentists will either reduce their NHS commitment or quit the NHS altogether. Only 2 per cent. of high street dentists said that they would increase their NHS work on the back of the Government's proposals, while 16 per cent. said that they would stop providing NHS dentistry altogether. Those are worrying findings. To revert to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1152" name="Nick Palmer">the point made by the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> about what is actually happening, I think that the latest figures for those leaving NHS dentistry show a worrying trend.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/4">The figures obviously have to be taken with some caveats because the vast majority of dentists do some private work and some NHS work, but the best guess seems to be that in 2003 about 250 dentists left the NHS, and in 2004 that number increased to more than 300. If we take those figures alone, the Government's plan for an extra 1,000 dentists has to be put into context&mdash;more than 500 have left the NHS over the past two years. One of my fears about the Government's proposals to address the crisis is that they are simply pouring water into a bucket that has a large hole in it. Dentists are already leaving in such large numbers that the extra 1,000, even if they can be recruited, will be swallowed up far too quickly.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.0/1">Is the hon. Gentleman aware that exactly the problem that he describes is becoming acute in places such as mid-Wales, where almost no NHS dental provision is available to a large proportion of the population? Does he agree that in the long term that will probably cost us more because minor dental ailments will become crises and emergencies, which necessarily cost a great deal more? There is a serious resource issue, which probably will involve higher costs if we do not resolve it in the short term.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.75.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/921" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="75"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.75.1/1">I am sure that that is right. I should make it clear that the idea behind the contract reforms of making dentistry less a problem-solving profession and more a preventive profession seems entirely sensible. The practical effect may be precisely what the hon. Gentleman has just described. I am grateful to him for mentioning mid-Wales because the situation is clearly patchy around the country. I have been struck by the e-mails, letters and phone calls that I have received from different part of the country since this debate was announced. The first came from west Wales and the constituency of Preseli Pembrokeshire where every dentist has now pulled out of the NHS. In an area of high deprivation, in an objective 1 zone, it is no longer possible for an adult to access NHS dentistry.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/2">The NHS Direct advice line is referring people in Pembrokeshire to a dentist in Port Talbot as their nearest NHS dentist, which is 60 miles away. NHS Direct fails to mention that the dentist there is refusing to see anyone from outside his area. Even if they wanted to travel 60 miles, the dentist would not help them. Just before Christmas the local health board brought in some extra provision, but that left 40 people who wanted emergency dental treatment queuing for three hours from 7 am at a special clinic, only to be told that the dentist being brought in was in Ireland and had forgotten that he was supposed to be working that day. That is a terrifying snapshot of what is going wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/3">There are similar tales from other parts of the country. In Portsmouth, people make on average 22 calls before they can talk to anyone about the possibility of dental treatment.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.76.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/964" speakername="Mark Hoban" colnum="76"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.76.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for mentioning Portsmouth. According to the first letter that I received about a dentist going private, my local PCT, Fareham and Gosport, was telling people to go to Portsmouth, Gosport or Lee-on-the-Solent for an NHS dentist. The NHS Direct website today tells them to go to Eastleigh, some 26 miles away. That shows the acuteness of the problem in south-east Hampshire.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.76.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/921" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="76"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.76.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for expanding my point. Moving further west again, the chairman of the Cornwall local dental committee says that dentists there are already working like machines. Dentists will not put up with the extra work that the contract will impose on them and growing numbers will go private. About 200,000 adults in Cornwall are not registered with a dentist. That is half Cornwall's adult population.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.76.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/719" speakername="Hugh Bayley" colnum="76"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.76.2/1">The real principle behind the new contract is whether we should move from the old system of payment for each individual item of treatment, which encourages over-treatment, to a system where dentists seek to promote good oral health for their patients. Surely that is the right way to go and the Government are right to seek to change the contracts. Are not the minority of dentists who resist that wrong?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.76.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/921" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="76"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.76.3/1">As I said, I think that the principle is perfectly sensible. The problem is that there is a huge gap between the rhetoric and the practical reality. The change clearly has not and is not being made in a way that dentists find acceptable. That is why the situation that I am describing, with help from all parts of the House, has come about.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/2">My last port of call is the north-west and a letter from Mr. Tariq Drabu, the chairman of the Bury and Rochdale local dental committee, in response to the Department of Health's chief dental officer, who wrote in <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>about the plan for an extra 1,000 dentists. Mr. Drabu challenged Professor Bedi's statement, saying that he had</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/3" class="indent">&quot;spun and stretched the truth somewhat regarding recruitment of dentists. Yes there will be the equivalent of an extra 170 places per year starting this year and by 2010, 5 years intake will either have been trained or be in training&mdash;but by 2010 there will still only be an extra 170 qualified dentists in the system. Add to that the fact that 50 per cent. plus of those will not be whole time equivalents&mdash;so in truth by 2010 we are looking at perhaps another 80&ndash;100 extra dentists for a population of 60 million not the headline figure of 850 as claimed.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/4" class="indent">Neither I nor any of my colleagues locally have seen any incentives whatsoever from the government to encourage dentists in private practice to increase their NHS commitment which is completely at odds with what Professor Bedi says. This in spite of the fact that it has been impossible to access an NHS dentist in Rochdale for the past 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/5" class="indent">As regards international recruitment we are recruiting from countries who have a worse oral health record than ourselves, where dentists are far more needed. It is a desperate sticking plaster solution to a gaping open wound and until the government seriously addresses the issues of quality care for NHS dental patients and improving working lives for NHS dentists and their teams rather than just being obsessed with access, the problems for NHS dentistry will only get worse.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/6">The point about foreign imports is a good one. They are clearly one solution to the problem, but I confess that I feel slightly uncomfortable about the idea of this country trawling the world to attract dentists, for instance from India, where the ratio of dentists to the general population is 1:36,000. I appreciate all the pressures that are on Ministers, but I hope that the Minister agrees that the idea of this country scouring countries that are significantly poorer than the UK for medical staff makes one feel slightly uncomfortable.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.77.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.77.0/1">I hesitate to speak anecdotally, but I suspect that the import of dentists from elsewhere is not new. I recollect that when I was taking my own children, who are now young adults, to the dentist, almost every dentist appeared to be from New Zealand. I think that that was because the New Zealand Government had instituted an extremely good preventive health programme, so there was not anywhere near the level of dental caries in New Zealand that would be required to keep all its dentists going, so some came to this country. Given the age of my children, that was happening under a Tory Government.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.77.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/921" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.77.1/1">The issue is not new, and I can safely say from where I stand that this country has been significantly enriched by the import of New Zealand dentists. As I said, I fully appreciate the pressures on Ministers, but recruiting vital medical staff from countries that are at a much lower level of economic development than we are makes me uncomfortable.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.77.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/719" speakername="Hugh Bayley" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.77.2/1">Is the hon. Gentleman arguing against the freedom of dental staff to emigrate and practise in other countries? Would he block British dentists from going to work in the United States, which is a richer country than ours? Does he believe that Poland, Spain or Germany should prevent their dentists from coming to work in this country?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.77.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/921" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew12">
	<p pid="a.77.3/1">No, I believe in the free movement of labour and that individuals in all countries should be allowed to work anywhere. That said, I feel uncomfortable about this country, as a rich, developed country, having to solve its recruitment problems by attracting medical staff from countries where they may be even more desperately needed than they are here. That is not an economic but a moral point. Nor is it a partisan point; I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> that foreign recruitment has been happening for a long time. However, it should make us uncomfortable that that appears to be the routine way in which we attempt to solve problems in all parts of the health service, not just the dental service.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/2">All these problems are happening against what is already a difficult background. A National Audit Office report of last November made pretty stark reading, especially in conjunction with the latest adult dental health survey, which showed that the average Briton has lost eight of his 32 adult teeth by the time he turns 45, and that 44 to 45 per cent. of the population are registered with a dentist. Those figures should worry us.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.3/3">The NAO asked the right question: will the new contract stem the flow of dentists out of the NHS? So far, the answer has been a clear no. If the situation is not reversed as a matter of great urgency, the crisis, currently patchy, will become universal. I do not underestimate the scale of the problem that the Minister faces. I hope that she can give me some reassurance about the special difficulties in my constituency, and that the uncertainty clouding the future of NHS dentistry can be lifted soon. If it cannot, dental health in this country will become an area of embarrassing national failure. All of us would regret that.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.1/1">It will come as no surprise that I intend to draw to the Minister's attention the deficiencies of the dental service in my constituency. However, I also want to talk about the improvements that have started to happen and to touch on the importance of prevention as well as treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/2">The situation in Milton Keynes, so far as I can tell, is that only one dental surgery in the Milton Keynes primary care trust area is accepting new NHS adult patients, and only a small proportion of surgeries are registering children aged 0 to 18 for NHS treatment. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/921" name="Damian Green">the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green)</phrase>, I represent an area of housing growth&mdash;it has been growing continuously for the past 20 years&mdash;which causes problems in that we are continually trying to fill up the bath with the plug out. That adds to our problems as an area of population growth, although we do not have a population that is significantly less healthy than the average for England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/3">The story of a constituent in Bletchley highlights a particular problem. He was trying to get new dentures and had been unable to find a dentist who could provide them. It became clear that the laboratory cost for producing dentures was about &pound;10 more than the NHS fee. We finally managed, after a great deal of negotiation, to get him referred to a local practice that had just taken on an extra member of staff to do NHS work, so there was a good outcome to his case. However, that took a great deal of effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/4">Another problem is the lack of an out-of-hours service within a 20-mile radius. My understanding is that it is impossible to get treatment after 9 o'clock in Milton Keynes, Luton, Bedford, Northampton and Oxford. That means that people tend to turn up in great pain in accident and emergency departments, and have to be given treatment simply for the pain to tide them over until they can be treated for the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/5">According to my PCT, one of its difficulties, apart from the general shortage of dentists and the fact that more and more have withdrawn from NHS work, is that Milton Keynes, thanks to our Government's stupendous care of the economy, has a hugely dynamic local economy, but that has a negative side as well as a positive one. The negative side is that there are many other employment opportunities, not so much for dentists but for all the other staff whom dentists need to provide a service. In our local employment market, it is difficult to recruit those ancillary staff and retain them.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/6">An additional problem is the high cost of housing in our area, which means that people employed in the public service who would be paid the same wherever they lived in the country find it difficult to move to jobs in Milton Keynes because their effective salary is lower. I ask the Minister to consider that issue, which affects not only the dental services, but the NHS generally. Key worker housing has been made available in Milton Keynes and is helping to deal with the problem, but I ask the Government to keep the situation under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/7">From what the hon. Member for Ashford was saying, the situation in Milton Keynes seems to be better, or slightly less worse depending on which way one looks at it, than in his constituency. I am certainly not saying that my constituents have particular and intense problems, but they are suffering like others across the country from general problems affecting the dental service.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/8">Measures have been taken and are starting to improve the situation. There has been a combination of increased Government funding and new innovative ways of delivering the service. I am pleased to have heard recently that the Milton Keynes PCT received Government funding to create 9,000 new NHS registrations. That process is just starting, but I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed the time scale for those new registrations, and what action the strategic health authority will take to monitor progress and ensure that there is no slippage on the delivery of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/9">A number of NHS dental access centres have been created in Milton Keynes, which have been extremely helpful in supplementing the normal&mdash;if I may describe it that way&mdash;conventional dentistry service and enabling people to gain access to dental services when necessary. As well as providing routine care, those centres provide specialist care for priority groups who cannot get to dentists and act as specialist treatment centres for patients referred by other health professionals. Are dental access centres intended as a permanent supplement to the conventional dental service, or are they a stop-gap measure to tide us over during the continuing dental shortages?</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/10">A third improvement, which has not yet happened but has been announced, is in the north of my constituency in Wolverton. It is an area of deprivation but a significant amount of extra housing is planned as part of the expansion of Milton Keynes. In November, the Government announced &pound;5 million of funding for a new one-stop primary care centre, including dental health services, in Wolverton to care for the current and expected population. I commend such super-health centres, which provide a much wider range of health services than the conventional GP surgery, bring GP and dental health services together, and will also carry out a number of minor operative procedures currently carried out in hospitals. Plans for another such centre in the further growth area on the western side of the city are being consulted on. I commend those initiatives and hope that the Government will monitor their progress when they open so that they can modify how health services are provided if there are lessons to be learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/11">On prevention, as in other areas of health, it is important to encourage people to improve dental health so that the need for dental care is reduced. I alluded in my intervention to my children and the influx of dentists from New Zealand, one of whom told me of the effectiveness of fluoridation there, which had drastically reduced the level of dental caries in children, leading to an oversupply of dentists. That is a very happy experience, which I am pleased we are finally building on in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/12">The amendment to the Water Act 2003 requires water companies to increase the concentration of fluoride in water supplies when the strategic health authority requires it. The evidence in favour of fluoridation is extremely strong. It is particularly important for children in deprived areas whose dental health is much poorer than that of children in better-off families. The fluoridation measures will have the greatest effect in improving the dental health of those children in disadvantaged areas. It is important that we continue to point out to parents and to the population at large the health burden of poor dental health, the problems that occur and the need to build good dental health in children. Good dental health will follow children into adult life. It is very difficult to repair in adults the damage done to dental health by a poor diet in childhood.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/13">I wanted to stress the importance of ensuring that fluoridation is extended, but there are other steps that children and adults can take to improve their dental health. It is important to stress the importance of a balanced diet, the need to reduce the sugar level in foods, which has obvious implications for the labelling of foods to ensure that parents and other adults can choose foods with lower sugar levels for themselves, and the importance of reducing the use by parents of fizzy and sugary drinks for children. Parents and children should be encouraged to drink water or milk rather than drinks with high sugar levels that will lead inevitably to poor dental health.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/14">Finally, it is important to encourage people to give up smoking, not only for the more obvious reason that it reduces heart disease and cancer, but because of the effect of smoking on oral health. Smoking discolours teeth and increases the risk of mouth cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.1/15">For all those reasons, and despite the primary focus of the debate being on the difficulties of gaining access to dental care, I hope that the Minister will not lose sight of the importance of continuing to stress preventive health measures that will reduce the need for people to seek dental care in the first place and immeasurably improve their health.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.0/1">It would be interesting to hear the views of New Zealand dentists.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.81.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/731" speakername="Paul Beresford" colnum="81"  time="010:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.81.1/1">You have declared my interest for me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, although it is a little more than that. I have an NHS number and I am a practising dentist, although an extremely part-time one. If someone has toothache on Sundays, there is a chance that they can see me. I am also a member of the British Dental Association, and have dental experience in the NHS and a tiny bit of experience in New Zealand. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">The comments made by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> on fluoride are correct, but she should also mention the school dental services for children in New Zealand, which have also made a dramatic difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/2">When I first came to this country, I worked in east London, predominantly in the NHS. Even in those days, however, there was a shift towards private dental care. I also worked in south-west London in mixed practice, and spent a year in the Eastman dental hospital. I have done the rounds, which explains why I am 10 years younger than I look. I have another considerable advantage: I am not on the Opposition Front Bench. I also regularly meet dentists and dental technicians at meetings and conferences.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/3">My constituency has exactly the same problems as the constituencies of everyone who has spoken so far and those who will follow, with perhaps the exception of the Minister, in that we have a shortage of dentists. Most people in my area have the advantage of being able to afford private dentistry, which means that those who cannot afford it have a tough time. There are pockets of quite bad deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/4">In the past 32 years of my being here, I have been struck by the improvement in dentistry in this country. Several factors are involved, but I know that the reputation of the UK's national health dentistry is not good in other western nations. Dentists in America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and so on warn their patients who come to this country not to take NHS dental treatment. They advise them to look for a private dentist. However, having said that, things are improving. There have been many changes, but two of the greatest are, first, fluoride in toothpaste and in water supplies&mdash;I hope that the Minister takes that seriously, as I will have questions at the end of the debate which I hope that she will be able to answer&mdash;and, secondly, the introduction of fees for patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/5">The introduction of fees had a dramatic effect on standards, because patients started to take notice of what was being done. They asked the dentist why something was being done a second time when it had been done last year or the year before and so on. If they had to pay for the filling, they asked whether they could have a white one. That brought in change quite quickly, which was stimulated by magazines and the <i>Daily Mail</i> Femail pages&mdash;it seemed that everyone had to have a &quot;Hollywood smile&quot;, although I should be desperately upset if we ever reached that stage. Dentists started to lift their standards, particularly in the past decade, and to examine the available equipment and materials. There has been a huge improvement in that respect, but also a huge change in costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/6">When I was at the Eastman dental hospital I spent quite a bit of my time undoing botched work done on patients who came in with toothache. One of the primary areas was in endodontics&mdash;root canal treatment. In those days dental schools taught students to use Dr. Sargenti's N2. I said to the professor at Guy's, &quot;Why are you teaching students to use that stuff, which is banned by most western nations?&quot; He replied, &quot;They will have to do national health dentistry and that is the only way to do it quickly.&quot; When I pointed out that it had a 60 per cent. failure rate, he just shrugged his shoulders. That was depressing, but even more depressing is that the national health dentist gets about &pound;75 or &pound;80 for doing molar root canal treatment, which will be reflected in the income under the new system. It should take a dentist and one or two assistants between one and one and a half hours to do the work properly, and the capital cost of the equipment&mdash;microscope, digital X-rays, fancy nickel titanium files and so on&mdash;is more than &pound;20,000. There is also a continual heavy revenue cost because the nickel titanium files can be used only a few times or they break and have to be discarded. If they break at the end of a tooth, the dentist is worried and has to phone his protection society to make sure that he is all right.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/7">The only way to respond to such matters would be to make a large investment. Dentists are asking for &pound;4 billion-plus and, realistically, that is not to be expected, so the question is where we are going. At present, we are going backwards. Dentists are disappointed and upset. We have heard how they are moving out, and I assure the Minister that what they say behind the scenes is unprintable. They have had enough, and if they could get out, they would. They would go into private dentistry because there are more incentives and more opportunities for dentists to produce work that they are proud of and to respond to patients and their demands. That worries me, because although there is a need for that, as I know from my time in east London there is also a desperate need for a basic health service that is oriented towards dental health, rather than fixing things with new private cosmetic treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/8">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West spoke about the difficulty of getting a full upper and lower denture for a constituent, the cost of which is &pound;100, &pound;200 or &pound;300 from the NHS. Even privately it is not much more than that, but more exotic dentistry, such as full implant replacements, costs &pound;40,000 or &pound;50,000 per patient, which is out of the question. There is a definite health need, but the demand for cosmetics need not and should not be met to that degree by the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/9">I was astonished when the Secretary of State, responding to a question from a BDA representative at a press conference on the last White Paper, announced that &quot;dentistry was sorted&quot;. I have not heard a more incorrect statement for years. The dentists have had enough. The dentists' organisations have had enough&mdash;they have ended up walking out. Patients are finding the situation impossible. They believed that, by the end of 2001, they would have the opportunity&mdash;according to the Prime Minister&mdash;to have access to national health dental services. They probably have that access if they are prepared to drive to it, but they have to drive a long way.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/10">The new contract was intended to solve the problem, but there are some major problems with it. In an intervention, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/719" name="Hugh Bayley">the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> mentioned that there was a fee system that tended to make dentists rush more and do more&mdash;I think that &quot;treadmill&quot; was the word that he used. The problem is that one treadmill has gone, but we are bringing back another.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/11">There is pressure from the Government for dentists to meet figures&mdash;they will have to meet the agreement on producing sufficient turnover for the finances that they have been promised. That will have two effects: first, it will speed up treatment but reduce the standard of treatment; secondly, it will make the dentist choose a quicker, cheaper option, particularly when laboratory costs and fees are involved. If an elderly patient comes in with a denture that they need to eat with&mdash;a genuine health need&mdash;which is linked to a key tooth that has suddenly developed an abscess, will the dentist, when he is under pressure, spend two and a half, three or four hours carrying out root-canal treatment, building up the tooth, putting a crown on it and then making a denture to attach to it? I suspect that he will be tempted to say no to that work, although I hope that he will not, and to extract the tooth, which is a poorer treatment for that patient. However, the new treadmill will induce the dentist to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/12">The idea that we will rush undergraduates into the profession and that within five, six or seven years they will all be pouring out of the dental schools to solve our problems is not on. That will not work. To begin with, we do not have the staff to deal with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/13">We have also touched on the matter of overseas recruitment. In that context&mdash;a point that has not been mentioned&mdash;I have deep concern over standards. I was recently horrified to discover that the pass mark required for dentists in the UK, when they sit the international English language test system, has been lowered. Perhaps that has been done for current convenience.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/14">I recognise that the Minister will not be able to answer all our questions today. However, I ask her to write to us all with the answers to those questions that she does not deal with. I shall pose only a few questions, but there are many more. One question that I have asked repeatedly in written form concerns when dentists and their professional organisations can expect sight of a draft base contract. There have been repeated delays. There have been responses to questions, but no answers.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/15">Does the Minister accept that the drive to increase the number of NHS dental patients is seen as a transference from one treadmill to another, and how will she overcome that? The paper-based tick-box system of monitoring, which we as dentists anticipate, will impose pressure throughout dentistry and will, as I mentioned earlier, lead to poorer treatment. However, in the case of one or two dentists&mdash;although I do not know any of that sort&mdash;it will mean that their golf handicaps will improve.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/16">Does the Minister recognise that the increase in demand for private dentistry with those new materials brings greater patient satisfaction, and that it is a contribution to the dental health of the nation? We think that we have a problem now, but if everyone dropped private dentistry and rushed to the NHS, the overload would be phenomenal.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/17">Can we be assured that the new base contract and the NHS link with dentists will enable dentists to tackle health care in a mixed practice, and that there will not be pressure to cease mixed practice? I want the Minister to recognise that any restriction on private dentistry will have a bad effect on standards and cause an increase in demand on the NHS. Many dentists need that mixture because they undertake a core service on behalf of the NHS, which they are willing to do because they can top it up with the private health service. If they do not have that, many will go straight across to being private. We need to recognise that, under the contract, capital investment is welcome, meagre though it is. There needs to be more recognition that with modern dentistry&mdash;with changes and the increased costs of modern equipment&mdash;day-to-day revenue costs are increasing faster than inflation. I am deeply concerned that the PCTs are so overburdened and so ignorant of dentistry that it has become just a little hole-in-the corner job, of no particular interest unless there happens to be local Members&mdash;like the two we have heard from today&mdash;who will jump up and down on their necks.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/18">Finally, as the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West mentioned, there is the vital issue of fluoridation. We took a teetering step during consideration of the Water Act 2003. Members on both sides of the House supported an amendment, but we are still waiting for the regulations. Can the Minister hurry up the process and tell us when the regulations can be implemented? I am a dentist who, in my tiny part-time work, engages almost entirely in private dentistry. However, NHS dentistry is an important part of the health of this nation. It is oral health against oral cancer, as was mentioned, and agonising toothache with the pain which that gives not only to those suffering from it, but to the employers and the economy of this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.84.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/915" speakername="Linda Gilroy" colnum="84"  time="010:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew17">
	<p pid="a.84.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/921" name="Damian Green">the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green)</phrase> on introducing a very important debate. I will try to speak briefly, as I had the opportunity of speaking in a debate in May 2004 on dental provision in Devon. I do not propose to go over the issues I raised then, describing how our part of the country is one of the hot spots where some problems emerged early. In that debate, other hon. Members and I raised issues to do with the supply of dentists in Plymouth and the wider dental health community in Devon and, indeed, Cornwall. In particular, we were concerned about the importance and future security of the vocational dental health service. That plays a significant role in providing dental care, especially in the poorer areas of my constituency. We talked of the need to establish dental training, at least as an outpost of Bristol&mdash;the nearest dental school to Devon and Cornwall&mdash;because, as with medical care, dentists tend to go into practice where they were in training, and, vice versa, more people come into training in such a locality. That has certainly been found to be the case with the new Peninsula medical school.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">We also talked a lot of the expectation that we might be able to recruit dentists, particularly from within the EU. If the hon. Gentleman feels uncomfortable about that recruitment, I hope the Minister will be able to offer some reassurances. I certainly think from what I know of the progress that has been made that there is no need to feel uncomfortable. I look forward to my hon. Friend's comments, but the hon. Gentleman, and perhaps other hon. Members, should reflect on the fact that the haemorrhage of dentists from the NHS has been going on since the early 1990s, when a deeply unpopular contract was introduced. Indeed, two medical schools also closed then. I will not dwell on that particular political point, but is important to make it, and I urge the Minister to continue to give serious consideration to the training of new dentists, particularly in our part of the south-west peninsula.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">I know that there has been progress and look forward to what the Minister has to say about that. Like most hon. Members, I am in regular contact with my local PCT, and have been over a range of recruitment issues since that earlier debate. I thank her Department for its speedy attention, helping us in trying to resolve some issues in finding new ways forward. Plymouth primary care trust is continuing to work hard to stabilise the situation and plan ahead. Some dentists have entered into early contracts. We were an &quot;Options for Change&quot; field site and those contracts appear to be working successfully. Plymouth primary care trust continues to try to maintain those dentists working in the NHS and to improve access where possible, bringing them back into personal dental service local contracts. I hope that the Minister, in responding to the questions raised, will say what the Department is doing to ensure that PCTs such as Plymouth can build with confidence on what they have already achieved. For that, it needs a PCT budget for dentistry and clear guidance, with swift clarification on contracts where such guidance is unclear.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4">I want to illustrate the point briefly in relation to a practice of five dentists in my constituency, where there seems to be some lack of clarity over both the ability to enter into individual contracts and the need to do so. The point was highlighted by a somewhat frustrated dentist who wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The contract is to run for three years. Both my wife and myself will have retired before the end of this period. None of the other three dentists would be prepared to accept responsibility.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/6">One of the dentists is even likely to return to his own country. The dentist continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/7" class="indent">&quot;It would seem that we are being pushed into the private sector&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/8">by the inability to come to a conclusion over individual contracts. I hope that that can be resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/9">Finally, I want to comment on one or two points arising from the Plymouth city council scrutiny committee. All last year it worked alone and with other scrutiny committees in Devon and Cornwall to try to bring some sense to the difficult situation in the far south-west, of which I know the Minister is aware. A copy of the scrutiny report has been sent to her and I hope that she will pay particular attention to its recommendations about children.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/10">The report recommends conducting a national review of dental health care for children and not giving practitioners of NHS dentistry an automatic right to deregister an NHS child patient, although I do not know whether that is practical, because they are individual contractors and business people. Also, as the hon. Member for Ashford said, children who have been registered with an NHS dental practitioner should be permitted to remain on that practitioner's list, irrespective of whether their parents have registered as private patients following a change in practice by that dentist.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/11">Finally, the report also recommends establishing a south-west peninsula school of dentistry, as part of our new Peninsula medical school, which is establishing such first-class representation in other medical fields.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/12">.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.86.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1053" speakername="Elfyn Llwyd" colnum="86"  time="010:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew18">
	<p pid="a.86.0/1">I will not pretend that the problem can be laid entirely at the Government's door. I remember debating the very same point under the Major Administration with the then Secretary of State for Wales, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1183" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood)</phrase>. In a debate in 1993, he agreed to provide a grant for Welsh dentists to set up in NHS practices, which partly alleviated the problem. However, I live in one of the most rural parts of Wales. My constituency is 100 miles north to south and 100 miles east to west, but we have only two NHS dentists in the entire area. The out-of-hours emergency provision is two hours on a Sunday morning and a 150-mile round trip&mdash;a three-hour drive&mdash;which is absolutely third-world stuff.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/2">A proud elderly lady from Bala came to see me recently and said that she had to see her GP more often because her oral health was suffering owing to the fact that she cannot access reasonable treatment. We face a crisis. I have a list from the Gwynedd local health board of 30 dentists in the county, 29 of whom will not accept adults on the NHS and one of whom will do so from April 2005. The situation is extremely disturbing.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/3">There is of course an uneven distribution of dentists. Many dentists have told me that students often train in dental schools and then get attached to urban practices, where high-paid cosmetic work is undertaken. They are attracted to that work rather than to rural areas. There is no doubt that it is placing considerable pressure on GPs. As I mentioned, the lady from Bala gave such evidence. As has been said, dentists are frustrated by the lack of time available to spend with patients to offer proper preventive advice. None of this is new; it has been happening for some 10 years, but it is now even more urgent that something be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/4">The Prime Minister promised at the 1999 Labour party conference that anybody wishing to access NHS dental provision would be able to do so by 2001. However, the position in Wales is probably far worse than in 1999. Overall, there are 0.36 NHS dentists per 1,000 population in Wales, according to a study undertaken by Bath university that was published in May 2004. That compares, for example, with 0.6 in the Czech Republic, 0.7 in Belgium and Germany and 0.8 in Norway&mdash;so we are lagging behind. Worse still, only 46 per cent. of adults in Wales are registered with an NHS dentist, and that figure has not improved since 2000.As was recently acknowledged by the Minister responsible in the Welsh Assembly, that figure has remained constant, with 40 per cent. of children in Wales not registered with an NHS dentist. The overall result, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, is that five-year-olds in Wales have, on average, twice as many missing, decayed or filled teeth as youngsters in the west midlands or south-east England. That is a serious position and, obviously, something needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/5">The report of the Select Committee on Health in 2001 said:</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/6" class="indent">&quot;We consider that dentistry has never been fully integrated into the NHS and as a result, major health inequalities exist. We believe that the present arrangements for accessing NHS dentistry are inequitable, uncertain and getting worse; patients do not know where they stand. Unregistered patients find it hard to get any form of care. Registered patients can lose that status without redress and often without knowing that they have done so.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/7">It went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Certain very vulnerable groups of patients, such as elderly people and those with dementia, face particular problems.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/9">It is far worse in rural areas. Perhaps the Minister will consider the fact that the Ceredigion local health board is offering bursaries of &pound;12,000 for students who train in dentistry and come back to practise in the Ceredigion area for five years after graduation. I do not know whether that scheme commends itself to her, but it might be a way of dealing with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/10">I fully appreciate that there is no single answer, but I have spoken recently with several dentists about the subject. One in my constituency, Dr. John Swain of Dolgellau, told me that the position is far worse in rural areas, as we know, but that one of the problems is that smaller practices need financial assistance to take in trainees. That might also assist. I have spoken with the Secretary of State for Wales, also the Leader of the House, who thinks that that is a good idea, so I ask the Minister to take it further. If the right hon. Gentleman has not spoken with her, would she be prepared to discuss it with him? I have tried to be as brief as possible in the light of the time constraints, and I am grateful for this opportunity to raise this important matter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.87.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1152" speakername="Nick Palmer" colnum="87"  time="010:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew19">
	<p pid="a.87.0/1">I shall be brief. Most dentists are happy to work for the NHS if they can do so with reasonable terms and conditions, and most patients are not really too concerned with the detail. As virtually every speaker has said, they simply want the access. During periods of uncertainty, dentists are open to approaches from private groups, which pursue them with somewhat predatory zeal. Once they are signed up, they turn their ruthless marketing on to the patients. At least two of my constituents say that they were told in the surgery by Denplan salesmen that unless they signed up at once, they would find that not one dentist in Greater Nottingham was taking on NHS patients. That is, frankly, a fat lie. It is therefore important that dentists who are keen to stay with the NHS should be able to negotiate their arrangements as quickly as possible. I have been corresponding with the Minister on behalf of my constituent Andrew Keetley. In the last exchange I said that discussions with him were continuing, but he says that he has not heard anything for quite a long time. I appreciate that not every application can be granted or considered, but it would be good if those matters could be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/921" name="Damian Green">the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is useful for the House periodically to review progress on the issue. The progress has been rather depressing; the figures suggest that it is still in reverse rather than going forward. I want to comment on two or three points that have been raised in the debate, which is timely in view of the written statement that was made on Monday, with its remarkable closing words:</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/2" class="indent">&quot;The changes which we have been making to NHS dentistry are proving to be very successful as evidenced by the high level of interest among dentists in moving to new ways of working.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-10">10 January 2005</phrase>; Vol. 429, c. 8WS.]</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/3">Surely the best measure of how the Government are doing is the number of people with access to an NHS dentist.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/4">Reference has been made to the Prime Minister's promise of 1999. Back in 1997, 51.8 per cent. of adults were registered with an NHS dentist. According to new figures that I obtained from a written answer in December, the figure for 2004 had fallen to 38.8 per cent. The number of children registered has fallen alarmingly from 65.7 per cent. in 1997 to 54.6 per cent. in 2004. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> referred to the aspiration&mdash;I think that that is how it must be described at the moment&mdash;of 9,000 new NHS registrations. On the basis of answers that I have received, I would suggest that only one in five NHS dentists is registering children at the moment, and that only 14 per cent. are registering charge-exempt adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/5">The most vulnerable are struggling to find an NHS dentist anywhere with a book that is open and to which they can be added. In my constituency, I found from a survey that I undertook last year that 30 of the 69 practices were not taking NHS work. Some people might uncharitably claim that the Government's two-pillar approach to dental reform&mdash;the local commissioning of dental services by primary care trusts and the new contract&mdash;is fundamentally undermined by what the Government said in their written statement on Monday; they might say that those pillars are crumbling.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that part of the problem is the extent to which dentists have ceased to believe that the British Dental Association speaks for them? Dentists in my area feel that the negotiations are problematic because of uncertainty about whether they are truly represented.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.2/1">I am not here to speak for the BDA, which will speak for itself. I am sure that dentists will make representations through hon. Members such as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.88.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/769" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="88"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew24">
	<p pid="a.88.4/1">No. I am trying to make progress in a very short time, and the hon. Gentleman has made several interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.4/2">The PCTs were found by the National Audit Office to have had little experience of high street dentistry, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/731" name="Paul Beresford">the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase> said. They are already absorbing a huge agenda of change, not least of which is the GP contract. Monday's written statement explained that the delay is needed to give PCTs the time to prepare for their new role. It also explained that a longer lead-in time is necessary to allow public consultation on key aspects of the matter, and so that the parliamentary process can be fully observed.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.4/3">How on earth can we be presented with a statement at the beginning of this year telling us that the parliamentary process needs fully to be observed? Why was the Department unaware of the need to do that when it was programming the implementation of the reform years ago? Why on earth has the Department only now woken up to the fact that the National Audit Office warns that PCTs are not ready? Why did it not make its own assessment and reach the same conclusion, so that it could have put in place the measures to provide PCTs with the necessary capacity?</p>
	<p pid="a.88.4/4">The dental work force review was commissioned by the Department in July 2001, and was the first since 1987&mdash;it was very welcome for that reason&mdash;but it was not published until July 2004. It had sat in the Department from autumn 2003. We have heard that shortages of up to 5,100 dentists are forecast for 2011 and that the number going through training in the next few years will not fill the gap. Surely, that will necessitate substantial overseas recruitment, and regardless of whether one supports the idea of open access and the free movement of labour, there must be serious questions about safeguarding the ethics of overseas recruitment to ensure that we do not poach resources from countries that can ill afford to lose them.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.4/5">The hon. Member for Ashford referred to NHS Direct, and it is worth noting that calls to it about dental matters have increased by 77 per cent. over the past two years, against an overall increase in calls of 10 per cent. So, there is a huge underlying problem, with people failing to gain access to NHS dentistry services and seeking emergency access.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.4/6">The second pillar is the new contract. We need the details of that contract, and it would be helpful if the Minister said when they will be shared with those in the BDA, with whom the Government are negotiating, so that things can begin to move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.4/7">Will the Minister also say something about how the new charging regime will interact? There is a question about the extent to which it will generate a financial shortfall in funding for NHS dentistry. Given that the NHS health economy has a &pound;500 million deficit, which is growing, according to the <i>Health Service Journal, </i>how will that shortfall be met?</p>
	<p pid="a.88.4/8">The hon. Members for Milton Keynes, South-West and for Mole Valley referred eloquently to prevention, and the absence of a reference to it in the White Paper on public health gives cause for concern. I hope that the Minister can clear up an issue arising from the written statement. It would be useful if she clarified the Government's attitude and intentions towards the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance on the call-up for checks by saying when they will be rolled out and implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.4/9">There is no magic solution to fixing NHS dentistry. The current direction of travel&mdash;local commissioning through PCTs, provided that they have the necessary capacity and skills, the long overdue reconstruction of the work force, and the new contract, which will, I hope, move us to a system that is about prevention, not drill and fill&mdash;has to be the right way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.4/10">The question, however, is whether the Government have prosecuted things in an aggressive way that shows that they recognise that there is a serious problem. I do not think that they have, in their eight years in office, prosecuted the reform and improvement of NHS dentistry with anything like the pace that was necessary. That is why things have become worse over the past few years, not better. Indeed, that is why I fear that they will get much worse and why, for some years to come, many of our constituents will continue to suffer the anxiety of being unable to find an NHS dentist. Although the Government inherited a very poor legacy from the Conservatives, they have not done enough to put things right.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/921" name="Damian Green">my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green)</phrase> on his success in securing this timely debate. At the heart of it lies the famous pledge made at the Labour party conference in September 1999 that everybody who wanted it would have access to NHS dentistry within two years. I think that the Chancellor would bear testimony to the fact that one should not necessarily take prime ministerial pledges at face value, but we were perhaps entitled to expect that we would have something rather different from what we have now. Although dental access centres provide theoretical access, we have heard ample testimony today to the fact that most of our constituents have great difficulty accessing NHS dental care.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.1/1">Is my hon. Friend aware of the recent survey that indicated that only 40 dentists in Hampshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight are taking on new adult NHS patients? No wonder people feel angry and bitter that the Prime Minister's pledge has been broken.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.90.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="90"  time="010:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew27">
	<p pid="a.90.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I used to be a dental patient in Hampshire, and his comments come as no great surprise. They will, of course, be reflected throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/2">The proportion of adults registered with a dentist has steadily fallen from 55 per cent. to 46 per cent. today. There might be some dispute about those figures, and I have heard different ones bandied about, but I believe that those are the official figures. However, we can all agree that things are bad and getting worse. Worse still, dentists are leaving the NHS in droves so the debate is timely.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.3/1">I agree. There are big problems in my area. However, does the hon. Gentleman not agree that there are things that we can do in our localities to make things better? I convened a meeting of the strategic health authority, the primary care trust and the local dental committee in York. As a result, we have got through personal dental services contracts for seven practices, which will take on an additional 5,000 patients, and we have established an open-access urgent treatment centre. There are problems in my neighbourhood, but if we work with our local health bodies we can get them to address such problems, using the tools that the Government are making available.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.91.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="91"  time="010:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spnew29">
	<p pid="a.91.0/1">I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention. From what he has said, the picture in his constituency seems to be somewhat better than that in mine. In my constituency&mdash;I suspect that it is typical&mdash;the PCT that is being encouraged to run such things is struggling. I believe that it will continue to do so, for reasons that I shall explain. Can the Minister tell us why, according to Monday's announcement, the Cayton report will not be given a full airing until the summer? I shall be grateful if the hon. Lady confirms that she has it, and I would gently suggest to her that this might be a good opportunity to share its contents, which will be crucial as we pick up the pieces of Monday's announcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/2">The Consumers Association would also like to see the report. It says that the fear must be that the Government are running scared in the run-up to the election. It suspects that they want to delay publishing their proposals to set charges that are higher than the public can stomach. Others have suggested that the extraordinary delay is because the Government know that the anticipated three-banded system will not work. It will be interesting if the Minister can say which of those two possibilities is correct. We have to accept that progress since the beginning of December has been something of a dog's breakfast. We began with a very poor backdrop: the dental work force review, which was delayed by two years and published early last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/3">The sorry saga has, I am sad to say, gone from bad to worse, with the most recent chronology going something like this: on <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase>, hours after the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1332" name="Rosie Winterton">the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>, confirmed at the Dispatch Box that arrangements on dentistry were proceeding on time, the British Dental Association walked out of contract negotiations. Lester Ellman, chair of the BDA general practice committee, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/4" class="indent">&quot;We have been proactive in our discussions with the Department of Health but the traffic has been almost entirely one way. To continue would be to devalue NHS dentistry, and to let down the dentists we represent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/5">Earlier that day, the Minister had told us, in a fairly upbeat way:</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Preparations for the most far-reaching reforms of NHS dentistry since 1948, founded on the delegation of new contractual arrangements to primary care trusts, are proceeding on time.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-07">7 December 2004</phrase>; Vol. 428, c. 1027.]</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/7">The following day, I raised the Minister's assurances on a point of order. On <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>, Sir Nigel Crisp, reflecting on the BDA walk-out, told the Public Accounts Committee, surprisingly perhaps, that the association's involvement was</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/8" class="indent">&quot;not absolutely crucial for us&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/9">and that</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/10" class="indent">&quot;we would not expect the timetable to slip.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/11">Confirming that on <phrase class="date" code="">21 December</phrase>, the Health Secretary wrote to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1034" name="Andrew Lansley">my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/12" class="indent">&quot;I can assure you, as Rosie Winterton assured the House on 7   December, that we are on course with our programme of reform.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/13">Yet in an official ministerial statement published on Monday, the Health Secretary announced plans to delay the introduction of the new dental contract until April 2006. Further consultation has been deferred until the summer; I have to ask the Minister why.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/14">Cynics would say&mdash;heaven forbid&mdash;that in the intervening period we are highly likely to have a general election, and that there is, perhaps, an attempt to delay dealing with what has become an extremely difficult subject until after that general election. As others have said, it is not for want of warning. The BDA, the NAO and PCTs have indicated all along that PCTs do not have the capacity to take on responsibility for commissioning dentistry. It is hardly surprising that things now have to be delayed, and I am not surprised that, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1152" name="Nick Palmer">the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> said, the BDA welcomed Monday's announcement. It has said all along that things are simply not right for PCTs to take on responsibility for dental commissioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/15">Monday's ministerial statement claimed that there has been progress with recruiting dentists from overseas. We are told that the Government intend to recruit 230 dentists from Poland and that they have engaged a recruitment agency to do the job at a cost of &pound;3.8 million, which is &pound;16,500 per dentist going directly to the agency if my mathematics is correct. We also understand that a &pound;10,000 golden hello will be provided to dentists from Poland who wish to work in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/16">Can the Minister offer a justification for spending &pound;16,500 per dentist, given that EU practitioners do not need to take the international qualifying exam and could go straight on to the UK register? While she is about it, can she explain why we no longer have mutual recognition with dental schools of other Commonwealth countries? We have corresponded on this subject before, because it seems to me that there is potential for recruiting dentists in a fairly trouble free way, as we used to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/17">In response to the points made by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, there is a real ethical difference between recruiting surplus dentists from countries such as New Zealand and recruiting them from those countries where they are desperately needed. I would be grateful if the Minister told us the true cost of the Government's recruitment exercise and how many dentists have started to work here as a result. How long will practitioners, so expensively recruited to the NHS, be tied to the NHS?</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/18">A little while ago some representatives from the Dental Laboratories Association came to see me and we had a fruitful meeting. They pointed out that in dental pilot areas their members' work had fallen by 70 per cent. Has the Minister reflected on that and drawn any conclusions? Does she, like me, suspect that one of the factors in pilot areas is that dentists are much less likely to refer expensive work to dental laboratories because of the perverse incentive that is acting there? I do not want for one moment to decry the pilots that are being carried out, but it is important to take note of concerns that have been expressed by organisations such as the DLA and ascertain whether the quality of work in those areas has fallen off as a result of the pilots.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/19">Our consultation document, &quot;NHS dentistry&mdash;proposals for modern oral health&quot;, is based on five pillars, not two like the Government's. They are: registration, capitation, a low-cost voluntary monthly payment scheme for non-exempt adults, oral health promotion focused on children and a greater role for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in determining an evidence-based schedule for NHS dentistry.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/20">Almost all the responses have been positive. One described the review as refreshing and a clear step in the right direction. Another said that the document was impressive, showed a great understanding of the issues that had allowed dentistry to be sidelined, and offered good solutions to many of the issues pertinent today. Other respondents said that they broadly supported many of the underpinning five pillars of the Conservative party's action plan, adding that the plan was cogent and well constructed.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/21">Those positive responses give us good grounds to hope that our solutions, when they are announced very soon by those higher up the food chain, will be well received both by the profession and, more importantly, by patients. In the meantime, I hope that the Minister will use the opportunity provided by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford to explain why the Government have given up on dentistry.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.93.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1332" speakername="Rosie Winterton" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="93"  time="010:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h01.htm#50112h01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.93.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/921" name="Damian Green">the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green)</phrase> on securing the debate. I am well aware that there are big challenges for NHS dentistry. We have seen from the number of Members on both sides of the House who are present in Westminster Hall that the matter is of concern to their constituents. I hope that I will be able to give some reassurances about the action that the Government are taking.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/2">I take on board many of the points that have been made, but as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/915" name="Linda Gilroy">my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> said, Conservative Members have to take some responsibility for the very unpopular contract that was introduced in the 1990s, the resulting cuts in fees and the closure of two dental schools. I do not say that we immediately have all the answers, but let us be honest about where some problems arose. That is why we are dealing with the situation today by introducing radical reforms to NHS dentistry. As hon. Members know, we have a drill-and-fill system under the current contract in which dentists are paid for the work that they do, which in a sense is invasive. The problem is that the money reverts to the centre if dentists decide to leave the NHS, and it is not possible for that money to be replaced at local level. By radically changing the system of commissioning at local level, we are enabling PCTs to carry on using their money to commission at local level rather than losing it from the area, as happens at the moment. We are backing up the changes to local commissioning with a 20 per cent. increase in the amount of money that we are investing in NHS dentistry. We are also putting massive extra resources into NHS dentistry.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/3">Those are key changes. We are also introducing a new contract for dentistry that will enable the changes in preventive care to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1249" name="Phyllis Starkey">my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/731" name="Paul Beresford">the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)</phrase> referred. That is exactly what dentists have been saying. They do not like the way that the contract works and want it to change so that it will reflect modern ways of working. That is why we are making the changes. Over and above that, we are also thinking about how we can introduce a new system for charges and for gathering remuneration from dentists that will make things simpler. That will not replace one treadmill with another.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" name="Andrew Murrison">The hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> talked about the report on patient charges. We are keen to ensure that we get that right, and I want to do more work on that system before we finally decide exactly how it will work. Various options are available to us, and I want to ensure that there is the least bureaucratic system for dentists and one that enables us properly to monitor public money.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/5">So, we are spending about &pound;368 million more on NHS dentistry in the long term. We will be training more undergraduates, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health announced recently. In the short term, we have allocated &pound;59 million in the past year to address some real and immediate access problems. We will recruit an extra 1,000 dentists in two ways. First, we are allowing many dentists to move to the new personal dental services system. About 3,500 dentists now say that they like the new ways of working. We also have several PDS applications in the pipeline, which we want to ensure that we can process. Again, we want to give PCTs more time to move dentists over to the new system, because those dentists are voting with their feet and showing that they like the new ways of working. That gives us the opportunity to ensure that we have learned lessons from some new PDS sites when we bring in full implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/6">There are several points to make about international recruitment. First, we do not recruit dentists from countries that have no surplus of dentists and that do not want us to take dentists from them. We are making good progress. Polish dentists have begun work in the constituencies of the hon. Member for Westbury and my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton. Problems remain in my hon. Friend's constituency, but extra money has been allocated and international recruits are going into her area. I invite Members to meet some recruits from India whom I met at the Eastman dental institute, where the hon. Member for Mole Valley trained. There is a high level of expertise, and it is vital that we use it.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/7">Changes are taking place at a local level with the extra money that we have allocated to PCTs. I met <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/719" name="Hugh Bayley">my hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> and representatives of the PCTs in his area, and he is right that plans have been formulated and extra money has been allocated. I congratulate him on working closely with his PCTs to that end.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.0/1">The new PDS contract is making a big contribution in York, but the largest and longest-established NHS practice in York is concerned that a contract currently being negotiated may not be approved. Will the Minister give an assurance that any practice that wants to transfer to PDS will be able to do so and that it is just a matter of agreeing the terms?</p>

	<p pid="a.95.0/1">It is certainly a matter of agreeing terms. The Department of Health has set up a support team and increased the number of people dealing with PDS applications. I will take up <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1152" name="Nick Palmer">the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase>, and I can also tell my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West that 9,000 registrations are expected over a three-year period. One new dental practice is starting this spring, followed by four later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/2">In Ashford, &pound;65,000 has been allocated to the local PCT to improve immediate access problems, and I will write to the hon. Member for Ashford about the various dental practices to which that money has been allocated. In the immediate term, there are plans for some 2,500 extra registrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/3">I have addressed <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/769" name="Paul Burstow">the points made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> about the new contract&mdash;discussions have taken place and will continue to take place. As I said, I shall pursue the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, and I will pass on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1053" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the comments of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase> to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/4">Nationally, plans to change the system of commissioning dentistry are proceeding, but at local level changes are already being made. Dentists are telling us that they like the new ways of working, and we have also made &pound;59 million available to address some immediate problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/5">To address the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, there will always be people who do not register with a dentist, so there will always be a role for dental access centres. I am aware that colleagues, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton, continue to experience difficulties, but the field site in the south-west peninsula has provided opportunities for us to examine new ways of working, and I congratulate her local health authorities on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.0/6">The changes will make a difference to NHS dentistry. I know that there are immediate access problems, but I hope that I have given some reassurance that we have a vision for the future and radical reform, which is backed up by a massive increase in investment in NHS dentistry, both in the short and longer terms.</p>

	Women Prisoner Suicides
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.96.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/912" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="96"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h02.htm#50112h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.96.1/1">I welcome the chance to highlight the high rate of suicide among women prisoners. I first became aware of the subject when I chaired a women's Liberal Democrat meeting at conference and met a lady named Pauline Campbell, the mother of the late Sarah Campbell, who died in Styal prison on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-18">18 January 2003</phrase>. There is a certain irony in the fact that I have managed to secure this debate when the inquest into Sarah's death is being held. The more I looked into the matter, the more I realised that the high rate of suicide among women in prison is a symptom of all that is wrong with how the criminal justice system, and particularly the prison system, treats women.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/2">The facts are simple. I am sure that the Minister is aware of them, but I will repeat them for the record. In 2003 the female prisoner population reached 4,595, but that hides the fact that more than 13,000 women were in prison that year. There were 14 female suicides in 2003 and 13 in 2004. The Home Office, for some reason, prefers to use the term &quot;self-inflicted death&quot;. I am not sure why. I shall stick to the term &quot;suicide&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/3">Of course, men commit suicide as well, but while women make up just over 6 per cent. of the prison population, they account for 15 per cent. of the suicides. They also account for 45 per cent. of the incidents of self-harm in prison, which are connected to the subject of suicide. Inquest, which campaigns against deaths in custody, said that the high number of female prisoner deaths was &quot;desperate, depressing and shameful&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/4">It seems clear to me that different factors are having an impact on women and that the reasons for the difference in suicide rates must be investigated. It is pertinent to look at the differences between the male and female prison populations. The key difference is the type of crime committed. Women are much less likely to have committed a violent crime. Only 10 per cent. of women in prison have committed a violent crime. More than 40   per cent. of women are jailed for crimes of an acquisitive nature&mdash;theft, to the average person&mdash;and 11 per cent. are jailed for drug offences. It is thought that a high proportion of the theft offences are linked to the need to steal to fund a drug habit, but it is difficult to establish a precise figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/5">The evidence shows that women in prison suffer from a number of mental health problems. Two thirds show symptoms of at least one neurotic disorder such as depression, anxiety or phobia. More than half suffer from personality disorder. That can be compared to the general population, in which less than a fifth of women suffer from those disorders. Half the women in prison are on prescribed medication such as anti-depressants or anti-psychotic medicine, and there is evidence that the use of such medication increases while in custody. As if that was not enough, studies have shown that many women in prison also have serious drug problems, and about 40 per cent. could be described as harmful or dependent users of drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/6">It is clear that we are dealing with some of the most vulnerable members of society, particularly when one bears it in mind that one in four female prisoners spent time in local authority care as a child. The problem is much wider than trying to pin blame on the Prison Service. Forty per cent. left school before the age of 16 and more than half say that they have suffered domestic violence. One in three have experienced sexual abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/7">Prior to 2003, a high proportion of female suicides were to be found among remand prisoners. According to Government figures, in 2003 there were no deaths of females on remand. However, figures from the Howard League for Penal Reform indicate one death of a remand prisoner, so I am not quite sure how the difference has arisen. Either way, that seems to be a reversal of the trend and suggests that special attention has been paid to remand prisoners, but there is no room for complacency. We also have to take into account the number of failed suicide attempts and incidents of self-harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/8">The situation of women at Holloway prison was recently highlighted by <i>The Guardian</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Officers at Holloway prison are cutting down five women a day from nooses, the Guardian has learned, and recently saved one inmate six times in a single night.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/10">The article goes on to describe those women as the lucky ones because they did not succeed. It also quotes Deborah Coles of Inquest:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/11" class="indent">&quot;'We know that prisons cannot keep women safe: it is not just those who are dying, but the numbers who are self-harming and committing suicide every day.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/12">Seventy per cent. of the female prisoners at Holloway are on remand. It is clear that any improvement in the death toll among female remand prisoners is a temporary blip, as the rate of attempted harm remains unacceptably high, but I hope not. I have been told that there are hopes that the situation will improve because there are plans to reduce the proportion of remand prisoners at Holloway. However, there might be a problem if more remand prisoners are dispersed around the country to units that perhaps are not quite so used to dealing with the specific problems of Holloway.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.0/1">Holloway is part of my constituency and I made a lengthy visit to the prison last week to discuss the whole process. Obviously, there are tragedies in Holloway, as I am sure the hon. Lady would accept. Does she also accept that the tragedies that occur there are largely a result of sentencing policy rather than of the prison itself, that the prison has made enormous efforts to try to support the prisoners&mdash;for example by giving them access to the Samaritans helpline&mdash;and that the staff involved in these tragedies also suffer terrible traumas? I am convinced that Holloway is doing its best to care for the women there, but frankly many of them simply should not be in prison.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.97.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/912" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="97"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h02.htm#50112h02_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.97.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I was not going to mention this, but perhaps I should have said that often the staff feel that they are struggling with the system too. They want to help but often cannot because of resource problems or just the sheer volume of the problem. I shall return to the sentencing point, because that is also pertinent.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/2">It is helpful to think about how female prisoners are treated from the moment they enter jail. In fact, the system starts failing women even before they enter prison. The first point to bear in mind is that many women do not expect to find themselves in jail, because of the nature of the crime that they committed. They might not have thought that they could be put in jail for a theft, for example. A report by Her Majesty's chief inspector of prisons in 2000 said that more than half of new prisoners appear not to have expected to be remanded in custody and may not have made preparations for it. Has the Minister given any thought to a system such as that which operates in the Netherlands? There, if a decision is made that a woman with children should be jailed, she is given a breathing space so that she can go home and make appropriate child care arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/3">The &quot;First Night in Custody&quot; project conducted interviews with 1,400 women coming into Holloway for the first time. On analysing the data, the Revolving Doors Agency learned that 42 of the women&mdash;3 per cent.&mdash;had no idea who was looking after their children and that 19 children under 16 were looking after themselves. The former figure does not include those women who knew who was looking after their children but had not expected to be separated from them that evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/4">Clearly, separation from their children is traumatic for any parent, but I believe that separation has more impact on women because they have generally spent more time with the children and have taken on the major responsibility for caring for them. I find it shocking that the Home Office does not seem to see any need to keep a record of how many children are affected. We have heard much about joined-up government, and that information should be collected even if it is only so that social services can check that all is well with what is probably a vulnerable family.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/5">Answers to fairly recent parliamentary questions show that</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/6" class="indent">&quot;for every female prisoner, there are roughly 1.5 children in the community&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/7">and that</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/8" class="indent">&quot;prior to going to prison, 60 per cent. of the female prisoners who were mothers had been looking after their children at home.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-05">5 January 2004</phrase>; Vol. 416, c.16W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/9">An earlier answer showed that 66 per cent. of the female prison population were mothers of children under 18 and that more than one third of the mothers had one or more children under five.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/10">Clearly, the process is stressful, but the Prison Service seems to have ways of adding to the stress. In a debate in another place on women in prison, Baroness Gale pointed out that Holloway does not have a lock-out system. I think that that is well meaning on the part of Holloway, because it thinks that it should be able to receive prisoners at any time. However, many male prisons in the area do operate a lock-out, which means that after, say, 7 o'clock they will not receive prisoners, so men are usually dealt with first and women are frequently kept in the transport van for long periods. A new system of escorting prisoners was due to come into effect last summer, but I understand that the option of escorting female prisoners separately from male prisoners is deemed to be prohibitively expensive. Has the Minister assessed whether the new system has improved things for women?</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/11">Women arrive stressed from the impact of not expecting to be in jail and of the inefficient transport system, combined with concern for their children if they are mothers. Sadly, things do not get much better. The Prison Reform Trust report &quot;Lacking Conviction: The rise of the women's remand population&quot; goes into detail about what happens next:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/12" class="indent">&quot;When women enter custody on remand they are often subject to dehumanising treatment. This is largely due to the sheer numbers of remanded women and the problems they present.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/13">The report of Her Majesty's chief inspector of prisons on Styal prison goes into detail on how women are treated on arrival. I do not have time to read it all, but the following sample will give the flavour:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Women who have been newly sentenced or newly remanded into custody are known to be at risk of self-harm. It was therefore of great concern to find that many of the women we found sitting on the floor had been shuttling back and forth from magistrates courts and police cells for between two and four days. We talked to several of these women who had been locked out for some days. One woman was several months pregnant and another was 19. One woman aged 35 was detoxifying and concerned about her medication. They all looked exhausted and confused.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/15">The chief inspector suggested that there is a strong link between the treatment of those women&mdash;he used the word &quot;humiliating&quot;&mdash;and the strong evidence that the risks of self-harm and suicide attempts are highest during the early days of custody. A later report in June 2004 found that women arriving at Styal were still lacking support and 48 per cent. of women surveyed said that they had not received any help or support from Styal within the first 24 hours of arriving. I think that that is due to the pressures of the system rather than the hard-heartedness of the staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/16">It is worth picking up on the woman who was detoxifying and concerned about her medication, because it is believed that a relatively high proportion of female prisoners have a drug dependency problem. In an ideal world, the system should be able to identify those people and start providing appropriate help and support as soon as possible, but we do not live in an ideal world and I was disappointed that in response to a written question last June the Minister told me that data on the matter are not collated centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/17">The chief inspector's report on Eastwood Park in 2001 said:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/18" class="indent">&quot;The initial services offered to women who had recently arrived and were withdrawing from substance abuse were uncoordinated and not meeting their needs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/19">That is of particular concern because responsibility for health in prisons is being transferred to primary care trusts. If the Home Office does not have any understanding of the scale of the problem, although I cannot believe that it does not, it will be difficult to get the PCTs to deal with the problem adequately. That is particularly so when drug rehabilitation services generally are often very difficult to access.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/20">Eastwood Park is in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1311" name="Steve Webb">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb)</phrase>, who tells me that the local PCT has real concerns that it will not receive adequate funding to deal with some complex problems that it will inherit. Any information on how the system will work and how the funding formula will be calculated will be welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/21">Even if a detox programme were able to commence, there is the added problem that women are often in jail for comparatively short periods. I do not complain about the length of the sentences, but unless services start quickly and there is some attempt to continue them when a woman leaves prison, any positive work will be negated when the woman returns home.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/22">I mentioned the high rate of mental health problems in women's prisons. It is worth repeating that 37 per cent. say that they have attempted suicide at some time in their life. The many stories of women who have succeeded in taking their own lives highlights the fact that friends and family members have often raised concerns in the days and sometimes hours before a suicide. In January last year, the Minister was asked</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/23" class="indent">&quot;what proportion of the female prisoners who committed suicide had previously been identified as at risk through the use of the HM Prison Service form F2052SH in each of the past four years.&quot;&mdash;<i>Official Report, House of Commons, </i><phrase class="date" code="2004-01-05">5 January 2004</phrase>; Vol. 416, c. 17W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/24">The answer was staggering: all the women had been on an open F2052SH at some point during their imprisonment. In 2003, 64 per cent. were on an open form at the time of their death. In 2004, that had reduced slightly to 50 per cent., but it is still a very large proportion.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/25">That is a damning indictment of the prison system's ability to keep its prisoners safe. It calls into question the accuracy of the review process and means that we need to examine the circumstances of the suicides and to learn from the failures of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/26">I conclude by highlighting one further area of concern: family contact. There are a small number of women's prisons, so women are more likely to be held long distances from home. Half of all women prisoners are held more than 50 miles from their home town and a quarter are more than 100 miles away. A Home Office study found that only half the women who had lived with their children or been in contact prior to imprisonment had received a visit since going to prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/27">I have not painted a pretty picture. Clearly, action must be taken, and I am aware that the Government have launched their suicide strategy. However, although that is welcome, far more fundamental changes must be made. The first change relates to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/819" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the point raised by the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>. We need to ensure that we jail only those women who really need to be in jail, whether that be because of the seriousness of their offence or for the protection of the public. The judiciary seems to take the attitude that it is okay to send women with children to prison for short periods without taking into consideration the wider impact on the family. If there is a will to reduce the number of women in prison&mdash;many of whom are imprisoned for relatively minor offences&mdash;the Home Office must impress the importance of those considerations on the judiciary.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/28">Many people have called for the establishment of a women's justice board, which would address the particular needs of women in prison, and I fully support that call. We also need to ensure that there is a clear strategy for identifying the needs of women prisoners as swiftly as possible. A service is needed that is capable of dealing with child care, housing, mental health and drug rehabilitation services.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/29">I began by mentioning Sarah Campbell. Action must be taken for her sake, for the sake of the 26 other women who committed suicide over the past two years and for the sake of all those who tried to do so and did not succeed. This problem is not a happy legacy for the Minister to take on, but I believe that he is concerned about it. I look forward to him telling me how some problems that I have highlighted will be tackled.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.101.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/917" speakername="Paul Goggins" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="101"  time="011:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h02.htm#50112h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.101.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/912" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> on raising this difficult issue. I am pleased that she has brought it to the attention of the House. I am also grateful for the contribution made to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/819" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the debate by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>. I warmly acknowledge that both he and the hon. Lady have a long-standing interest in this and related issues. As the hon. Lady made clear in her opening remarks, the debate is also timely. The inquest on Sarah Campbell is taking place, and that draws our attention to this important issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/2">As the Under-Secretary with responsibility for correctional services and reducing re-offending, I have many issues to consider, but none is more important than this one. The need to reduce the number of prisoners&mdash;and perhaps women prisoners in particular&mdash;who seek to take their own lives is of the highest priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/3">The hon. Member for Romsey asked why we use the term &quot;self-inflicted deaths&quot; rather than suicide. Suicide implies intent, and we cannot always be certain that someone intended to take their own life. That is why we use the more inclusive term &quot;self-inflicted deaths&quot;. It is not an act of political correctness, but an attempt to define the issue accurately.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/4">Tragically, last year there were 95 apparently self-inflicted deaths in our prisons, 13 of which were those of women prisoners. The figures were broadly the same as the previous year, when there were 94 deaths overall, 14 of which were those of women. As in the previous five years, in 2004 the rate at which women in prison took their own lives exceeded the rate at which men did so. That runs counter to the trend in society as a whole, where women are less likely to take their own lives than men. Clearly, there are some unique factors at work in this situation that predispose women in prison to be more likely to self-harm and to take their own lives. We need therefore to appreciate the differences between male and female prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/5">The hon. Lady gave the House some figures that demonstrate the vulnerability of women prisoners. It is interesting to contrast some of those figures with the figures for men. For example, we know that there is a close association between sexual abuse and self-harm by women prisoners. We have conducted interviews with prisoners who have self-harmed that show that 41 per cent. had experienced sexual abuse, compared with 18 per cent. of men. Some 44 per cent. of women on remand have attempted suicide in their lives, which compares with 27 per cent. of men on remand. About two thirds of the women who arrive in custody require clinical detoxification, as compared with just less than half of men. Those differences demonstrate the increased vulnerability of many of the women in our prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/6">All those factors have been identified as significantly increasing an individual's risk of suicide. Also, as mothers tend to be the primary carers of their children, concerns about child care arrangements, the fear of losing contact with children, the inability to plan for children as they grow up and the sheer pain of separation all add to the stress and distress that many women in prison experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/7">We cannot underestimate the unique pressures that are involved in the day-to-day care and management of such a vulnerable female prison population. I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North paid tribute to the staff at Holloway prison and, indeed, staff at all of our prisons, who deal with such vulnerable people day in, day out.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.0/1">Has the Minister visited Holloway prison recently? If he has not, would he be prepared to go and examine the custody records, the inappropriate sentencing policies, which are not the fault of the prisons&mdash;they are the victims&mdash;and the caring approach taken by the staff, who are desperate to improve the situation of the prisoners? Will he see whether there are lessons that can be applied more widely? After all, 10 per cent. of all women prisoners are in Holloway prison and, as the hon. Member for Romsey rightly said, they are often isolated, and receive few visits and little support from outside.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.1/1">I visited Holloway prison some time ago, but if there is an opportunity to do so again in the near future, I will seize it. Perhaps my hon. Friend would like to join me on that visit. We can learn many lessons from Holloway, not least about how the first night of a prisoner's stay is dealt with in such a sensitive and supportive way. We have carried those lessons across to other prisons, which is one way in which Holloway has helped to inform practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/2">We are talking about the contribution that staff make. I am sure that it would interest hon. Members to know that 127 resuscitations were carried out on women prisoners in 2003 and that a further 51 were carried out in the first nine months of 2004. We are talking about people being brought back from the point of death by highly dedicated staff, to whom I pay tribute.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/3">The hon. Member for Romsey and my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North both raised the important issue of sentencing. Over the past 10 years, the female prison population trebled. However, I am pleased to say that the female prison population today is 4,134, which is 173 fewer than on the same day last year and more than 500 fewer than the record level reached in May last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/4">I hope that my hon. Friend is encouraged by the fact that sentencers are getting the clear message that short-term prison sentences for less serious, non-dangerous offenders are an ineffective way of dealing with offenders and that robust community sentences are a much more constructive alternative for women prisoners, as they are for male prisoners. Offenders are provided with the opportunity to address the causes of their offending behaviour and at the same time put something back into the community where they committed those offences. For such offenders, that is a much more constructive approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/5">In the longer term, I hope that the women's offending reduction programme, which I launched in March last year, will help to rebalance the system and bring a sustained reduction in the women's prison population, ensuring that custody is reserved for the most serious and dangerous offenders. To achieve that, our priority will be to improve community-based services and interventions, so that they are more appropriate and accessible for women offenders. We also need to ensure that women who are sent to prison are kept safe from harm. The Prison Service is developing a suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy for women prisoners. The strategy recognises that, given the vulnerabilities and needs of women in prison, there are some areas of suicide prevention that require a gender-specific approach. The strategy does not aim at providing favoured treatment for women prisoners, but it acknowledges that treating men and women prisoners as though they are the same would not represent the best care.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/6">The strategy is building on interventions that are already improving the care offered to women in prison. It might be helpful if I give one or two examples. Holloway and Bullwood Hall offer crisis counselling for women who self-harm. East Sutton Park has what is called a vision team, led and run by the prisoners. They help to deal with issues such as housing, employment and family matters. The first night in custody project at Holloway, which I mentioned earlier, focuses on the needs of women at the extremely vulnerable stage of initial entry to prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/7">Several women's prisons, including New Hall and Morton Hall, have introduced the insiders scheme. Insiders are peer supporters selected and trained by officers to welcome new prisoners into reception, to check whether they have any immediate concerns and to share basic information with them as newly arrived prisoners. In addition, women's prisons run Samaritan-supported listeners schemes to support the more vulnerable prisoners. Holloway also runs a domestic violence programme based on cognitive behaviour therapy, which provides participants with information on how to get help and advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/8">Those examples show the excellent work being done in women's prisons. However, beyond that there are high-level strategies that are having a positive impact on the care offered to women in prison. They include a strategic plan for detoxification and maintenance programmes throughout the prison estate to ensure that there is continuity of treatment between prisons and, indeed, after release&mdash;the hon. Member for Romsey emphasised the importance of that&mdash;and that women can develop ways of coping with their drug problems without feeling the need to self-harm. The hon. Lady suggested that there was difficulty in getting information about the number of detoxification programmes that are running. There should not be any difficulty, and I shall write to her with the information.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/9">The Department of Health is providing an extra &pound;1 million to recruit additional psychiatric nurses to add to the mental health support provided in prisons. We are developing a training pack for all staff working with women in custody to help them to understand the factors underlying self-harm and offer them practical ways of helping women in custody to cope with stressful situations.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/10">The hon. Lady asked whether we had considered the system operating in the Netherlands, under which women are allowed to go home prior to a period of imprisonment. We have not considered that in any detail, but we have introduced a new sentence of intermittent custody, which is, I think, particularly helpful for women prisoners who have child care responsibilities. They spend part of the week in prison and part of the week at home. We have run it for almost a year and it is proving very successful. Families are helped to stay together, which includes the possibility of staying in work, but people face the appropriate punishment if they have committed a crime serious enough to warrant imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/11">The hon. Lady mentioned the escort arrangements for women prisoners. New contracts have been operating since last summer. Some of those arrangements are not working as well as they should be. That matter is a high priority both for the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service and for me. We shall expect improvements and I shall write to the hon. Lady in due course to report on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/12">We are learning lessons all the time. The F2052SH form that the hon. Lady referred to is being superseded by a new system, which will, I think, engage prisoners and the staff around them more in their care. I assure her and my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North&mdash;and the whole House&mdash;that we are determined to make progress on the issue, and that I shall continue to give it the highest priority.</p>

	Neighbourhood Policing
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.105.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/695" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="105"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h03.htm#50112h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.105.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this Adjournment debate on neighbourhood policing. It is all the more welcome for being a surprise. I found out about it on Monday; I do not know whether the surprise was quite so welcome to the busy Minister, but I am delighted to see her.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/2">I am pleased, too, to be accompanied today by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/808" name="Vernon Coaker">my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase>, who has been an inspiration to colleagues in the Nottingham area by his persistent and relentless pursuit of more effective policing in his constituency and in Nottinghamshire. He has been a model in that regard, and although he is not in a position to comment today because of his duties as a Whip, I know that I would not have been as interested as I am in the issue had it not been for his assiduous work over the years.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/3">The debate about reactive policing and pre-emptive policing has gone on for decades, and, as with all such debates, the views are often artificially polarised. The real truth, which most police officers and members of the public accept and understand, is that those two styles of policing are complementary; we cannot have one without the other. Nothing that I say by way of welcome to the Government's drive to improve neighbourhood policing, and the positive response being developed by    Nottinghamshire police, should be taken as undermining the need for responsive policing and reactive policing. They are two sides of the same coin and I think that we are now finding a more appropriate balance between them.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/4">In Nottinghamshire, the chief constable is developing a county-wide neighbourhood policing strategy with energy and intelligence, and that is reflected in the city division, of which my constituency is a part. Neighbourhood policing in my constituency needs 70,000 pairs of eyes and ears&mdash;those of my constituents, who would thus support the uniformed branches of the police rather than hiving off responsibility to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/5">In the city of Nottingham, neighbourhood policy and neighbourhood policing are being developed by the police and the city council in collaboration. Genuine collaboration is the only way that what is happening can be made to work. If the effort is only police led, the full potential benefits will not be realised. The city council, as my hon. Friend the Minister will know from her visits, brings excellent experience of community involvement, through the 100-day clean-up, the blitz on graffiti and the &quot;Respect for Nottingham&quot; campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/6">I see neighbourhood policing as having five key components: beat officers, police community support officers, neighbourhood wardens, the community and multi-agency working. All five elements are either relatively new or are finding a refreshed role within neighbourhood policing. Teething troubles are to be expected, but there is no question but that what is happening is a real breakthrough and a new development that is settling down well. If we continue to drive it with effective management and public and Government commitment, it will make an ever more important contribution to improving law and order and public reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/7">The first of the five elements that I identified is the beat officer. The central pillar around which neighbourhood policing must be based is the individual police constable who is responsible for a geographical area. That is the system now in place in my constituency, and I thank the chief constable, Steve Green, and the   divisional commander, Chief Superintendent Les Kominiak, who, incidentally, may be retiring in the near future. I and my colleagues in the Nottingham area want to express our grateful thanks to that dedicated and determined officer, who did remarkable things in the city division in his relatively brief tenure there. Both those officers deserve commendation for their renewed commitment to the beat officer system.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/8">I carry in my diary at all times a list of the 22 beat officers who are responsible for 22 specific areas in my    constituency. That precise accountability gives ownership to the individual officer, and that provides a focal point for all other neighbourhood policing elements. Crucial to making that work is achieving the greatest stability among our beat officers. The chief police officer in my constituency, Superintendent Helen Jebb, is acutely aware of the need for as much stability as possible. I am very pleased that the police authority has approved the proposal for special payments for beat officers who stay in post for one year, followed by additional increments if they stay in post for two years, and further increments if they stay in post for a third year. I hope that the Minister will confirm later or in writing whether the Home Office has been able to approve that innovative and helpful use of the special priority payments. Regardless of the debate about whether increments are divisive, if beat officers are prepared to make a long-term commitment to a community, they must be the first in the line to receive such increments while they still exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/9">I will go even further and ask the Minister whether she will re-examine the system that I saw in operation in Holland on a recent police parliamentary scheme visit. The beat officer signs a contract with the community to stay in post for five years. Perhaps the special priority payments should include an agreed minimum tenure. At the very least, each beat manager in the United Kingdom should have an engagement plan to suit their local circumstances, as is being pioneered in my constituency by Chief Inspector Simon Nickless.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/10">The city of Nottingham divisional commander, Les Kominiak, pioneered the concept of the beat officer having a publicly known mobile telephone number. At the time, I thought that that would be counter-productive, because all sorts of phone calls would be made, but I am very happy to eat my words publicly, as the public's ability to leave messages has been not only good public relations, helping visibility and contact, but highly effective in delivering useful intelligence to the police. We are talking about not a return to Dixon of Dock Green, but the most effective hard policing to reduce the criminal elements in our society. This is not soft in any sense of the word; it is the most effective deployment of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/11">Another matter that needs to be examined nationally as well as locally is the disincentive of the shift pattern for officers who are retained on the beat. The generous six days on, four days off shift pattern for response officers must be reviewed, not only to make response officers more effective and easier to contact and to put them back under the control of local police station inspectors, but to ensure that they are retained on their patches.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/12">The Government and the constabulary should be proposing effective personnel policies to insist that the norm will be that beat officers who leave have a proper handover period with their successors. Massive local knowledge is often lost by poor or non-existent succession policies. The beat officer must become as much of a fixture in a local community as the GP, head teacher or councillor. Consistency and stability will then have a massive consequential impact on neighbourhood police in the broadest sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/13">Another area that needs a little more attention is police communication with the public. I know from my contact with constituents that not everyone has the name and mobile phone number of their local beat officer. If we provided them repeatedly through the local press, a regular newsletter or an annual &quot;entitlement to know&quot; enclosed with the council tax bill, people would be able not only to contact their beat officer, but to be put in touch with the whole range of neighbourhood policing and criminal justice system services.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/14">Special constables also play an important role. Our local recruitment drive to increase numbers in the special constabulary is an attempt to encapsulate the essence of community engagement. Volunteers from our local communities are supporting their police service enthusiastically and productively, and perhaps the Minister can tell me whether there is or could be a modest payment for the hours that they put in.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/15">The second important component of neighbourhood policing is the recent development of police community support officers. Although it is early days, it is not too wild a prediction to say that PCSOs&mdash;again, I pay tribute to the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling, who was at the forefront of campaigning for Ministers to introduce them&mdash;will be seen in a year or two as a permanent fixture in our communities, and we will be unable to imagine ever having done without them. They are one of the Government's brightest initiatives, and Ministers are to be congratulated on the vision and commitment that they have shown in putting PCSOs in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/16">People like to see high-visibility public figures wearing yellow jackets. They do not necessarily know the distinction between PCSOs and the police, but we need not be ashamed of that. The more bad guys who see a uniformed presence of whatever description on the street, the happier my constituents and I will be. Indeed, in an interesting bit of joined-up thinking, there is an agreement between the divisional commander and the city council for council staff in the Nottingham city centre to wear high-profile yellow jackets. In my constituency alone there are four PCSOs at the Broxtowe station, six at the Oxclose Lane station and four on the mobile taskforce.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/17">As regards PCSOs, I would like the Minister to continue to think about two issues. First, there is the continuing debate about what PCSOs' powers should be. I commend the gentle evolution of the PCSO in Nottinghamshire, which seems a sensible way forward. The more sensitive we can be with PCSOs, the more likely it is that they will fit well into local circumstances, which are obviously different in different places.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/18">In Nottingham, PCSOs can do everything from policing dispersal notices to tackle antisocial behaviour and providing professional witness evidence, which is crucial in breaking the anti-witness culture that drug gangs in my constituency have developed, to using powers of arrest for half an hour until a police officer arrives to provide assistance and issuing fixed-penalty notices. The Minister must bear it in mind that we need to retain local flexibility so that we can determine what powers are appropriate and where they are deployed. That may mean fewer powers in certain circumstances and more in others.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/19">Secondly, the greatest threat to the continuing development of PCSOs is that they might be seen as a substitute for, rather than additional to, the local beat officer. That could be the case especially if there were a squeeze on public expenditure&mdash;if the day ever dawned when another political party got into power and mismanaged the economy. If the issue is not handled sensibly, local policy could, by default, drift to PCSOs only. We would then be only one step away from response policing being run by a national police force and neighbourhood policing being run by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/20">There is much to commend that approach, and perhaps it should be piloted in the city of Nottingham. However, if that is the way we want to go, it should be done only as a matter of deliberate policy, not by default. I am therefore reassured by a recent letter that I received from the Minister, saying that PCSOs are additional to, not a substitute for, beat officers. However, as circumstances and perhaps even Ministers change&mdash;unless the present Minister becomes Home Secretary&mdash;we need continuity to ensure that that idea is retained, whatever the economic and political circumstances surrounding PCSOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/21">The third element of neighbourhood policing is the welcome development allowing local authorities&mdash;in my case, the city of Nottingham&mdash;to employ uniformed neighbourhood wardens. So much of the low-level crime that angers and frustrates our local communities melds imperceptibly into antisocial values evident at street level, which neighbourhood wardens can combat. Having been out on patrol with neighbourhood wardens in my constituency, I know that their ability to take action across a wide range of council and community issues helps underpin the work of the other uniformed branches. They can issue on-the-spot fines for littering and intervene on issues ranging from designing out rat-runs around local estates to dog mess. Those are all very useful and positive services to which the community responds and feels is beneficial. Tying neighbourhood warden patrols into intelligence-led briefing and deployment ensures that their work is done not in isolation but in areas where communities and the other uniformed branches will benefit most.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/22">The fourth element of neighbourhood policing&mdash;and the ultimate measure of success&mdash;is the involvement of the public. Involvement will differ between localities. Some may wish to be involved by becoming special constables, others by sitting on their tenants or residents association. In Nottingham, we have broken down the city into nine area committees, each with its own community safety group. That offers potential for participation, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/23">However, I want to focus on what is in my opinion one of the most underused parts of the local scene: the neighbourhood watch. I have never been a great advocate of neighbourhood watch, but I must admit that as every day goes by it becomes more and more important that we make it relevant and renew what it needs to do. I ask the Government, through the Minister, to look again at that and to ensure that neighbourhood watch reaches a new and higher level, giving it the priority and resources that it needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/24">I have asked all those who should be involved to set as an ambition the creation of a neighbourhood watch in every part of my constituency. Coverage is currently sparse, and the Government and local institutions must set out a clear strategy to make neighbourhood watch comprehensive. There is too much pass the parcel at the moment in organising neighbourhood watch. A named official must be known to the public and to the Government to make the scheme work in every constituency, town and area in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/25">Many people in my area fear that their involvement in neighbourhood watch will lead them to be intimidated. To encourage more and more people to get involved, a fresh approach is necessary. Perhaps in the first instance there should be a neighbourhood watch club that people can join without being surfaced locally until a critical mass of a dozen or 15 people in a street can be achieved. Perhaps that could be explored as a different way to move forward on neighbourhood watch.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/26">Although effective neighbourhood policing can do a great deal, I will continue to look across the Government and, indeed, to the Prime Minister to provide the context for the longer-term answers on crime prevention&mdash;above all making sure that youngsters grow up as social beings rather than antisocial yobs. Short-term measures to relieve the consequences of antisocial behaviour are essential, but will be little more than policy snacking if we do not address the longer-term issues. I hope that all political parties&mdash;they are all represented here today&mdash;will put the long-term development of social behaviour at the centre of their manifestos at the coming election and that whoever is elected as the Government will make the matter central to the next four or five years in British politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/27">I am thinking particularly of the need for comprehensive parenting skills and of doing for social behaviour what we have done for literacy and numeracy, by putting it at the heart of the national curriculum&mdash;not referred to, not as an adjunct to it, but at the centre of the national curriculum. In that way, in areas such as mine we can undercut the attitudes that lead to such massive expense in the long term through involvement with the courts, the police, drug rehabilitation, social work, benefits&mdash;the whole panoply that follows if we do not get things right in the first few years of life and education. The new Home Secretary's recent background probably equips him more than most to acknowledge that young people who have a toolkit of social values, self-discipline and respect for others and the emotional intelligence to use them provide the most effective self-policing mechanism: a fully operational conscience.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/28">Neighbourhood policing will be supported by the public when they understand the practical consequences of their criminal justice system. The Government&mdash;in this case Ministers in the Department for Constitutional Affairs&mdash;must pick up their responsibility in that area by ensuring that the new local criminal justice boards are empowered, resourced and then encouraged to involve systematically every tenants association, every neighbourhood watch and every area committee, so that people gain an understanding of how their criminal justice system relates to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/29">The criminal justice system must be&mdash;it needs to be&mdash;returned to the public and it must stop being the private playground of lawyers and professionals. I hope that the Minister will be able to allude to that and to whether any progress has been made since I raised the matter with the Prime Minister on the Floor of the House before Christmas. If we do not activate the public, we will stand down our largest army in the war on crime. We must involve the public; they must feel that the criminal justice system and neighbourhood policing belong to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/30">The last element to which I want to refer is the large number of local bodies and partnerships that have an interest in neighbourhood policing and often operate on a multi-agency basis. There are a number of examples of that. An obvious one, which has been raised many times by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/957" name="John Heppell">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell)</phrase>, is that of a far tighter partnership between the Crown Prosecution Service, the courts and the police so that we have an agreed strategy when deciding how to tackle antisocial behaviour with an antisocial behaviour order. That would reduce tension and ensure better understanding and communication between agencies. Equally, the embryonic antisocial behaviour teams that are being established in the City of Nottingham have a key role, not least on the former council estates that make up my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/31">In areas of social housing, the local housing office is key. Repossession is a more potent tool even than ASBOs. The use of local knowledge and the ability to engineer better social behaviour through the lettings policy and police checks cannot be underestimated. I was up in Mansfield on a police parliamentary scheme visit, and saw the imaginative way in which the powers of traffic wardens and of PCSOs are being tied so that they combine their impact. The informal network of activity is equally important. We all remember the days when park keepers and bus drivers were the eyes and ears of a local community. That needs to be deliberately revived. Short-term savings on things such as one-person-operated buses or mobile park caretakers have long-term consequences, and we need to revive and regenerate the impact that people on the ground had in all aspects of public service.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/32">I have just mentioned five or six examples of local bodies, and in such a situation co-ordination is absolutely vital, otherwise gaps appear, duplication occurs, things are left to someone else, or the organisational cultures either clash or sulk depending on the mood of the day. As neighbourhood policing develops, we look to the Government to make it clear and to take great care to ensure proper communication, accountability and responsibility for that co-ordination, which is so important between agencies and with the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/33">In the end, there is no substitute for a named person who is known to the local public and to the Home Office as responsible in such areas. Although the civil service may try to &quot;Yes Minister&quot; us out of it, I hope that the parliamentary constituency could provide the right bite-size area for such an arrangement. That would also give Members of Parliament a role and place on them an expectation to help to deliver on neighbourhood policing. I will leave that one in the air for the Minister. If all that is done effectively, we will be in the business of creating a web, a network, an infrastructure that will relentlessly tackle local crime rather than fobbing it off as somebody else's responsibility. Those are the key elements. Much progress has been made informally. The Government have set out their agenda on neighbourhood policing and lots of people are already pursuing that agenda before it formally comes into effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/34">As well as that informal progress, I am delighted to be able to welcome the initiative endorsed only yesterday at the Nottingham crime and disorder reduction partnership. A proposal for two formal pilot schemes on neighbourhood policing in Nottingham was agreed, including one in my constituency, as a prelude to developing a city-wide neighbourhood policing plan. Some 20 PCSOs will be added to the present number of PCSOs and beat managers to form the core of the new teams. A named person will be in charge and the team will link to the antisocial behaviour team and the city council street scene department, with a named contact in each. The teams will be accountable to the area committee's community safety working group, which will be consulted on the task to be undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/35">My thanks go to the Home Office for its funding of the active communities unit, which has been able to prepare the ground for effective consultation to make the scheme work properly. The pilot in my constituency is expected to be up and running next month and long-term funding will be sought in mid-2005 on the back of an agreed neighbourhood policing plan. The signs are very encouraging, but I hope that in developing the formal structures of neighbourhood policing the Minister will be careful in the following two areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/36">First, connecting with the community must not result in the paralysis of over-consultation so that delivery itself is impaired. We can develop a meetings culture with too many open meetings which the same group of people attend. Delivery on the ground will inspire more people to get involved. Secondly, the pilots should be allowed to develop without being bound hand and foot by performance indicators and targets laid down from the centre, which are often insensitive to local needs and circumstances. At the beginning I hope that there will be a real desire for flexibility, so that many different styles and ways forward develop, rather than a wish to intervene too soon to ensure that particular benchmarks, which often are not that relevant to local needs, are met.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/37">There are two minor dangers in what I think is a very welcome development from the Government in this area. The development so far reflects great credit on those who have been involved, but some key decisions are coming up. The central one for the Government is how far we can allow authority for neighbourhood policing to devolve to the localities. It is always difficult promoting a local solution that has to be driven at national level; we all battle with that contradiction in many different ways. If we can make police authorities a little more effective and representative as instruments, that will go a long way to help.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/38">Additionally, while taking second place to no one in my admiration of the former Home Secretary, I hope that the new incumbent will understand that we will make fewer mistakes and get better and more practical outcomes if we involve practitioners and the public at every stage of developing the concept of neighbourhood policing. Whether we call it market testing or reality checking, there is no substitute for picking the brains of those most intimately involved and with the best experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/39">In parliamentary terms, I hope that the Home Secretary will begin to make the fullest possible use of both pre and post-legislative scrutiny so that we can explore all the opportunities and use all the experience available to make neighbourhood policing work on the ground. This is something that Parliament, used properly, can help to bring to the party. It is too early to call neighbourhood policing an unqualified success. Equally, we should avoid presenting it, as some have presented identity cards, as a cure-all. None the less, there is no doubt in my mind or, more importantly, in the minds of my constituents, that the signs are very    encouraging indeed, whether we consider neighbourhood policing a national initiative or a practical local policy. With due care and attention, neighbourhood policing, linked to the long-term measures on social behaviour that I mentioned earlier, could be the answer to tackling the culture of antisocial behaviour and volume crime that is my constituents' No. 1 priority. I wish the Government well in their efforts.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.112.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/973" speakername="John Horam" colnum="112"  time="014:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h03.htm#50112h03_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.112.2/1">I am very glad to have such an unexpectedly early opportunity to speak. I wish that the attendance could have been better, although the number of hon. Members present might have something to do with the fact that the subject was changed late in the day. Perhaps not as many hon. Members as usual knew what was to be debated, which is a great pity. However, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/695" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on raising a central issue of our times.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/2">As the hon. Gentleman said, a lot of interesting things are going on in Nottingham that we read about with great interest and approbation, even in London. He paid tribute to the local commander in Nottingham and I want to pay tribute to my local sector chief, Inspector Nick Stratford. The southern sector of Bromley coincides with my constituency. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the bite-sized area of a constituency being a good size for neighbourhood policing. My relationship with Inspector Stratford is good. I find him responsive, with his feet on the ground, and willing to commit to the idea of neighbourhood policing. I am grateful to him for all that he is doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/3">I have no doubt that the more neighbourhood policing we have, the better. It is the right direction for policing to take in the 21st century. However, the one necessary criterion is that we have enough police on the ground&mdash;on the beat, visible to people, making themselves known.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/4">I shall give an example of how that does not work in my constituency in current circumstances and how it could work. I went to a public meeting before Christmas that was attended by no fewer than 400 people. The meeting was called by the police, who were there in force. The Minister can imagine the long list of complaints that were aired, as the police explained that they thought they were doing a reasonable job, only to be told, &quot;No you're not, because of X, Y and Z.&quot; The meeting went on for a long time and the conclusion was that we needed more police.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/5">When the crunch came, the police had to admit that, in my constituency, quite a large area in Cray Valley&mdash;a large ward in a London borough&mdash;was being dealt with by just one beat officer. That is not all, however. I subsequently discovered that beat officer guarding the Door at the end of the main Committee Corridor when the Hunting Bill debate was interrupted and having two hours of her time wasted when she could have been down in Cray Valley doing her real job. That is an example of the problem of insufficient police officers and, particularly in London, their being extracted far too often to do pointless things in the centre of the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/6">My first task as the Member of Parliament for Orpington in 1992 was to open a new police station in the Cray Valley ward, which then had about 20 officers. When the Labour party came to power, I am sorry to say that the station was closed. To be fair, however, although one beat officer covers one area, four or five cover another part, so there are probably about six or seven officers in all. The area is important, because there is a large Traveller population&mdash;the biggest in the country&mdash;and there are associated problems, as well as those that are not at all associated. People remember what happened to that police station because it happened only four or five years ago. They remember the number of officers that were there then and know how many are there today.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/7">However, I want to encourage the Minister because I am not entirely condemnatory of there not being enough police. A police station in Biggin Hill, which is rather isolated and separate from the rest of my constituency, was closed under her Government. People were very upset about that and I held large meetings two years ago in Biggin Hill about antisocial behaviour at which all the usual complaints were raised. However, action was taken in partnership between Bromley council and the Metropolitan Police Authority, and there are now two regular beat officers and four PCSOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/8">So, six people look after the ward of Biggin Hill. I am glad to say, and the Minister will be pleased to hear, that over the past 18 months there has been a total change in the atmosphere because there are now six instead of one. Even though we still do not have a police station, the local authority is talking about opening a shop with multi-service provisions, which is definitely a step forward. I assure the Minister that although there are glaring examples of neighbourhood policing not working because there are not enough police, such as in Cray Valley, it clearly does work when there are enough policemen on the beat, as in Biggin Hill.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/9">I agree with the hon. Member for Nottingham, North that it is important that policemen become as familiar to local people as the local GPs and teachers. It may be that instead of there being one person, there are half a dozen people whom it is necessary to name in any particular ward. My constituency is a bite-size area for this concept. There are eight wards. Six or seven policemen in each ward, which is the ultimate intention, would make a huge difference. That is the case in only one ward. The others have to make do with one policeman, which is simply not enough. Local police officers can direct resources to an area, but other areas will remain uncovered and problems emerge, so they are fighting a losing battle.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/10">The sine qua non of neighbourhood policing is that there are enough police officers on the ground to enforce it properly. I understand that the provision of the number of police in a London borough such as Bromley is the responsibility of the Metropolitan Police Authority rather than the Minister. One reason I am here today is that decisions will be announced at the end of this month about the new resource allocation formula for the whole of London. Antisocial behaviour, and everything associated with it, is as evident a problem in the leafy suburbs, such as Bromley, as it is in inner London and other inner-city areas. It is just as big an aggravation and as many people's lives can be made miserable by such everyday occurrences as in inner-city areas. Attention must be paid to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/11">Bromley, which is the largest borough of London in population and size&mdash;my constituency is the biggest in London&mdash;has 150 fewer policemen than Lewisham and Croydon. Ironically, a constituent in Biggin Hill stood up at one of the meetings to which I referred and said that he felt safer in Lewisham than in Bromley, because in Catford, where he lived previously, he could see policemen on the beat, whereas he never saw them in Bromley until the recent change. I draw to the Minister's attention, and through her to the attention of the Metropolitan Police Authority, the fact that the leafy suburbs, particular Bromley, are not getting a fair deal under the current allocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/12">People are much helped if they have the mobile phone number of their local beat officer. Beat officers who give them out are very popular. They may be in demand and inconvenienced by their mobile phone ringing, but in the case of a local hot spot it can be extremely helpful for people to have someone that they can get hold of immediately.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/13">Another problem in the borough of Bromley, as I am sure the Minister is aware, is that the police force has the worst response rate in London. That is partly due to the size of the borough, and the few police cannot respond in time, but there is also a big communication problem in London. Changes are being made to how responses are handled, but it is so far leading to a deterioration of the situation. There are great concerns, not only about the number of police visible on the beat, but about the response times to people making emergency 999 calls. They are real problems in London, although I know that the Minister is not responding to London issues directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/14">Finally, I want to mention two rather more futuristic points. First, I have concentrated on the need for more visible police on the streets, because that is fundamental. However, there also needs to be a change in the culture of the police force. In recent years, there has been an emphasis on promotion in the police force based on specialisation. Everyone wants to get off the beat and into a specialised remit, believing that that is the way to promotion within the force. On the contrary, I think that we need to go back to a generalist police force with people who are multi-tasked, and who can understand and respond to lots of different situations. In New York, for example, that was done by making the detectives responsible to the precinct captains. That was a huge demotion for the detectives and they hated it, but it meant, all of a sudden, that everybody wanted to be the person who was top dog&mdash;the precinct captain&mdash;and for their area to be the best policed neighbourhood in New York. That directed the competition in the right way and we know what results were achieved there. The Minister ought to pay some attention to that issue. It is a long-running one, which cannot be solved overnight, so perhaps it is not for her but for a future Minister. None the less, it needs attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/15">Secondly, I strongly agree with the hon. Member for Nottingham, North about devolving responsibility. How far can we take localisation? The fact is that the police will pay more attention to local needs if they have to be responsive to local people. In my case, Bromley police are responsible to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, who is in turn responsible to the Minister. They are therefore looking upwards all the time instead of downwards to the needs of their local areas. At the moment, there are too many central initiatives&mdash;they are undoubtedly relevant to some areas, but clearly not to every area&mdash;with targeted funding, which cannot be touched, and which therefore means little in terms of the money that is available to a local commander to deal with his general range of problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/16">The balance between centralisation and localisation needs shifting sensitively and sensibly towards more localisation. I fully accept that that cannot be done overnight, and consequences would flow from it, such as in local authority funding. At present, roughly 75 per cent. of police funds come from central Government and 25 per cent. from local authorities. Clearly, while that is so, central Government will want a big say in how police forces use the money that they provide, so perhaps there will have to be some consequential long-term change in the funding. I accept that that is a long-term problem, but until we grasp it, we will not get the localised emphasis that is more relevant in this century.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/17">I welcome the Minister to her job, but we need far more resources and a long-term view of the nature of policing.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.1/1">I apologise to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for not being present throughout the whole of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/695" name="Graham Allen">the speech of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase>. However, he was kind enough to let me have a copy of his speech, so although I was not here, I am aware of what he had prepared to say.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.116.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/853" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="116"  time="014:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h03.htm#50112h03_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.116.2/1">I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, although that is not the same as hearing it live.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/2">The starting point to any debate on policing in London is the great success that the London Mayor has had in increasing police numbers to record levels. We now have 30,000 police in London, and the training school, which is in my constituency at Hendon, is bursting at the seams and cannot take any more. As the numbers go up, a tension is created between the number of police devoted to the safer neighbourhoods programme and the number allocated to core policing, an issue to which I shall return.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/3">The most common concerns identified by the public are what, euphemistically and wrongly, used to be called low-level crime. In fact, they are high-profile crimes that impact on all our communities at all levels. The public are right when they complain about youth crime, antisocial behaviour, irresponsible drivers, graffiti, drug use and drug dealing and so on. The safer neighbourhoods programme in London is making a major contribution to tackling them. It is important to realise that the teams are ring-fenced, so they are not affected by aid extraction. That is a particular problem in London, because people are sent to central London to police demonstrations or to deal with terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/4">There is no doubt that the programme has significantly reduced crime and the fear of crime. In London, the safer neighbourhoods teams have encouraged increased confidence in policing. In the first quarter during which we had them, there were 25 per cent. more calls to police in safer neighbourhoods areas. They are also having a positive impact on community cohesion. Since roll-out began, the teams have hosted more than 232 public meetings with nearly 6,000 attendants, of whom 20 per cent. were from minority communities. In safer neighbourhoods areas, robbery was reduced by 40 per cent. and criminal damage by 4 per cent. between 2003 and 2004&mdash;greater reductions than occurred in areas that did not have such teams.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/5">Compared with the police service as a whole in London, safer neighbourhoods teams better reflect the communities that they serve. Women make up 23 per cent. of their members and people from minority backgrounds comprise 21 per cent. A work force who reflect the diversity of London inspire more confidence and trust in the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/6">I have two safer neighbourhoods teams in my constituency, and I pay tribute to my borough commander, Chief Superintendent Ricketts, and his officers and staff, who have had great success. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, spoke about the importance of stability at police constable level. I want to bring to colleagues' attention the need for stability at leadership level. Superintendent Ricketts is the fourth commander in my borough in the almost eight years that I have been a Member of Parliament. If local policing is to develop properly, we have to have the stability that has so far been lacking. It might be that two of the superintendent's predecessors were on the rapid promotion track, but I am pleased that Mr. Ricketts sees this as his last posting, of which he wants to make a real success, and that he is not keen for promotion. I hope that the Met will leave him be and let him get on with the job, and that the same will apply to the rest of his staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/7">Where we have teams in Barnet, crime has reduced by 17 per cent. There has been joint working with the community in cleaning up graffiti and maintaining the clean-up. One tagger did return, but he was identified and arrested, and there have been few incidents since. There has been greater focus on local intelligence and local criminals, leading to effective enforcement against low-level crime, which affects quality of life. There has been a 45 per cent. reduction in the number of abandoned vehicles, and we have enhanced community cohesion. The officers are familiar and available, with the dedicated mobile telephone number of which we heard earlier. Direct working protocols exist between the police and the local authority on graffiti, abandoned vehicles and antisocial behaviour. Community advisory panels are focusing police activity and providing meaningful local oversight and feedback. Officers are tackling the issues that concern the local population.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/8">There has been a 30 per cent. reduction in antisocial behaviour calls where there are safer neighbourhoods teams, and we have used PCSOs by focusing on their strengths. Intelligence has led to the arrest of local drug dealers on Grahame Park estate in Colindale&mdash;that information would not have been given had the individuals not had confidence in their teams, and the arrests would not have been made. Paradoxically, there has also been an increase in allegations of harassment and minor assault. Perhaps that, too, shows an increased confidence in the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/9">There are problems with the teams; it is not all good news. One of my main complaints concerns how Conservative-controlled Barnet council has significantly downgraded its neighbourhood warden service. That has reduced some of the impact of the teams. Ward boundaries are too clumsy a model, and I shall return to that. Giving Hendon the same resources as inner-London boroughs is illogical and the roll-out has led to displacement issues, raising questions about core policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/10">Let me deal with ward boundaries. The problem can be illustrated by the proposal for a team to come to West Hendon in my constituency. West Hendon includes Brent Cross, which distorts the crime figures, but immediately next to West Hendon is Hendon Central, and near the tube station and the shopping area is a major crime hot-spot. We had to get special consent, by my raising the matter with Mr. Livingstone, who agreed to use the Brent Cross police team as part of the safer neighbourhoods area team and to expand over the frontier to include Hendon Central. That was an imaginative way to break through the ring-fenced boundary, which had the potential to cause obstruction in the setting up of teams.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/11">It is not fair that we should have a &quot;one size fits all&quot; system, with one team per ward irrespective of the size of the ward. We also suffer a degree of discrimination in connection with the cost of policing in London&mdash;a matter that I pursued with my hon. Friend the Minister in a recent parliamentary question. The cost of PCSOs in London does not reflect the fact that it is rather more expensive to employ them in London than in the rest of the country. That discriminates against us.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/12">The biggest unfairness, however, is seen when one considers the size of wards in inner London compared with those in outer London. For example, the average population of the wards in Barnet is 50 per cent. higher than the average for Kensington and Chelsea. The largest is twice the size, and the smallest is twice the size, but they have the same size of team. The figures for average square mileage are even worse; the wards in Barnet are seven times larger than those in Kensington and Chelsea. The smallest ward in Barnet, Burnt Oak, is double the size of the largest in Kensington and Chelsea, and the largest ward in my constituency, Mill Hill, is more than nine times that of the largest in Kensington and Chelsea.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/13">It is not practical for the same number of officers to police a much larger population and a much larger area. We have to find a way of gearing the size of team to reflect demand. It is all very well to say that we want visible policing, but that number of police vanish in such large wards, whereas Kensington and Chelsea seems to have a copper on virtually every street corner. Such a distribution is not fair or equitable. That is not only a matter for my hon. Friend the Minister, of course; it involves how the Metropolitan police distributes its resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/14">We also need to consider the impact of the new teams on core policing. The safer neighbourhoods teams draw on the new officers, but that has effectively resulted in far fewer of them being allocated to core policing. That happens irrespective of the capital city function, which is a bone of contention between the Met and the Government, as 10 per cent. of our officers&mdash;as many as 3,000 at a time&mdash;are being diverted to anti-terrorism duties. That is a major drain on the Met, but we are not properly reimbursed, either as London taxpayers or as a London police service, for the extra work, which is not properly recognised.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/15">If one looks at the geographical policing areas, one sees that Barnet is the fourth largest in area and the second largest in population. Again, the problem is well illustrated by comparing Barnet with Kensington and Chelsea. Barnet has nearly 19,000 reported crimes compared with just over 14,000 in Kensington and Chelsea. However, we have only 544 officers compared with 553, and we have 37 PCSOs compared with 55. Barnet is 34.5 square miles compared with just over 6 square miles in K and C, and our population of 320,000 is virtually double that in Kensington and Chelsea of 173,000, yet we have far fewer resources to tackle the job.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/16">Those differences are reflected in some crime figures. Our crime figures in Barnet are mixed. Yes, there are some good signs, but some figures show that we are not doing as well as we could. That comes down to insufficient officers. Barnet is grouped by the Home Office as part of the 3B family group, but the amount of crime is double that. For example, we have almost twice the crime of our sister boroughs of Richmond, Kingston, Merton and Harrow, which are in the same group.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/17">Looking at the volume of crime, it can be seen that Barnet is one of the highest contributors, with crime levels that match those of Newham, Haringey, Brent, Islington and Hackney. We have significant crime levels. As for the number of crimes committed per police officer&mdash;I do not mean that the police have committed the crimes&mdash;we have the worst ratio in London. I raised that matter with my hon. Friend the Minister in a parliamentary question, and she will probably recognise the answer. Barnet has 27.6 crimes per police officer; the average for outer London is 21, and only 17.5 for England and Wales. That major problem is caused by a lack of recognition of the impact of such demand on core policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/18">It is important that the resource allocation formula should reflect some demands of outer London. We feel neglected due to how the formula was gerrymandered by the commissioner's discretion the last time around. I argued about that at great length with senior officers of the Met. We have significant problems. In Barnet and other outer-London boroughs, we now have many inner-London problems in our town centres. Those are not reflected in the unfair way that the commissioner and the Met have allocated resources to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/19">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on her drive and enthusiasm for the new policy, but ask that we try to tackle some of its by-products for core policing.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.0/1">In the little time remaining I shall quickly cover a small number of points. I greatly value <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/695" name="Graham Allen">the opportunity that my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> has given us to debate this subject&mdash;it was a complete surprise to me, and a very pleasant one.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/2">I want first to mention the work of South Derbyshire's crime and disorder reduction partnership, because I admire the quality of its work, but I am also slightly concerned about the approach that is being taken towards supporting partnerships. The work of the partnership in South Derbyshire has produced a range of highly effective innovations, which have helped to reduce crime and the fear of crime substantially&mdash;in particular the initiative on securing homes where there have been burglaries. Funds have been provided. I think that we all know that a place that has been burgled before is the No. 1 target for another burglary in due course. The work was so successful in the pilot period that in every case there was no repeat burglary. That is a tremendous success for the scheme; the people concerned are often elderly and it gave them great reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/3">Building on that work, the partnership has funded a joiner and a van. The joiner tells me that the job is the best one that he has ever had&mdash;driving round to do the necessary work in a designated and clearly identified vehicle, uniformed, and giving all the reassurance of a proper quality service. Support has also been given to developing skateboard parks in the area, to provide useful and fun diversions for younger people. That has been greatly appreciated. Obviously, the partnership is not the only funder of the projects, but, nevertheless it is a significant contributor in ideas and money.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/4">The partnership's work on tackling drugs is a highly successful initiative, which has pulled in a number of repeat offenders in parts of my constituency&mdash;particularly Newhall. That has dramatically reduced crime in that part of South Derbyshire. An officer is now dedicated to pursuing ASBOs. We are not as quick on the draw as some areas, and I welcome that. I prefer ASBOs to be a later resort rather than the first action that one would take to deal with someone who is not conforming in the neighbourhood.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/5">The local force has recently been given funding for community support officers. South Derbyshire will get five. Derbyshire has not been the first to bid for those. The emphasis in Derbyshire has been on building the uniformed force and particularly on strengthening the role of specials. However, those CSOs will be extremely valuable in South Derbyshire and I look forward to their arrival.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/6">We have a rural policing unit because of the rural nature of the area. The difficulties of targeted funding have been mentioned, but it is critical that targeted funding is retained to support a unit of that kind. It is extremely helpful, particularly in dealing with farm-based crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/7">I congratulate Tony Hurrell, who is the commander for the division covering my constituency and a constituent of mine. It is a reflection of his commitment to the area that he is also the leader of the local strategic partnership. He sets a high example of commitment to his community and the constituency. The officers whom he appoints to serve the various South Derbyshire sections also reflect similar qualities.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/8">I have three brief action points to outline, the first of which repeats the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North about parenting. In a meeting that I held on the Goseley estate in Hartshorne, residents surprisingly placed greater emphasis on the need to strengthen parenting and to get across the message of raising parenting standards than on visible policing and several other initiatives that one might have thought would be first in their minds, so that is a key area.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/9">Secondly, it should be possible to give some financial rewards to specials. I have suggested in correspondence with the Home Office the possibility of parish councils in my area providing an additional bounty to recruit specials in their parish to provide that uniformed presence. I would like a more permissive approach to that. I also emphasise the importance of quality local partnerships. I have one, and I recognise that I am lucky. Other people have told me that their partnerships do not work very effectively. Mine does, and I want to ensure that it retains the commitment, support and funding that it has enjoyed until now.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/10">I thank hon. Members for the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.121.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1136" speakername="Mark Oaten" colnum="121"  time="015:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h03.htm#50112h03_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.121.0/1">I am glad that I could not receive the fax of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/695" name="Graham Allen">the speech given by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> but I was in the Chamber to hear it&mdash;the reverse experience of the Conservative spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" name="Andrew Mitchell">the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>. It was an excellent speech and I did not disagree with a single word.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/2">Quite a lot of cross-party consensus is emerging on many policing issues, and the hon. Member for Nottingham, North gave an extremely good and informed analysis of an ideal model of neighbourhood policing. The way in which he went through the various components was helpful. I shall refer to some of those issues and discuss some of the ways in which his ideas could be developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/3">The hon. Gentleman's first point is essential. It is key that the beat officer must have a clear geographical area to cover. The situation that he described in Nottingham, where he can flick to the back of his diary and see the mobile phone numbers for 22 different officers, is probably the ideal. In my experience, however, it is not always easy to do that. It can be difficult to have that cover in all geographical areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/973" name="John Horam">The hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam)</phrase> made the point that cover is very patchy. In some areas there is cover, in others there is a difficulty with cover. I take his point about officers who would usually take part in that work being drawn into other activities, and we must watch out for that, although I disagree that their defending us in this place is pointless. But there is a problem, particularly in London, with police officers continually being drawn into big high-profile events and coming under other pressures.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/5">As has been said, continuity is essential. Again, my experience is that just when one gets someone who understands the area and gets to know the head teachers and community leaders, they leave, and all that good work is undermined. Certainly in the seven or eight years in which I have been a Member of Parliament, I have forgotten the names of individuals because they move so fast. I was therefore very interested in the example of the contracts in Holland and the ways in which the Government can bind in those individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/6">Another point made by the hon. Member for Orpington is that the police should regard this as an important career move and not as a stepping stone to a greater role and a better job. That would help to achieve continuity. I was very taken with the idea of including with council tax bills information about how to contact individual police officers. That is a very good idea, and what better way of allowing people who get fed up with having to pay their council tax bills at least to see a benefit in return for the money for which they are being asked?</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/7">There is also consensus on the use of community support officers. I have had my concerns about CSOs, but I recognise that they have an important role to play. I was encouraged to hear the hon. Member for Nottingham, North sharing my concern about the cautious approach that we take to tagging on powers for CSOs. I could not agree more that CSOs are additional to, and not a replacement for, fully trained police officers. We must be cautious and careful as we tag on more powers to CSOs. We must ensure that they are properly trained to understand how to use those powers and that they fall into line with the various Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 guidelines. They are being asked to do things that have enormous consequences, and ensuring that they have the necessary training is critical, but they do increase visibility&mdash;the jacket argument. Another way of considering the jacket argument and visibility is by asking some of our more senior police officers, even those involved in CID and undercover work, to be jacketed up if possible when they are not doing sensitive work. That would increase visibility at higher levels of the police. Often, there are many more police officers around in the streets than people think. Why are we not making them more visible when they are not doing sensitive work?</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/8">The hon. Member for Nottingham, North raised the importance of a partnership and of the local authority being involved at the same point. That was picked up on by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/853" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>, who talked about the great successes that have been achieved by partnership in his area, such as with the safer neighbourhood teams. He gave a long list of successes, including on graffiti, that have resulted from that project, and it seems that good work is being done, but he also gave a long list of some financial constraints that apply. People are obviously doing a good job, given those constraints.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/9">We must think much more creatively about engaging the public, because they are part of the list of those involved in the partnership. My party has suggested the concept of community justice panels, which I think, in a strange sort of way, the Government are now pushing forward. The panels involve letting the community have a greater say in what the punishment should be in non-serious cases in which a crime has been committed against the community. The panels sit down and discuss with the offender what they will do to put things right in the community. At its rawest, that is engaging the public and bringing them into the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/10">At a different level, building up the role of neighbourhood watch and perhaps modernising how it operates could be a useful tool in the process. I am not sure why the Government got themselves into a row last year with neighbourhood watch, but there is a need to build bridges with the National Neighbourhood Watch Association, which felt bruised and unloved by the Government when the debate over funding of how it operates centrally took place. I understand that many of the concerns have been resolved, but it would be useful if the Minister clarified where we are on neighbourhood watch.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/11">As the debate progressed, we got on to the issue of ASBOs and at what point in the process it is useful to put in place such a punishment. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North used a phrase that I quite like. We do not want to get too involved in what I think he described as policy smacking.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.122.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1136" speakername="Mark Oaten" colnum="122"  time="015:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h03.htm#50112h03_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.122.1/1">I would use the phrase with either word; it works with both. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1283" name="Mark Todd">The hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase> also touched on ASBOs, saying that he hoped that they would come at the end rather than the start of the process. The Minister will tease me about this endlessly, but I have come to the view that there is a useful role for ASBOs. That said, I share the hon. Gentleman's concerns that they should either be a last resort or be matched with something else. I have described such a scheme as ASBOs-plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/2">The contributions of the hon. Members for Nottingham, North and for South Derbyshire hinted at the fact that ASBOs alone can be effective in a short-term way, but other measures must be put in place. That is about tackling the underlying causes of behaviour. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North asked questions, but not many answers were given, because we all struggle to come to terms with what the answers are. Why do 12, 13 and 14-year-olds go off the rails? What can we do to try to tackle the problems? The hon. Member for South Derbyshire talked about alternatives&mdash;one of which involved skateboarding&mdash;tackling drug problems, doing things in the community and trying to find ways to get to these individuals early. Again, the youth work that the Government have done in that respect has been good. There have been pilots involving early intervention and identification of youngsters who may end up getting into trouble. I enjoyed my visit to Bristol to see how that work is done. If we can expand it much further and nip things in the bud, before individuals have gone down the track of having problems, that will be very helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/3">I conclude with two thoughts. For me, the most telling thing in the debate has been the request from the hon. Member for Nottingham, North to allow different forms of experimentation up and down the country. That is essential because not every solution will fit every area. My constituency and other constituencies are different, and we need different approaches. If the Government can resist the temptation to impose too many set models and can allow mistakes to take place in certain parts of the country as the price of different experimentation, that will be very worth while.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/4">The matter is complex, and must be seen within the context of police forces having to do things that they did not have to do 15 years ago, because of organised crime, drug problems, binge drinking, internet pornography and complex issues relating to terrorism. This critical matter should be up there with all of them, and I am grateful for the way that the hon. Gentleman set out his thoughts on how neighbourhood policing should play its role.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.123.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" speakername="Andrew Mitchell" colnum="123"  time="015:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h03.htm#50112h03_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.123.0/1">I start by apologising to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and to the Minister for my late arrival. I apologise, too, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/695" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> who, with great courtesy, gave me a copy of his speech. The irony is that while he was delivering it, I was reading it, close to this Chamber. I hope he feels that although he did not have my presence I was with him in spirit.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/2">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate. Neighbourhood policing is a matter about which he has frequently expressed his concern. The hon. Gentleman and I entered the House on the same day in 1987 when he was elected for a central constituency and I for a suburb of Nottingham. I have the greatest possible affection for the city, which is a great place.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/3">In November, the hon. Gentleman secured a debate in which he explained that it was his view that we could</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/4" class="indent">&quot;effectively increase the amount of time that police officers currently spend on the streets by 25 or 30 per cent.&quot;&mdash;<i>[Official Report, Westminster Hall,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-09">9 November 2004</phrase>; Vol. 426, c.   227.]</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/5">On <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase>, he asked a question to the Prime Minister about linking the criminal justice system nationally with local policing and crime reduction initiatives. During a debate on the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill, which is closeted in Committee, where I am leading spokesman for the Opposition, he made it clear that he saw the beat officer as a central pillar of neighbourhood policing in a constituency such as his, where beat officers are not being replaced and vacancies are not being filled.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/6">In another debate, the hon. Gentleman also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The people of Nottinghamshire know that we have a record number of police officers in post in Nottinghamshire, but they also ask, &quot;Where are those police officers?&quot;.&mdash;<i>[Official Report, </i>15 November 2004; Vol. 246, c. 1018.]</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/8">Those are very fair points. I attach particular importance to what the hon. Gentleman says because he has recently been on the police parliamentary scheme, and he knows what he is talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/9">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the five key components of neighbourhood policing and I very much agree with what he said about it. I also agree very much with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1136" name="Mark Oaten">the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten)</phrase> said about the importance of knowing who the beat officer is. I am impressed that he has 22 names to go with the 22 beats in his constituency. That is enormously important and I strongly agree with the proposition that the telephone numbers of the relevant beat officer should go out with the council tax form. That is a very good idea, which I hope the Minister will consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/10">The hon. Member for Nottingham, North paid tribute to the local commanders in his constituency. I, too, pay tribute to Douglas Paxton, a superb policeman, who is chief of police in Sutton Coldfield. He is leaving shortly, although he has been in that post for a decent length of time. In the 18 months after I first became Member of Parliament for Sutton Coldfield, there were three chiefs of police. I complained on behalf of my constituents that that was wrong. I very much support the work that the police in Sutton Coldfield are doing on antisocial behaviour, which has been a common theme in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/11">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the importance of community support officers, but emphasised that they are not a substitute for properly trained policemen and women. I strongly agree with him. Conservative Members believe that there is an important role for CSOs in being visible; the public like them. We are extremely concerned, however, that the Government see them as a substitute for police officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/12">I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that CSOs will be properly evaluated. There has been some evaluation but we want more independent evaluation before what the hon. Member for Winchester referred to as the tag-on of more powers takes place. We will discuss that next Tuesday in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill Committee. It is important that there should be independent evaluation of CSOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/13">The third component is neighbourhood wardens. I was distressed to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/853" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> say that a Conservative council had removed them from his constituency. A Conservative council in Birmingham has just given my constituency two of those wardens, and we are delighted to see them there.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.0/1">The council have not removed them; they have downgraded them by reducing their hours and diluted their effect by expanding their responsibilities, so that they are far less effective than when they were first instituted under the then Labour-controlled councils.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.1/1">I am glad to have put on the record that they have not been removed by a Conservative council.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/2">I strongly agree with the point made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North about the community and neighbourhood watch. I believe that neighbourhood watch is enormously important. I hope that the Minister will be able to say something about neighbourhood watch today that may encourage people who are feeling bruised by what happened last year. I hope that she will feel able to say something to encourage neighbourhood watch, which, in Sutton Coldfield, plays an important part in our deterrence of crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/3">My final point on multi-agency working is to say that I agree with the hon. Members for Nottingham, North and for Winchester on the importance of deterring antisocial behaviour. That is something common to all of us, as has been emphasised by the debate today.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/973" name="John Horam">My hon. Friend the Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam)</phrase> stood up, as ever, for policing in his constituency, and underlined his point by saying that mobile phone numbers are a good way of contacting local beat officers and assimilating local intelligence. He gave some examples from New York, a topic that I also hoped to talk about but may not. He also talked about the importance of a fair deal for the suburbs, on which he made common cause with the hon. Member for Hendon, and about the fact that antisocial behaviour is a big problem in his constituency, as it is in mine. He asked several questions, to which I look forward to hearing the Minister's answers.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/5">The hon. Member for Hendon agreed on the point about a fair deal for the suburbs, and he also asked a number of questions. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1283" name="Mark Todd">The hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase> talked, with some reservations, about ASBOs and about the importance of the zero-tolerance approach to crime locally, with which I strongly agree. He also made an important point about the use of specials&mdash;indeed, he adopted a Conservative proposal to give a bounty to special constables. The number of specials has declined significantly under this Government&mdash;by some 45 per cent. since 1997. I hope that the Minister will feel able to comment on the importance of specials and what she and her colleagues intend to do to promote them.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/6">Finally, I should like to emphasise the point made by the Liberal spokesman, the hon. Member for Winchester: that in local policing we must avoid top-down set models, which were a serious error of judgment by the former Home Secretary. We must ensure that local solutions are used to deal with local problems. I do not necessarily expect the Minister to agree with me and the hon. Gentleman, but I hope that she will take that point on board, because it will lead to much better neighbourhood policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/7">I again congratulate the hon. Member for Nottingham, North&mdash;my former parliamentary near neighbour&mdash;on securing the debate and on the consistent theme that he has brought to his comments in the House on neighbourhood policing. It is greatly to be welcomed that there now appears to be a degree of cross-party agreement on how the matter should be taken forward.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.126.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/737" speakername="Hazel Blears" speakeroffice="The Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety"  colnum="126"  time="015:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h03.htm#50112h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.126.0/1">I am delighted to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/695" name="Graham Allen">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing the debate. This is an appropriate time to hold it. My hon. Friend may not know it, but the first ever national conference on citizen-focused policing is being held today; there are hundreds of police officers just down the road thinking about and working on the practical ways in which they can involve their communities to ensure not only that we have the reassurance from neighbourhood policing but, crucially, that that policing is hard edged and problem solving, using forensics and intelligence. Neighbourhood policing should not be simply a nice warm, woolly, fuzzy feeling about giving people reassurance; it should be at the heart of a modern approach to problems that face us in the 21st century. As my hon. Friend said, it should not hark back nostalgically to the 1950s either. He is a member of the police parliamentary scheme, and I think that that has given him a great deal of practical insight into the problems that our police services face on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/2">I am happy to join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/808" name="Vernon Coaker">my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase>, who is here today. He has been a stalwart and active voice in ensuring that we drive policy to meet the needs of local communities, and that has been particularly true in his community in Nottingham. He was certainly very influential in our recent decision to introduce fixed-penalty notices for under-16s. I am delighted that we are now piloting the scheme in Nottinghamshire and I am looking forward to the results of that pilot. My hon. Friend has been very supportive, as has <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/957" name="John Heppell">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell)</phrase>, who, again, is absolutely focused on the issues of policing in his community.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/3">It is fair to say that had we been discussing these issues a year or 18 months ago, the performance of the Nottinghamshire force would have been a cause for concern. It is partly due to the contribution of the local Members of Parliament, who have helped to support the force, that we are now seeing some pretty good performance in Nottinghamshire in crime reduction and in driving up the sanction detection rate. There is still more work to do, but policing in that community is now much better.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/4">I am also happy to join my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North in welcoming the &quot;Respect for Nottingham&quot; campaign undertaken by the city council. It shows the power of partnership, and ever since I took on my current responsibilities I have been saying that policing and community safety are not simply matters for the police service. We must also involve local councils and the health service, which can help to tackle some drug problems that we face. Crucially, we must think about education, to ensure that we get to the causes of problems and achieve solutions for the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/5">It would be remiss of me not to remind hon. Members that we have made much progress. We are not starting from scratch; we have nearly 140,000 police officers&mdash; record numbers&mdash;on the ground. I am happy to give a reassurance yet again, although I must have done this a dozen times, that we see community support officers as an addition to those record numbers of police officers. They are complementing the skills of police constables and are an integral part of the team approach to policing&mdash;although, again, that approach is about not only police officers and CSOs, but wardens and, increasingly, accredited members of the security industry, who are being given limited powers and can be part of the extended police family. That really is the future for policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/6">I am glad that there is a degree of consensus among hon. Members present. Of course, it would be churlish of me to say that everyone now supports the Government's policy, but I genuinely feel that many of the things that the hon. Members for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) and for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell) mentioned are happening and have been happening under this Government for several years now. They have not started happening just recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/7">In dealing with some issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North raised, perhaps I can give him a little reassurance. First, he and several other hon. Members raised the issue of specials, and I regard them as a very important part of our extended police family. Although their numbers have fallen in recent years, that is partly because many of them have become members of the regular police force. We have been expanding police force numbers, so specials have had the opportunity to be recruited and many of them have come through in that way. Furthermore, some have become CSOs, which is another route to the force. However, we had a major national recruitment campaign last year, with television advertising, and have received 4,000 applications as a result. Those applicants are now going through the system, and, in many force areas, the number of special constables is starting to rise for the first time in many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/8">As part of the shopwatch scheme, which is now operating in London, we are getting people who work on retail premises&mdash;in Woolworths, Dixons, Marks and Spencer and Sainsbury&mdash;to train as special constables. They have been given powers and now patrol retail areas, and shoplifting in those areas is down by about 40 per cent. It makes good business sense to involve people from the local community. We also have specials, some with specialist IT skills, helping us with fraud investigations. That is a very different way of looking at the special constable resource.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/9">I think that there are four schemes across the country in which specials are allowed to be paid, and they receive &pound;1,000 a year. Interestingly, when consulted, half the specials said that they would welcome a small payment, but half said that they were volunteers and wanted to stay volunteers. The idea was floated that rather than paying them they could get a discount on their council tax. That is interesting, because it would establish a connection with what they are doing for their local community. Such schemes suggest ways in which we can think a little more creatively about rewarding people who want to come forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/10">I am delighted that the two pilot schemes on the neighbourhood policing model are being carried out in Nottingham. The proposal to make special priority payments is a matter for the chief constable in the general scheme agreed through the Home Office. In many areas, beat officers get the special priority payments. That is a way of saying that they are a valuable part of the service. Everything that we are doing in the performance management regime to value neighbourhood policing, customer satisfaction and public confidence sends an important message to the service that that is not the soft end of policing. It is right at the heart of policing, and performance will be measured on how good neighbourhood policing is. That is how we will get the levers to drive the process forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/11">I want to make it clear that the approach to neighbourhood policing is not about a &quot;one size fits all&quot; model. Communities are different. Inner cities are different from market towns; they share some problems of antisocial behaviour, as some hon. Members have said, but they are different places to police. Large rural areas with small concentrations of population are also different. Some areas may have a different team make-up from others. In some areas, a beat team might be predominately community support officers, perhaps led and managed by a PC. In other areas, with tough, serious crime, there may well be a predominance of fully warranted police officers, because that is what is needed&mdash;some investigators. The idea is to get the public to identify the problems and to shape our resources, so that the right people with the right skills are in the right place at the right time. That is neighbourhood policing in a modern framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/12">Several Members mentioned the issue of continuity. That is very important. In north Wales, which I visited recently, a system has been developed whereby people give a three-year commitment&mdash;rather than the five-year commitment in the Netherlands referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North&mdash;to be in that area, to do the neighbourhood policing and    to build the necessary relationships. After all,    neighbourhood policing is about building relationships. In return, the police force tells those people that it will be of benefit to their careers. There is proper agreement between the police officer, the police force and the local community; there is something in it for everyone. A beat contract and issues with the local community are also agreed, and the police officer reports back monthly on what they have done and, sometimes, on what they have not been able to do and what they will carry on trying to tackle. It is a long-lasting, continuous relationship.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/13">I entirely take <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/853" name="Andrew Dismore">the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> about continuity at basic command unit level and at leadership level. That continuity cannot just be on the beat; it has to be throughout the service. Inevitably, getting the best people into the right jobs will sometimes be a problem. My hon. Friend made some important points about the rigidity of the model used in the London area. I have no doubt that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner will carefully study my hon. Friend's well made points. We need to ensure that there is flexibility and that we have the right mix in relation to the needs of the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/14"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/973" name="John Horam">The hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam)</phrase> said that his area needs more police officers. As I understand it, in the past 18 months there has been an increase of 42 in the number of police officers in Bromley, from 417 to 459. Like everywhere else in the country, that area has more police officers under this Government. I remind him of that. He welcomed the idea of a one-stop shop, although bricks and mortar&mdash;police stations&mdash;do not necessarily lead to the best policing. We have to get the people into the community to do the work. I am grateful for his support for what is happening in Biggin Hill.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/15"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1283" name="Mark Todd">My hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase> highlighted the excellent work going on in his community. The innovation around repeat burglary victims is good. Emphasis on parenting and the need to get to the causes of antisocial behaviour are absolutely key, as he said. I like to characterise that as trying to bring decency back into our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/16">Today's debate has been excellent. We need local solutions for local problems, but I have one caveat. The centre has a role to play, and so does target setting, because of equity and ensuring that the poorest communities in this country do not always get the poorest services. I am afraid that that did happen in the past, so we need a central framework with as much local innovation and diversity as possible. I do not think that those things are mutually exclusive; good government is about having some drive from the centre, but drawing in the innovation, enterprise and skills from the local area. That blend is what leads to long term sustainable success.</p>

	Colne to Skipton Railway Line
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.130.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1168" speakername="Gordon Prentice" colnum="130"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h04.htm#50112h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.130.1/1">I welcome this opportunity to raise the issue of reopening a disused and dismantled railway in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/2">Many people&mdash;not just in Pendle but across the region, and in North Yorkshire next door&mdash;see the advantages in having this railway reopened. Getting a railway reopened, however, is a bit like pushing a boulder uphill. It is a never-ending task. The Countryside Agency produced a rail reopening toolkit in October last year, which claims to be a complete guide to the process of reopening a disused railway. It urges those who want a railway reopened to be rational and not fanatical. I will attempt to be rational this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/3">The Colne to Skipton railway opened in the autumn of 1848 and closed in January 1970. It is an 11.5 mile stretch running through very attractive countryside. There was a spur, which closed in 1965, from Kelbrook to Barnoldswick&mdash;the town where I live&mdash;but the link from Colne to Skipton is the key. After 30 years the track bed is still in good condition and if the link were reinstated it would open up east Lancashire to the prosperous market town of Skipton, over the border in North Yorkshire, and to the major commercial centres of Leeds, Bradford and other conurbations in Yorkshire. At the moment a train journey from Preston, on the west coast main line, to Skipton is a nightmare. It involves changing trains&mdash;sometimes twice&mdash;over a convoluted, dog-legged route with a travel time of at least two hours, and often considerably more.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/4">Restoring the link, and I hope electrifying it in future, would open up a whole range of possibilities. A link to Skipton would give people from east Lancashire access to the Settle&ndash;Carlisle line and would in due course allow trains from east Lancashire to run into the national park almost to Grassington, the capital of lower Wharfedale, with its stunning countryside. That countryside is just sitting there, out of bounds to so many people in my constituency who do not have cars and who cannot get up there.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that with ageing populations in the whole of east Lancashire, many people would be able to access not just east Lancashire but parts of the much wider area to which he refers? People in our patches are quite rightly both rational and fanatical about reopening this line.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.3/1">Indeed, and I agree with the hon. Gentleman, whose constituency is adjacent to mine. The Clitheroe&ndash;Blackburn line is a great success, with many people using it. There is a line from Skipton up almost to Threshfield, a couple of miles away from Grassington. It stops at the Tilcon quarry, but it is perfectly possible for that line to be opened up to passenger traffic in due course. That is what the Yorkshire Dales national park authority wants. We want to get people out of the conurbations for their leisure and recreation, into the glorious countryside of the national park.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.130.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/835" speakername="David Curry" colnum="130"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h04.htm#50112h04_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.130.4/1">I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman on that point, although an enormous amount of heavy investment in signalling would have to be done to expand the capacity of that line. Railtrack would have to give it slightly higher priority than it does at the moment. Does he not agree that his constituency and mine have been unified economically for a long time? The textile industry embraced both the Yorkshire and Lancashire side of the chain and the Aire valley is, in many ways, the backbone of that industry. The lines of communication and the demand for commuting down that valley would serve the eastern part of Lancashire and my constituency in Yorkshire.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-01-12a.131.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1168" speakername="Gordon Prentice" colnum="131"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/vo050112/halltext/50112h04.htm#50112h04_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.131.0/1">I agree with every word of that. Of course, on reinstating the line and bringing it up to standard, everything comes with a price tag. I shall deal with that in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/2">There are proposals to build a road&mdash;the so-called A56 village bypass&mdash;along the line of the old track bed. That has been on the cards for years and has been championed vocally by the local Liberal Democrats. However, we cannot endlessly construct roads and build our way out of congestion by urbanising tranquil rural and semi-rural areas. Roads bring pollution and noise and are not always the answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/3">At this point, let me introduce SELRAP&mdash;the Skipton-East Lancashire Rail Action Partnership&mdash;a campaign group formed just a few years ago in 2001 to work for the reinstatement of the railway. It has, through its Herculean efforts, had a huge influence on shaping public opinion. I pay tribute to a number of people involved in that campaign, including Steve Broadbent, Andy Shackleton, David Magnall, Steve Arnold and many others who work tirelessly night and day to build an ever-growing coalition of support.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/4">My colleagues <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/835" name="David Curry">here today&mdash;the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/878" name="Nigel Evans">the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase>&mdash;are patrons of SELRAP, as am I. My Conservative opponent at the next general election, Jane Ellison, enthusiastically supports SELRAP and has spoken publicly about the benefits of bringing back the railway. That is good. Members of the European Parliament, Diana Wallis and Chris Davies, have spoken in support, as has Virgin Rail. One of the major employers in Skipton and Ripon&mdash;the Skipton building society&mdash;has been vocal in its support.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/5">Brian Simpson, the director of the north-west rail campaign, was in touch with me earlier today. That campaign represents the Greater Manchester passenger transport executive, Merseytravel, Greater Manchester chamber of commerce, Manchester airport and lots of local authorities, so it is a heavyweight organisation. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The north-west rail campaign would certainly support the reinstatement&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/7">of the line,</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/8" class="indent">&quot;provided, of course, that a robust case can be put forward that would show that the line could act as a tool for economic regeneration, environmental protection and tourism development.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/9">We can show that.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/10">North Yorkshire county council is fully signed up. Craven district council in North Yorkshire&mdash;adjacent to my Pendle constituency&mdash;wants the railway back and Lancashire county council has moved its position over recent years and has, through its structure plan, kept the railway option alive. People on the ground, including Kelbrook and Sough parish council, support the idea, and when SELRAP canvassed public opinion in the area last year, 87 per cent. of local people who responded said that they were likely or very likely to use a reinstated railway.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/11">So what is the problem? The only fly in the ointment is the local Liberal Democrats who run Pendle borough council. Under pressure, they agreed that the track bed should be protected, but they show no enthusiasm for the project to bring back the railway, which is tragic. The leader of Pendle borough council, Alan Davies, said last year that the campaign to reinstate the line was a &quot;pipe dream&quot;. He stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The railway line is not coming back on that track bed and as soon as we accept that as a fact we can get on and relieve the real problems.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/13">By that, he meant building yet another road.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/14">The Liberal Democrats exasperate me. They are like a franchise operation&mdash;they use a national logo, but on local policies they pick and mix. Nationally, the party would not recognise what Liberal Democrats say locally, as they resist bringing back the railway. Councillor Tony Greaves, Alan Davies's colleague and now also a member of the House of Lords, described the bid to bring back the railway as a &quot;non-starter&quot;. Only a few weeks ago he told my local paper, the <i>Colne Times</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/15" class="indent">&quot;It is disappointing that people have put a lot of time into pushing for the re-opening of the link with Skipton&mdash;a non-starter&mdash;while the line from Colne to Gannow is under threat.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/16">Lord Greaves went on to tell the <i>Lancashire Evening Telegraph </i>on <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/17" class="indent">&quot;Gordon Prentice's Government&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/18">that has a certain ring to it&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/19" class="indent">&quot;is threatening a large number of branch lines with closure. Perhaps he should concentrate on that.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/20">The situation is changing even as I speak. The Railways Bill is before Parliament, the Strategic Rail Authority is being wound up and the responsibility for the shape of the network is to fall on central Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/21">I was interested in what the Minister said yesterday in the debate on community railways. We need to involve and empower local communities, to help them get the rail services that they need. I reflected on the issue after listening to the debate and, with the new proposals emerging, I wonder whether there is an opportunity to reinstate dismantled railway lines as part of the community rail programme, from build right through to operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/22">Why should the railway be reinstated? Some 20,000 people in Barnoldswick, Earby, Sough and Kelbrook do not have direct access to the rail network. I am not talking about a backwoods part of the country. There are major employers in the area, such as Silentnight Beds, Rolls-Royce&mdash;the fan blades for a lot of aeroplane engines are manufactured there&mdash;and Country Holidays. That is one reason why I want the railway to be brought back. Doing so would open up a new trans- Pennine corridor with North Yorkshire and Yorkshire beyond, and give people direct access to commercial and recreational opportunities. People who live in Yorkshire could sample and enjoy the recreational opportunities of Lancashire and the north-west and, as I said earlier, the Yorkshire dales would be opened up to the people in east Lancashire. Bringing back the railway would also reduce traffic in the national park more generally, which is surely a public policy objective that we can all agree with.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/23">What about the feasibility of the reinstatement? As I said, the track is in good condition. The British Rail Property Board owns a section of track from Colne to Foulridge, which is about 2 miles long. Craven district council in North Yorkshire has a policy of protecting the 5-mile stretch from the Lancashire border to Skipton. Much of the track bed is in private ownership, but it is in good condition. The remaining 4-mile stretch is owned by Lancashire county council. It originally proposed using the track bed for a new bypass, in the deposit edition of the joint Lancashire structure plan, but the public opinion that I mentioned earlier forced a rethink. The original proposals were modified to allow other options, such as reinstatement of the railway.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/24">Bringing back the railway is technically possible. North Yorkshire and Lancashire county councils commissioned the consultants Steer Davies Gleave to report on it, and in August 2003 it published its findings on the strategic value of the route for the development of trans-Pennine passenger and freight services. It concluded that the track bed is in good condition and largely intact, although it has been severed in two places, and bridges would be needed, one of them over the Leeds-Liverpool canal. The work would come with a price tag, but the consultants, who are skilled in such costings, estimate that it would be possible to reinstate the railway for &pound;33 million. Such figures do not scare us&mdash;that is less than the cost of a single Eurofighter Typhoon. In 2003, Lancashire county council estimated the cost of building the new bypass&mdash;over which the Liberal Democrats salivate&mdash;as &pound;37   million. So, it would be cheaper to reinstate the railway than to build the bypass.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/25">What do we conclude from all that? There is a huge coalition of support for the reinstatement of the railway; the cost of bringing it back would be relatively modest; it would open up new economic and recreational opportunities for people on both sides of the regional border; it would lead in due course to the electrification of the railway from Preston to Skipton; and it would be a major driver in the regeneration of east Lancashire, where there are so many socially excluded people. That is the vision that I share with the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon and the hon. Member for Ribble Valley&mdash;if I dare speak for them&mdash;and with the thousands of people who support SELRAP. It is not a pipe dream, and I very much hope that it has the Minister's support.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1168" name="Gordon Prentice">my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> on having secured the debate. He has conjured up a wonderful image of the opportunities that would be on offer as a result of opening the Colne to Skipton railway line, and I know that he has campaigned long and hard, alongside SELRAP, to bring his vision about.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/2">My hon. Friend will be aware that our general approach to local and rural railways is to work towards putting them on a sustainable basis for the long term, so that they can continue to offer vital services for passengers and freight and to contribute to the local economy, as well as meeting Government targets on accessibility, the environment and, as he said, social inclusion. The general aim is to make better use of the subsidy already going into the railways, rather than providing&mdash;at this stage&mdash;additional grants for development. To that end, the Strategic Rail Authority published the community rail development strategy in November 2004. Sadly, at present, re-openings fall outside the scope of the strategy. Even extensions that represent value for money in economic terms invariably require additional subsidy, which is currently unaffordable.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/3">The existing railways at Colne and Skipton provide local and longer-distance services. The service from Colne is one train an hour to Blackpool via Blackburn and Preston. I understand that the Association of Community Rail Partnerships, with the support of Lancashire county council, is actively developing a partnership for the line between Colne and Blackburn, which it expects to establish by the middle of the year. It will work with the train operator, Northern, and with    Network Rail, local authorities, community organisations, businesses, development and tourism agencies and other locally-based bodies to promote the line.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/4">From Skipton, there are regular stopping services to Leeds and Bradford, generally two trains to each destination every hour during the day, and it is served additionally by trains running between Morecambe and Leeds, and Carlisle and Leeds. It is, of course, part of the well known and well loved Settle to Carlisle route. Lancashire county council has received the Steer Davies Gleave report on the future of the railway formation around Skipton and Colne to which my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/5">Some conclusions of the report are:</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/6" class="indent">&quot;In the short to medium term it appears difficult to make a case for route reinstatement to serve longer distance strategic passenger movements. However, in the longer term there may be potential, particularly if the funding environment returns to one more conducive to investment in rail capital projects. If the route were reinstated to serve longer distance movements it would offer an opportunity to serve areas within the corridor both by stopping express services and local services;</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/7" class="indent">A double-track reinstatement would provide the greatest amount of operational flexibility which is potentially important for longer-distance passenger services that might have to be pathed through constrained areas elsewhere. The Villages Bypass scheme as proposed would effectively restrict the railway to a single-track reopening on the current alignment which might compromise the benefits to strategic passenger services  . . . The most cost effective way of maintaining the rail alignment is for the Villages Bypass to adopt an alternative route from that proposed at present&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/8">The report also stated that the forecast of local passenger flows was not sufficient to make a case for the railway in its own right, as the cost of installing track alone was &pound;33 million. It may appear to be a drop in the ocean to my hon. Friend, but it is still a significant amount of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/9">The Strategic Rail Authority set out its plans for the railways in its strategic plan of January 2003. The plan makes no reference to reopening the line within the 10-year transport plan period, and it remains the position that there are no plans to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/10">The longer-term planning of the network&mdash;that is, over the next five to 20 years&mdash;will be determined by a series of regional planning assessments that the SRA is conducting to cover each English planning region. RPAs consider the function of the railway within current and future land use transport systems and its role in supporting the economic and wider development objectives of local, regional, devolved and central governments. Colne to Skipton falls within two RPA areas. Work on the north-west RPA is in progress, and the SRA expects to publish the conclusions in the spring. The Yorkshire and Humberside RPA is due to commence in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/11">The SRA has taken the view that it would be prudent to safeguard the Colne to Skipton transport corridor for transport use until such time as the relevant RPA studies have been undertaken, as they will be of key significance in assessing the case for reopening the route for rail. It is a shame that the local Liberal Democrats do not share my hon. Friend's vision.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/12">Since May 2003, the Lancashire structure plan has safeguarded the Colne to Skipton rail route for transport use, and the A56 villages bypass has become the third priority in the programme of major road schemes. The pre-adoption version of the Lancashire structure plan states:</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/13" class="indent">&quot;The value of the former Colne-Skipton railway line includes possible long term potential for rail reinstatement as well as being the current preferred route for the A56 Village Bypasses. It is, therefore, important that this corridor is safeguarded for transport purposes. Before a final decision is made on the most appropriate road alignment further analysis of options will be undertaken ensuring that the potential of rail re instatement is not precluded.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/14">There are no plans to reinstate the railway between Colne and Skipton, but the route is safeguarded for transport use. I am sure that the enthusiasm and the campaigning zeal of my hon. Friend will carry his vision forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.3/1">My right hon. Friend makes a very good point, and I shall touch on this a little further in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.3/2">This announcement from the Highways Agency caused both anger and dismay in Norfolk, as we felt that the Government had broken their promises about these schemes. Let me remind the Minister of just how important the A11 and A47, and these schemes, are to Norfolk.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.3/3">Since 1997, I and other Norfolk MPs have initiated and spoken in debates in this House on why it is essential that the Government take a strategic view of these two main trunk roads, and how necessary it is that they should be dualled throughout. Is the Minister aware that Norwich is the only city in England and Wales that is not accessed by dual carriageway? In previous debates, I have taken the lead in stressing the importance of dualling the A47, part of which runs through my constituency of Mid-Norfolk. The A47 Blofield to North Burlingham section, one of the programmes that has been kicked into the long grass, is an example within my constituency. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-15">15 September 2003</phrase>, I led a cross-party, cross-Norfolk delegation to lobby the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/703" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on the need to dual the A47, and to press for a decision on the infamous single-lane Acle straight, between Acle in my constituency and Great Yarmouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.3/4">The Highways Agency's announcement on 1 December raises many serious questions about the integrity of the Government's road transport policy as it affects Norfolk and the eastern region. I have come here today to urge the Minister to reverse those decisions and explain the anomalies and contradictions behind them. It would, as my right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk said, have been courteous and helpful if the Department had actually notified local MPs of this decision in December. We had to learn about it from the local media. None of us was informed, and that includes the Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/801" name="Charles Clarke">the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>. I understand that he had something of a sense of humour failure over this.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.3/5">Can the Minister explain why the A11 and A47 are not regarded as roads of national importance, but rather as regional roads? Even in the listing of regional schemes, the A11 and A47 are fourth in line after</p>
	<p pid="a.136.3/6" class="indent">&quot;schemes under construction, schemes planned to start construction by April 2008&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.136.3/7">and</p>
	<p pid="a.136.3/8" class="indent">&quot;schemes to be progressed for future construction&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.137.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a very good point. Anybody looking at a road map of the United Kingdom sees that Norfolk is one of the few parts of the country where there are virtually no significant roads shown: we appear to be almost without transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/2">The badly thought out nature of the proposals is well illustrated by the fact that the A11 and A47 will be considered through regional transport boards. The problem is that, as far as I know, those boards have not yet been set up, and it is not clear how the local authority interest will be represented and safeguarded. What can the Minister tell us about the establishment and remit of the regional transport boards? Is the Minister aware that the East of England regional assembly originally approved extra housing? In Norfolk alone, approval was given for some 72,600 houses by 2021, as long as infrastructure, including transport, kept in step with growth. The chairman of the East of England regional assembly wrote to the Minister for Regeneration and the Regions on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-22">22 December 2004</phrase> that the</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/3" class="indent">&quot;key transport schemes had been arbitrarily cut from the approved programme, which suggested a lack of good faith by the Government. At a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">10 December</phrase>, the Assembly condemned the cuts and regarded the endorsement of the housing plan as suspended.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.138.0/1">I want to reassure the hon. Gentleman that in this important debate he has the support of all parties, all MPs and organisations that have considered this problem in Norfolk over the years. Will he find time to talk about the accident rate, which is sometimes swollen by the holidaymakers who come to Great Yarmouth, for example, in the summer? Every week there seems to be a terrible story of some horrific crash, often resulting in deaths, which has become almost acceptable to the public. From our point of view, it is unacceptable.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman. I shall touch on that later, as it is an important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/2">It is called the law of unintended consequences: given the failure of the Government's referendum on regional assemblies in the north-east, and Norfolk's experience of decisions by both the assembly and the East of England Development Agency, the Minister will not be surprised to learn that we in Norfolk have very little confidence that either the A11 or the A47 will receive any kind of priority under the proposals put forward by the Highways Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/3">In the strange world in which the Government operate, there is another glaring anomaly about those decisions. I understand that, just before Christmas, the Home Secretary intervened with the Secretary of State for Transport and persuaded him to reinstate the A11 Attleborough bypass scheme to the category of national importance. I do not know whether such an agreement is in writing, but can the Minister confirm whether the scheme has been reinstated? If it has been reinstated, without meaning to be churlish, I must question the basis of such a decision. Was it made because the Secretary of State for Transport believes, after all, that it genuinely meets the criterion of national importance? If so, why not the A11 Fiveways to Thetford or the A47 Blofield to North Burlingham scheme? Or is it because the Attleborough bypass is close to the constituency of the Home Secretary? I actively support all colleagues supporting that scheme, but it seems to be a strange anomaly.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/4">Finally, we are waiting for a decision on the dualling of the notorious Acle straight on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1339" name="Anthony D Wright">the A47, shared by me and the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase>, who is in the Room. Will there be a decision soon, and if so, are we to assume that, like the other Norfolk schemes, it will come bottom of the list of regional priorities?</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/5">As the hon. Member for Norwich, North pointed out, the issue is not just about improving transport and economic development. Dualling saves lives. Every study done by the Government and local authorities shows that where dualling is introduced, the number of accidents, including fatal accidents, is reduced. In the early evening of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-06">Thursday 6 January</phrase>, Mr. Glenn Fransham was killed on the Acle straight, near the Halvergate junction in my constituency, and the road was closed in both directions for four-and-a-half hours. As well as the tragedy for his family, Great Yarmouth was effectively cut off. That is totally and utterly unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/6">The Government have failed to consider the A11 and A47 strategic roads necessary for the development of Norfolk as well as the whole of eastern England.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.0/1">I apologise for being late; I had a constituents' meeting. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, although the European Union has accepted that the A47 is part of the trans-European road network, the Government must show the same commitment with respect to the strategic route of the A47, which runs all the way through to King's Lynn and beyond?</p>

	<p pid="a.139.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has argued very strongly on this issue, along with all of us here. He is reinforcing my point that the A47 is not only crucial in Norfolk, but the main east-west road running all the way to the midlands. I know that it is an entirely separate issue, but the hon. Gentleman and all of us here are waiting with anticipation for a decision by the Secretary of State about the outer harbour at Great Yarmouth. That decision will be made on separate criteria, but if it goes ahead, as we all hope, the dualling of the A47 will become significantly important.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.2/1">My hon. Friend is illustrating, as has also been shown by the interventions of fellow Norfolk MPs, that there is a complete lack of strategic understanding of the importance of road networks in Norfolk. It is not possible to think of developing any of our towns, including Great Yarmouth, without some thought about how people are going to get there. Equally, if the Government talk about growth in housing and general regeneration of Norfolk, they have to give strategic thought to how people are going to get in and out of the county safely, which was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" name="Ian Gibson">the point made by the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>. A quick look at the accident and emergency figures in our hospitals will show the impact of unsafe and undualled roads.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.3/1">My right hon. Friend's point reinforces the arguments about road safety and expansion. The Government want to put a lot of resources and effort into the expansion of the economy in East Anglia. I recognise and support that, but we will not get that expansion if the impression is that Norfolk is somehow cut off.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/2">By every criteria that the Government hold dear, the dualling of the A47 and A11 must come high in their priorities, particularly in terms of dealing with social deprivation. Many people are under the impression that Norfolk is a wealthy county. There are undoubtedly parts of Norfolk where there is great wealth and the possibility of generating great wealth, but all hon. Members in this Room have in their constituency areas&mdash;in some cases, large areas&mdash;of direct social deprivation. Given that alleviating deprivation is a Government priority, that is a strong reason for examining the issue strategically.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/3">Limited schemes for dualling the A11 and A47 have been cut, and it seems to the people in Norfolk that there is no logic to the Government's road policy. I urge the Minister to reconsider this decision, because it is unacceptable to the people of Norfolk according to all the criteria that I have put forward. I hope that she will realise that the strength of feeling is represented here today by almost all Norfolk MPs&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1032" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> would have been here but is in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.3/4">Finally, I ask the Minister to remember that this year, Norfolk and Britain are celebrating the bicentenary of Admiral Horatio Nelson's victory at Trafalgar. Nelson was a Norfolk boy. He used to write about going into Norfolk and coming out of Norfolk as though Norfolk were almost a separate country, geographically, because of the poor communications. I leave her with a paraphrase of Nelson's famous signal at Trafalgar: &quot;Norfolk expects the Minister to do her duty.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.140.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1227" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> on securing the debate and providing us with an opportunity to discuss what we are doing about providing transport infrastructure in his area. He painted a picture of an apparently neglected part of the country, cut off from the rest of it. I reassure him that that is not so.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/2">The east of England as a whole is a vital region at national and international level. We are working closely with regional partners to deliver the transport infrastructure that it deserves and requires. Norfolk, by virtue of its geographical location, is sometimes perceived, especially by those living there, as being on the sidelines. However, in recent years there have been some additions to the strategic transport infrastructure, and those have improved accessibility in relation to the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/3">Norfolk is served by four major roads from the west and south: the A47, the A11, the A12&mdash;which are obviously all trunk roads&mdash;and the A140, which is the responsibility of Norfolk county council. In recent years there have been several improvements to those roads, such as the Hardwick flyover at King's Lynn, which removed a major congestion point on the A47 and reduced delays by up to 50 per cent. The dualling of the A11 between Roudham heath and Attleborough has also reduced journey time.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/4">A number of local transport schemes in Norfolk have contributed to improving access to the wider strategic network and, therefore, to connections with the rest of the country. However, it is not just within Norfolk that we need to look for improvements, as even improvements outside the county can be of benefit in improving accessibility to it. We are constructing the Thorney bypass on the A47, which has been promised by successive Governments for more than 60 years. It is due to open in early 2006 and will mean a major saving on journey time.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/5">We commissioned a multi-modal study of the A47 between Norwich and Peterborough, which examined the whole corridor strategically. Although it concluded that there was no immediate need to build a dual carriageway along the whole route, it recommended that certain sections should be investigated further. The Highways Agency is reviewing the case for the Middleton and East Winch bypasses and will review the case for upgrades to the further sections of the A47 between the A1 and Sutton and between North Tuddenham and Easton.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/6">Of course, it is not just roads that service Norwich at a strategic level. The railways do as well. The successes of the Norwich to Cambridge direct rail service, on which patronage has increased as the result of rail passenger partnership funding supplied by the Strategic Rail Authority, are excellent news. Also, from 1 January, the new franchisee, One, has withdrawn 38-year-old locomotives between London and Norwich and replaced them with more modern and reliable ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/7">The latest performance figures for One railway's London to Norwich service show that 88 per cent. of trains arrive on time. The latest timetable from One shows an increase in the number of trains each day between Norwich and London from 65 to 70, with later departures in the evening. That has been made possible by a decision that we took to amalgamate several separate franchises into one, covering the majority of the East Anglia region, which made possible more efficient operation on the Great Eastern main line.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/8">The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk identified the recent announcement on transport schemes locally and nationally as an indication of our neglect of the area. I should say straight away that we have not removed any schemes from Government programmes at national or local level. He mentioned the decision not to include the A11 in the near future roads programme. However&mdash;and he raised this&mdash;we have reconsidered our decision about the A11 Attleborough bypass. We have announced that, in light of the scheme's value for money and the stage that it has reached, the Highways Agency will now take it forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/9">The other two schemes in the region relate to the A11 from Five Ways to Thetford and the Blofield to North Burlingham section of the A47. We have asked the region to advise us on the relative priority of those schemes and other transport proposals in the region.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.0/1">On the subject of the A11, we all welcome the notion of including the Attleborough bypass, but does the Minister understand that Norwich is the only major city in the UK not connected to the national road network by dual carriageways&mdash;a fact that I mentioned in my maiden speech three and a half years ago? One can get all the way from junction 9 on the M11 near Cambridge to Five Ways on a dual carriageway, and then suddenly it stops and one slows right down. Does the Minister agree that it is unacceptable that a city such as Norwich and a county such as Norfolk should be cut off in that way? Does she agree that getting the A11 dualled all the way, including the section from Five Ways to Thetford, should be a high priority?</p>

	<p pid="a.141.1/1">That is why we asked the region to identify its priorities. If, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, that issue is so important, not just for Norwich but for the region, it will come very high on the list of regional priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.0/1">The whole point of the debate and the arguments put forward is this: why does not the Secretary of State have a view on the matter? Strategy is decided at the national level, unless I wasted my many years spent teaching officers at the Army staff college. The Minister is talking about the tactical level. If the matter is to be decided by a region, which is, at the end of the day, a quango&mdash;I still do not know whether the regional transport board has been set up&mdash;we know from past experience that the schemes will be tail-end Charlies. We, and most observers, regard the schemes as crucial.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.1/1">I do not know how the schemes can be tail-end Charlies if they are as important as Conservative Members suggest. &quot;The Future of Transport&quot; White Paper identified the value of involving regional bodies, local authorities and other key local stakeholders in shaping the programme of future transport investment in their areas. Local people on the ground know what the priorities are. Conservative Members, as leaders of local stakeholders and local political opinion, along with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" name="Ian Gibson">my hon. Friends the Members for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> and for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright), will ensure that such decisions are taken at regional level.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/2">The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk raised the issue of regional transport boards. There is no prescription from on high&mdash;from the Department for Transport&mdash;on how regions should co-ordinate and prepare advice on priorities. It is up to the region to decide to do that. The important thing is that the region makes those decisions based on the views of local stakeholders. It is important that they have the flexibility to develop those arrangements, simply because we are often accused of trying to run everything from Whitehall. We are devolving these decisions to the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/3">Clearly, Norwich is an important centre and that will be taken on board by the region. If the lack of a dual carriageway is of such significance, the scheme will certainly be adopted as a high priority by the region.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.2/1">I know that the Minister is genuinely trying to address the problem, but can she explain why the three schemes were initially dropped from being of national importance to being of regional importance? The people of Norfolk had assumed that the schemes would go ahead, and that they would be completed in the next two or three years. In fact, Ministers urged me to congratulate them in previous debates. Why have the schemes been moved into a regional bracket? We know from the Highways Agency's literature that that means that they have slipped further down the decade. Why has the A11 Attleborough bypass scheme been brought back in, but not the other two schemes, particularly the scheme in my constituency, where the road accident rate alone would justify its introduction&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.143.0/2">There is clearly an issue of prioritisation and of deciding which are the most important. We have made it clear that regional local bodies should have a stronger voice in decision making. We reinstated one of those roads because we recognised that it had a significant effect on local transport needs. The others will have to be prioritised, taking account of available resources. If the region gives them a high priority, there is no reason why they should not go ahead in fairly short order.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.3/1">Does my hon. Friend understand the frustration of my constituents in Great Yarmouth? For the past 30 years of my involvement in politics, I have been campaigning for the dualling of the Acle straight, an 8-mile stretch of road between Yarmouth and Acle. The frustration is caused by the fact that a programme in the early 1990s to dual the road was withdrawn by the Conservative Government in November 1996. It is a case of give and take. Under Governments of all political persuasions, it seems that no one is handling the problem with the required urgency.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.4/1">My hon. Friend has campaigned long and hard for that dualling. He rightly points out that a Conservative Government shelved the scheme. At least we now have a Government who are willing to invest in public transport and roads. He can be absolutely sure that that investment will be spent wisely and on a value-for-money basis. We are providing huge resources to be spent on the road system, but we believe that the region should have a key view in the decision-making process and that it has the power to help us come to the right decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.4/2">It is important that regions consider basing their decisions not only on transport priorities but on related housing and economic development programmes. Transport should be seen not in isolation, but as part of the regional strategic decision-making process. That is why we are consulting on proposals for   providing long-term regional funding guidelines covering transport and other policy areas. Subject to the outcome of consultation, we will publish later in the year indicative regional transport allocations for 2007&ndash;08, and longer-term planning assumptions going far beyond then.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.0/1">On that specific point, how is the Minister's Department reacting to the letter from the chairman of the East of England regional assembly saying that, as a consequence of the Highways Agency transport reallocation from national importance to regional, there is to be a vote by the elected members, putting into suspended animation the agreement for extra housing within the eastern region?</p>

	<p pid="a.144.1/1">I am not fully aware of that communication, but I shall certainly write to the hon. Gentleman about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/2">Funding guidelines will allow each region to take account of the impacts of individual decisions on wider objectives and enable them to base their strategies on more realistic assumptions of future funding. They will also   mean that regions are better able to align their planning, housing, transport and economic development strategies and come to a common, integrated view on priorities within their areas. No matter what the scale of the project, we must be absolutely assured that it meets our five criteria for transport set out in the 1998 White Paper &quot;A New Deal for Transport&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/3">Those criteria are accessibility, safety, economy, the environment and integration. No project will fully satisfy all those criteria, but we must ensure that there will be overall net benefit from the scheme. That often causes tensions between the various criteria, and one of the main difficulties is caused by trying to satisfy the environmental and economic criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/4">Norfolk, of course, has many areas of great natural beauty and the need to preserve them for the enjoyment of local people and for the benefits that are brought to the area by numerous visitors must be weighed against any economic benefits that the new infrastructure might bring. The hon. Gentleman highlighted the A47 Acle straight, where there may be economic benefits from widening or dualling the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/5">As we have demonstrated elsewhere, our policy on new transport infrastructure also takes into account the full environmental cost as well as possible economic benefits. We are awaiting the results of work done by the Highways Agency on the environmental impact of widening or dualling the road. We are also aware of the work carried out by the county council on the economic impacts, and we shall make a decision in due course. In the shorter term, the Highways Agency is investigating measures that can be implemented to improve safety as part of its ongoing network management responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/6">As for Eastport, to which the hon. Gentleman also referred, the project throws up a wide range of complex issues that must be considered carefully by the Government before a decision can be reached on public funding. We are considering such matters and are mindful that there are time limits on some elements of the potential funding. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport is considering the potential impacts of the project on the ports sector and will provide advice to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, whose approval is required for the funding decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/7">It is not only major transport projects that will increase the strategic access. Often several smaller scale improvements can make a big difference to the operation of the road network. The Highways Agency has developed route management strategies for the A47, A12 and A11. They set out its plans for the development and management of the routes over the next 10 years, with priorities identified for action over the next three years. Key proposals for the A11 include the closure of central reserve gaps with the aim of improving safety, reducing accidents and reducing delays caused by those accidents. The agency is also investigating measures to reduce congestion at the Five Ways roundabout, which, although located in Suffolk, will improve journey time reliability to Norfolk. On the A47 and A12, key proposals include ways to reduce congestion and improve access to Great Yarmouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/8">Progress is being made to improve access to Norfolk. We have not axed any schemes from our programmes, but have asked the region to align its planning, housing, transport and economic development strategies and come to a common, integrated view on priorities within its area and then to advise us of its priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/10" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-nine minutes past Four o'clock.</p>
