	<p pid="a.1.2/1">It is good to see you in the Chair, Mr. Martlew, and to see colleagues from all parties here to support&mdash;I hope&mdash;the principles of how we fund early intervention; its financing is a work in progress, and today I shall try to set out a stall for the next year's work on making it effective. I hope to be lucky in the draw and follow up this debate with progress, towards to the end of the year, and then perhaps have another exchange with the Minister, who I am delighted to see in his place. I do not know whether he thinks that I am tracking him on his journey around Whitehall. I have had lots of interviews and exchanges with him over early intervention, which have always been very positive and sympathetic. I now want to take the matter further with him in his new role and explore some of the financial aspects.</p>

I hope that the report has made a small contribution to every party's thinking&mdash;in a non-partisan way&mdash;on how we address some of the long-term problems facing us. My hon. Friend gives me an excuse to say that bringing about intergenerational change will require a generation. Everybody, of all political complexions and none, will need to understand that. We will also require a social and political consensus to sustain it over the long term. That is what we were trying to do in the report, and what I continue to try to do with people of all persuasions of good will, who see that early intervention is actually a very long-term solution requiring the broadest possible social and political support.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.0/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for that intervention and you, Mr. Martlew, for the judgment that you are exercising to provide for a genuine debate. You need to be credited for that, Mr. Martlew, because we need this sort of exchange if this House is to be taken seriously. My hon. Friend the Minister has been involved in enough Adjournment debates to know that they can be a lonely experience, with only a Minister and one Back Bencher present. Today, the record should say that heavyweight and intelligent people from all parties are participating in this debate, and I welcome that.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.2/1">I say to my right hon. Friend that we must be careful that we do not talk ourselves into a debate about the nanny state because it does not get raised that often. I have read the works of Thomas Paine and they say that Governments, even in their best form, are a necessary evil. The idea that state-ism should control people's lives&mdash;as some people on the left, the right and the centre believe&mdash;is anathema to my political tradition. We want to liberate people and give them the equipment to make their own way. That is the basis of many, if not all, of the mainstream political philosophies in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/2">I will come on to the subject of parenting later. As my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham knows, the famous child psychologist Bruce Perry was the first to pick out those shocking pictures of the brain size of a three-year-old who had been loved and nurtured and that of a three-year-old who had been seriously neglected. The contrast was between an ordinary three-year-old and a three-year-old in a Romanian orphanage. Physically as well, there was a difference in size. That stunning image was used by my right hon. Friend when she was running the Cabinet Office, and I have used it over and over again. Bruce Perry's thesis is that there has been a breakdown in the intergenerational transmission of parenting skills. That is a sociological way of saying what I and my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green said in our modest publication &quot;Good Parents, Great Kids, Better Citizens&quot;. If we continue that transmission of good parenting skills in a virtuous circle, we will be half way to setting up effective early intervention and creating self-starting, rounded and emotionally capable people. I will give way to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2031" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>, but then, if I may, I should like to make a little progress because everyone is making my points.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.0/1">May I move the hon. Gentleman from the philosophical and more general point to a very practical point? Regardless of what we do and spend, we will fail young children unless we get housing right. As Members of Parliament, we have all heard cases of single mums and families living together in very poor housing, being bumped from pillar to post, with children who are disabled, ill and sometimes emotionally challenged. Unless we make it easier for those people to get decent housing in which they can keep warm and dry and feel safe, we will not get anywhere. We have an economic crisis at the moment that could challenge financial support and early intervention. Those things would be a very soft target for ministerial cuts. We must not take our eye off the ball, and we could kill two birds with one stone by tackling the provision of housing for such children.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a number of intelligent points, as I always expect from him. George Hosking of the Wave Trust has greatly influenced me. Rather comically, he has explained via a dance that a woman would have to have hips about 5 ft wide to give birth to a baby whose brain is fully formed&mdash;I could not possibly do the dance that he does to illustrate this, and I would not attempt to do so. To put it succinctly&mdash;I find this preposition memorable&mdash;every child is born three years premature. Parents&mdash;we might be talking about a single parent living in one room&mdash;look after babies who, in other circumstances, could be in an incubator in intensive care. We ask poor, lonely, young people, often women who are on their own, who are not educated in parenting, to look after what is in effect a premature baby and to take that baby through those vital first three years, when the brain explodes with neuron growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/2">Age nought to three is a vital period. Perhaps because I come from Nottingham, I have an image of an archery target with that age group in the bullseye. The next ring is the age three-to-18 group. They will be the carers in future, so if they properly develop, they will make the valuable nought-to-three period of the next generation as prolific as possible, through empathetic behaviour, nurture, love, warmth and the family values that are traditionally part of raising a child. My hon. Friend is right that that period is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/3">I shall address costs later, but in a nutshell, it costs &pound;250,000 if a child goes wrong and is banged up in a secure unit for a year at the age of 16, and &pound;230,000 if a child ends up on an intensive drug rehabilitation programme for a year. Let us imagine what would happen if that money was put into nurse-family partnerships, in which nurses have a relationship with every young teenage mother. It would pay for 50 youngsters&mdash;I have done a quick calculation&mdash;to get the most fantastic help with nurturing and loving their child, which every parent wants to do. That would save us so much money down the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/4">In Nottingham, for example, we could give warmth, comfort, security and expertise to the parents and children to which I referred for &pound;2.8 million&mdash;we are already doing so for a quarter of the children of teenage parents for &pound;700,000. That is the same cost incurred by five or 10 people who have gone wrong, not including court, prison and welfare costs. The problem cries out for that kind of sensible investment. I shall deal with this matter later, but if we can figure out how to make that saving, we could also provide a tremendous income stream for the Government for 20 or more years as this generation grows up.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-13a.8.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="8"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090113/halltext/90113h0002.htm#09011363000458">
	<p pid="a.8.1/1">There are so many brilliant concepts and philosophies relating to this area, including the sort to which my right hon. Friend has just alluded, and we need to liberate people's capacity to implement them. I hope that that point will draw me back to not only the concept of early intervention, over which I have laboured in several Adjournment debates, but specifically its financing, because that is the guts of the debate. In looking at ways of drawing in finance to make early intervention work, I would like to make it as easy to invest in the human capital of healthy and happy young children as to invest in the physical capital of land, buildings and machinery, the intellectual capital of ideas, inventions and artistic creations and the financial capital of company shares and bonds.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/2">The current economic downturn has been a signal for radical rethinking on borrowing and spending, and that needs to extend beyond what was done in the 1930s to what we need to do for the 2030s and the generation now growing up who will be adults a century after the great depression. Today's borrowing must be tomorrow's springboard for success, not a ball and chain or something that gives no returns in the future. The investment must give those returns massively and in ever greater amounts, create growing dividends and savings for a generation and help to repay current borrowing&mdash;something that must be done in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/3">Sadly, the case of Baby P has backed up the claim made in a recent publication in <i>The Lancet</i> suggesting that one in 10 children suffer abuse, and my view is that they are just the extreme tip of the iceberg. The bulk of the children to whom I am referring are those who, to put it more mundanely and less dramatically, would benefit from effective parenting, which can be created by early intervention. If children grow up healthy and happy in households that offer them love, nurture, stimulus and empathy, their prospects improve dramatically for the rest of their lives. They are less likely to commit antisocial behaviour and crime or to become dependent on alcohol or other drugs. They are more likely to achieve at school and less likely to stress their teachers and disrupt the education of others. They are more likely to secure well-paid employment and become taxpayers and less likely to be dependent on welfare. They are less likely to have unwanted pregnancies and more likely to become great parents of children whom they will also wish to raise to be good parents in their turn.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/4">Taken together, all those effects suggest that successful early intervention policies will generate an exceptional financial payback, which could be seen as a bonus. I do this sort of work because I care about the kids in my constituency, but by the way, it will make the Government billions of pounds if done properly over the long term. To use a fashionable Keynesian expression, early intervention is a massive multiplier. That sort of common-sense economic and financial conclusion has now been underpinned by fantastic amounts of research. Five or 10 years ago, we might have been scratching around for an evidence base to prove it, but we now have a lot of solid evidence, not least because of the superb work done by Treasury officials in the lead up to the last comprehensive spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/5">There is also the work of James Heckman, the 2005 Nobel prize winner, who demonstrated that the economic payback of pre-school intervention was three to six times higher than that of post-school intervention. When I talk to people about that and try to search for the right words, I often refer back to my mum, who said that a stitch in time saves nine&mdash;it does not need to be a highly scientific explanation. We all know that helping a child early will save ourselves a lot of grief and expense later on.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/6">Even last week, I discovered that a tremendous evidence base is being built in Birmingham, not least because of the inspiration of Steve Aos, who has done many calculations about returns using a very conservative methodology that gives the lowest possible return in all cases. Birmingham is now using some of that evidence and has a &pound;41 million package that is intended to save &pound;102 million, but I need to examine that a little further.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/7">One thing that I do know about is the nurse-family partnership, because we brought it to Nottingham and, as I mentioned earlier, are using it with single teenage mums. It is a home visiting programme for low-income mothers with their first babies. The programme is now 26 years old. Professor David Olds, who started it in the United States, has an evidence base of 26 years&mdash;try contradicting that. It was based on extremely rigorous and deeply conservative, rather than speculative, assumptions. He has demonstrated, and independent scrutiny has supported, that mothers were significantly less likely to abuse or neglect their children or to have subsequent unintended pregnancies or misuse alcohol or drugs. They were significantly more likely&mdash;percentages are attached to these claims&mdash;to enter stable employment and escape welfare benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/8">Unsurprisingly, the programme has also demonstrated enduring benefits for the children. Compared to their control group counterparts who did not have intensive nursing and health-visiting support, those who did made 56 per cent. fewer visits to hospital emergency rooms, so child abuse and accidental injuries were reduced. As adolescents, the children who had been through the nurse-family partnership were arrested 56 per cent. less frequently than their other cohort counterparts and had 81 per cent. fewer convictions. As 15-year-olds, they had had 63 per cent. fewer sexual partners. There is a wealth of evidence, which I know the Minister has seen, to support those statements.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/9">Clearly, appropriate intervention saves lots of money. The Treasury recognised that in the run-up to the last comprehensive spending review, as well as acting on it, which I welcome warmly, in a number of areas. For example, the Treasury supported Every Child a Reader, which gives one-to-one attention to young disadvantaged children struggling with reading and writing. The CSR backed the scheme, saying that raising children with poor education to the average would save &pound;6 billion in public expenditure to deal with the consequences of poor literacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/10">As my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead said, we are pushing at what I hope is an open door at the Treasury, and we have one foot through that door. The only thing that I want from my right hon. Friend the Minister as a result of this debate is for that work to be taken further. I would like to discuss more informally with him, and perhaps with colleagues who are present today, how it can be taken forward along with the Treasury's work. I do not want a cheque tied in a pink ribbon or a commitment that this or that financial instrument will be used in future, but I do hope that the Minister will entertain a continuing dialogue over the next year with colleagues of good will from all parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/11">My experience from chairing the local strategic partnership in Nottingham, which pioneered the package, is that it is dangerous to seek short-term funding, funny money, two-year grant aid and the like. It is disruptive, the criteria and Government policy can change and it is uncertain. Therefore, I am looking for a long-term answer and a long-term commitment over a generation, with payback over a generation. I do not want any favours. I do not want social or ethical money from somebody trying to help me out. I want money from the hardest-faced capitalist who can be found in the toughest financial market that can be found, who sees it purely as a great investment that will yield them a return&mdash;not because they want to help the kids in Nottingham, North or any of the other constituencies represented here today, but because there is a tough case for it as a money-making scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/12">I need to devise a plan with the Treasury and others. I have pulled together a group of high-powered people from the City of London and the public and voluntary sectors to work on the matter, and I hope that collectively we will come up with something. As a constituency entrepreneur, I am happy to continue working on it with friends in this room, but I hope equally that the massive possible returns will interest the Treasury in working on its own to explore the possibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/13">There are some interesting points that I could make on the UK system of finance, but I shall try to avoid making them. One that I must mention is that local government often does not have the capability to make independent decisions, even where it sees ways to tackle local problems sensitively and make large savings.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-13a.11.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="11"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090113/halltext/90113h0002.htm#09011363000460">
	<p pid="a.11.0/1">I am just about to come to the question of local government, and I will address my hon. Friend's points directly then. I hope, Mr. Martlew, that you feel that this has been a genuine debate. I have forgone pages of script to keep that debate going. It has been extremely useful. As an aside, I can only wish that Westminster Hall was used more frequently for exchanges such as this and less frequently as a mini-Commons Chamber where we do not listen to one another.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/2">In the short time left to me, I shall outline a couple of possibilities, which I put to my right hon. Friend the Minister so that there are no surprises and so that we can have a further dialogue. They illustrate the scope of the task.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/3">It is clear that in extraordinary times such as these, the unthinkable, such as nationalisation of banks, can become commonplace rapidly. The most radical proposal is full independence for local government. I say that it is the most radical; it is actually commonplace in most western democracies, but it is a rather radical suggestion in the imperial United Kingdom. Each local government unit would have the freedom to borrow against its credit rating for any purpose, using any means that it could persuade financial markets to accept. Central Government would have to stand aside; it could neither approve the borrowing nor give any guarantee on default.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/4">As in the United States, borrowing could be subject to local referendum. Why not involve people? They often say, &quot;I'm sick of those blinking kids down on the street corner. Can't we do something about it?&quot; Many people do not believe in &quot;hang 'em and flog 'em&quot;. Many appreciate that youngsters should be helped. &quot;Give them something to do,&quot; they say. &quot;Why can't they help their mum? Where's the health service?&quot; Local people appreciate that answers can be devised locally, so why not involve them in local referendums?</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/5">Municipal bonds are long established in most democracies, and are regularly used to fund long-range early intervention policies. They are an attractive way to do so, as many investors are willing to hold long-dated bonds until maturity and accept no returns in the early lifetime of the bonds. Bonds are also tax-exempt in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/6">When I last considered the subject, in the middle of last year, there were 50,000 state and local entities in the US alone that could issue securities and more than 2 million separate issues outstanding, with a combined value of $1.7 trillion. More than 5 million US households owned municipal bonds directly or indirectly, and I understand that they have become still more popular since the crash in other asset prices. US municipal bonds are available to British investors, with the curious result that people in Nottingham can invest in the future of children in Colorado but cannot invest to finance similar packages or schemes in their own city.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/7">A less radical proposal, but one that would still require political will, would be to have a new national savings issue dedicated to early intervention. Its proceeds would be ring-fenced and re-lent to local government or other vehicles to finance approved programmes. That might be attractive to lenders and markets because of the guarantee against default, but it would obviously be less attractive to local government because it would subject all its early intervention activities to central Government control or oversight. However, I am sure that local government could live with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/8">A still less radical possibility would be for the Government to relax the criteria allowing local government or other structures to borrow directly from the Public Works Loan Board, or to undertake prudential borrowing. At present, these facilities are limited to physical capital projects, such as buildings and transport, which is an issue that I have raised with Treasury officials in the past. If the facilities could be extended to include human capital investment, that could open up a new means of financing early intervention. I hope that we can also explore these ideas, without commitment, with the Minister and his colleagues over the next year or so.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/9">The Government might also consider the possibility of creating special purpose early intervention trusts, or socially responsible early intervention companies with powers to borrow money. So there could be some arm's length agreement. It is not beyond our collective wit to come up with some measure in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/10">More simply, the Government could commit dedicated long-term grant aid to early intervention projects from current revenues. That suggestion is not attractive to me or to local government, because it would make those projects vulnerable to a change of mind by central Government when circumstances changed at national level. I would guess that it is not very attractive to the Treasury either, because it would involve committing current revenues far into the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/11">Alternatively, the Government could examine the precedent set by the Department for Work and Pensions and work out the cost of a lifetime of public intervention for, say, 1,000 children, then offer half that cost to a private company, for example. The Government would immediately save half the costs of those 1,000 lifetimes and the company would be incentivised to have a brilliant early intervention programme, to retain savings, to increase its profits and to reduce the costs of remedialism, rehabilitation and a lifetime on welfare benefits. These are ideas that I am sure we can explore across the party divide and through the good offices of Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/12">A further very simple proposal is that the Government could match the baby bond with an equal donation to each local authority or trust for each newborn child in its area, with the proceeds to be spent on early support programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/13">Whatever new investment vehicle is created for early intervention, it will face one key question and I hope that colleagues will help me in trying to think it through. How do we identify and capture the combined savings from early intervention and pay back the investors or original grant aid? That is the key question and it is one that I hope we can work with the Treasury to think through. I have thought about it a lot and I do not pretend to have come up with an answer yet. I hope by the end of the year to be able to pull together some of the work on that issue. It is the key question. The rewards of early intervention are real, but they do not always take the form of a stream of money income or a specific asset that rises in value.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-13a.13.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="13"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090113/halltext/90113h0002.htm#09011363000462">
	<p pid="a.13.1/1">First, we again need the strategy and the highest-level political commitment, and I do not just mean whoever happens to be the party leader in power at that time. There must be a consensus and the strategy must be driven, in almost Swedish style, over 30 or 40 years. So we need that core commitment and strategy in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/2">In addition, we need to ensure that the instruments that we are currently developing in Whitehall, whether they are local area agreements or other targeting instruments, are seen as being less crude and intrusive and more related to showing nimble and lively sensitivity locally, so that people can figure out what is happening locally. That is the alternative to a one-size-fits-all approach, where the name of the city is simply changed. We need instruments that genuinely reflect local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/3">Even in my own city of Nottingham&mdash;I am sure that it is also the case in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford&mdash;there is a big white working-class former council estate area, which I represent, and next door there is a very different, ethnically diverse inner-city area; my hon. Friend studied there and will recall it well. Even locally, therefore, we need to be sensitive, so that some of the crudity of approach that is imposed by one-size-fits-all thinking is loosened up and made much more sensitive, so that it can react a little more nimbly to local circumstances. Then, as my hon. Friend said earlier, there will be the resources locally to achieve that type of early intervention effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/4">The rewards of early intervention are not always that obvious and they take the form of outcomes for children throughout life that are better than the outcomes for children who did not experience early intervention. How do we value that difference? That takes us back to the key question that I referred to earlier about capturing savings. I think that the answer entails comparing two cohorts of children, as has been done in New Zealand and other countries, to establish the difference between a cohort of children who have experienced early intervention and a cohort who have not experienced it. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green and I have asked party leaders to consider this proposal, as one of the key recommendations at the end of the book that we put together.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/5">If the two cohorts of children are compared, we can figure out the percentages for fewer crimes, fewer demands on the health service, more time spent in employment, and so on. Of course, making such calculations is a formidable challenge and will involve a great deal of hypothesising, but making them will become easier if we build in this system of comparison over a generation, as we develop more knowledge of the detailed benefits of early intervention programmes. Indeed, the Treasury has already got past first base on this issue as a result of the work that it did prior to the last comprehensive spending review. There are also possibilities for involving the insurance industry, so that it may contribute its insight to the task of assessing rewards that only emerge over the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/6">I have taken some time this morning to make my case. I hope that I have left enough time for the Front-Bench spokesmen to make their contributions. I have deliberately encouraged people to participate in a genuine debate and it has been an extremely good debate this morning. I have just touched on some very complex technical territory. A lot of hard work needs to go into examining this issue and I hope to return to it towards the end of the year, to see how far we have got.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/7">There are basically three fundamental truths in this area. First, the rewards of early intervention are far-reaching and the costs of late intervention are becoming prohibitive. Secondly, early intervention programmes must be long-term programmes and they are always at risk if they are compelled to rely on short-term financing from current revenues. Thirdly, it is both prudent and practicable for Her Majesty's Treasury to help us to devise new forms of investment finance for early intervention that will meet the demands of lenders and allow the nation to improve its stock of human capital as efficiently and rapidly as it meets its other capital needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.0/1">I would encourage the hon. Member to accept a fourth fundamental truth in this area. It is that if we get housing right, then social stability, health, education and finding employment for parents become so much easier and more achievable. Conversely, without decent, longer-term housing prospects, the young families that we are discussing will not move forward in these ways and any money that is spent will be less effectively spent.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.0/1">It is a great privilege for me to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing the debate and on speaking so eloquently on this subject. It is also a privilege for me to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase>, who also has a long-standing and admirable interest in this field. We have the added context of the fact that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" name="Alan Milburn">the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase>, who could not be present today, has been asked by the Prime Minister to do additional work on social mobility. That subject matter is not identical, but it overlaps with what we are discussing.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/2">The problems are familiar to us all as constituency MPs, but it is worth touching on some of them, one of which is educational underachievement. I take the point that once children have reached formal education, much of the mould has already been set and the problems are already in train. Nevertheless, this issue is indicative of a wider malaise.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/3">In the most deprived areas, 44 per cent. of schools achieve the requisite Government target GCSE pass rates, compared with 97 per cent. in affluent areas. So, children reach that level of attainment almost across the board in affluent areas, but in less than half of schools in more deprived areas. Only 21 per cent. of children who receive free school meals achieve five good GCSEs. To touch on the points that the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green has just made, many people who find themselves, in adult life or adolescence, in prison or otherwise severely disadvantaged have failed to reach those basic levels of attainment much earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/4">Relative financial poverty is another factor. The Government deserve some credit for seeking to address that systematically by targeting money, through one-to-one tuition, to equip people with greater skills in the workplace. There are also schemes such as Home-Start&mdash;I am familiar with Home-Start in Taunton&mdash;which is an excellent organisation. Under the scheme people, mainly mothers, mentor new mothers who are in less fortunate circumstances and try to pass on mothering and life skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/5">We have touched on the cost of failing to intervene in terms of prison places and drug rehabilitation programmes. We can all agree that considering the matter simply in statistical terms of financial cost, education and Government programmes may mean neglecting the biggest aspect&mdash;the emotional and spiritual poverty in many communities. This is not simply about financial poverty; it is about deeply entrenched unemployment, about people living lives that lack structure or focus and about all the social ills that arise from such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/6">What about the solutions, inasmuch as we can readily arrive at solutions, and ideas for improvement? I agree with what the hon. Member for Nottingham, North said about the role of local government. We should encourage local communities, not only through local government but at lower and more immediate levels, to be imaginative in their solutions and to take responsibility for their own neighbourhoods. People should not see this as entirely an exercise of initiatives that are devised in London and passed down for implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/7">I agree that the private sector has a role to play. The hon. Gentleman's thinking is extremely radical in that regard. Although the implications might be alarming for his colleagues and others, including some people in my party, we ought to explore that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/8">Education is clearly important, and more could be done to help children before they get to school. That would be a better use of Treasury money than the baby bond that matures when children reach 18, when, I think we all agree, the direction of travel for their lives has mostly been determined. My party, as well as the Conservatives, and perhaps the Government, have talked about the so-called pupil premium to target extra financial resources at children who are falling behind in the primary school years of their education. In the past day or two, the Government have made announcements about giving incentives to teachers to stay in schools where the cohort of children is harder to teach. I welcome such initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/9">The nanny state has been mentioned, and I think that agencies of the state have difficulties. For example, there was clearly a need for greater intervention in relation to Baby P. However, the newspapers that were critical of Haringey social services&mdash;I do not say that they should not have been critical&mdash;also criticise social services departments for confiscating children and say, &quot;How dare the state behave in such a heavy-handed way?&quot; There is a difficult balancing act to be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/10">I admire the work of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North and the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green. The latter talked about the prison population, which is a stark demonstration of the points we are discussing. However, I am slightly cautious about the risk of confusing cause and effect, and have some reservations about adopting a prescriptive approach&mdash;for example, financially penalising people for not being married. My parents are married and I went to university, but it is likely that I would have gone to university even if my parents had not been married. Sometimes inferences that might apply in general terms can be made, but they do not always apply in specific terms, and we ought to be cautious about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/11">I conclude with this observation: aspirational poverty is the greatest danger that we must tackle. I think that the hon. Member for Nottingham, North talked about liberating the capacity for people to help themselves. Dealing with this issue is not just about providing facilities. Since the Victorian era, free education has been provided by the state and we have had free libraries for anybody who wishes to go and read the complete works of Shakespeare or the day's newspapers. Those services exist, but people need to want to access them so that they can realise their potential. It is not just about equality of wealth; it is about everyone being able to enjoy the full richness of life. I welcome this debate and, in the spirit of our contributions, I hope that the Minister will try to see this as a long-term, cross-party issue. We are all keen to achieve the objectives discussed. Those objectives will no doubt be further mentioned in the final two speeches.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship today, Mr. Martlew, and I congratulate you on the way in which you have chaired the debate. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> not only on securing the debate and on setting out his thoughts so eloquently&mdash;and, indeed, on bringing in contributions from a number of right hon. and hon. Members&mdash;but on shaping debate on the subject more broadly. He mentioned that he has held a number of Westminster Hall debates and has raised the issue of early intervention in a number of contexts, inside and outside Parliament. In doing so, he has contributed hugely to developing political parties' understanding&mdash;not just his party, but all parties&mdash;of the advantages of early intervention and has contributed to the wider debate outside.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/2">I also congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase>. He has made an enormous contribution to increasing the understanding of some of the difficulties that we face in society and some of the ways in which we can address those concerns. My right hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman have worked together on the publication of their book, &quot;Early Intervention: Good Parents, Great Kids, Better Citizens&quot; and have provided an example to all parliamentarians. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> had another engagement and is no longer in the Chamber, but he mentioned that it was the most important report that he had read during 30 years in Parliament, which is praise indeed. At a time when there is great cynicism about politicians, if the public were to see the way in which my right hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman have worked together and brought forward the debate, they would be hugely impressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/3">The central argument is that a section of society suffers from low aspirations. That important point was made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase>. Often, the problems of drug and alcohol abuse, family instability, crime, and worklessness are passed from generation to generation. That creates neighbourhoods in which those characteristics become the norm and are prevalent. Sections of society therefore live a life of hopelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/4">My right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green and the hon. Member for Nottingham, North have made the case that, although Governments of both parties have responded by trying to tackle the consequences, such as crime and poverty, they have not tried to tackle the causes to the same extent. The emphasis needs to be put on the early years, particularly between nought to three years old, which is the time when a difference can be made. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1557" name="Hilary Armstrong">The right hon. Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong)</phrase> made an important point about understanding more about the development of the brain. So there is a great opportunity during those early years.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/5">Clearly, dealing with this issue will benefit the poorest families, who will receive help directly, but it will also benefit wider society by reducing crime and antisocial behaviour. In the long term, demands on the taxpayer will be reduced. To use the terminology that my party tends to use, if we can tackle the problems of a broken society, we can reduce the demands on the taxpayer in the long term. Effective early-years intervention is a vital component of achieving that. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North used evidence of studies in the US&mdash;for example, the nurse-family partnership's home visiting programme&mdash;to demonstrate how effective that can be.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/6">A corollary of the focus on early intervention&mdash;the hon. Gentleman teased out this point effectively&mdash;is the requirement for greater diversity in the provision of services. We need experimentation and for people who are close to ground to be prepared to try something different to find out whether it works. That, of course, is an argument for greater localism&mdash;a point that the hon. Gentleman made&mdash;for trying to give greater powers back to local authorities and for moving away from over-prescriptive targets. That is vital, because doing so allows for greater involvement of the voluntary sector&mdash;a point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> and mentioned by the hon. Member for Taunton. Greater localism provides greater scope for the voluntary sector to play a role. Perhaps for understandable reasons, that sector shows greater initiative and experimentation in addressing some of these issues. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green made an important point about the need to enlist the voluntary sector, and my party supports doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/7">How do we ensure that we maintain the focus on early-years intervention? The key point in this debate has been about financing. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North is clearly thinking imaginatively and radically about ways in which we can deal with that, and we certainly encourage him to continue to do so&mdash;it is incumbent on all of us to do so. The key problem is how to capture the benefits. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> made a good point about the difficulty of some of the expenditure being incurred in one area and some of the savings in other areas. We need to think about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/8">May I just raise a small note of caution? The hon. Member for Nottingham, North argued that the current climate has made us think more radically about borrowing, but I do not think that he will be surprised to hear me say that we need to be a little cautious about that. One of the arguments for early intervention is that it will lead to long-term benefits. I am not going to get into a debate about the current state of public finances, but there are long-term difficulties with the borrowing that we face, and I am nervous about that. There is clearly scope for reprioritising within the existing budget, to find savings that enable us, for example, to abolish the couple penalty in the tax credit system and to provide more health visitors. All that is possible within existing budgets, but I shall end on a conciliatory note, because we have had an excellent debate. The hon. Gentleman deserves to be thoroughly congratulated on pushing the agenda; it has support certainly from my party and, I believe, from all parties.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-13a.29.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="29"  time="011:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090113/halltext/90113h0005.htm#09011363000482">
	<p pid="a.29.1/1">I agree with the three points that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> outlined at the beginning of his contribution. First, there is a need for new housing in all the areas represented by all the hon. Members in this Chamber. Secondly, that housing should be of good quality and, particularly, of high environmental quality. I am proud that the Oxley Park development in my constituency has eco-houses of the highest quality, which have been occupied extremely quickly both by people buying them and through social ownership or social renting. Thirdly, housing needs to be provided in parallel with the necessary infrastructure underpinning it.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/2">Although we are talking largely about physical infrastructure, I also want to stress what I describe as the soft infrastructure, which needs to accompany new communities and has always been developed in Milton Keynes, which is not yet at the end of its first development plan, a small proportion of which is still being completed. When I talk about soft infrastructure, I mean the social organisations, including voluntary organisations and other social infrastructure, that have to be developed as a community is enlarging and, in the case of the areas that hon. Members and I represent, becoming considerably more diverse.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/3">From there, we diverge, because I want to talk largely about housing need. What I say will be very different from what others say because Milton Keynes is very different from the rest of the Milton Keynes and South Midlands area. Milton Keynes is a hugely successful and highly dynamic new town or new city. During the previous recession, growth continued in Milton Keynes, albeit at a slower pace, obviously, but at a faster pace than in the rest of the country, and I am confident that Milton Keynes will also weather the current recession, and that growth will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/4">The concept of growth has been embraced by, for example, the Milton Keynes economy and learning partnership and has been set out in its economic vision, &quot;From New Town to International City&quot;. Milton Keynes looks forward to being the 10th largest city in the UK in 2030. The superior facilities that we have&mdash;for example, our shopping centre, theatre and art gallery&mdash;surpass innumerable other facilities and are enjoyed by many of the constituents of the hon. Members ranged on the Opposition Benches. I except my colleague in the other half of Milton Keynes, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase>, because they are our joint facilities, but the constituents of all the other hon. Members are happy to come and enjoy those facilities. We all benefit from the fact that we have a superb regional theatre. We are happy to welcome the constituents of the other hon. Members to enjoy those facilities and help to make them economically viable and hugely successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.1/5">As I said, we are different from the rest of the Milton Keynes and South Midlands area. In particular, we are different because we have more jobs than houses. Therefore, many members&mdash;one third&mdash;of the work force in Milton Keynes live outside the constituency and commute in. I accept that many of those live outside the constituency by choice. They may prefer living in a village to living in an urban area. However, a great many of them live outside the constituency because sufficient housing is not available in Milton Keynes, and they are priced out. I have innumerable examples of individuals who have moved from the north of England and got a job in Milton Keynes, but who have not been able to get a house in Milton Keynes because they cannot afford it, so they come as far south as they can, which is not as far as Milton Keynes. If more people who already work in Milton Keynes could live in Milton Keynes, the effect on the environment would be much reduced and the quality of life of those individuals would be improved.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.1/1">Indeed, Mr. Martlew.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/2">The Milton Keynes Partnership pioneered the infrastructure tariff&mdash;the forerunner of the Government's community infrastructure levy&mdash;which funds development in parallel with housing. For example, we have the biggest school building programme in the country. The Members for both Milton Keynes constituencies have opened new schools to meet the pupil need. Those schools were built before all the houses in the catchment areas had been built; they then grew as the areas grew. We have also had massive investment in our health system. We have had new GP surgeries and dental surgeries&mdash;the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes recently opened a dental surgery&mdash;and the hospital has been expanded.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/3">That is very different to the situation in 1997, when I was first elected. Health provision then did not meet the needs of the population. However, it has now expanded, as has the annual funding, and it is now more or less in balance with population growth. None the less, it needs to continue growing as the population increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/4">There is also the transport infrastructure. I think particularly of the improvements to junction 13 on the M1 and the extra platform at Milton Keynes Central station. Regrettably, some of the gilt was taken off the latter because of Network Rail's mess- ups in January, when the west coast main line completely seized up. Infrastructure should improve in parallel with the increase in housing. The Milton Keynes Partnership tariff allows for forward funding, so that the infrastructure can be put in place despite the fact that the housing development takes place later; we know that the developers are committed to topping up the fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/5">I suggest that the rest of the region gets its act together, as has Milton Keynes. All local councils should draw up proper infrastructure plans and work with developers and the Government to ensure that those plans are achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/6">As for the kind words of the hon. Member for Aylesbury about the east-west rail link for Aylesbury, I am more than happy that Aylesbury is getting its station paid for. However, I hope that Aylesbury Vale district council will commitment itself to improving the housing that is supposed to help fund those railway improvements; it should not say that it wants the infrastructure but not the housing. We need to have both in parallel; just as we need infrastructure with the housing, so we need the housing with the infrastructure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-13a.37.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1397" speakername="Nadine Dorries" colnum="37"  time="011:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090113/halltext/90113h0006.htm#09011363000498">
	<p pid="a.37.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Cummings. I wanted to focus on the growth forecast for Milton Keynes and the premise on which that growth is predicted, but given the time restrictions, I shall instead focus my comments on one area in particular. First, however, I should like to thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> for securing this debate. I have attempted to do so many times, but I am delighted that he succeeded, because his speech was incredibly erudite and compelling. He did a far better job than I could ever have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/2">I shall talk about the 2,000 residents of Aspley Guise in Bedfordshire. So that the Minister understands where I am coming from, I shall describe Aspley Guise: it is one of the most beautiful areas in Bedfordshire. It is a village made up of Tudor cottages; it was mentioned in the Domesday Book; it is surrounded by green-belt land; it is a chocolate-box village, which are traditional in England&mdash;the kind of village that one imagines when talking about the typical British village. It also has a unique, supportive and strong community. People in Aspley Guise very much identify themselves with the area and the village, and it is an honour to be a Member for a constituency with such a strong community.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/3">Aspley Guise is threatened with being subsumed by the expansion of Milton Keynes and becoming part of what is, or will be, a modern city. Obviously, the 2,000 residents of Aspley Guise object strongly to that, for a number of reasons, one of which is that they fear losing their identity and culture. They worry that the village will cease to exist and become part of a modern city. Those 2,000 residents are hugely concerned about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/4">I can do no better than put it in the terms expressed by councillor Fiona Chapman. Imagine that someone has a big house and wants to build an extension and that, rather than applying to have it built in their own garden, they apply to build it further away in the garden of someone else's smaller house. That is how the residents of Aspley Guise feel. They believe strongly that the expansion of Milton Keynes should take place within the boundaries of Milton Keynes and that a good area of green-belt land should surround Aspley Guise as a buffer between Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes expansion. They feel very strongly for a number of reasons. They understand that the 224,000 proposed new homes were based on a predicted jobs growth of 192,000. That was not realistic even then. As we know, Milton Keynes had just 0.1 per cent. economic growth at the time, when the rest of the region was benefiting from a growth of 0.6 per cent. Today, David Frost from the British Chamber of Commerce spoke about the dire situation for economic growth and businesses in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.1/5">Aspley Guise residents and I should like to ask the Minister why he thinks that we need to completely subsume a village on the basis of economic growth forecasts that we know will not be realised. I shall finish quickly, because I know that my colleagues want to speak. As the Minister has been an assiduous and efficient chairman of Milton Keynes and South Midlands, will he come to Aspley Guise to look at the area and meet the people and listen to their concerns? Unlike the previous ministerial visit, I guarantee that it will be a calm, beneficial and warm meeting. So, when the Minister is in the Milton Keynes or the Bedfordshire area, will he do us the honour of paying us a visit, so that he can see for himself the area that will be destroyed by the growth of Milton Keynes?</p>

	<p pid="a.40.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> on securing this debate and I congratulate all hon. Members who have spoken&mdash;they have made the case on behalf of their constituents and raised their concerns. I shall try to be brief to allow the Minister as much time as possible to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" name="Brian Binley">The hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley)</phrase> said that the Minister was lucky. I am sure that he feels very lucky to have the pleasure and responsibility of responding to debates of this nature, but it feels like groundhog day because there are so many in Westminster Hall. There is a consensus that there is a massive unmet housing need, but there is frustration&mdash;not only in the region that we are talking about, but the whole country&mdash;because the process is the wrong way round. Local people do not feel that they have an opportunity to speak or that what they say will have an impact on the outcome. We end up having so many debates in Westminster Hall on such matters because they provide the only opportunity for Members to raise their constituents' points.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/3">The organisations that take the decisions lack accountability, but so does the process. I have spoken in such debates before, as colleagues have, and tried to gain an understanding of the process and to see how we could make an impact on it, but we have debates when the regional Minister is absent, which leads to questions about their role in decisions. At least, in this case, we have the chairman of Milton Keynes/South Midlands&mdash;the Minister&mdash;responding to the debate, so there might be some accountability. However, in all too many cases the right Minister is not present.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/4">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> highlighted, Milton Keynes is different from other parts of the region, which raises the question why the region is carved out as it is. There are major accountability issues, which should be tackled if the Government are keen for people to buy into the process. Hon. Members are more than prepared to make the argument for meeting the housing need, but without accountability it is difficult to counter cynicism, even if the Government show willing.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/5">The issue is important because people are concerned that the sustainability of their communities is being undermined. They are worried about the impact that changes will have on their communities from a social perspective; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1397" name="Nadine Dorries">the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries)</phrase> made that point well. The proposed changes will not only mean that communities grow, but that they will change altogether, so the matter needs to be treated sensitively. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West made a valuable point when she spoke of the need to ensure that we have soft infrastructure. We need to support growth, but we should not undermine what exists. The danger is that the process does just that.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/6">The major environmental issues in the south-east were raised, such as access to water, and the impact of building on greenfield sites and of not protecting the green belt. Because of the planning process, developers have every incentive to develop sequentially, and we can guarantee that the greenfield sites will be the first to be identified. That needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/7">Ultimately, everything boils down to the economic sustainability of the plans. Hon. Members have already questioned the numbers of jobs and houses that will be generated, and we are now living in a completely different climate. There are Government announcements day after day on what they are doing to tackle the economic downturn, so I am at a loss about the continuing denial about housing numbers. The fact is that the Government's target for house building is not being met. The jobs are not there, and the construction industry faces huge difficulties, and the Minister and the Department for Communities and Local Government must adapt to reflect that changed world.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/8">There are some practical things that the Government could do. The new situation does not mean giving up on meeting housing need, because if anything the need for social housing will be even greater. What are the Department's plans to meet the changing need? For example, if properties are not being developed in the private sector, and if there is greater need for social housing, what can it do to meet the new need? Could the Minister show some flexibility on the percentage grant for social housing, and can any money be brought forward? How will he respond to the Taylor report, which focuses on building economically sustainable communities, and not simply massive urban extensions, to safeguard the sustainability of existing communities as well as provide for future housing need? Practical steps could be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/9">I would like the Minister to say that he is prepared to listen to the views of the constituents whom hon. Members have represented today. Will he provide a reassurance that the targets will not be set in stone, to be pushed forward regardless of those views, in the light of the changed economic realities with which we now live?</p>

	<p pid="a.43.3/1">I begin by welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Cummings, and wish you and other Members a happy new year. I must also apologise to you, Mr. Cummings, as I am afraid that I have three Adjournment debates today and you will be seeing rather a lot of me. This debate was a good start. It was a high-quality, well-argued debate, so perhaps I will now bring the average down.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> on securing the debate. Future growth of housing is of critical importance across the country, and it is essential that we have a good, mature debate and a positive and constructive conversation about the right way forward. As he said in his speech, I visited Aylesbury in October in my position as chair of the Milton Keynes South Midlands inter-regional board, and I was pleased to see the progress that had been made there. The growth of Aylesbury is important to the success of the sub-region, and a successful sub-region there, given its location, is important to the entire country. Its strategic location and its close proximity to London and to world-class universities such as Oxford and Cambridge, as well as the centres of higher education in its own area, means that it is well positioned to play a leading role in the UK economy as we move forward in the 21st century. It is important that we facilitate growth and development in that regard. I was pleased to see a report&mdash;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" name="Phil Hope">the Member for Corby (Phil Hope)</phrase> mentions this to me on a regular basis&mdash;by Oxford Economics claiming that Corby, which is in the north of the sub-region, was the best placed of any town in the country to weather the current market conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/3">I know from my visits throughout the region, which I really enjoy, and my meetings with people across the sub-region, that there is huge potential and ambition in the area. Council leaders and delivery partners have great ambitions for the future of the area, and the important vision of how growth can benefit existing and future residents was captured in today's debate by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/4">Three themes have been raised in the debate, and I would like to address all of them. The first is the need for more homes, and not just any old places, but quality homes built with local consultation. I absolutely agree with that. When I last visited Milton Keynes, I went to the Oxley park development and was really impressed by its sustainability and the high-quality environmental materials used. I hope that that model can be applied across the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/5">The second theme relates to jobs and how we cannot have a mismatch between housing and jobs. Again, I agree with that approach. The third theme relates to the key element of infrastructure, which has to be well planned in conjunction with local needs. That is the key theme, because we cannot think of any of those aspects in isolation. The location of homes needs to be thought about in close relation to the location of enterprise and employment areas, and the infrastructure and public services to help service those areas are absolutely key. The approach suggested by Opposition Members today runs contrary to the concept of the benefit of planning and of bringing everything together to ensure that we do not think of things in isolation.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/6">I will now look at the need for more homes. On his website, the hon. Member for Aylesbury states that almost everyone agrees that new homes need to be built, and it was pleasing to hear every hon. Member who has spoken today state that that is important. There is a broad national consensus about the need for more housing in the country, but I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West was right in saying that people genuinely believe that we need more housing, but want it built nowhere near them, and we need to combat that. I was disappointed to see that the hon. Member for Aylesbury had put his name on the petition on the No. 10 website to say no to new homes in his areas, because without new homes people will have to move away from where they grew up in order to get a roof of their own.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/7">There is a question of affordability. The ratio of house prices to average salaries in his area of Aylesbury is nine, meaning that house prices are nine times the average salary. That is not sustainable in any sense of the word. I would hate to see a situation in his constituency in which people who grew up in Aylesbury were forced out by higher prices. We need to address that by providing more affordable housing and more social housing. That is vital for combating that real social problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/8">The past 30 years have seen a 30 per cent. increase in the formation of households but a 50 per cent. drop in house building. There are 200,000 people in the south-east on waiting lists for affordable housing and over 37,000 on waiting lists across the Milton Keynes South Midlands sub-region, with over 2,500 in Aylesbury. We simply cannot afford to ignore that, because it is of absolutely vital importance. Good, long-term planning is key. Yes, it should be done in consultation with the local community, but it is vital if we are to address those real concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/9">I do live in the real world and recognise that the circumstances in the housing market at present are obviously very difficult, but there is no evidence to suggest that those long-term demographic changes are altering at all. Thankfully, we are all living longer, so we have an ageing population. Given social changes, such as more single people living alone, those trends will continue. I suggest that failure to act and plan for more housing now would simply store up problems for the future and that that would be irresponsible. That is my response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" name="Julia Goldsworthy">the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy)</phrase>, who questioned whether we should look at changing the targets. Given that the statistical evidence behind those targets is very robust and that it includes long-term demographic factors, we have to do it. Yes, in the current economic climate it will be difficult to get back up to the necessary speed and trajectory, but it has to be done, and the Government are up for the challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.3/10">An awful lot was discussed in the debate, and unfortunately I do not have the time to address all of it, but I want to mention one last point before concluding, and that is the point about planning and not looking at things in isolation. I absolutely agree with the sentiments expressed by those on the Opposition Benches on how housing must be thought about in terms of long-term planning, together with employment and infrastructure, but some of the suggestions made today, not least by the hon. Member for Aylesbury, run contrary to that. I think that he was trying to say that we should return to emphasising windfall development and ad hoc planning so that, when a site becomes available, we embrace it for planning, and I think that that view is wrong. It is not the right approach. Long-term planning for the future, bearing in mind the various pressures and circumstances, are absolutely vital. The ambition in the sub-region for&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-13a.54.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="54"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090113/halltext/90113h0009.htm#09011363000513">
	<p pid="a.54.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings. I know that the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase>, has been taken ill because his office has had the courtesy to phone my office. I wish him the best of health and hope to see him back soon. I am pleased to see that the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" name="Alan Campbell">the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase>, will be replying instead.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/2">The background to this debate is that the Gloucestershire constabulary faces a tough future in the next couple of years. The funding formula allocation that it has been given by the Government rises by just 2.5 per cent. in each of the next two years, which is right at the bottom of the floor. The specific police grants that the constabulary gets have been frozen, except for the one that funds police and community support officers. That means that the overall settlement is lower still at just 2.1 per cent. Given that the inflation faced by police forces, which is largely outside their control, is running at somewhere between 3 and 3.6 per cent., that represents a real-terms cut and a significant shortfall in funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/3">However, council tax payers in Gloucestershire are already hard pressed and we cannot afford to have a large increase in the police share of the council tax precept. Gloucestershire county council has delivered a record low council tax increase and I hope that the police authority will keep its low as well. For the Minister's benefit, it is worth saying that the county council is working in close partnership with the police and has funded 63 new officers specifically to go out on the beat in Gloucestershire. That is welcomed by the people whom I represent.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/4">Gloucestershire historically gets a poor deal for police funding from the Government and it is in the bottom six police forces for funding per head&mdash;&pound;58 a head versus a national average of &pound;81 a head. Even so, the spend per head by the police is about average for England and Wales. The circle has been squared by a higher than average council tax precept, and local people face an unfairly large proportion of the burden because the Government have refused to fund Gloucestershire police fairly. Will the Minister explain why Gloucestershire receives just 70 per cent. of the national average funding per head for its police services, which puts an extra burden on hard-pressed council tax payers?</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/5">In November, as I said, the Government confirmed the formula grant allocation rise of 2.5 per cent. for Gloucestershire for the next two years. In response to a request for information for this debate, the chief constable confirmed in a letter to me that</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/6" class="indent">&quot;with the exception of the neighbourhood policing grant&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/7">the one that pays for PCSOs&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/8" class="indent">&quot;all specific grants have been frozen...resulting in the total level of Government funding (formula and specific) only increasing by 2.1%.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/9">That compares to an average increase of 2.8 per cent. in England and Wales, with metropolitan forces seeing an average increase of 3.1 per cent. Yet again, it seems that the figures show that the way the formula works out means that the Government are penalising rural, as opposed to urban, parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/10">As I have said, total Government grant will increase by just 2.1 per cent, and my chief constable has said that the cost growth faced by the local police force is about 3.6 per cent. Consequently, that is about 1.5 per cent. above the increase in Government funding. Even if we are generous to the Government and use their estimate of cost growth&mdash;the gross domestic product deflator&mdash;that still shows cost increases running at more than 3 per cent. Why do we get such a bad deal from that funding formula in Gloucestershire? One of the principles underlying the funding formula averages out the differences between different parts of the police authority area. In a recent article in <i>Policing Today</i>, which I am sure the Minister has read, Gloucestershire's chief constable, Dr. Tim Brain, explains:</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/11" class="indent">&quot;This principle rewards areas of uniformity in population distribution, density and relative wealth. If...your police authority area is characterised by strong contrasts&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/12">as is Gloucestershire&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/13" class="indent">&quot;between partnership areas of high population density and other areas of low density, you tend to lose out.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/14">When the formula was introduced it was recognised that it was not perfect, so a damping mechanism of floors and ceilings was implemented to ensure that the impact on places such as Gloucestershire was reduced. In their Green Paper, &quot;From the Neighbourhood to the National: Policing Our Communities Together,&quot; the Government confirmed their plans to remove those floors, and the Minister for Policing has confirmed in the same language used in the Green Paper that they will be removed in due course. He said that it is the Government's</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/15" class="indent">&quot;intention to move to full implementation of the funding formula at the fastest pace that is compatible with ensuring the financial stability of all police authorities.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-12-09.36"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 December 2008; Vol. 485, c. 36W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/16">Will the Minister explain exactly what that means? Given that most police authorities that benefit from the floors think that their removal will mean a significant reduction in their expenditure, it does not sound as if doing so would be financially stable. However, if that is the case, we will never move to a position where the floors and ceilings are removed. If the Government's intention is to remove the floors and ceilings, either they believe that it will not have a significant impact on police authorities&mdash;I shall be grateful if the Minister will confirm that that is the Home Office's view&mdash;or they are moving ahead regardless of the consequences. The answer to the parliamentary question to which I have referred is simply a tautology and the way in which it is currently written is meaningless.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/17">In a letter to me last July, the chief constable said that</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/18" class="indent">&quot;there can be no doubt that if the financial implications of the Flanagan report and the green paper were followed through there would be a substantial grant cut for forces like Gloucestershire.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/19">The Minister will know that Dr. Brain leads on financial matters for the Association of Chief Police Officers and is therefore something of an expert on these matters. Will the Minister confirm whether the Department agrees with the chief constable's analysis of the financial impact on our county's police force of removing the floors? Is it the case that, as Dr. Brain states in his article,</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/20" class="indent">&quot;it is not at all certain that the current formula is any longer an accurate reflection of the relative needs of authority areas&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/21">Does the Minister think that the funding formula used to allocate funding accurately reflects the relative needs of different areas?</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/22">On some specific funding areas, the security grant is a good example of the Government's requiring the local police to undertake certain responsibilities but not funding them properly. Between 2005 and 2007, the security grant for royal protection was cut by 9 per cent., but the same demands are still being made of the police. Perhaps the Minister could explain why that is the case and what local services he expects the constabulary to cut. Alternatively, does he expect local council tax payers to pick up the funding for what are essentially national security responsibilities?</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/23">Another example is funding for PCSOs. The Government grant provides only 75 per cent. of the funding required, which leaves the constabulary&mdash;the council tax payer&mdash;to find the funds elsewhere to meet that Government policy. I remind the Minister that, at the last election, the Government promised that 24,000 new PCSOs would be introduced during this Parliament. However, they reneged on that commitment and cut funding by &pound;70 million in 2006. Most of the funding that was left went to the Metropolitan police, which gave local police forces a real problem. In summary, the cost of delivering Government-defined goals is increasing, but funding has been frozen. The Government have demanded that initiatives are followed through, but they have failed to maintain appropriate funding for them. As a result, other services must be cut or further burdens will be placed on local tax payers.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/24">At the same time as funding is being held down, costs are rising. Things are particularly difficult at the moment. The Government have set police pay awards nationally at 2.6 per cent., which is above the rise in the grant given to Gloucestershire, and the crime fighting fund, which is supposed to fund the cost of police officers, has been frozen since 2004. That places a further burden on the police that is completely outside their control. Considering the impact of increased fuel prices and the increased price of imported products procured by the police force because of the weak pound, the chief constable's estimate is that the police are facing an increase in costs at a rate of about 3.6 per cent., which is 1.5 per cent. higher than the funding that they receive from central Government. That gap has to be made up somehow.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.1/25">The poor settlement might tempt the police authority to go for the easy option of sharply increasing the council tax precept to cover the costs imposed on our police force by the Government. That would be the wrong thing to do. In this particularly tough economic climate, with household budgets under pressure, it is essential that council tax increases are kept to a minimum, and the police authority must play its part.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.1/1">The hon. Gentleman will know that, once a formula is put in place, over time, as circumstances change, the appropriateness of that formula will also change. From time to time, therefore, in this and other areas, it is the Government's responsibility to look at the funding formula. By announcing a three-year settlement, which will run until 2010-11, and by consulting on the new funding formula&mdash;two meetings have already taken place&mdash;we are trying to ensure that the new formula is in place by the time that the next round of finances is announced in 2011. If the hon. Gentleman is asking whether there would be sufficient change with the application of that formula to warrant a mechanism for guaranteeing the fairness that we have tried to ensure in the current funding formula, I am sure that that will form part of the discussion. In moving from one funding formula to the next, we anticipate not only that the formula will be improved, but that it will have built into it a mechanism to ensure fairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/2">The hon. Gentleman raised a number of specific points about royal protection and about funding for police community support officers. Let me encourage him by saying that discussions are already under way on what would be the best funding formula for 2011-12 onwards, and I encourage him to take part. The chief constable is already involved, and I urge Gloucestershire police authority and people from other force areas to take part in those discussions. It is in all our interests that we get the very best formula, not just for Gloucestershire, but for the rest of the country, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/3">Turning to council tax, the other important element of police funding, as the hon. Gentleman said, is the contribution made directly by local council tax payers through the police precept. The Government expect the average increase in council tax in England to be substantially below 5 per cent. in 2009-10. We have made it clear for a long time that we will not tolerate excessive increases in council tax. In this difficult economic climate, we will not hesitate to take strong action if necessary to protect council tax payers from excessive increases, including requiring authorities to re-bill if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/4">Final capping principles will be set out after authorities have set their final budgets, but my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government wrote to all local authority leaders on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-09">9 December</phrase> to say that the Government are prepared to announce the principles in advance if the circumstances suggest that capping may be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/5">Returning to the position in Gloucestershire, it is only right that local decisions are made locally by the chief constable, who is best placed to decide how to deploy resources. Gloucestershire is a relatively well resourced force, with 1,338 police officers in March 2008&mdash;205 more than in March 1997. That is an increase of 15 per cent., which exceeds the overall 11 per cent. increase for England and Wales. The police are also supported by 162 police community support officers and 684 police staff.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-13a.63.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="63"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090113/halltext/90113h0010.htm#09011363000523">
	<p pid="a.63.1/1">I am delighted to have this opportunity to introduce a debate on a big and important subject. I have two reasons for doing so. The first is local: like many other MPs, I am hearing from a growing number of constituents who are running into mortgage distress or who have faced or are facing repossession, and I wish to speak up for them. But I believe that every MP could say that; there are no special circumstances in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/2">The main reason for this debate is to try to pursue a series of questions about the Government's recent initiatives on repossessions, which I welcomed. Obviously, we will debate these matters on the Floor of the House amid the normal party political banter, but on this occasion I want to take advantage of the short Adjournment debate format to pursue what are, in essence, factual questions about where we are and where Government policy stands.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/3">My starting point is that the Council of Mortgage Lenders has estimated that there would probably be some 75,000 repossessions in 2009, which is roughly the same figure as occurred at the peak of the last recession in 1991. Of course, they are the tip of the iceberg. In the last recession, there were estimated to be some 350,000 cases of arrears of varying degrees of severity, and the current projections are that half a million mortgages may be in arrears of some kind at the end of this year. Could the Minister begin by saying whether he regards the CML's assumptions as sensible and realistic? Are they the assumptions that the Government themselves use?</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/4">I ask that question with a particular point in mind. Three months ago, the CML was using the same figure&mdash;75,000. It is still using it despite the introduction of what seemed to be quite promising Government initiatives. Does that mean that the CML's assumptions are not up to date, or does it mean that the situation is deteriorating? It would be helpful from the outset to get a sense from the Minister of the Government's working assumptions about the scale of the problem and how it will evolve during the coming year. As to why that is a problem, I hardly need to state the obvious. Repossession is a tragedy for families because it usually involves not just the loss of a job but the loss of a home at the same time. It is a double tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/5">However, there are some less obvious reasons why repossession is a problem. It is a problem for society, particularly for local government, because of the pressure that it brings to bear on social housing. Over the past few weeks, there has been an upward revision in the number of people on waiting lists from 1.7 million to 2 million, so the pressure is clearly there.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/6">In addition, repossession frequently results in distress selling, thereby driving down the price of housing at a particularly sensitive time and creating additional negative equity problems. Clearly, it is desirable from a wider market standpoint to avert it.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/7">Of course, there are many hidden costs. For example, before this debate I was sent a report on the incidence of mental health problems among people facing repossession. There is a great deal of general anxiety. A YouGov survey suggests that 44 per cent. of all mortgage borrowers are currently anxious.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/8">I would like to proceed by asking the Minister about each of the four components of the Government's response. There has been a flurry of positive initiatives: the pre-action protocol; the reforms to income support for mortgage interest&mdash;ISMI&mdash;which involves interest payments under the social security system; the mortgage support scheme in collaboration with the banks; and the mortgage rescue scheme. I shall deal with each of them briefly.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/9">The pre-action protocol, which my colleagues and I had been calling for for some time, was particularly important. It was an intervention in court rules by the Ministry of Justice to try to ensure that repossession is always treated as a last resort, that all other options are explored, and that financial advice is available. As I understand it, the Government's guidance to the courts should have that effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/10">A case that I recently encountered is the kind of case that the protocol should reduce or eliminate. The home of one of my constituents has just been repossessed by a company called Capstone Securities, a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers. My constituent had tried very hard to save his home. He had put an offer to the bank that he would repay 80 per cent. of his arrears on the spot and clear the remainder within two months, but the bank rejected it. It wanted to repossess, end of story, no negotiation. Many people have found themselves dealing with uncompromising, unreasonable creditors who operate in that spirit. My constituent has now lost his home, and because of the delay in selling, has seen all his equity disappear. There are thousands of stories of that kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/11">The questions that are now being asked about the Government's initiative, welcome as it was, are about its limitations, both legal and practical. Can the Minister tell us what kind of assessment the Government are making of how the new system of rules is working? One point that is made is that because the rules are guidance and not binding on judges, the judges quite understandably apply legal principles. They view a mortgage as a contract and therefore do not treat mortgage arrears as they would treat arrears on a tenancy. There is not a test of reasonable behaviour, and therefore mortgage lenders are able to repossess much more easily than a landlord is able to obtain repossession from a tenant.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/12">Another point is that mortgage lenders, particularly those outside the mainstream banking system, are often highly unreasonable. There are cases of legal costs being added to the bill without the need for any reference to the court, and of companies not being obliged to return to the original owner any equity in the property. There is a general unreasonableness in the way that court settlements emerge, and the guidance that the Government have established does not appear to deal with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/13">An additional difficulty has now surfaced: a legal precedent was set with GMAC just before the Christmas period in which the mortgage lender established that it could repossess without even going to court. Can the Minister give the Government's assessment as to whether that case is a serious problem or merely an anomaly?</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/14">Finally in this category, there are the problems in respect of repossession of buy-to-let property, and the vulnerable position of tenants who find themselves trespassing in their own home and being required to move out quickly, often within hours. I believe that the Government's new guidance suggests a stay of execution of up to seven weeks, but I would be interested to have confirmation that it is now being followed and is working.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/15">The second area of change is to the ISMI regulations, which cover interest payments through the social security system. The delay once someone is out of work is now 13 weeks rather than 39 weeks, and the scheme is extended to properties of &pound;200,000 rather than &pound;100,000. Clearly, the scope of the scheme has been enlarged. It would be interesting to know how many families the Government estimate will be helped by the enlarged ISMI scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/16">Would the Minister acknowledge that there is a problem in the scheme in respect of households in which two partners are working, which is often the case? An example was given to me of a family in which one partner with a salary of &pound;24,000 loses their job. Their partner earns &pound;7,000 a year in a part-time job, but because they are working more than 24 hours a week they are not eligible under the ISMI scheme at all. Despite a substantial drop in income, they cannot be assisted.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/17">The third area of support, which I shall spend a little more time on, is a mortgage lender-led initiative&mdash;the mortgage support scheme. It is an imaginatively constructive idea in which the mortgage lender absorbs interest arrears over a couple of months, and the Government, in effect, underwrite the arrears while they are in the process of being corrected. The feedback that I am getting, particularly from voluntary organisations, is that the scheme is now being very tightly drawn to exclude large numbers of people who might otherwise be eligible for it. One of the conditions, as I understand it, is that it would not include people in negative equity. Of course, in the current environment, that excludes enormous numbers of people, because the market is falling rapidly and those who need help most are effectively excluded from this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/18">I am also told that one of the difficulties that the banks themselves are advancing is that, by participating in this scheme, they have compromised their position under the financial regulations, because they are required to hold more capital if they have clients who are in arrears. The figures quoted to me show that the equivalent of between 30 and 80 new mortgages might be sacrificed for every case of a family helped under this arrangement. If that happens, it is completely mad and totally undermines the purpose of the arrangement. Is the Minister's Department discussing with the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority whether these bizarre regulations, which effectively undermine the good work that this scheme is doing, can be modified?</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/19">What is the Government's own estimate of the number of people&mdash;the number of families&mdash;who will be helped by this scheme? I believe that, on the day it was introduced, the Secretary of State made an estimate of approximately 9,000 people. I have not heard that number confirmed since. It would be useful to have an indication of the magnitudes we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/20">The fourth and final intervention is the mortgage rescue scheme, under which people who fall into serious arrears can become tenants in their own homes, which has the valuable objective of ensuring that, even though they cannot cope with the mortgage, they are not forced out on to the streets. I believe that there is a &pound;200 million package designed to make this happen. The feedback that I get is that this is now beginning to work, with the collaboration of housing associations and local councils. Clearly, because this scheme is decentralised, which is potentially a positive feature, it will necessarily be applied unevenly. Do the Government have any mechanism that would tell us where this programme is and is not being applied, whether they are bringing any pressure to bear on councils to introduce it and how they are monitoring its effectiveness? I understand that, for understandable reasons, local councils and housing associations are only willing to take people on if they have limited problems, which, again, excludes people with negative equity difficulties. It would be useful if the Minister provided feedback about what numbers we are talking about. Is the number that has been quoted&mdash;about 6,000 in the coming year&mdash;correct?</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/21">The answer to the problem of keeping people in their own homes, even though they are in serious arrears and cannot sustain a mortgage, is, in the private sector, sale and leaseback, the market for which is flourishing. There were some serious abuses in that market and the Government undertook an investigation, through the Office of Fair Trading, that reported in autumn last year. There is a recognition that that market needs to be regulated. When and in what form will that regulation take effect?</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/22">My concluding comments are these. We have had a series of initiatives that are valuable in themselves. However, the feedback that I get from the people who are potential beneficiaries, from the voluntary organisations that represent them and from the industry is that although they are valuable they are very limited. If we add 9,000 and 6,000, which are the estimates so far in respect of the two main Government schemes, we are talking about 15,000 people, potentially, out of 75,000 people, which is an important figure but is still less than a quarter of those involved. That leads to the necessary conclusion that, even with these schemes in place, large numbers of people will be repossessed this year. That raises the question of where they will live.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/23">We are in an environment where the provision of social housing is now deteriorating. Industry estimates show that the total number of units built for social housing in the year to the end of March is likely to be some 85,000, as opposed to 185,000 in the previous year. So we have a shortfall of 100,000, much of which is caused by failures of joint projects with developers. Repossession is taking place in an environment where the provision of social housing is deteriorating. How far do the Government's proposals match the severity and scale of the repossession crisis that we now face?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-13a.66.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="66"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090113/halltext/90113h0011.htm#09011363000524">
	<p pid="a.66.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I was struck, on listening to his excellent contribution, by how measured it was. As he said, we can, to some extent, keep party political banter out of this Chamber with regard to such a serious issue. I pay tribute to him for the manner and the measured way in which he addressed his points and asked his questions, as is always the case when he contributes to debates in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/2">In difficult times, the Government are committed to doing everything that they possibly can to provide support in the short term for borrowers facing difficulties and in promoting the long-term stability of the market. What the hon. Gentleman was saying with regard to repossessions was true. It is a major trauma that is, arguably, the biggest single difficulty that a person can face in their life. It affects people's relationships, their health&mdash;particularly their mental health&mdash;their well-being and quality of life. Children can be uprooted from their school and adults from neighbours, friends and family. In the current challenging economic climate, more people are understandably worrying that they could lose their home. The key point is that just as fear of crime is an important consideration that policies need to deal with, repossession and the fear of repossession need to be dealt with, too, so that people who may face economic difficulties and are not, at the moment, facing repossession can be reassured that the Government are providing real practical help and doing everything that they possibly can to ensure that a particular household can keep its home and that it will not be repossessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/3">The current figures provided by the Council of Mortgage Lenders show that there have been some 30,200 repossessions in quarters 1 to 3 of 2008, which represents about 0.26 per cent. of all loans. We accept that repossessions are rising, but we must also remember that the numbers affected at present remain small in comparison with the early 1990s, despite the fact that more than a million more householders now own their own home.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/4">I do not want to tell the House that I am complacent and I do not want to provide a lazy approach to this issue. The Government are working night and day to ensure that repossessions are minimised as much as possible. I want to reassure the House, and families throughout the country, that we are determined to help as much as possible. No household that experiences a temporary drop in income through no fault of its own, and which is willing to pay back what it can, should fear repossession.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/5">There is also an onus on householders, who should be required not to put their head in the sand. Instead, they need to talk to the lender if they are facing financial difficulties. In the week when people were returning from the Christmas and new year break, before the House was sitting again, I toured my constituency and visited the citizens advice bureau. In mentioning citizens advice bureaux, I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman, who is the CAB parliamentarian of the year. It can be important for people to talk to their local citizens advice bureau, which provides real practical help.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/6">As a Government we have taken important steps, as the hon. Gentleman graciously mentioned. We have introduced new schemes and expanded others. We have offered practical help to as many people as possible. The courts have agreed to the mortgage pre-action protocol, a legal agreement which sets out that lenders will only use repossession as a last resort and will look at all the other alternatives with the borrower, whether that involves reducing monthly payments or deferring for a time. Hopefully, that would address the point that the hon. Gentleman made about his constituent, which sounded tragic. Hopefully, that would not happen today. The mortgage pre-action protocol would mean that nobody would be repossessed within three months of the first missed payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/7">The hon. Gentleman asked how this scheme is working. I have to say that it is early days. We are working closely with the Ministry of Justice to ensure that we can iron out any potential difficulties. I would welcome the hon. Gentleman's mentioning relevant cases that he comes across in his work as a parliamentarian, and in his constituency, so that we can find out whether we can tweak out any of the difficulties to ensure that people get practical help.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/8">To help to ensure that households can be given advice, more funding has been made available for national debtline and Citizens Advice to help consumers with money problems. That includes almost &pound;6 million of additional investment to March 2011 in telephone advice and &pound;10 million to March 2011 to expand face-to-face debt advice capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/9">In the pre-Budget report, we announced reforms to the support for mortgage interest scheme. That benefit is available to those receiving jobseeker's allowance and other income support-based benefits to help people keep up their mortgage payments if they lose their jobs. We have raised the outstanding mortgage threshold so that households are entitled to receive it if they have less than &pound;200,000 remaining on their mortgage, and we have reduced&mdash;this is a key point&mdash;the waiting time so that people can receive it 13 weeks after they lose their jobs, rather than 39 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/10">Last week, I was at a meeting of a branch of the trade union Unite in my constituency. It consisted predominantly of subcontractors. As you will appreciate, Mr. Cummings, that is a volatile industry in which there are periods of unemployment. Those people mentioned that they are delighted with the scheme because in periods of economic volatility and uncertainty about jobs, it can provide practical help.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/11">For vulnerable households that would be otherwise eligible for homelessness assistance if their homes were repossessed, such as families with children, the elderly or the disabled, we have set up the mortgage rescue scheme. Those at risk of repossession because of other loans secured against their homes are also now able to apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/12">If the home owner can keep up some mortgage repayments, the local authority or housing association will buy a share in the home so that the monthly mortgage repayments are cut. If home ownership is no longer a realistic prospect, the local authority or housing association will buy the home outright and the family will be able to stay there as a tenant. Largely thanks to the proactive work of my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing, we have brought forward the introduction and implementation of that scheme. The first 80 authorities began fast-tracking their mortgage rescue schemes in December, and we shall announce imminently what is happening with other authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/13">We are in the process of establishing a new scheme to help people who are having trouble making payments but are not eligible for ISMI&mdash;income support for mortgage interest. We have in mind families in which perhaps one person within a couple has lost their job or income or experienced a dramatic cut in overtime or payments. Applicants must have an outstanding mortgage of less than &pound;400,000 and savings of less than &pound;16,000. We estimate that this will take care of 98 per cent. of all mortgages. People have to prove that they have suffered a serious drop in income, demonstrate that they have kept up some repayments for at least five months and commit to paying at least 25 per cent. of their existing monthly payments. The rest of their payment will be deferred and added on to the end of the term, guaranteed by the Government and the bank. After a year, the bank will look again at the circumstances and, if necessary, extend the deal for another year. The idea is to make monthly payments more affordable, giving people practical help and valuable breathing space to get back on their feet.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/14">The scheme is voluntary, but already the country's eight largest lenders, representing 70 per cent. of lending, have agreed to support the new scheme and pledged to work with the Government to develop it. Since the day of the Queen's Speech, when my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced it, we have been working with about 15 of the major lenders to get the scheme off the ground. We hope that the remaining lenders will also participate.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/15">We expect the scheme to help significant numbers of households to avoid repossession over the next two years. The hon. Member for Twickenham mentioned a possible target of 9,000 households being helped. The Minister for Housing has been absolutely clear about the fact that we are not setting a target or a cap on the numbers that might participate. It will be a demand-led scheme. People can feel reassured in coming forward that they have not missed a cut-off point. It is not the intention at all for household 9,001 not to be provided with help; the intention is to provide practical help to all households that need it.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/16">My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has announced a lending panel to bring together the Government, regulators, lenders, trade bodies and consumer groups. The panel will monitor lending to both households and businesses, encourage best practice throughout the mortgage market and ensure that lenders are aware of all the alternatives to repossession.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/17">We are working to address a number of concerns affecting specific groups. The hon. Member for Twickenham alluded to that. The Office of Fair Trading is developing guidance to help those who have taken out extra loans against their homes. The practice is known as second charge lending. The guidance will stress the importance of treating borrowers sympathetically and doing everything possible to avoid repossessions. New industry best practice guidelines, published in December, clearly set out how people can expect to be treated by their lender if they are experiencing difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/18">The hon. Gentleman referred to the sale to rent back market and the OFT's market study in that regard. It recommends that that market is brought within the scope of FSA regulation, and we shall be consulting on that shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/19">The hon. Gentleman touched on a very important matter. The fear of repossession and repossession itself do not hit just home owners. They also hit tenants; they, too, are potentially vulnerable. We need to act to help tenants who are not in arrears and who are working hard and paying their rent, but who face the prospect of their home being repossessed, through no fault of their own, if their landlord has secured a loan on the property. At present, evidence suggests that buy-to-let landlords are no more likely to be affected by repossession than other households. However, I am concerned about the issue and I recognise that tenants in the private rented sector would face eviction in the circumstances described, which seems unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/20">To protect those tenants, we shall ask the Civil Procedure Rule Committee to amend the rules so that buy-to-let tenants get up to seven weeks' notice if their landlord's mortgage defaults. At the moment, as the hon. Gentleman said, they have notice of as little as two weeks or even a matter of hours, which is not fair. We encourage all landlords and lenders to communicate with tenants so that they are given time to make alternative arrangements if their home is at risk. We also want to ensure that tenants who are at risk speak up, get independent advice and attend the court hearing so that their needs are taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/21">I return to where I started by saying that in these unprecedentedly difficult times, in which we are facing global financial pressures the likes of which we have not seen for many decades, the first priority of the Government is to reassure people. We need to ensure that wherever possible, families do not have to suffer the trauma and upheaval of repossession. People also need to be reassured that they do not need to fear repossession. All households at risk can benefit from the new emphasis on repossession as a course of last resort, and from the enhanced debt advice services. As I have made clear, we are also putting in place a variety of schemes, offering tailored and specific support depending on the individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/22">In a debate in this Chamber earlier today, I said that the watchword was &quot;flexibility&quot;. We need to work across Government, whether that involves the Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Ministry of Justice or my Department, to ensure that we have a seamless product that can provide practical help to families in order to minimise repossessions as much as possible. We need to be flexible. We need to learn the lessons from what happens on the ground, which the hon. Gentleman and others will bring forward, so that we can tweak out some of the teething troubles that we might see with these innovative schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/23">In these difficult times, we are determined to provide real help to households that are frightened. We need to reduce that fear as much as possible and we have put in place schemes to help to do that. The Government are ambitious to do more and I am sure that, working together in a cross-party consensus&mdash;that was the manner in which the hon. Gentleman made his excellent speech today&mdash;we can do more.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/24" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/25" class="italic">Sitting adjourned.</p>
