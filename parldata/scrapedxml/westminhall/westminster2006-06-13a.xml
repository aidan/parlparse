<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-13a.169.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" speakername="Richard Ottaway" colnum="169"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060613/halltext/60613h0169.htm#06061329000494">
	<p pid="a.169.2/1">There is a certain irony in our having this debate while it is raining outside. Perhaps that illustrates the problem we have in trying to get to grips with this serious matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/2">Although I have criticisms to make today, not all of them are laid at the Minister's door. I am the first to acknowledge that much of the present regime originated under the previous Conservative Government. I shall be critical on the issue of housing and planning, but I do not hold him responsible for everything that happens on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/3">There is a complexity in that my constituency is straddled by two water companies. Perhaps that has drawn my attention to the random way in which certain measures are being introduced by different water companies at different times. The north of my constituency uses Thames Water Utilities while the south of my constituency uses Sutton and East Surrey Water, of whose activities the Minister will be well aware. I have good relations with both companies. They keep me well informed and I believe that their management is thoroughly competent. I shall discuss the operations of the companies a little later.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/4">The background to the debate is that the south-east is experiencing a drought. There are plenty of estimates about which year the drought is the worst since; I have heard that it is the worst since 1995, 1974, 1933 and 1922. Whichever is correct, the situation is bad. The present shortage of rain started in November 2004, and there have been two dry winters since. In the 19 months up to the beginning of this May, only four had above average rainfall. During those 19 months, there was only 80 per cent. of the normal rainfall in the south-east, compared with 95 per cent. in the UK as a whole. However, October 2004 and, as we well know, May 2006&mdash;the two months straddling that period&mdash;were very wet, with rainfall of about 180 per cent. of what we would expect. If that is taken into account, rather worryingly, we are talking about the driest period for only 11 years&mdash;since 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/5">During that period, river flows have also been below average, although the Environment Agency says that the situation is getting worse. Groundwater levels in southern England are below average. Reservoirs in southern England were in the 83 to 88 per cent. full bracket at the beginning of May. The figure for the rest of the UK was 95 per cent. That is the shortage of water in that region. Two other factors are involved&mdash;demand and leakage&mdash;to which I shall return.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/6">The response of the Government, the water companies and the agencies, through the regime that prevails, was to introduce bans and orders. That is the correct response. Use must be restrained, because if there is no water, there is no water, and we must accept that.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/7">However, the application of some of the orders is bizarre. There have been a number of different interpretations of how a hosepipe ban is introduced. In any event, as far as I can tell, such bans have been largely ignored. Will the Minister examine the situation with micro-irrigation systems? As he is well aware, under a hosepipe ban, someone may use a watering can to water their garden, but a micro-irrigation system is technically banned although it is more efficient. Will he review that point?</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/8">There is also the question of why royal parks are exempt from a hosepipe ban. If there is a shortage of water, there is a shortage of water, so we are not talking about something we can juggle. In my judgment, a royal park has no greater priority than a garden in Croydon, South. We are all grateful to Alice Miles of <i>The Times</i>&mdash;I am sure that the Minister has seen the article&mdash;who exposed the hypocrisy that No. 10 is technically a royal park and seems to be getting round the hosepipe ban by having a tank of undefined size to water the garden there. If No. 10 can do it, why cannot my constituents do it? I do not expect the Minister to march into No. 10 and demand a halt, but the issue should be examined.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/9">That deals with hosepipe bans, but as we all know, Sutton and East Surrey Water has introduced a drought order and Thames Water Utilities is about to do the same, and that represents a more draconian approach to the matter. Royal parks will be exempt under the drought order. Why will Thames Water Utilities be introducing its drought order so late in the day? It will be introducing it at the end of the one of the wettest months that we have ever had. What had changed from the situation at the beginning of that month by the end of it? The situation surely cannot have been worse. What decision could not have been made at the beginning of May that was able to be made at the end of it? I do not believe that there has been more rainfall in central London than in south London.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/10">In the meantime, the top end of my constituency is subject to a hosepipe ban and the bottom end is subject to a drought order. That means, for example, that car washes may operate in the north of my patch but not the south. There are five golf courses in my constituency. In the north, they may be watered, but not in the south. There is no difference is the situation of the areas, in that they all use the same river basin and they are in the same water catchment area. The patchwork fragmentation of the water regime in the south-east needs to be examined. What is effectively an economic distinction is artificial. We should return to that. Let us not forget that we are not just talking about golf courses. Tennis clubs and bowls greens also face difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/11">The public are sceptical. Imposing a drought order is a serious matter. Car washes may still operate under a drought order if they use less than 23 litres per car. How on earth can we persuade the public to save water at home if they see a car wash operating during a drought order? If the argument is that we must look after businesses, we must recognise that a darn sight more people are employed in a golf course than in a car wash. Golf courses are big business.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/12">We need a coherent regime and water efficiency strategy, and not patchy implementation throughout the south-east. If we were to look at a map&mdash;the Environment Agency's map is as good as any&mdash;of the water companies in the south-east, we would see that there is a complete fragmentation. As we looked north up through the country, we would see that the areas are large and are built primarily around the river basins, such as those of the Trent, Severn and Thames. Why is there a patchwork in the south-east? Well, that is how things are set up. The most fragmented regime is in the areas of worst drought. As I said, I have high regard for the management, but the fragmentation of the regimes is not in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/13">I am sure that the Minister is aware that the water framework directive is coming over the horizon. It is one of the few decent bits of European legislation. The UK is obliged, by 2009, to develop a river basin management plan. This is a unique opportunity to review the strategy and to introduce much more co-ordinated measures than we have had in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/14">May I turn to the question of demand, housing and planning? London, of which Croydon is a part, is expecting to have 800,000 new houses by 2015. The south-east is growing by 1 per cent. per annum in respect of demand for water. The Government say that there is no problem in supplying the planned housing expansion with water, and they point to a figure of an increase in water demand of 0.1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/15">The excellent report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology described planning of water supply and water management as one of the foremost domestic policy challenges of the day. Paragraph 4.40 refers to the Government's approach and states:</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/16" class="indent">&quot;Whilst we welcome the Government's belated attempts to consider the likely impact of increased housing growth upon water use, we are completely unconvinced by the figures produced. Not only is the methodology flawed, but the findings are produced in such a way that even the Minister with responsibility for water issues misinterpreted them. The Government must be more transparent about the fact that their housing growth plans will have a very significant impact on water use in south east England, and focus on ensuring that the necessary preparations are made.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/17">The report continues in paragraph 4.47:</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/18" class="indent">&quot;It is worrying that the housing growth plans have not in many cases been factored in to the water companies' long-term plans, due to the way in which Government have initiated the planning.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/19">That report has no side to it&mdash;I am not being patronising, but the Lords produce good reports which tend to be non-political&mdash;but it goes on to discuss the need for proper consultation. When the Commons Environmental Audit Committee was chaired by my neighbour, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1857" name="Peter Ainsworth">the Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth)</phrase>, it said that it was dismayed that water companies had not been properly consulted. That point was picked up by the Lords Committee in paragraph 4.19 of its report, which says that Werner Boettcher, who is not a lackey, but managing director of Thames Water,</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/20" class="indent">&quot;told us that there had been 'very little consultation with water companies or the water industry'. He added, 'we have a statutory duty to provide [a] supply of water and the question has not really been asked, where is the water actually coming from?'...Similarly, the company's written evidence stated that 'the issues were not necessarily related to 'if' water could be supplied/managed, but 'when'...What appears to be missing is a thorough understanding and explanation as to how...land-use planning and water resources planning interact and what the Government policy for this is'.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-13a.175.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" speakername="Nicholas Soames" colnum="175"  time="009:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060613/halltext/60613h0169.htm#06061329000507">
	<p pid="a.175.0/1">I am very grateful to you, Mrs. Humble, and I propose to speak briefly. I hope that you and the Minister will forgive me, but I have to leave for a sitting of the Standards and Privileges Committee at 10.25 am.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/2">In support of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">the Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase>, I want to speak about linking development with water resources in my constituency. My contribution is intended neither to be as parochial as it sounds, nor to make a constituency point, because what I have to say affects many other constituencies in the south of England. The Minister knows that, because he is wrestling with problems that are not of his making and have existed for a long time, but they are being exacerbated by the Government's policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/3">The point that I really want to make to the Minister concerns the fact that in about 1999 I became aware of plans that might lead to the building of a substantial number of new houses in the south-east. There is clearly a requirement for more affordable housing and for other housing in the south-east&mdash;nobody disputes that&mdash;but the sheer scale of the proposals is critical for us. He might know that more houses have been proposed in the Gatwick diamond, incorporating Mid-Sussex, Horley, Horsham, Reigate and Crawley, than there are in Milton Keynes. However, the Gatwick diamond does not have the special infrastructure that Milton Keynes has been accorded, so the infrastructure development is impossible. It is impossible to build such a great number of houses merely on the basis of developers' contributions, and without the Government's support for the infrastructure. It is not a matter for argument today, but water is an important part of infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/4">When I heard about those plans in about 1999, I wrote to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" name="Chris Mullin">the hon. Member for Sunderland, South(Mr. Mullin)</phrase>, who was a Minister in the then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, to warn him about them and to explain some of the difficulties. I went to see South East Water, which was then managed by a remarkable woman, Margaret Devlin. She, sadly, has now left her post as managing director to emigrate to New Zealand. Given the scale of the problem that she faced, I do not blame her. She is an outstanding woman, and she did a very good job. The Minister knows her, and she is a loss to the water industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/5">I went to see Mrs. Devlin to discuss openly with her the extent of the Government's consultation with the water companies on the sheer scale of the proposals for my constituency and elsewhere in the south-east. She told me, and I must say that I was surprised, that the water companies were not official consultees. On<phrase class="date" code="2000-05-26">26 May 2000</phrase>, after I had been to see her, she wrote to me, and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/6" class="indent">&quot;South East Water firmly supports sustainable development and has regular contact with East and West Sussex Planning departments on future development plans. However, until water companies becomes statutory consultees of housing development, it is difficult to see how such planning can be truly sustainable if no account is taken of water resources availability.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/7">She continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/8" class="indent">&quot;I make no apology for emphasising the need for water companies to be statutory consultees on housing development. It is important to understand that the request to become statutory consultees in the planning process is not driven by a desire to block development, rather to assist in ensuring that all factors are considered in respect of location, water resources and the environment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/9">Subsequent to that meeting, Mrs. Devlin sent me the interesting points and the brief that Water UK submitted to the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee's 1998 inquiry into those matters. Inter alia, Water UK recommended:</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Water companies should be made statutory consultees in the planning process to reflect their statutory obligation to supply&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/11">It made a number of other important points, too. The Government decided to pay no attention to those recommendations. Their response, as set out byMrs. Devlin in a letter to me dated <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-16">16 March 2000</phrase>,</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/12" class="indent">&quot;was that as the current informal arrangements work reasonably well, the need does not exist to formalise the role of the water company in the planning process. The key issue here is that whilst informal arrangements can and do work, more often than not by the time the water company enters the planning process it is usually to receive confirmation of the planning details.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/13">I wholly support all the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, who knows a great deal about the subject and has made a number of important strategic points. Mine is a strategic point, too, but it is linked to a local point. The Government cannot go on willing the scale of development planned without matching the infrastructure to make it happen. The issue is not just water, but hospitals, roads, schools, care for the elderly and everything else; all those things are increasingly underfunded. In the south-east, the Government have stripped money from the shire authorities to give it to the north. At the heart of the matter lies the Government's policy of sustainability.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/14">I shall end with only a slight jibe at the Government's expense&mdash;tendered, of course, with immense respect, affection and admiration. After my exchanges with Margaret Devlin, I tabled a question for the heroic Deputy Prime Minister, asking him to define sustainability. It was not for urgent answer; the usual space of time was given. The departmental answer was that I would get a reply &quot;in due course&quot;. In other words, the Department did not have a clue what sustainability meant. Three weeks later, I got an answer&mdash;a detailed letter&mdash;explaining to me what sustainability means. Some of what was in that parliamentary answer has not survived through to today; because of the sheer scale of the developments proposed, the Government's new definition of sustainability has had to be thrown out of the window.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/15">Part of the definition of sustainability is the prudent use of natural resources, and so say all of us. The Government must will the way, and must enable us to cope with the level of housing and development proposed for my part of the world. There are proposals for East Grinstead and elsewhere in my constituency, where we need housing, and where young people desperately need to be able to buy affordable housing. However, there is also the question of how they are to travel on roads already gridlocked, and there are hospitals already under great pressure with tremendous deficits. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">The hon. Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> knows all about that, given where she comes from. The proposals are, by the Government's own definition, unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/16">All that I ask of the Minister, who has a proven record of being reasonable, rational and sane on such matters, is to give us some understanding and some hope that the Government will consider with the greatest care the points being made by colleagues from across the south-east. They are not anti-development; I was distressed that when I went to see the Minister for Housing and Planning at the Department for Communities and Local Government, she was extremely aggressive with a delegation from the south of England, which included my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1642" name="Francis Maude">the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude)</phrase>, and my hon. Friends the Members for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), and for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert). She suggested that we were just anti-housing, and were simply nimbys, but we are not. We want the housing, and we know that we have to have it, but we want it to be proportionate and to scale, and we want sustainable resources that will be used in a sensible and prudent manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/17">Again, I apologise, Mrs. Humble, for the fact that I have to go at 10.25, but I shall read with great interest what the Minister says. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, for allowing me to take part in this debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-13a.177.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" speakername="Martin Horwood" colnum="177"  time="010:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060613/halltext/60613h0169.htm#06061329000508">
	<p pid="a.177.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase>, on securing this debate on an important issue. The problem, as he said, is stark, and statistics suggest that, in some places, ground water levels and river flows are the lowest on record. We have been experiencing drought since November 2004, broadly, and the Environment Agency says that rainfall has been much lower during that period than during the drought of 1974-76. In some places, rainfall is at its lowest since the 1920s, as the hon. Gentleman said. There has been some respite, due to the traditional English summer solution&mdash;May was the wettest that there has been for some time&mdash;but that provided only partial respite from the drought.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/2">Clearly, there is a possible connection to the progress of climate change, and what were once extreme environmental phenomena&mdash;such as heat waves and floods&mdash;are increasingly becoming the norm. The impact on communities and businesses is major, and will get worse with climate change. It will certainly get worse in the south-east and other parts of the country where enormous increases in housing are proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/3">I sympathise with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase> on trying to get a definition of sustainability out of the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I tried, too, and I was on the Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I did not get a comprehensible answer, either. The ODPM's approach to housing supply came overwhelmingly from the Barker report, which was a very clever report, I am sure, but was commissioned by the Treasury, and was asked an essentially one-dimensional question about how to tackle house prices through housing supply. I am sure that Kate Barker is a clever woman, but she gave an essentially one-dimensional reply, which was that one would have to increase housing supply by a great amount to make a difference. She was given no particular environmental remit. The lack of consultation on policies that emerged from the Department formerly known as the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;its lack of consultation with the water companies has been pointed out&mdash;demonstrates the lack of environmental impact assessments in the whole post-Barker process.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/4">I was struck by the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee report; buried in page 121 of it are comments from Professor Adrian McDonald, who points out that Kate Barker's report says:</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The analysis suggests that the additional housing supply needed to reach the Government's ambition of 200,000 net additions per annum within a decade would result in a marginal increase in water use.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/6">Professor McDonald comments:</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/7" class="indent">&quot;This assertion of a very minor increase in water demand is at odds with every other forecast that has been made and with the plans of all water companies in the south east. As yet it has not been possible to trace the origin of the statement to a verifiable item of scientific analysis.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/8">He mentions an earlier report, commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, that asserted that</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/9" class="indent">&quot;over the next ten years a huge increase in the demand for water in the south east is forecast.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/10">The newly named Department for Communities and Local Government needs to do some serious thinking on the environmental impact of the numbers of houses that it proposes for the south of England. I hope that it will look again at those numbers and consider different ways of tackling the issue of affordability, perhaps by thinking about household size and the availability of credit, so that it has a less one-dimensional approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/11">On our response to water supply crises, we have various tools at our disposal. The Government approach has essentially been one of regulation and restriction up to now, but all the numbers suggest that the trends are now all in the wrong direction. Let us consider first leakage numbers. I should praise the Government a little; I am not entirely sure what Water UK is&mdash;from the name, one can only tell that it has something to do with water and is British&mdash;but the Government-introduced report by Water UK is extremely useful in giving us statistics on what is going on in the water industry. Strangely, Water UK has quite different numbers on leakage from Ofwat. The Minister might look into that inconsistency.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/12">Water UK reports that, from the water industry's total output of about 18,000 megalitres per day, there is a loss of about 5,000 megalitres per day. The comparable figure from Ofwat for the same year is only 3,649 megalitres per day, so there is some inconsistency there. Both the Ofwat and the Water UK reports show a consistent trend since 1999-2000 of an annual increase in water leakage since 1999-2000. According to Ofwat's figures, from a level of 3,243 megalitres per day in 2000-2001, leakage has increased each year to reach 3,649 megalitres per day. According to Water UK's figures, it has consistently increased from just over 4,200 megalitres per day in 1999 to over 5,000 megalitres today in 2003-04. The trend is clearly going in the wrong direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/13">Ofwat's response to that trend strikes me as remarkably complacent. It talks of an economic level of leakage, but it does not appreciate the potential impact of the trend going in the wrong direction. There are good guys and bad guys in its analysis of the water companies. Companies such as Wessex, Yorkshire and Dwr Cymru are clearly going in the right direction in tackling of leakage and appropriate action is being taken, but companies like Severn Trent and Thames Water are going in the wrong direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/14">The charts included in the Ofwat report show that Thames Water's long-term target for reducing water leakage by 2010 is, in terms of litres per property per day, way above the highest number for any other water company today. Thames Water is a case apart. In Government jargon, it is in need of special measures, or a turnaround team. It needs drastic action and, given its profit levels, it seems inappropriate for it to continue to have such a poor record and such unambitious targets set for tackling leakage.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/15">Demand management is going in the wrong direction as well, according to Water UK's report. It shows that in the last year for which there arefigures, domestic water demand was still increasing, from 149 litres per person per day in 2002-03 to more than 150 litres in 2003-04, and that non-domestic demand is also increasing. Strangely, it shows a slight reduction in total water consumed, which I am slightly confused by, but there is clearly still a problem in demand management. The comparison with approaches to climate change and carbon emissions is quite striking. Part of the solution lies in big infrastructure by tackling leakage and distribution problems, similar to the distribution problems to be tackled in energy supply. There are the big technological fixes&mdash;the George Bush approach&mdash;such as desalination plants and the like, but I am somewhat sceptical of those.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/16">As in energy efficiency, a large part of the solution must lie in water efficiency and micro-scale solutions to water demand. The House of Lords report includes recommendations relating to what is euphemistically described as &quot;black-water recycling&quot;. It includes examples from Australia of localised black-water recycling. It acknowledges that the &quot;yuck factor&quot; has to be overcome in this respect, but says that there is more to be done provided that&mdash;I am reassured by this&mdash; sufficiently expert plumbing exists to prevent the confusion of water supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/17">We must also consider the greater use of grey-water recycling and rainwater capture. Even the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee is relatively unambitious about that. It suggests extending the remit of the Energy Saving Trust and the Carbon Trust to water, which seems a slightly strange solution. Grants are available for the microgeneration of energy, through what was the clear skies programme and is now the low-carbon buildings programme, but no similar grants are available for rainwater capture technology for householders. I know about that because I am trying to do it myself. There might be potential in the long term to create a resource management agency that takes on the function of the Energy Saving Trust and the Carbon Trust, perhaps incorporating water, which extends to other areas of resource management with ecological implications, such as the use of nitrogen. The Government should be ambitious in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/18">Regarding water efficiency and reducing our &quot;water footprint&quot;, various demand methods are available. The only one used at the moment is the emergency measure&mdash;an example of failure&mdash;of moving from hosepipe bans to drought orders. Such measures are introduced when all other systems have failed. It is a shame that we have ended up in this situation, but we have done so in many parts of the country. I agree with the hon. Member for Croydon, South: it is important that such measures are applied fairly. There should not be exemptions for royal parks and people should not be able to use water for car washes and swimming pools while the livelihoods of people working in the horticultural suffer because of their inability to use water.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/19">We must encourage metering. I support moves to encourage strongly the use of water metering nationwide, and perhaps we might consider alternatives to water rates even for those houses that do not have water metering. For instance, each house could have a home water efficiency rating operating on a different basis to water rating, which uses the rateable value of the house in 1973&mdash;an increasingly bizarre basis on which to base water rates. We should encourage a greater understanding of the &quot;water footprint&quot; and the impact of water use by households. For instance, Friends of the Earth has suggested that estate agents might quote water ratings so that people buying a house might have a sense of what its &quot;water footprint&quot; is.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-13a.181.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1407" speakername="Gregory Barker" colnum="181"  time="010:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060613/halltext/60613h0170.htm#06061329000511">
	<p pid="a.181.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">the Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase> on securing this important and timely debate. It is, perhaps, typical that on a day on which we are debating drought and water shortages, the heavens should open and it should pour with rain.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/2">We should not forget that although we face the threat of below-average rainfall over a period of two years or more and the long-term challenge of climate change, we are also likely, with the incidence of drier, even hotter summers, to face increased flooding, because our weather patterns are changing. We are having longer, drier periods, and short periods of intense rainfall. That is dangerous, because when the land dries out and bakes, its ability to soak up rainfall is undermined, particularly when it comes suddenly and in great amounts. As a result, in the summers&mdash;possibly this summer&mdash;there will be an increased incidence of flooding. That is a real possibility in London if we have storms through the summer during a prolonged period of overall dry weather. Weather patterns are confusing, and we must not allow ourselves to be lulled into thinking that just because we get rain every now and again, that is the solution. The problem is much more complex and long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/3">The tone of the debate, which was set by my hon. Friend, has been constructive. There is great concern outside the House, and there is a large degree of anger in the south-east at the Government's housing plans. Overall, people are very reasonable: they know that the weather is one of the few things that they cannot blame on the Government. However, the Government's insistence on building millions more homes in areas that already suffer from water stress seems perverse to many people. No more new homes should be built until a proper assessment has been made of the availability of water. Indeed, such assessments should be made a condition of planning consent, and all new homes should have water-saving installations fitted as standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/4">Many of my points have been touched on already in the debate. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase> spoke powerfully and with great authority about the overwhelming numbers of new homes proposed for the Gatwick triangle. He is a formidable champion for his constituents, but he also spoke sensibly about a much wider problem which affects more people than just those in his community. He is absolutely right: the owners of those new homes, particularly if they are affordable homes, will not thank the Government if they find, when they move into them, that the area is subject to acute water pressures, stress and shortages, to say nothing of the other strains on social and physical infrastructure. I simply cannot understand why the Government have been so resistant to water companies becoming statutory consultees. I hope that the Minister will update us on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/5">That is not just a problem in the Gatwick triangle: the Thames Gateway is one of the areas that is most prone to flooding, yet has one of the scarcest water supplies. That is a real conundrum for the Government to solve, and we look to the Minister for a more sophisticated answer than those that were forthcoming from the ODPM.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/6">If I had to summarise the approach of Labour Governments to water since they came to office in 1997, the first thing that I would say is that they have had a lack of long-term strategic thinking. Water is not a laissez-faire industry: the private sector is dominant, but the Government are ultimately responsible for drawing up and having ownership of the 25-year plans, but we hear little of those plans, which are sketchy and underpowered. New as the Minister is to his job, I would like to hear more about his vision for the long-term direction of the UK water industry in those 25-year plans, and what personal input he will have into shaping those plans so that they are fit for the21st century.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/7">The second feature that has characterised the Government's approach is a general lack of ambition to grip the complex problems. A few weeks ago, I had breakfast with the chief executive of Skanska, which is one of the UK's largest engineering contracting firms. He told me that he was amazed that people are prepared to accept what the water companies say about their ability to make repairs and to progress with updating leakages. He said that it simply is not true that they can go only so far so fast, or that their best is the best that can be achieved. He talked about infrastructure building, in relation to cost, speed, the convenience with which works can be done and the disruption necessary to the public in built-up areas when renewing pipeworks and large infrastructure projects. He compared what his company does in the private sector for many of its clients, particularly in the gas and electricity sectors, with the relatively mundane progress that the water companies are making. What is the Minister going to do to stretch the water companies, challenge their assumptions and encourage them to go further and be more ambitious? What are those companies doing to introduce best practice in contracting and engineering to ensure that the solutions that they are implementing are the most effective for the 21st century?</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/8">The third element to the Government's approach is a lack of national aspiration to match best practice in water consumption to patterns across the rest of Europe. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> said in his thoughtful and sensible speech, a great deal of which I wholeheartedly agree with, water consumption has grown significantly, almost horrifically, in the past 20 years, particularly in the south-east. Our record compares poorly with developed economies elsewhere in Europe, particularly Germany, which has a much better record than we do for saving water. It uses approximately one third of the water per consumer that the UK uses. Why? The answer is that it has far better, much more effective and widespread rainwater harvesting, and widespread utilisation of practical measures such as dual-flush loos. That sounds a bit mundane, but lavatories account for about 25 per cent. of total household demand for water, certainly according to the figures that I have seen for 1997-98. I believe that the figures for the UK have grown since then.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/9">In contrast, according to Ofwat, this year, privatised water companies are losing 3.6 billion litres a day, which is up to 500 pints per home. So, we are not encouraging householders to be more prudent with their water use; we are falling far behind what other countries are able to do with sensible, non-panic measures, and at the same time, the water companies are losing huge amounts of water. That sends a poor signal to the water user.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/10">The German Government have also succeeded where we have failed in raising public awareness of using less water per se. Each person in the south of England uses, on average, 160 litres of water a day&mdash;an increase of almost 50 per cent. on 25 years ago and about 10 litres each above the national average for water use. Yetthe south-east is the most water-stressed area of the country. We need to work out&mdash;and we look to the Government to work out&mdash;a joined-up, broad-based water strategy. Those are the sorts of thing that should be happening and that we should be familiar with in a 25-year plan that attends both to the responsibilities of the water companies and to the education of consumers, so that we can begin to change consumer habits. I do not mean that that should happen in a panicky way or as a knee-jerk response, but that we should have a long-term plan to change consumer behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/11">I shall discuss the issue of the private sector versus the public sector. At the time of the privatisation of the water industry, 15 or so years ago, there was some controversy&mdash;particularly in Parliament&mdash;but there was also, in the water industry generally, a great deal of excitement and the beginning of a new can-do attitude; it was shaking off the old, municipal public sector administrative ethos. That sense of excitement and expectation gave rise to a huge influx of new investment. Since privatisation more than &pound;55 billion of private sector money has come in to fund large-scale projects. Yet the sense of excitement seems to have been lost. The Government accepted privatisation, but, rather than embracing the possibilities, they seem at ministerial, Government and public policy level grudgingly to have accepted the status quo. They display little ambition and few ideas about how the private sector can best be harnessed and utilised for the benefit of the consumer. I should like to hear fromthe Minister, as he is coming new to the job, about his vision of how the private sector and public policy can work more effectively hand in hand to grapple with the long-term challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/12">Other hon. Members have mentioned the excellent House of Lords Science and Technology Committee report, and I want to refer to two or three of its conclusions in particular. The Committee recommended:</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/13" class="indent">&quot;There should be wider stakeholder engagement, by means of new regional boards consisting of environmental and consumer interests as well as Ofwat representatives. These boards would determine how resource development, leakage reduction, network renewal and demand management could most appropriately be balanced in each area, with the resulting plans guiding Ofwat's funding decisions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/14">I think that, again, that reflects what I was saying about a lack of holistic, joined-up vision at the top of the water industry. I should be interested to know how the Minister proposes to respond to the first point made by the House of Lords Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/15">The Committee also recommended:</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/16" class="indent">&quot;Ofwat and the Environment Agency should take a realistic approach to the essential development of new resources.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/17">It added:</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/18" class="indent">&quot;To enable the water companies to undertake the necessary long-term planning for new resources, we call on Ofwat to agree indicative water prices for each company for up to 24 years into the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/19">The hon. Member for Cheltenham was right when he said that we must address the issue of Ofwat's having put so much emphasis on keeping down the costof water that it is perhaps jeopardising the long-term value of the water industry. We must be prepared to take a broader look at the costs of investment if the water industry is to be fit for purpose in the21st century. I detect from this morning's short debate a great deal of consensus, which should make it easier for the Government to tackle difficult issues such as metering and the possibility of water bills increasing in the longer term, to fund investment. However, we shall not have confidence about companies pushing for increases if there is no strategy at the top of the water industry to which everyone can sign up.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/20">Another point that the hon. Member for Cheltenham made was also dealt with in the House of Lords report, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/21" class="indent">&quot;Ofwat and the Environment Agency must also work together to ensure that water companies maximise their promotion of water efficiency, and have the necessary resources to do so. We also recommend that the remits of the Energy Saving Trust and the Carbon Trust be extended to cover water efficiency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/22">Like the hon. Gentleman, I question whether using those two agencies for water is the best way forward, but the idea that there should be a comparable model for the water industry, taking a holistic approach to consumer education, public information and private sector strategy, is extremely valuable. A water saving trust that could be the repository of grants, information and strategic thinking would be very welcome. That holistic approach is sorely lacking in the water industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/23">Finally I discuss once again the issue of development, particularly in the south-east. However we discuss the water industry in the country and whatever reasonable, sensible, consensual discussion we try to have about the long-term challenges that face the industry and about the direction that the Government are taking, the public will never sign up to increases in their water charges or to the idea of getting used to using less water or taking more sensible measures in the home if they feel that the Government are turning a blind eye to the most important issue affecting water demand&mdash;massive house building in the south-east. It is essential that the Government not only listen, but demonstrate that they are listening to communities in the south-east who are desperately concerned about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/24">Whether the development is on a small scale of a few hundred houses at parish, village or town level, or whether it is the much larger developments that the Deputy Prime Minister is championing in Milton Keynes, the Gatwick triangle or the Thames Gateway, it is essential that the Government should be able convincingly to demonstrate that they are listening to the water industry and environmentalists, and that the homes being built are sustainable not just in name but in nature. So far no one in Parliament has been convinced that the Government's sustainable homes programme is anything but a good brand for a dodgy product. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.185.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship today, Mrs. Humble&mdash;and to see it raining outside. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate on water shortages, which is a matter of significant public concern, particularly in the south-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.0/2">We can all agree on the importance of providing a sustainable water supply system capable of meeting the essential needs of consumers and industry now and in the future. That requirement has been highlighted by the current drought in the south-east, which the Environment Agency considers to be the worst for30 years and which, if we have a hot, dry summer, could be the most severe for 100 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.0/3">One of the Government's earliest initiatives on coming to power in 1997 was to hold a water summit, which produced a 10-point plan for action. That plan included actions to reduce leakage, improve water conservation and efficiency and review the abstraction licensing system and drought management. It might help hon. Members if I were to go through some of the framework that has been established under the Water Act 2003. I think that that will answer some of the questions that have been raised in a helpful and constructive debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.0/4">The 2003 Act has facilitated a number of important changes to further the sustainable use of water resources, promote water conservation, strengthen the voice of water consumers and increase the opportunity for competition in the supply of water. The Act makes the provision and maintenance of water company drought plans, which were previously prepared voluntarily, a statutory requirement, and legislation to bring that about was passed in October last year. Drought plans need to balance a water company's duty to maintain public water supplies with the need to avoid or minimise any potential damage to the environment. They contain various actions that water companies may introduce, depending on the length and severity of the drought. Those actions range from hosepipe bans to drought orders to restrict non-essential uses of water during a drought. Before publishing their final plans, water companies are required to complete a public consultation on their draft plans and to respond to any representations that they receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.0/5">In discussing drought plans, the hon. Member for Croydon, South asked several questions about potential anomalies with hosepipe bans. At the <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-01">1 June</phrase> meeting between the water companies, the Consumer Council for Water, Ofwat and the Government, we jointly agreed to review the scope for hosepipe bans. I appreciate the difficulties that the hon. Gentleman faces, given that there are two different regimes in different parts of his constituency, but I am sure that he will appreciate that both the companies must respond to the different specific circumstances that they face.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.0/6">In the south-east, most water companies are following their drought plans and have imposed hosepipe and sprinkler bans. As hon. Members will be aware, the Secretary of State has granted drought orders to Mid Kent Water, Southern Water and Sutton and East Surrey Water further to restrict non-essential uses of water. Thames Water has now announced that it is to apply for a drought order. As with the other drought order applications, the company's case and any objections received will be given careful consideration before a decision is made.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.0/7">Perhaps it would be appropriate to comment on some of the points that the hon. Member for Croydon, South made about Thames. Obviously, it is for Thames Water itself to decide whether it needs to apply for a drought order. It needs to act on its plan in the light of its perception of water resource issues, and it has now judged that this is the right time to apply for a drought order. We have had several meetings with Thames in recent weeks to discuss its water supply situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.185.0/8">The hon. Gentleman also asked about imposing fines on Thames Water for leakage. As he will be aware, it is for Ofwat, as the economic regulator, to take action if Thames fails to meet its leakage targets. I should just say, however, that Thames tells me that 3,000 of its 10,000 pipe miles in London date from before 1850, so it faces specific circumstances with regard to leakage. None the less, the company itself has admitted that its leakage rates are unacceptably high, and it is right that there should be a strong focus on its meeting its leakage targets.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.2/1">Before the Minister moves off the issue of hosepipe bans and drought orders, let me point out that there has been a great deal of comment in the press about the anomalies involved in the various hosepipe bans and drought orders and about people's concerns at the various ridiculous rules and regulations, which simply do not seem fair and donot reflect the reality of how we live our lives in the 21st century. Does the Minister believe that there is now a strong case for examining all the complex rules and regulations involved in drought orders and hosepipe bans so that we can come up with a fair, simple set of up-to-date regulations that everyone can understand and sign up to?</p>

	<p pid="a.188.2/1">My understanding is that leakage is projected to fall further. By 2010, the targets plan for a further reduction of 7.6 per cent., compared with 2004-05 levels, so there is pressure to reduce leakage rates. However, we will, as I said, want to keep leakage rates under review, taking into account costs, technology and international best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/2">I was going to comment on the current system of hosepipe bans and regulations, and, indeed, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1407" name="Gregory Barker">the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Mr. Barker)</phrase> encouraged me to do so. There is a case for looking at the system, because there are anomalies in it, some of which were highlighted by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. At our <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-01">1 June</phrase> meeting with the water companies, we agreed that we would want to review the operation of hosepipe bans and the regime, and it is important that we continue that work for the long term so that the general public can feel confident that a fair system is in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/3">I move on to the comments that the hon. Member for Croydon, South made about the construction of a national water grid. He will be aware that the idea has been examined and raised many times over the past30 years, but it has pretty much always been decided that it would be nothing like economically sustainable. Water is a heavy liquid, and the cost of pumping it around the system is significant We should bear in mind that there have been substantial improvements in connectivity between water companies over the past few years, particularly in the south-east. Networks have improved, but not to the extent that the establishment of a national grid is feasible at the moment, and that is the overwhelming consensus of the water companies, the Consumer Council for Water, Ofwat and the Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/4">Since the 1999 periodic review, water companies have prepared 25-year water resource plans. Until recently, they were not required to, and did so only on a voluntary basis. The 25-year plans describe how each company aims to achieve a sustainable supply-demand balance for the public water supply. They are updated annually by companies and reviewed by the Environment Agency for consistency with its own 25-year national and regional water resources strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/5">The big change is that the provision of water resources management plans is to become a statutory requirement under the Water Act 2003. A consultation on proposed regulations relating to the process ended in April this year, and the responses received are being considered. Our aim is for the new regime to come into force by next April.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/6">Like drought plans, water resources management plans will be subject to public scrutiny and consultation. The plans are designed to reflect the best available information on the consequences of climate change, an issue to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> referred, and to ensure that the latest research is factored into them on an ongoing basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/7">The plans should also reflect the Government's &quot;twin track&quot; approach to managing water resources, which is based on demand management, developing sustainable resources where they are needed and the implications of demographic change and increasing pressures for housing on the demand for water resources. I shall explain in detail how the system is supposed to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/8">The Government recognise that there are concerns that their plans for significant new house building in the south-east might have an adverse impact on supply and demand for water in that area. That additional demand should be factored into water companies' water resource plans, and it is important for those plans to be updated as more detailed information on housing numbers and locations is provided, to ensure that resources are available to meet any increase in demand. As a Government, we want a two-way dialogue between water companies and planning bodies to ensure that that happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/9">During this debate, we have perhaps missed the point that the water companies are statutory consultees on regional spatial strategies and local development frameworks, and that the planning bodies will be statutory consultees on water resources plans. That is an important step forward. However, a question is left in my mind about how individual planning applications should operate, and there is at least an arguable case that significant planning applications should have very clear inputs from the water companies, and that those inputs should be taken into account as part of the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/10">I am not sure that the water companies themselves would want to be statutory consultees for every planning application, but the fact that they are statutory consultees to the local development framework and the regional spatial strategies is an important and significant point.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-13a.190.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" speakername="Ian Pearson" colnum="190"  time="010:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060613/halltext/60613h0171.htm#06061329000520">
	<p pid="a.190.0/1">I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but we are talking about private companies. If the market decides that there is a more efficient way to allocate those resources, market forces will be expected to drive further consolidation in the industry, subject to the normal concerns of regulations and competition. I would expect that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/2">I make the point back to the hon. Gentleman that there have been significant improvements on connections between companies' networks. Water sharing between water companies is going on to meet variations in demand. To that extent, the market is deciding that, where it is sensible to join up, that should happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/3">The current and future long-term water resources plans identify a range of options for meeting the supply-demand balance. Supply side options include new reservoirs and desalination plants; both are identified in the plans of some companies and will need proper appraisal for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/4">As the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle said, the additional demand for water from new development will depend also on the extent to which water efficiency measures are incorporated into the new buildings. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Communities and Local Government will undertake a joint consultation on options for further regulation to secure improved water efficiency in homes and buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/5">The hon. Member for Croydon, South said that the Government should lead on water efficiency. As he will be aware, in October 2005 we established a water saving group to encourage the efficient use of water in households and help ensure the long-term sustainability of the water supply. The group's action plan has five different workstreams dealing with targets, the evidence base, best practice, education and policy. I chair the group that includes the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Environment Agency, Ofwat, the Consumer Council for Water, Water UK and Waterwise. Each workstream is led by a different organisation, and a great deal of work is going on.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/6">A number of hon. Members raised the issue of water metering, which has been actively considered by the water saving group. Increased water metering can contribute to helping achieve a sustainable long-term water supply and demand balance. Currently, there is water metering in about 28 per cent. of households and, as part of the work of the water saving group, we are looking at ways to enhance the rate of metering in water stressed areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/7">A number of hon. Members mentioned the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee report, which was published last Tuesday following a 10-month inquiry into water management in England and Wales. It is wide-ranging and makes a number of recommendations on improving water management. I do not have time to go into a number of the points raised in this debate, but I should say that as a Government we are doing much to address such issues as the labelling of white goods and the use of grey water, mentioned by the hon. Member for Cheltenham. Perhaps I can write to hon. Members to outline our views. Our response to their lordships will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/8">In conclusion, it is clear that to achieve the sustainable use of water resources, we need to introduce a combination of measures&mdash;when necessary, through regulation&mdash;to balance supply with demand, including the promotion of best practice and advances in technology. A partnership between the Government, the water regulators, the water companies and communities is required, all working together to ensure that there are sufficient supplies of water to meet demand, both now and in future.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.1/1">May I say from the outset that I am absolutely delighted to head up this debate on mesothelioma and fairness to victims? I wish to thank several people who have contributed to this campaign, none more so than my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase>, who has been at the heart of the campaign. I have been extremely grateful forhis help, advice and support. Likewise, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase>, who unfortunately cannot make it to this debate, has also been extremely helpful and supportive. The advice and co-operation of the TUC have been exemplary, and I also thank Thompsons, the local solicitor, which has represented a number of the victims and their families during this difficult period.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/2">Current and former shipyard workers such as myself live every day with the fear that the dreaded fibre is inside us. As it can take up to 50 years to manifest itself, people in our communities live in fear that someday they will be struck down by this horrible disease. The only compensation that they can get is the knowledge that their families will be taken care of when they are no longer with us. I for one have been to too many funerals and seen too many families suffer as a result of this terrible disease, mesothelioma.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid point. It was quite humbling&mdash;excuse the pun, Mrs. Humble&mdash;to witness people in hospitals and hospices go through this traumatic period in their life, and to see at first hand the excellent support that they get from our medical staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/2">My hon. Friend makes a point about the health service. If I may digress slightly, let me point out that there is medication on the market that does not present a cure for mesothelioma but definitely helps in prolonging someone's life. If someone has only12 months to live, prolonging their life for even a month would be extremely helpful. The medication is Alimta, and it would be helpful if the Government were to give it a sympathetic hearing so that it could be offered by the national health service.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.3/1">Having had informal discussions with the main political parties, I understand that there is cross-party support for legislation to try to address the wrong that the Law Lords have done. Unfortunately, but not untypically, no hon. Members from the Scottish National party are here, although I am sure that, like me, my hon. Friend will be not surprised about that, because they only work part-time anyway.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Mr. Hutton, announced in a recent press release his intention to work in partnership with insurers to ensure faster compensation for mesothelioma sufferers and their families, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/3" class="indent">&quot;As an MP in a ship building area, I have seen at first hand the effects that exposure to asbestos can cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/4" class="indent">Mesothelioma is a particularly unpleasant disease and the time between diagnosis and death is often tragically short.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/5" class="indent">No amount of money will ever compensate individuals and families for the suffering and loss caused by mesothelioma, but it is doubly important that the process for claiming compensation does not add to the distress experienced by individuals and their families.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/6">The press release continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/7" class="indent">&quot;The DWP will work with the Association of British Insurers, the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers and the Department for Constitutional Affairs to urgently identify ways to speed up the settlement of claims. We all believe there is more that can be done to improve the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/8" class="indent">Our aim&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/9">I stress the word &quot;our&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/10" class="indent">&quot;is to ensure that wherever possible sufferers of mesothelioma can receive compensation whilst they themselves can still benefit from it, at the same time knowing that their families will be secure in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/11">Mr Hutton said he would report back on progress made&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.195.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on initiating this debate and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> on the work that he has done.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/2">As someone who represents a constituency that had a large asbestos factory, I have been shocked at the Law Lords' decision, as have other hon. Members. It has caused widespread anger in the community. I have received scores of letters from families who have lost people because of mesothelioma and asbestos sufferers who still face the threat of mesothelioma. For us,as Members of Parliament, that decision must be overturned. That is why we are here&mdash;to represent the people who cannot fight for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/3">The Secretary of State referred to working with the insurers and companies, but such behaviour is typical of how insurance companies have acted in the past. The first Workmen's Compensation Act was introduced in 1906, but it was not extended to asbestos victims until 1931. I have a quotation from someone talking about workers trying to seek compensationfor industrial illnesses that sums up why, in the21st century, we are still in the position we are in:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Adequacy of compensation has never been a guiding principle of British workmen's compensation law. Payments thereunder have always been regarded, with some justification, as contributions wrung from employers, who have collectively and individually insisted upon the principle that the injured workmen should shoulder some part of the loss arising from circumstances which, in most cases, were wholly beyond their control&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/5">That was written in 1941, but with the judgment that we are discussing, it is as true today as it was then.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/6">From 1931, Turner and Newall, the company in my constituency, employed an insurance company to negotiate down people's legal entitlement. In 1932, for example, Turner and Newall paid Commercial Union 100 guineas a year for the privilege of doing that job, and in 1931 it noted in its company minutes with some satisfaction that compensation of &pound;254 paid to a victim of mesothelioma was &pound;50 less than what that person was legally entitled to. It is about time we said that this has got to stop.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.1/1">I agree and would like us to adopt a solution like the coal health claims scheme. We must move away from addressing the issue in the civil courts, and have a common agreement on about what is going to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/2">Mesothelioma was first recognised as a disease only in 1956, by a South African, Wagner. What he described on visiting Turner and Newall in 1959 is typical of what we are dealing with:</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/3" class="indent">&quot;We went to lunch...where I was introduced to senior managers...I was questioned on my work and future interest. I explained about the investigations into the possible association between crocidolite and mesotheliomas and the nature of the tumours. They felt further work in this field was unwise, and advised against it...Their final opinion was that I was being foolhardy and wasting my time.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/4">That sums up the attitude of companies that have used asbestos and enjoyed its economic benefits&mdash;so much so that in 1964, when Frank Brooks became the first person in Rochdale to be diagnosed with mesothelioma, his widow was denied compensation because although it was admitted that there were tumours, that was not on his death certificate.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/5">We have to go beyond that. That sort of behaviour has to stop. The last asbestos all-party group heard what was happening in Australia, which is light years ahead of us in what it does to support mesothelioma victims. Lord Rodger is totally right in his dissenting judgment when he says that it is not for Law Lords to rewrite the law; that is a job of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/6">What are the options? There has been talk in the press of an amendment to the Compensation Bill, although some people have said that that would be unwise. I hope that the Minister can advise us better about his thinking in this area. I believe that the model should be what has happened for coal miners. A scheme should be set up that employers and insurers have to pay into. The compensation should be taken out of the hands of the court and of insurers, who will fight for their own self-interest. Payments should be timely. They should be made while people are alive rather than when they are dead.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> for obtaining this important debate. It gives us the opportunity to try to encourage my hon. Friend the Minister to work with other Departments and to propose a solution; I believe that there is a solution to this situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">The hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> referred to a scheme. I believe that it is time for us to consider introducing a no-fault liability scheme. We could introduce such a scheme without the obstructions to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> referred, which we have encountered with the miners scheme. I think it is fair to say&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that the miners scheme is in the possession of the courts and we report back to the courts three or four times each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/3">With a no-fault liability scheme for mesothelioma sufferers, there would be no need to do that, because we could have a scheme owned by the Government and contributed to by the insurance companies. I am aware that the Department of Trade and Industry has substantial numbers of claims to deal with, because they involve British shipbuilders, people who have worked for British Rail and others. If we jointly could develop a scheme involving the insurance companies in private industry, together with the Government, who are the insurer of the industries that I have just mentioned, we ought to be able to provide a no-fault liability scheme for all mesothelioma sufferers.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/4">As we are all aware, there is a real issue about the wives of workers who have come into contact with the fibres as a result of washing working clothes and who develop the disease. Many of these issues came to light in the 1970s around Hebden Bridge, where family members, particularly wives, developed the disease because of contact with clothes on which there were fibres. By breathing in the fibres, they developed the disease, so when we talk about a no-fault liability scheme, perhaps, as the Department for Work and Pensions starts to consider its review of industrial injuries, we could include all people with mesothelioma, including wives who unfortunately and unwittingly have developed the disease. There are real opportunities in that respect, and perhaps the Minister will comment on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North mentioned the <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-03">3 May</phrase> judgment and rightly pointed out that the law had previously been set by the Fairchild case. I recall the Fairchild case and the decision being made in the House of Lords; in fact, I was in the Gallery when the Lords delivered their decision in 2002. UCATT&mdash;the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians&mdash;financed that case. It set the law, and the law was that compensation awarded within the parameters set by the Fairchild case would be indivisible, so that if there was just one employer, that employer would be responsible for full compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/6">We must return to the position established by Fairchild, because even if we develop a no-fault liability scheme, as I believe we should and could by the end of this year, we will still have to retain the right of each individual who makes a claim under the scheme to go to law if they so wish. We must keep the routeto court for the person who wishes to take their case to court, even if we make an offer under a no-fault liability scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/7">Much has been said about the recent decision, which was a disgrace. It has put the families of mesothelioma victims in a very grave position. Lawyers are saying that it will have enormous implications. First, it will slow down the fast-track system in the courts. Secondly, it will impact on the length of time that a case takes. Thirdly, it may impact on the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979. There is some controversy in that respect. Last week, I received a legal opinion from Allan Gore, QC, in respect of the logic set by the Barker case. The Barker case suggested that if all the employers could not be traced, compensation would be reduced accordingly. The 1979 Act provides an avenue for people to be able to make a claim if they are unable to trace their former employer, so if the Barker case says that if an employer cannot be traced, compensation is reduced, it follows that a claim cannot be made under the 1979 Act, and that is the view of some QCs.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/8">However, the Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1682" name="Bridget Prentice">the Member for Lewisham, East (Bridget Prentice)</phrase>, said last Thursday on Second Reading of the Compensation Bill that her view, from advice given to her, was that the route to the 1979 Act, which provides a safety net, would still be open. We need to clarify that, because it is an important safety net and its availability needs to be ensured. Perhaps the Government could say, &quot;Well, whatever the Barker decision, the 1979 route for compensation will be kept open.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/9">We have an enormous difficulty because of the number of cases that are likely to arise. The number of mesothelioma cases has increased dramatically, from 153 in 1968 to 1,874 in 2003. In this past year there were more cases, and we are now nearing 2,000 a year. The Health and Safety Executive's view is that those cases will peak in 2015 or thereabouts at between 2,000 and 2,400. They will then plateau and taper away by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/10">Not all cases will disappear by 2050, because the cases that we are dealing with now are predicted on past exposures. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North referred to the fact that a new drug is available, which is important because we do not have much asbestosis, where the asbestos particles that get into the lungs develop fibrosis, a form of pneumoconiosis, as what tends to happen is that particles enter the lung without forming fibrosis. They stay in the lung and from that that presence there is the potential to develop mesothelioma cancer, which is a cancer of the lung pleura that is invariably fatal and is invariably caused by exposure to asbestos. Alimta helps, together with chemotherapy.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/11">The Australians are leading the field in health development. My hon. Friend is right that even if we get the no-fault liability scheme we must have a treatment and care strategy through the Department of Health. We need such a strategy because of the number of people whom we know will develop the disease. It is extremely important that we ensure that victims who develop the disease have compensation before they die. That is why I suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that a no-fault liability scheme is the way forward. I had a word with the Secretary of State for Defence, who is on board for a change, and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. We need to bring the Departments together.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/12">My hon. Friend mentioned the meeting with the Prime Minister, which was constructive. We hope to move forward and see an amendment introduced in the Compensation Bill that will restore the law established by the Fairchild case. We then need to move towards the no-fault liability scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on securing this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/2">Other colleagues have referred to the scope and effects of this pernicious disease that is suffered by workers who through no fault of their own were employed to do necessary work and an honest day's work, only to find many years later that the honest day's pay came at the highest price: a crippling illness and a premature death rather than the years of retirement to which we all aspire.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/3">I pay tribute to Tony Whitston and the Greater Manchester asbestos victims support group for their tireless campaigning on behalf of the victims and their families and for keeping me well informed. I have constituents who worked for Turner and Newall, which was taken over by Federal Mogul in 1998 and was the subject of an Adjournment debate in 2002 secured by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" name="John Battle">the Member for Leeds, West (John Battle)</phrase>, as well as constituents who worked in the old British Steel plant at Irlam, who were devastated by the collapse of Chester Street Insurance Holdings Ltd. in 2001. Asbestos sufferers and their families have had enough upset and uncertainty in their lives; I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will accept that today.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/4">As colleagues have said, the decision by the House of Lords in May this year was that, where two or more companies are responsible for the asbestos exposure and it is not possible to bring a case against them all, the amount of compensation might be reduced. That is outrageous and wholly unacceptable. The upshot of that decision is greater delay, more cost and more uncertainty for sufferers and their families, which is completely unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/5">I was pleased to hear the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions say at a meeting last month that the Government wanted to speed up compensation for workers suffering the effects of prolonged exposure to asbestos and from related diseases. One solution that I support, which has been mentioned, is a specific scheme for compensation. I hope that Ministers will work with the unions and the TUC to ensure that the matter is resolved quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/6">I would like to take a moment or two, and to test your patience, Mrs. Humble, to talk about the new drug mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase>. Alimta does not fall within the strict remit of the debate but it is pertinent. It can treat, but sadly not cure, victims of mesothelioma. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is due to report on the drug next month. I have written to the Secretary of State for Health to express my strong feelings. All new patients should have the benefit of the drug if appropriate, as it may increase survival rates by between 23 and 40 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/7">The Scottish Medicines Consortium has already approved the use of Alimta and it is available throughout Scotland. Patients in Salford and throughout Greater Manchester receive the drug, too, but that is not the case in all parts of the country. Our old enemy the postcode lottery is still in operation. It is estimated that the cost of prescribing the new drug to patients will be &pound;2.7 million in 2005-06 and will rise to &pound;5.2 million in 2009-10, which must surely be affordable.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/8">I shall return to the main thrust of the debate, as the Clerk is looking towards you, Mrs. Humble. It is for the reasons that I have mentioned that I support the all-party group, which is well led by my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone, and the mesothelioma charter.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/9">I and my colleagues will do whatever we can at a parliamentary level to ensure that the disease is made a national priority by the Government, that research is funded to improve diagnosis and treatment, that clinical guidelines on best practice are disseminated so that sufferers have access to the best possible treatment wherever they live and that the Health and Safety Executive is tough in enforcing safety regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/10">I send our best wishes to those who suffer from this crippling disease and their families, who give them endless and loving care and support. I say to those families who have lost a loved one and to the medical and other workers who provide treatment and care that we, as parliamentarians, will press our Government to do more to implement the mesothelioma charter in full and to implement a payment scheme as a matter of urgency.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on the eloquent way in which he opened it. He drew attention both to this dreadful condition and to the manifest injustice that has been created by the House of Lords ruling.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/2">Obviously, the dangers of working with asbestos may have been largely addressed in more recent years by health and safety regulations, although that has perhaps not yet been done to everyone's satisfaction. The situation now is far better than it was before. Thankfully, people working in affected professions should not necessarily now face the same levels of illness and risk as previous workers, but the legacy of the past is still with us.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/3">As several hon. Members have said, in particular <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone(Mr. Clapham)</phrase>, we have not yet seen the worst of this problem. Some 2,000 people a year die of mesothelioma. According to the Health and Safety Executive, the death rate is expected to peak at 2,500 a year in about 10 years time. Many of the cases are clustered in the constituencies of the hon. Members who are present. The constituency of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is also affected, and I know that he has taken a close interest in this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/4">As hon. Members have made clear, the condition does not only affect those who are working in the industries affected; in many cases, it affects family members, particularly wives. I hope that the Minister will address that point in his response. Any compensation settlement needs also to consider it, as well as dealing with the issue of the affected workers themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/5">Understandably, the decision of the Law Lords is causing great distress to mesothelioma sufferers and the thousands of bereaved spouses and families. It is fair to say that under the ruling, compensation will be denied in some cases on a technicality. As every hon. Member who has spoken has said, that is clearly wrong. Those affected want to know that they can receive 100 per cent. of a fair compensation package and that they can receive it in a swift and simple manner. That is far more important than whether the financial liability is ultimately from one or several relevant employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/6">The Liberal Democrats welcome the commitment made by the Secretary of State at the recent meeting of the all-party group that deals with this matter to bring forward legislation to address the concerns about receiving compensation in the wake of the Law Lords decision. The Prime Minister recently met a group of Labour MPs, having given an agreement to do so during Prime Minister's questions. From what has been said, that resulted in some clear signals of steps forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/7">It is also worth pointing out that this is not a party political issue. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> spoke eloquently about those who have suffered from mesothelioma in his constituency. The TUC and the Transport and General Workers Union have campaigned on this issue on behalf of their members, and have done so effectively. There are several support groups for the sufferers of mesothelioma and other asbestos-related conditions. Will the Minister confirm that they will all be consulted when legislation is drafted in response to the ruling?</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/8">Calls have been made for an amendment to be made to the Compensation Bill, which is due to be read in the House soon, having been considered in another place. As has been rightly said by several hon. Members, this provides a timely opportunity, not least because asbestos victims and their families want swift action and a just outcome soon. We also need to be sure that the right outcome is achieved. A number of different ideas have been put forward during this debate. If a consensus can be agreed on proposals in time for them to be included in the Compensation Bill, so much the better. Equally, we should not rush things and end up with a poor outcome and further rough justice for asbestos victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/9">A just outcome would deliver the following: full compensation for the victims and their bereaved relatives&mdash;I again pick up the point about family members, for whom the condition has also caused suffering&mdash;a simple way of accessing compensation, preferably with a single route to receiving compensation where there are multiple employer liabilities; and crucially, given the speed with which the condition can lead to death, the system that is put in place must be able to work quickly. As has been said by Labour Members, ideally those affected should receive compensation during their own lifetime rather than it simply being compensation that goes to bereaved relatives, as often happens.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.0/1">The hon. Gentleman's third point was about speed and simplicity.

	<p pid="a.207.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on securing this debate and on the way in which he opened it. Many other hon. Members throughout the Chamber have also made distinguished contributions on this very serious and significant matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/2">Such a situation should be broadly uncontentious between parties and we should work together to find a practical solution. No one will argue with the facts. Mesothelioma is a most unpleasant disease. It is insidious and people do not know that they have it or whether they may go down with it, but when they do, perhaps after exposure many decades previously, it inevitably results in extreme distress and death. Such people and their families probably have only a short time&mdash;an average of 18 months&mdash;to come to terms with the situation. Again, I think that there is agreement between parties that there is an emphasis and premium on us as law-makers to secure rapid and assured action for sufferers and their families. That is what they want, and it has been rightly emphasised this morning, as it was during the debate on Second Reading of the Compensation Bill last week. I believe that we are at one that that is the way in which we want to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/3">The Government have a responsibility to respond to the recent judgment of the House of the Lords in the Barker case. I interpret that judgment&mdash;I am not a lawyer and I do not demonise lawyers&mdash;as qualifying the impact of the earlier Fairchild case, which had a certain logic and a degree of imagination in meeting a real problem. In the Fairchild case the House of Lords decided that, notwithstanding that a single fibre of asbestos could be responsible for the onset of the disease and that by definition it was impossible to put the blame unequivocally on a single employer because no one would know whose fibre was involved, it was reasonable to impose a collective responsibility, liability or guilt on all somebody's employers during the time when they were exposed to asbestos fibres.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/4">The Barker judgment, not illogically, gives some legal proportionality by saying that although those circumstances may apply collectively, the responsibility is not joint and several, but is confined to the proportion of time spent with a particular employer. That has a certain logic to it; otherwise, in theory and in an extreme case, an employer who exposed an employee for one day could pick up the liability for40 years' of someone's working life.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" name="John McFall">the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Mr. McFall)</phrase>, who has now spoken, and my hon. Friends the Members for Livingston(Mr. Devine), for East Lothian (Anne Moffat) and for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin). I thank the hon. Members for Rochdale (Paul Rowen), for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)&mdash;a constituency that always sounds like it should refer to more than one hon. Member,although nevertheless it has only one&mdash;and for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) for the measured way in which they made their comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/5">It is unfashionable to do so, but I should also like to thank a former Member of Parliament whom many of us got to know, Tony Worthington. He worked tirelessly on this issue, and I am sure that he repeatedly met the Clydeside organisations that my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire will meet later this week. Tony Worthington was the first in this place to drum into me the importance of getting the treatment of mesothelioma victims right.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.1/1">My constituency does not have any shipyards or coal mines&mdash;in truth, it has very little industry&mdash;but it nevertheless has victims of mesothelioma, so my hon. Friend is right that it is a nationwide problem, and we need a nationwide or UK approach to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/2">I shall deal briefly with the specific points raised. The Government and I are as disappointed with the Barker judgment as hon. Members are, not only because it adds further uncertainty and difficulty, and puts a further burden on those who have been diagnosed, but because it will lead to unfairness in how compensation is provided and offered. In the Fairchild judgment, the characteristics of mesothelioma were considered; unlike other forms of asbestosis, it can be triggered by the inhalation of a single asbestos fibre, as we have heard.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/3">In respect of the specifics, our worry is that the claimants will have to trace all relevant defendants before liability can be apportioned and compensation paid. The Government find that utterly unacceptable, particularly at the victims' time of life, and given the position in which they will find themselves. It is important to concentrate on what the Government will do about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/4">On speeding up payments, there is of course the mesothelioma court fast-track process, which tries to speed up the delivery of the money to victims, so that they receive it while they are still alive. We are working with stakeholders and others on improving systems to speed up the tracing of employers and reduce the associated costs, including&mdash;this is an important point that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North, mentioned&mdash;the legal cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/5">Despite those efforts, the shocking statistic is that the average time taken to process and pay compensation is still longer than the life expectancy of the victim post-diagnosis. None of us should ever seek to defend that or be satisfied while that is the situation; it would be indefensible for any of us to make that case. That is why we want a much-improved system for paying that compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/6">Although I will not be provoked into commenting, I remain open-minded about the options available to the Government if a voluntary basis&mdash;best practice and good will&mdash;do not ensure improvement. We are working with many insurers who are alive to the nature of the problem and who, in many cases, are working very hard on it, but if that does not deliver the type of justice that Members of all parties expect, there remain other options, and we are open-minded about them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-13a.216.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" speakername="Oliver Letwin" colnum="216"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060613/halltext/60613h0174.htm#06061329000578">
	<p pid="a.216.1/1">It has been my practice once a year, roughly speaking, if I can obtain a slot, to raise with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs the concerns of my agricultural constituents, of whom I have a large number. The purpose of these debates has never been to trawl the past, but rather to highlight features of the future that I hope will help the Department to assist those of my constituents who remain hard-pressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/2">Clearly, the past year has been difficult for farmers. One of the most difficult parts of the year was the saga of the single farm payments. I am glad to say that, as far as I have been able to ascertain in recent weeks, most of my farming constituents have now received either the 80 per cent. payment or a full settlement.I am grateful for that and I want to put on record that I am grateful for the efforts that Mark Addison has made&mdash;as far as I can make out from my correspondence&mdash;to improve the situation in the Rural Payments Agency. I have experienced much speedier and effective responses since he came on to the scene.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/3">There are still outstanding cases that I want to bring to the Minister's attention, and this is a rare opportunity to get directly into his mind. Perhaps he would convey to Lord Rooker the sort of case that still constitutes an exception. The experiences of a couple in my constituency called Mr. and Mrs. Bugler constitute an extraordinary record of the sort of problem that we face. The RPA initially rejected their entire claim on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-26">26 August 2005</phrase>. It took six months, until February this year, for the RPA to accept that they had a valid claim. I know that it is a complicated process, especially with all the mapping difficulties that unfortunately occurred due to the IT system. The extraordinary thing is that since February that claim has been accepted, but the Buglers still have not received their payment. It is not a trivial claim&mdash;about &pound;13,000&mdash;and they are not rich people. Part of my purpose is to hope that the Minister will scurry back to his Department and ensure that Mr. and Mrs. Bugler receive their payment with all speed, but that problem is symptomatic not of anything like the majority&mdash;thank goodness&mdash;but of a substantial minority of my farming constituents. They are in such a position, and I hope that we shall see action to tidy up those cases rapidly.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/4">I am concerned, however, about 2006 single farm payments for west Dorset farmers. I am grateful for the ability to send in blank claim forms, as I am sure other hon. Members in rural seats are. That has certainly helped some who would otherwise have been stymied by mapping and record problems. It is clear that there is good will in this process on the part of the current management of the RPA, but there is still considerable evidence of confusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/5">Without dwelling excessively on this particular set of constituents&mdash;although it usually does happen that when something goes wrong one year, it turns into a problem during the next&mdash;I should say that since they completed their 2006 application in May, they have since received six letters of acknowledgment. Three were from the customer service centre and three from the operations director, which were dated between <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-18">18 May</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-31">31 May</phrase>. That in itself is neither here nor there: who cares about letters of acknowledgment? But it suggests that there might not be tight administrative control of the 2006 process yet.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/6">I sat through discussions with some of my farming constituents a few weeks ago, during which I was told tales of the difficulties people have had in getting their 2006 forms into reasonable shape, given the uncertainties generated by outstanding problems in 2005. I am extremely conscious of the fact that an organisation hit by endless difficulties is not the one best placed to deal with the difficulty of making up for 2005 and 2006. I hope that the Minister will do everything in his power to assist the RPA in clearing up 2006, by paying further attention to the staffing of the RPA if necessary, so that we do not have a repeat of 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/7">From my constituents' point of view, that process will be materially assisted if Ministers take steps to change the culture of enforcement in relation to cross-compliance. I shall give the Minister an example of what I am talking about. I have no difficulty with the concept of cross-compliance: it is necessary. However, much depends on the spirit in which it is enforced. I cite the case of Mr. and Mrs. Newman in my constituency. They had a livestock inspection in February 2005. There is nothing wrong with that: such inspections are needed. However, the results were not conveyed until October and there is much wrong with that. People should not experience that sort of delay. It would not normally take more than three months, so an excess of time elapsed before they were told the results.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/8">That, however, is not really the essence of the problem. The essence of the problem was the attitude taken to discrepancies. For example, they had made a mistake in that there was a zero where there should have been an &quot;O&quot; . I accept that zeroes and &quot;O&quot;s are not identical items and that that was a mistake, but when an agency such as the RPA has made the number of mistakes that we have experienced during recent years, it does not behove it to make complaint about a constituent who has placed a zero where there should have been an &quot;O&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/9">A second complaint was made: the letters &quot;UK&quot; were missed at the start of two tags. That was not the fault of the Newmans. The British Cattle Movement Service had issued the tags incorrectly, but it became a cross-compliance issue. I do not want to continue the tedious litany of the various bits and pieces that afflicted these constituents. When one goes round west Dorset, one hears from farmer after farmer about little irritations of this sort. Such irritations can lead to severe worries, especially if people have not received their single farm payment, or are dealing with bankers who are getting more and more impatient. I know that the Minister is a perfectly ordinary and decent human being from past experience, and if he were in the condition that I have described, he would feel the same. People get irritated, worried and cross because they try to iron things out and they cannot do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/10">In this case, my constituents tried to get the problems ironed out from October. They did not even get a reply until March, which rejected the appeal on the grounds that these were two genuine defects of cross-compliance. They appealed again and the RPA has now given up on the three ear tags without &quot;UK&quot; on them, but is still insisting on the zeroes and &quot;O&quot;s. However, the RPA has said that there will be no penalty. That is lunacy. It is not the way to run things. There ought to be a culture of acceptance of de minimis problems with cross-compliance and I am afraid that someone somewhere, very close to the top, has quite reasonably given out instructions saying, &quot;This is all very important and we have to have it shipshape. We must not have fraud or impropriety so be very careful that these things are done right.&quot; However, they did not add, &quot;But do please exercise some common sense. Don't go for the de minimis, go for the substantial things.&quot; I can see from the Minister's body language that I have made my point so I shall not continue to dwell on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/11">My next point is made to me repeatedly by farmers in west Dorset and it concerns a lack of symmetry. Traceability is everything with meats and livestock, and is clearly high on the agenda of DEFRA agencies. My farmers understand why that is; we have all been through enough in the past 10 to 15 years to know why that is. However, in the supermarkets in my constituency, and, I expect, in any other, one finds on the counter meat from Brazil. There is nothing wrong with meat from Brazil&mdash;there is nothing wrong with Brazil&mdash;but that meat is not traceable. I doubt whether it is remotely traceable. That sort of asymmetry causes real angst for my farmers. I hope that DEFRA will start to consider in more detail whether we are asking so much more of our farmers than of farmers in other parts of the world as to make it an uphill struggle for our farmers to compete, and how we can deal with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/12">I draw to the Minister's attention the extent of the continuing anxiety about bovine tuberculosis in west Dorset. I know that the Minister's colleague who deals with these matters has recently announced the good news that TB figures throughout the country have, slightly mysteriously reduced, and we welcome that, although I must say that I do not think that there has been any noticeable reduction in west Dorset. We all understand the reasons for the free movement controls&mdash;my farmers are certainly living with them&mdash;but there is a continuing sense that action must be taken reasonably speedily to address the causes of the disease. DEFRA needs to take us from the investigation, study and consideration that has been going on for a long while to some specific, well-organised action that involves proper testing. Now that polymerase chain reaction testing is available, we need to see it being used. We need to see effective action being taken, so that my farmers can begin to think that the future will be TB-free. That is of real concern to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/13">Unless this issue is pretty speedily addressed, more and more of my farmers, afflicted as they are by they are by the RPA problems, will begin to feel that they do not want to continue, as I fear a lot of them have in the past year, and will continue to sell out. In west Dorset, farming is not a marginal activity; it is central to our agri-industries, tourism and the whole life of the place. That depends not only on the number of acres being farmed, but on the number of farmers engaged in farming. We do not want TB to be a basis for reduced animal welfare and farmers going out of business.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/14">I hope that the Minister and DEFRA understand how far the severe problems of the past few years mask what could be a hugely optimistic set of trends. I hope also that alongside curing the administrative problems, DEFRA will help to advance the positive causes that many of my farmers are queuing up to take part in. There is enthusiasm for local food and organic food, which is reasserting itself in the marketplace, and for non-fuel crops, all of which offer huge potential to west Dorset farmers over the next few years. However, there is little sign at the moment of real, positive encouragement from the Ministry. It is not that Ministers have said the wrong things, but that there is not much sense of them coming forward and preaching the gospel of the trends of our times&mdash;of local food, organic food and non-fuel crops. I think that that is because in recent years, Ministers have become beleaguered by all the administrative difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/15">Goodness knows that I can understand how that has happened, but there is an opportunity, if the administration can be got under control, to generate an optimism that will in turn generate a kind of investment and enthusiasm in the industry that could offer us a farming scene in west Dorset that will be much healthier in five or 10 years than it has been for the past 10 years. I hope that the Minister and his colleagues will cure the administration problem and stress the optimistic trends.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-13a.219.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"  colnum="219"  time="012:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060613/halltext/60613h0174.htm#06061329000579">
	<p pid="a.219.0/1">I am delighted to respond to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase>. It is three years since the last in the series of annual debates on agriculture in west Dorset, and he has finished his speech today much as he did then, when he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/2" class="indent">&quot;I may be a ludicrous optimist and, indeed, the fact that I am talking about agriculture in the area of west Dorset at all suggests that I probably am, because the pessimists do not believe that it will exist in future.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2003-02-05.100"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 5 February 2003; Vol. 399, c. 100WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/3">Three years later, it is still there, and I take from his remarks a great deal of comfort that many of the issues raised in the five years preceding 2003 have not surfaced again, at least not in the same way, in this year's debate. That shows that, for all the beleagueredness&mdash;he is right to point out the problems that farmers have faced in past years and this year with the RPA&mdash;there is beginning to be a sense that in farming generally and, I trust, in west Dorset, there is a sense of direction and purpose, which has resulted from the radical changes that have taken place, which he mentioned in his speeches in 2002 and 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/4">The farming industry in west Dorset represents a key element of the rural economy and way of life. There are nearly 4,000 holdings, which employ 7,200 people. Just as was true last time the right hon. Gentleman raised these matters in the House, we need a thriving and profitable farming industry to do three things: to produce our food; to safeguard and enhance the landscapes we cherish, with which his constituency is so particularly blessed; and, increasingly, to respond to the fundamental issues of biodiversity loss and climate change facing us.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/5">We have taken some big steps forward towards building a sustainable future for farming in the past few years by working in partnership with the farming industry. The right hon. Gentleman has previously paid tribute to the work of Don Curry and the Curry review. The partnership is founded on our joint strategy for sustainable farming and food, which is a long-term plan for the development of the industry, and provides a framework for farmers to succeed in what has always been a fast-changing world. At its heart is the concept of reconnection: reconnecting farmers with their markets, reconnecting the food chain with the environment, and reconnecting consumers with the countryside and how their food is produced.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/6">The strategy remains one of the Government's key priorities, and is backed up by significant new resources&mdash;an additional &pound;500 million, at least, in the past three years. It is being taken forward by Government and industry partners in the south-west, and has specifically helped farmers in Dorset through initiatives such as the rural enterprise gateway, which provides free business support for rural businesses in the area, including farmers.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/7">I turn to the new single payment scheme, which is the most important development in agriculture policy in generations. It has reduced 11 bureaucratic common agricultural policy schemes to one payment linking compliance and environmental, public and animal health standards, and it leaves farmers to produce for the market, rather than concentrating on producing for subsidy. It has been assessed that the improved flexibility and reduction in bureaucracy will, once the scheme has bedded down, be worth a potential&pound;100 million in extra income to farmers in England alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/8">Of course I recognise the sort of problems that the right hon. Gentleman has brought to the attention of the House this morning. It would be wrong of me to comment on the specific cases. Although I am not in the habit, as he suggested, of scurrying back to my Department, I shall walk at a sedate pace and ensure that the messages are passed on to my noble Friend Lord Rooker.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/9">Payments began, as the Government promised, in February, but they did not flow nearly as fast as the Rural Payments Agency forecast. A number of short and longer-term measures were put in place to help to rectify the situation, including the appointment of a new acting chief executive for the agency to strengthen its leadership. Those measures proved useful in speeding up the full payments, but we could not be certain that all applicants would receive a payment by the end of the regulatory payment window on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase>. In May, the agency made a significant number of partial payments to a majority of applicants who were yet to receive a full payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/10">By close of business on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-08">8 June</phrase>, the total amountpaid to claimants in full or partial payments was&pound;1,331 million out of the total &pound;1,500 million to be disbursed. The RPA is now focused on making payments to claimants who have not received any payment to date and whose claim value exceeds &euro;1,000. I know that the right hon. Gentleman is a good deal swifter at mathematical calculations than I am, and will realise that the particular claim that he brought to the attention of the House falls into that category.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/11">Unfortunately, I am not able to give a summary of payments made in west Dorset. Experience has shown that it takes a disproportionate time to retrieve data on regions, and at the moment I am sure the right hon. Gentlemen would not want me&mdash;and I certainly do not want&mdash;to deflect the RPA effort from its focus on making payments as soon as possible, which we would both agree must be its priority. Looking forward, the Government are determined to learn the lessons from this year to help us to prepare for the undoubted challenges that will arise in delivering the 2006 scheme, with a view to reaching a stable position in 2007. The new ministerial team will, I promise, work extremely hard with the RPA and stakeholders to that end.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/12">I have made a note of the issue about acknowledgement letters that the right hon. Gentleman raised. Although it is perhaps understandable in the present circumstances, it is an irritation and a sign that the system is not yet operating as it should. However, I reassure him that, although most of the RPA's resources are focused, as I said, on processing outstanding 2005 schemes as quickly as possible, I am confident that it has sufficient staff to undertake data capture and to make a start on validating 2006 scheme claims in parallel with the 2005 scheme activity that is continuing.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/13">Farmers manage nearly 80 per cent. of the UK's land, and we believe that public money should reward farmers for the landscape and environmental benefits that they provide. It is now just over a year since the launch of environmental stewardship, which is a further key element in our strategy for sustainable farming and food. It enables all farmers to engage in simple yet effective environmental management and offers genuine financial support.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/14">The opening year of the scheme has not been without problems. Nevertheless, more than 20,000 farmers have successfully entered new stewardship agreements, bringing about 2.6 million hectares of land under environmental agreement. In Dorset, nearly 500 farmers have entered the entry-level and organic entry-level schemes, and five higher-level scheme agreements are now in place. To date, more than&pound;18 million has been paid to agreement holders in England, and I am greatly encouraged that we are providing real rewards to those who are prepared to commit to securing environmental gain through their sensitive management of the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/15">Of course I recognise that what the right hon. Gentleman I think called little irritations occur in cross-compliance and the monitoring of that. As he said, the process in question&mdash;like all processes&mdash;needs a common-sense overrider. However, I am sure that he will welcome, as I do, the fact that in the first year of the scheme's operation a real transformation is beginning to happen in the way farmers are reconnecting with their markets and people are reconnecting with their food and the countryside.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/16">The England rural development programme has had a major impact on rural areas around the country, and about &pound;1.6 billion has been committed to projects over the past seven years. In Dorset, that has helped initiatives such as Local Food Links, an enterprise that aims to support a range of local food production and give local people&mdash;schoolchildren in particular&mdash;access to the products in question, thus supporting local farmers and growers, reducing food miles and supporting a healthier population. The Dorset &quot;Chalk and Cheese&quot; programme is supported by nearly&pound;3 million of EU and public money under the Leader+ programme and has delivered a variety of community-led projects in the area, designed to support local farming. One of those is an internet-based radio service run by and for small farmers in the area to help producers to add value to their products and to develop sustainable tourism initiatives such as the Wessex ridgeway project and &quot;Chalks and Hawks&quot;&mdash;a wildlife tourism initiative integrating species conservation and rural tourism.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/17">We are determined to continue those successes in the next round of rural development funding, starting in 2007. The consultation on the priorities for the next rural development programme in England closed on<phrase class="date" code="2006-05-22">22 May</phrase>, and we received 280 responses, which I believe shows a good deal of interest. We want to use the next programme, which will continue to have environmental stewardship at its heart, to make a real difference in rural areas by safeguarding and enhancing our rural environment and fostering thriving rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/18">In the time that is left to me, I do not want to miss the opportunity to deal with the issues raised by the right hon. Gentleman about bovine tuberculosis, because that is an important issue for farmers&mdash;and dairy farmers in particular&mdash;specifically in the south-west. It is there that the problem seems to be prevalent. It is the biggest endemic animal disease issue that we face, and I know that it will be of concern to many livestock farmers in and around the right hon. Gentleman's constituency, for the reasons that I have set out.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/19">To help to address the situation we have recently introduced pre-movement testing in England to help to reduce the geographical spread of TB. We have implemented a new system of compensation to prevent overpayment for animals that react to the TB skin test and to speed up the removal of those animals from farms. Following completion of the Krebs trial, we have consulted on the principal method of badger culling to control TB in high-incidence areas of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/20">No decision has yet been made on badger culling, but any decision needs to be based on all the best scientific evidence about whether it can be successful in the long term and whether a cost-effective, practical, sustainable and of course humane culling policy can be developed and implemented. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would agree that those are fundamental and essential criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.226.0/1">I am most grateful to my hon. Friend, whom I congratulate on securing this important debate. He has spoken about the effects on his city, as other Members who represent Coventry would. However, I ask him to bear it in mind also that in the black country area&mdash;certainly in Walsall&mdash;we have suffered a great number of redundancies in manufacturing. That has continued. In Willenhall&mdash;not the Willenhall in my hon. Friend's city, but the one in my constituency&mdash;the lock industry has been substantially reduced for all kinds of reasons; obviously, losses in the motor industry have had an effect on that industry. I hope that my hon. Friend shares my hope that the Minister will speak about the larger and wider aspect of manufacturing in the west midlands.</p>

	<p pid="a.226.3/1">I do, Mrs. Anderson; I am grateful to have been called to speak by your good self.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1518" name="Jim Cunningham">the Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham)</phrase> on securing this debate, as we all do, and thank Mr. Speaker for making it possible. This debate is important, and as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" name="David Winnick">the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick)</phrase> made clear in his intervention, it is about the whole of the west midlands, although my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South has talked and I will talk more specifically about the situation in Coventry.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/3">This debate takes place against the background of the Massey Ferguson closure, when all the manufacturing was moved to France. The Jaguar closure followed, although fortunately we retained the bulk of the activity in the west midlands, and we are very pleased as Coventry people to see that it remains with us. Most recent, and still a matter of great current concern, is the Peugeot closure, with the work going to the Czech Republic.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/4">We are realists, of course, and recognise the impact of globalisation, which is felt throughout the country and Europe, but on the whole we feel that we do not always do as well as we could, and that is the concern that impelled my hon. Friend to secure this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/5">I have three specific matters of great concern to Coventry to bring to the Government's attention; I am sure that the Minister will take them on board and that we shall pursue them subsequently through her. Before I come to them, however, I should mention that we should not feel that all is doom and gloom or that all is lost in manufacturing in the country as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/6">We accept, of course, that those Jaguar, Massey Ferguson and probably Peugeot jobs&mdash;although that issue has not been finally decided&mdash;will not come back to Coventry and that we shall have to seek newer and different manufacturing outlets. However, in the nation as a whole, manufacturing is 20 per cent. higher than in 1975, despite the dramatic falls in 1979-81 and 1991 under successive Conservative Governments, when it dropped by 25 per cent. and 8 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/7">In the past 10 years, despite the impact and the pressures of globalisation, we have broadly sustained our level of manufacturing output. However, in Coventry we have felt the pinch very badly, and we welcome this debate to make clear to the Minister how we think the Government could help. We are not looking for subsidies, handouts or anything like that, but for what the Chancellor in person has always committed himself to: competitive new ventures with high added value, through which we can be resistant to the pressures of globalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/8">I should like to bring three specific issues to the Minister's attention. First, I mention investment in the Browns Lane plant, which happens to be in my constituency and with which we have had long-standing good relations. Mr. Peter de la Marche, an entrepreneur of great vision and energy, has taken over the site with a big investment of &pound;50 million and I am sure that the whole House, as well as those in the Chamber today, wish him well in the bold, exciting venture that he is bringing to Coventry. He has a brilliant new idea for modular building, and his company name is pretty eponymous: Delamar Construction.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/9">I understand that some of that project's issues are yet to be finalised with the Government; there is an application for support of one sort or another, and it would not be appropriate for me to go into the details of that. However, may I lodge with the Minister and, through her, the Department, a request for an early meeting on the matter? I am sure that my hon.Friend the Member for Coventry, South and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1516" name="Bob Ainsworth">the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth)</phrase>, who I am delighted to see are both present today, wish to join me in that, because we see a huge opportunity for the Government to play a key, unlocking role. Again, I pay tribute to Peter de la Marche himself.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/10">I should also like to raise the issue of the Ansty site, already referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South, which is an extremely important potential development. The hospital trust there has made it clear that it is immensely interested; Yvonne Carter, the dean of Warwick university medical school, and Mr. David Roberts, of the trust, have both made it clear that they see it as something through which we can really play to the inherent strengths of the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/11">As far as the trust is concerned, a huge contract is out with General Electric Medical Systems; on the back of that, we hope to build the first investments in the new medical equipment centre that we would like to establish on the Ansty site. I am pleased to say that we have had an initial meeting with Sir William Castell, chairman of the Wellcome Trust. Previously, as I am sure my right hon. Friend the Minister will know, he was chief executive of General Electric Medical Systems and a board member of General Electric. I am pleased to say that he has agreed to visit the hospital and look at the site in August to see what we have in mind and to make key contacts for us with the company.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/12">As my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South said, the project clearly will need support from the Government and from Advantage West Midlands. Most encouraging is that when a delegation of us saw the Chancellor and were briefed on the meeting, he said that he would take a personal interest in it. That would be a great help to us in pushing the matter forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/13">We have fixed other meetings with GEMS, and I have also arranged a meeting with the Advantage West Midlands managing director. As my hon. Friend said, that organisation will be vital in getting the project off the ground. Again, would my right hon. Friend the Minister ensure that we secure maximum support from the Department?</p>
	<p pid="a.226.3/14">The third area&mdash;again, it happens to be in my constituency but none of us makes any apology for that&mdash;is London Taxis International, which makes all the cabs in London. As my right hon. Friend is aware, it also has various matters outstanding with the Government and is looking for support on key areas of innovation and new development. If she would take those three matters on board&mdash;perhaps we could set up a meeting with her, with officials or with whoever is most appropriate&mdash;my colleagues and I would be most grateful.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.1/1">From my time wearing my previous ministerial hat, I know that my hon. Friend played a key role in these matters. I was able to work with him on all aspects of the Longbridge closure, and I know that he has a particular interest in how the site will now be employed. Of course I will be happy to discuss with him and others our plans for the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.1/2">I want to say a little about the car industry, as there is a tendency to get the bad news in the press and to forget the good news. In the early 1970s, the United Kingdom produced some 1.9 million cars. By the early 1980s, that had gone down to 900,000, but the figure for 2005, which is the latest year for which we have statistics, is up again at 1.6 million. We should be proud of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.1/3">Of course, closures are devastating for the individual families involved, the local communities and the work force, but equally, there is a growing number of good stories. I do not have time to go through them now, but one just has to look at Toyota in Burnaston, Nissan in Sunderland, BMW in Oxford and Honda to realise that we are bringing into the UK manufacturing that was done in the past in places such as Japan and Brazil. There are some good news stories as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.1/4">As far as Peugeot is concerned, I understand entirely what my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South said about the devastation that losing those 2,300 jobs will create and the impact that it will have on the work force and their families. He drew attention to the fact that the Government did what they could to support production of the new 207 model by allocating&pound;14.4 million, which was never taken up by Peugeot. We are in close contact with the company and will ensure that it meets its legal obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.1/5">I am sure that my hon. Friend will join me in paying tribute to the chairman of the Coventry, Solihull and Warwickshire Partnership, Brian Woods-Scawen, who brings together all the local stakeholders to ensure that proper support is provided for the workers through the learning and skills council and job centre, for local communities through local authorities and for the suppliers. He works with all the key local partners and has said that he will come to us if he requires more assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.1/6">My hon. Friend was asked about the boycott, and I would add only one thing to his remarks. We must remember the dealerships, which employ some 5,000 people, and that 73 per cent. of cars produced in the UK are exported. It is a good export industry, and we depend on that world trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.1/7">In the final moments, I shall discuss briefly the Ansty development site, which I know is of great interest to local Members of Parliament. It is a complicated site, and I am told that it must go through complex reclassification and planning consultation, which will take time. According to the time frame that I have been given, it is unlikely that the process will be completed until 2008. Difficult planning and commercial considerations are involved, but I am aware of the interest in that site of my hon. Friends the Members for Coventry, South and for Coventry, North-West and others who are present for this debate, and I would like to have further discussions about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.1/8">I, too, congratulate Delamar Construction on the work that it is doing on the Browns Lane site. It could employ up to 2,000 people, which would be a welcome change. To be honest, I am not totally aware of the funding application, but I will try to take it up and review it. Again, perhaps we could discuss it at our meeting.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-13a.234.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="234"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060613/halltext/60613h0176.htm#06061329000597">
	<p pid="a.234.1/1">No, I do not. However, the hon. Gentleman should not take just my word for that&mdash;numerous patient groups and clinician groups have made the same point. Indeed, I understand that the NICE dementia guidelines group and its chairman wrote to the appraisal committee, urging it to retain a wider, more generous set of appraisal guidelines for the use of those drugs. However, that seems to have been flatly ignored. The guidelines group, which is still charged with delivering guidelines for the treatment and management of dementia, includes in its membership social workers, patients, carers and health care professionals&mdash;in other words, the people who have hands-on, direct experience and can therefore bring a more rounded perspective to such decisions&mdash;yet the appraisal group seems to have set that completely to one side.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/2">It seems to me to be another weakness in the process that although in NICE the voices of patients are now heard at the table, they are not at the right table and therefore cannot exercise the influence that they should. I hope that the Minister will say a little about that and tell us whether he will look again at whether NICE has adequate arrangements in place to ensure that the patient voice and experience and the carer's view are adequately taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/3">I want to ask the Minister about another of my concerns about the NICE appraisal. Why has NICE's appraisal committee not properly considered, as the Department and the Welsh Assembly asked, the cost-effectiveness of the Memantine drug in treating behavioural symptoms of dementia?</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/4">One of my concerns about the series of changes that will flow from the decision if it is not overturned on appeal is that we will start moving back to old patterns of organising to deal with dementia. I remember that when I was first elected to the House in 1997 the level of diagnosis was relatively low. There was diagnostic denial. People were not diagnosed early enough: why diagnose when there is no treatment to be given?</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/5">Things have changed. We have seen a whole generation of memory clinics and other services develop to cater for the fact that the drugs exist, and in turn those clinics have led to the development of a host of other services and support arrangements, which are of huge benefit. The concern is that the whole infrastructure is at risk because of the decisions that NICE has made. That is why it is imperative that the Minister should be as clear as he can be today about what the next steps are to address the concerns that many of my constituents and others have about where we find ourselves as a result of NICE's decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/6">It is hard to understand how NICE came to the decision, because 30 clinical trials showed the drugs to be effective, offering patients improved memory, the ability to continue to do normal activities, such as washing and eating, and therefore greater independence. That is a key part of the Government's agenda&mdash;a part that I fully support. The benefits extend to carers, who often report being less stressed and happier while their loved ones are being prescribed the drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/7">There are four other reasons why NICE's decision is wrong, three of which relate to clinical practice. First, it contradicts the purpose of treatment, which is to prolong the early stages or to postpone the onset of the later stages of dementia&mdash;to lengthen normality, thus increasing the patient's quality of life. Secondly, the decision directly conflicts with the Government's policy to promote the independence of people of all ages. Undoubtedly, the restriction on the three drugs will curtail patients' ability to think and act for themselves, thus reducing their quality of life and independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/8">The point about quality of life is key. Even the chairman of NICE, Professor Rawlins, in an article in the <i>British Medical Journal </i>in 2004, acknowledged that QALY&mdash;the quality adjusted life year&mdash;should not be the only basis for making such decisions, yet it appears that that has been the case on this occasion. There is a dearth of quality-of-life data, which need to be taken into account when it comes to such assessments. Will the Minister look carefully at whether NICE has taken on board what its own chairman has said on the record?</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/9">The third reason why the decision is wrong is that withdrawing access to drugs in the early stages discourages early diagnosis, and the last and perhaps most damaging reason is the ethical conundrum in which it places doctors. Doctors will be forced to wait for their patients to deteriorate before being allowed to prescribe drugs that they know can help. In no other circumstance of which I am aware would doctors be placed in the position of knowing that something that is beneficial could be prescribed, but finding that their hands are tied and that they are told that they cannot prescribe it. One carer says:</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/10" class="indent">&quot;If people could continue to get drugs in the early stages of their disease, the early stages would simply be prolonged. This is better for everyone...mentally, emotionally and physically. Trust me.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/11">What of later-stage, more severe dementia, when a patient needs treatment most? Did NICE allow Ebixa, a drug that can help a patient when the behavioural symptoms are at their most distressing? No. The only option for doctors will be to fall back on anti-psychotic medication to manage challenging behaviour, in effect placing a chemical straitjacket on seriously ill people. The decision to prohibit Ebixa will not only adversely affect patients, but have huge repercussions for carers. Carers will be placed under increasing strain of the sort that I have described.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/12">Will the Minister make clear what he and his Department intend to do next? Will they support the appeal that has now been lodged? At what point does the Minister have to satisfy himself that NICE is properly discharging its statutory duty and accounting to him and, indeed, to the House for the way in which it discharges that duty?</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/13">I accept that drug treatments are not the be-all and end-all of treatment for Alzheimer's and dementia. However, drug treatments have been a catalyst for other treatments of the disease. As I said, the development of memory clinics has been accelerated by the availability of drug treatments, and a range of other support services have been provided as a consequence. I hope that the Minister will take this point on board. It might be argued that NICE is saving the NHS money through its decision and that cost-effectiveness is part of its remit. Of course cost-effectiveness is important, but it must be stressed that Alzheimer's treatments are not expensive. On average, the cost is &pound;2.50 per patient per day, or&pound;800 per patient per year. How can NICE maintain clinical excellence if it is asking doctors to ignore a diagnosis until it is sufficiently bad before a drug can be prescribed?</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/14">The treatment of dementia has a large impact on the care of people with the disease. Care of people with dementia raises wider questions about care of the elderly in general and the value that we place on carers. I believe that carers have been overlooked by NICE in its decision and the impact on their lives was not really considered by the panel. Carers have the most contact with sufferers of the disease and experience first-hand the benefits of the drugs on their patients. Surely their input and well-being deserved to be given greater weight before the decision was made; it appears as if that was ignored.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/15">If better care of dementia is to become a reality, better training is needed for staff, not only in the national health service but in the care sector. That would better serve the needs of sufferers not only of this disease, but of many others. By increasing the understanding of staff of the predicament that their patients are in and the potential problems facing them, perhaps we would address some of the concerns that I shall talk to the Minister about later today, which relate to malnourishment, dehydration and nutrition. Again, those are serious concerns. It is vital to ensure that people get the nutrition that they need. Often, older people find themselves in a vicious circle. Inadequately fed, they become confused. As they become confused, the dementia that they may already have is exacerbated, and because of that, their behaviour may be more challenging, which in turns leads to their being prescribed anti-psychotic drugs. Those anti-psychotics cause them to lose memory and behave more bizarrely as well&mdash;and it goes on and on. There is a downward slide to dependency and, ultimately, death.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/16">A final point must be made about a potential cure for the disease. We appear to be far away from finding one. That relates to my first point: there simply is not enough funding for research into the disease. We must recognise the impact that dementia will have on our population as its prevalence continues to grow, and use that impact as the impetus to look seriously into curing the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/17">I started by referring to the person whose name is used to cover 55 per cent. of all dementias in this country, and to his work, which was very important. I hope that we can reach a point at which treatments are available and research is extended. I hope that the Minister can give us some sense of the direction now, because many people outside the House feel hopeless and powerless as a result of the decisions that NICE has made.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate. I very much look forward to spending the afternoon with him when he comes to meet me in the Department about a separate issue immediately after the debate. He has a long track record of caring passionately about these issues, and I pay tribute to him. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase>, who, appropriately in national carers week, is continuing his campaign to raise awareness of the needs of carers in relation to these challenging issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/2">It is appropriate that we acknowledge that dementia is a heart-breaking condition. Of course it has a horrendous impact on the individual directly affected, but it also has an impact on the loved ones who see an older relative deteriorate, often quickly, in a way that is tremendously sad. Relatives do not have to deal only with the practical realities. It is a challenging condition in terms of its emotional impact on those who are closest to the people affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/3">It is important to deal initially with the comments made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam about the NICE process. First, the NICE recommendations are neither the final story nor the final guidance on drugs for Alzheimer's disease. Stakeholders have until <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-15">15 June</phrase> to lodge an appeal against the recommendations and at that point NICE will convene to committee to hear any appeals. It will publish a report of the appeal on its website.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/4">It is also important to say that the process has been thorough&mdash;unprecedented almost.</p>
