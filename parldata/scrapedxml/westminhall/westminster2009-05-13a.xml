<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-13a.227.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="227"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090513/halltext/90513h0001.htm#09051344000405">
	<p pid="a.227.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend to some extent, but that is no excuse for not trying to root it out completely. I am trying to stop the syndicates and others involved in illegal acts as they emerge. They may be small in number, but they cause a lot of disruption for little effort, and we have to stamp it out. If we ever lose the belief that sport has integrity, we will lose the public. We must ensure that that does not happen, but one event could be enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/2">Since the previous debate, the Minister has said that betting corruption is one of the major issues that threaten sport today. I welcome that statement. He said that he wants to ensure that everything is done to stamp it out. He wants to ensure that</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/3" class="indent">&quot;no stone is left unturned in the fight against corruption in sport.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/4">He has gone on&mdash;bravely so&mdash;to create a taskforce on betting corruption in sport. We will hear later who its members might be, and how it might work.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/5">The Gambling Commission published a policy paper on betting integrity in March 2009, in which it went into detail on subjects that include information sharing, specific bets, terms and conditions, investigation and prosecution. I hope that the House will consider that paper. Betfair, the online gambling company, has launched a legal action against the Dutch Government, who have urged Dutch banks to block transactions to online gambling companies. Legal activity is developing on that subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/6">The Gambling Commission's policy called for better information sharing between sports governing bodies and the industry, to scrutinise and investigate betting patterns. That is a firm policy aim. However, the commission believes that that should become a non-legislative agreement. There may be some argument about whether that sort of path is tough enough, but further data sharing is to be welcomed. Sports' governing bodies do not know the extent of bets on their sports, and they therefore do not know how to assess whether their sport is at a higher or lower risk from match fixing. We welcome such contact.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/7">The commission is engaging with sports governing bodies on their rules about who may bet and what sanctions can be used against players involved in betting corruption. The Professional Players Federation has criticised sports' governing bodies for not educating players well enough on the consequences of foul actions that could completely spoil the sport. That needs to be well thought through, and we must use plain language&mdash;the Alex Ferguson sort&mdash;on the consequences if one is caught acting in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/8">The commission can restrict betting types, but, in general, it does not want to tighten the rules. A huge diversity of bets is now available to the market; that is of concern. According to a Salford university academic paper entitled, &quot;Risk to the Integrity of Sport from Betting Corruption&quot;, novelty bets are creating the biggest problem or, at least, run the highest risk. For example, bets can be placed on how many cricket players will come on to the pitch at 11.30 am wearing hats or black spectacles. We might consider that trivial, but if it is fun and people want to do it, I guess that it should be allowed. However, we must handle the situation, because it is open to deviant behaviour in terms of where the bets go, who puts them on and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/9">The commission is considering employment terms when bets are made. An agreement should be reached, when a bet is placed, that there is no conflict of interest with the individual. For example, if they are a professional player or coach, they should not be allowed to bet on their team. Through section 42 of the 2005 Act, the commission can investigate suspicious betting patterns, although it is ultimately up to the police to investigate and bring prosecutions. According to the commission, the best way to deal with any prospect of match fixing is through sports governing bodies, but some confusion surrounds that. When should the commission initiate and close an investigation? When should governing bodies start and close theirs, and initiate disciplinary procedures? Some people feel that the Accrington-Bury thing was extended because of confusion about the different stages of the investigation. Will the Minister expand on that?</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/10">Betfair has a model for information sharing with sports governing agencies and their investigative programmes, but it does not always know the criteria for reporting suspicious bets. I learnt about the suspicious bet that started this debate from a newspaper, although I shall not name it, because it is not that friendly to us at the moment&mdash;it will get no more publicity here today. People in the media said to me, &quot;You see, it was a Norwich match&quot;; they know that I am&mdash;yes, I still am&mdash;fanatical about Norwich. It was difficult to get this debate moving, however: we tried to ask questions in the House, but we were not allowed to name the two teams; but then <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> managed to name them in a question&mdash;and so it went on.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/11">We need guidelines on industry standard practice to inform sports governing bodies on how decisions are made to follow up suspicious betting behaviour. The commission's intelligence unit, which I have met, is severely limited. It is not big enough. It needs to be sharper and to be able to investigate all sports and markets, to interact with different sports and to have greater jurisdiction, so that it can investigate these betting patterns and bring successful charges. An organisation can always be judged by the number of charges that it brings. I have already asked a question about that. Too few cases are being carried through to the end. There are some, but others are dropped, including the one on the Norwich-Derby game, because the evidence cannot be obtained.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/12">The Salford university study identified the billions of pounds entering the betting industry&mdash;it went from &pound;7 billion, in 2001, to &pound;38 billion, in 2008&mdash;which, it says, increases</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/13" class="indent">&quot;the potential for corruption in the absence of appropriate action by sports governing bodies, regulators and government to address the new threats&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/14">There is an appetite for moving forward. The Asian market presents us with real problems. I am told that the premier league is the best football league in the world&mdash;I am not sure whether that is accurate, but we would probably all agree with it. It attracts more than $500 million in bets each weekend in the Asian betting market. That is big bucks and presents considerable opportunities for people to be tempted down funny pathways.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/15">I mentioned that people can place bets on spectacles and hats worn on a pitch. A tennis player could win a first set, but throw the second and third and get beaten. It is quite possible for a second seed to look good and be playing well, but be beaten by the 487th ranked player. Of course, that could happen legitimately&mdash;it is what sport is all about&mdash;but, at the end of the day, if a match goes a certain way, a suspicious betting pattern might indicate that the match was thrown, that somebody did not play hard enough or that something was set up. We need to keep tabs on these betting markets across the world and on the size of the sums being bet.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/16">I am pleased that some European countries are starting to take an interest. Often, in debates on Europe&mdash;on copyright, for example&mdash;people will dismiss an argument saying, &quot;We can't get all the other European countries to engage in this.&quot; The taskforce gives us an opportunity to do that on this occasion. UEFA&mdash;on the football side&mdash;the Jockey Club and other groups could sit on the taskforce and play a part. It could be a wide taskforce with sub-committees and so on. However, as long as it is independent and sets its own terms and conditions, it will be acceptable to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/17">We need to fund education programmes. The all-party football group has produced a sterling report on what needs to be done in British football. For example, as the Minister has said, the four top clubs have all the money and resources. How can we devolve some of that down to the minor leagues and other groups? Delia Smith said that the demise of Norwich into a lower league was all about money. We have not got enough to buy the players. At all stages&mdash;including from youth&mdash;skills gravitate up to the highest level. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">The hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> and I visited Cambridge United and saw its youth policy. It has some smart young people dedicated to playing football, but no money comes down to them, because they are not in the full league. Compared with other clubs, Cambridge United needs about &pound;200,000 a year to help its youth academy.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.1/1">I concur with the hon. Gentleman. Some players at that level end up in the championship or the premiership. I saw a match in the former when at least three or four players came from that level. Some also come in from Sunday league football and go on to become stars. We must encourage that in this country. The all-party group has suggested that the number of foreign players might need to be limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.1/2">We need to get the money down to the minor leagues, to encourage those young people with skills, but, at the same time, they must be educated. Youth academies help them with their schooling, so that if anything goes wrong, such as a bad injury, they can move on and develop other skills that they have learned&mdash;a talent for law or business, for example. The opportunity is there to combine with the betting industry and say, &quot;Look, here are worthwhile causes where we can support grass-roots sport.&quot; The Minister might be tempted to take over that area and develop it very quickly to the benefit of sport in this country. The education and thrill that young people get from sport can be imparted into schools. Youth academy players go out into schools and bring the better players back into the academy. It could be so exciting.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.1/3">Our fetish for the four big clubs will not do football any good. By widening perceptions, we might also address the essential problem about intellectual property. I am involved with writing and films and so on. Intellectual property is a big concept now. There are lawyers who work in that field alone. The rights are important not only to science, medicine, new discoveries and books, but to the skills in the sporting world as well. We have to protect such skills. Betting industries, associations and sports' governing bodies should combine to form a taskforce to ensure that the whole sport gets the whack that it needs to develop and remain safe for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.0/1">My hon. Friend is making an interesting case. Does he agree that the amount of money already kicking around within football does not seem to have trickled down to clubs such as AFC Bournemouth, who, thankfully, have just managed to avoid relegation from league two? Those clubs work towards the possibility of getting just one game in the FA cup against a premier league team, simply so they can get the gate receipts that mean they can manage financially for another year.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-13a.233.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" speakername="Jeff Ennis" colnum="233"  time="010:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090513/halltext/90513h0002.htm#09051344000415">
	<p pid="a.233.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> on introducing this timely and important debate. I also commiserate with him as a Norwich City fan. A week last Sunday, he will have been sitting on the edge of his settee. Barnsley were the other team in the frame, and when they went 1-0 down to Plymouth, I thought it was curtains for us. However, we have a certain fighting spirit, like this Labour Government, and we pulled the iron out of the fire at the end to win 2-1. That could be an analogy for next year's general election.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/2">I am speaking primarily in my capacity as joint chairman of the all-party racing and bloodstock industries group. There is no doubt that betting on all sports has grown exponentially with the development of the internet, which has been accompanied by increased risk to the integrity of sport. Betting is a serious issue for all sports and for Governments worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/3">The British Horseracing Authority has led the way in tackling the threat of corruption and has assisted many sports to deal with the challenges. It stands willing to help any sports that approach it and lends its expertise whenever it is called upon. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> said, in the past 12 months, there have been no corruption incidents to do with horse racing in this country, which is a feather in the industry's cap.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/4">Dame Elizabeth Neville, a former chief constable and a director of the Serious Fraud Office, led an independent review of British horse racing integrity operations in 2008 and concluded that the BHA was a model for the effective investigation of corruption in sport. Four key principles underpin the BHA's integrity operations: clear rules and regulations for all participants, accompanied by robust disciplinary processes and penalties; a partnership approach with the Gambling Commission and betting organisations, which includes information sharing; a high level of intelligence and investigative capability; and, finally, education across the sport, which is absolutely vital&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North referred to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/5">Since 2002, the BHA has invested significantly in infrastructure and modern processes, including employing a new director of integrity services and licensing, and two full-time betting investigators, who enable seven-days-a-week monitoring of betting markets on course and fully informed analysis of betting. It has agreed a memorandum of understanding with betting organisations that allows the sharing of information and intelligence, and it has established a fully resourced and funded intelligence unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/6">The use of information and its conversion into evidence is crucial, and the system used to grade the information and its source is the same as that used by all UK police forces&mdash;many people involved in ensuring integrity in the racing industry are former police officers, as the Minister will know. Finally, the BHA has invested in sophisticated IT systems and a team of seven full-time investigators.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/7">One outstanding issue that remains to be resolved as far as the BHA is concerned is overseas betting operators. The Government recently announced a review of such operators. A growing number of companies locate their online operations outside British regulatory and taxation regimes, yet they can advertise freely to British punters. That means that they do not have to comply with the regulatory arrangements applied by the Gambling Commission or pay the horse racing levy that funds the integrity arrangements that I outlined. The BHA believes that the loophole needs to be closed urgently. Will the Minister say something about that?</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/8">Another issue that has yet to be resolved satisfactorily is list positions in the on-course betting ring and the continuing dispute between the Federation of Racecourse Bookmakers and the Racecourse Association. Before the Gambling Act 2005 came into force, many on-course bookies paid high prices for their pitches in the belief that that investment would buy them their list position in perpetuity.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/9">I am sure that all Members who like to go to the race course&mdash;as I did on Saturday at Thirsk with one or two hon. Members, in particular those who sit on the Opposition Benches&mdash;would agree that the bookmakers' ring adds to the atmosphere at a race course. It makes the difference between racing in Ireland and Britain, and racing on the continent in countries such as France.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/10">A certain amount of progress looks to have been made. I do not know whether the Minister saw the article in this morning's <i>Racing Post </i>written by a good Doncaster Rovers fan, Howard Wright. It reads, &quot;Shake-up in store for on-course bookies at Northern racecourses&mdash;Proposal for scheme to guarantee positions for 35 years&quot;. The article puts the current position in a nutshell:</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Northern Racing is proposing a groundbreaking deal for on-course bookmakers operating at the group's nine racecourses, which will guarantee positions in the 'pick' list for 35 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/12" class="indent">Bookmakers will continue to pay five times the cost of admission to the particular enclosure in which they are betting until August 31, 2012, after which the daily fee will go up by 25 per cent. for the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/13" class="indent">After 2017, there will be five-yearly reviews and the cost will rise according to the retail prices index since the date of the last revision.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/14" class="indent">A daily administration fee of &pound;20 will continue to be paid, subject to review, according to the contract proposal that is being sent to bookmakers today and will appear on Northern's website.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/15" class="indent">Auctions and private sales of list positions in existing rings will take place quarterly, with 10 per cent. of the sale price going to the individual racecourse as commission...</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/16" class="indent">There will be no arbitration system to settle disputes, which 'will be subject to the jurisdiction of the English courts'.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/17" class="indent">The scheme is backdated to 2007 and, if agreed, could act as a blueprint to solve the dispute over pitch tenure that has raged between the Federation of Racecourse Bookmakers and the Racecourse Association since before the Gambling Act came into force in September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/18" class="indent">The row has also frustrated attempts by the sports Minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, to modernise the operation of the betting ring. The FRB has stood firm behind the principle of bookmakers holding their list positions in perpetuity, which the RCA denies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/19">On the face of it, that looks to some extent like going down the right road. However, the FRB would like me to make a number of points about the issue, because it is not quite as clear and straightforward as Howard makes out in his article.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/20">The FRB is concerned about the working party set up by the Minister. He was quoted in the <i>Racing Post </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-18">18 March</phrase> as saying that he would</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/21" class="indent">&quot;give it one last crack&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/22">by re-convening the working party and would consider using secondary legislation if agreement was not reached. I understand that that meeting has not yet taken place. Will he comment on that and tell us whether there will be one?</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/23">The next point concerns the UK-wide solution for tenure. The tenure of list positions must be agreed UK-wide, as it was before the passing of the 2005 Act. Although commercial access fees may vary, it would not be fair for some bookies to keep their assets for longer than others. If a negotiated agreement cannot be reached UK-wide, surely legislation is the only option.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/24">The article mentioned the fact, which the FRB opposes, that there will be no dispute resolution mechanism. The FRB feels that agreement on tenure means nothing if access charges are not fair and reasonable, and a dispute resolution mechanism is essential to ensuring fairness for both sides if agreement is not reached. The FRB strongly advocates such a mechanism, but the RCA has strongly resisted it until now. In my opinion, a dispute resolution mechanism for forward negotiations must be seriously considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/25">There are few industries in which this country can truly be described as the world leader, but betting and gambling is one of them. That is primarily due to the high levels of integrity encouraged in all UK sports. I believe that the leading best practice model is the one employed by the BHA. I hope that all major sports in this country will seriously consider adopting similarly high levels of integrity to those that operate in the British racing industry.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-13a.237.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" speakername="Don Foster" colnum="237"  time="010:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090513/halltext/90513h0003.htm#09051344000417">
	<p pid="a.237.0/1">May I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> not only on securing this debate but on the interest he has long shown in this important issue? It pains me to say this and it is a rare occurrence, but I agree with almost everything <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> said. My remarks will be shorter than they might have been because he has said much of what I was going to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/2">It is important to place it on the record that sports betting in the UK is big business. According to various sources, it has seen about a fourfold increase over the last few years. Whether we believe it is the responsibility of sports governing bodies or others to pay for it, integrity work in each sport is expensive and the cost is rising. No major sports governing bodies have been able to give me a precise cost because such work is often integrated with other activities. However, many millions of pounds are spent by major sports governing bodies. It is critical that they do that work. A number of cases have been mentioned in this debate. The hon. Member for Norwich, North referred to various examples and I will speak about a couple of those later.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/3">I was delighted that a number of hon. Members used this opportunity to raise other outstanding business in relation to gambling, and in particular to horse racing. The hon. Members for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) and for Livingston (Mr. Devine) spoke passionately. I, too, believe it is vital that we resolve the question of on-course bookmaker lists. I have attended Westminster Hall debates on that topic over the last two years. I hope the hon. Gentlemen will not mind if I do not comment further on that; they can find my views on the matter in <i>Hansard</i>. I share their view that the issue must be resolved soon, in the interests not only of on-course bookmakers but of the people who go to the races and enjoy the benefit brought by on-course bookmakers.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/4">I will not follow other hon. Members in pressing the Minister to tell us about the sale of the Tote because we have debated that on many occasions. However, it could legitimately have been brought into this debate. I will not even ask him for the latest details in the saga of the horse race betting levy, although a comment from him would be interesting.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/5">My point is simple. A lot of money is made from sports betting by the betting industry in this country. A lot of costs are incurred by sports governing bodies in relation to integrity. The question is whether a greater contribution to those costs should be made by betting organisations. Like the hon. Member for Shipley, I do not think the case for that has yet been made. I do not believe we should go down that route now.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/6">The question that remains is, what more can we do if there is a continuing problem? There are a number of cases of matches being rigged for betting purposes. I welcome the Minister's establishment of the expert panel. I look forward to hearing more details from him today and in the near future about who will serve on that body and what its remit will be. That body must help to resolve a number of ongoing problems, which centre around two things. The first is how we gather information about what is going on. The second is how we provide help to sports governing bodies so that they can put in place appropriate rules and sanctions to deal with any incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/7">The hon. Member for Norwich, North raised the matter of the Norwich City versus Derby match, on which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> has asked a number of parliamentary questions. The issue concerned betting on the Asian-Chinese market. It became apparent from the debate on that issue that the Football Association finds it extremely difficult to act and to prove a case of match fixing. The FA has made it clear that it is able to act only if a whistleblower comes forward. It needs help in looking at these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/8">An interesting article in <i>The Independent</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-24">24 April</phrase> said that the FA was &quot;powerless to act&quot; in such cases. It stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/9" class="indent">&quot;an informed source told The Independent that the FA 'is highly unlikely to charge a player with match-fixing' and will not do so in this case. Match-fixing is simply too hard to prove, to specific legal satisfaction, whereas infringements of football's own betting rules are more clear-cut and more likely to end in convictions, though the matter remains within the sport's governing body.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/10">I hope that the expert panel will consider what help can be given to deal with those difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/11">I share the concern that the hon. Member for Shipley touched on about the role of the Gambling Commission. In an intervention, I asked the hon. Member for Norwich, North whether he had confidence in the commission's work in this area. He said that it was almost up to top gear. That is in marked contrast with the view of the hon. Member for Shipley. The commission document of March this year contained a degree of complacency. At least it is acknowledged that more work needs to be done, and I welcome the fact that the commission will focus more on this matter in future. I would welcome the Minister's comments on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/12">The recent worrying incidents demonstrate why it is difficult to have confidence in the Gambling Commission in this area. Many hon. Members will have read the reports of the recent mystery shopping exercise in bookmakers' shops. The commission discovered that a 17-year-old was able to place a bet illegally in 98 of the 100 shops that were visited. However, the only resulting action that seems to have been taken is that a letter has been sent to each of those betting shops, telling them they must have procedures in place to prevent that from happening again. Similarly, we have discussed many times white-listed jurisdictions and the promise of mystery shopping as a way of checking that they are behaving correctly. However, as we have discovered in other debates, no mystery shopping took place on overseas-regulated, white-listed regulated betting sites until very recently. The Minister has told me in a letter that that has now started to happen; I would be grateful if he told me what progress we have made and what information we have received.</p>

	<p pid="a.245.1/1">Okay, not &quot;not done anything&quot; but not enough. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Some hon. Members say that we could have done more, sooner. The reality is that we have done a great deal to regulate the gambling industry in recent years. The old Gaming Act 1968 was out of order and needed amending to reflect the development of internet technology in particular. That is why the Government introduced the Gambling Act 2005 and set up the Gambling Commission, whose remit included focusing on betting integrity. We all know that people still like to visit the high street bookies, but there are now numerous ways to place a bet, especially on sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/2">We spoke about sporting issues, and I share the concerns that the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East raised about the number of corners in a game and so on. Such things do not materially affect the result of the game, but there are concerns. The hon. Member for Shipley is right to say that the bookies may get on to it, but we have to get the balance right. Betfair and bets in running are a concern as well, but I hope that there will be an opportunity to look at the integrity issues that may come from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/3">People can bet with their TV remote. Anyone with a Sky subscription can place a bet with Sky Bet. We know that having a flutter can add to the enjoyment of watching sporting events. From the regular racing punter to the football fans betting on the result of their team's game on a Saturday, betting on sport is an accepted, everyday occurrence.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/4">As the hon. Member for Shipley said, the likelihood of serious, widespread corruption is small, but the threat and risks to reputation are real. We want the UK to maintain its standing as an honest and well-regulated country for gambling. Therefore, it is vital that the threat of corruption, especially from overseas and online betting, is abated. A major sports betting scandal could damage the concept of sport and conceivably affect public interest in and support for a particular event or sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/5">Significant corruption, or a series of betting scandals, would also call into question the regulatory ability of some of the sports' governing bodies and the effectiveness of the betting regime, which could have implications for the wider gambling industry. That is why we must do more to ensure that the threats of betting corruption do not become real.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/6">The solution is to bring together all the relevant organisations to support the people who do the intelligence work and to work with the Gambling Commission. The commission has come in for a bit of stick today, but I believe that it is doing well. It is the main player in regulating betting that is licensed in Britain, and its approach to what we are trying to achieve is now heading in the right direction.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising that point. Let me say from the start that the actions of the bookmakers were totally unacceptable. We need to find out what happened&mdash;we need to hear their responses. The letter that went out demanded action and a response within 28 days. I agree with him that just sending out a letter may have looked a bit complacent, but the reality is that action and a response were demanded within 28 days. That level of problem&mdash;98 out of 100&mdash;is totally unacceptable. I said earlier that the betting industry does all that it can, but it must do more. We cannot have vulnerable people and people under 18 put into such a difficult position.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/2">In setting out and clarifying the regulatory position on integrity, the Gambling Commission is moving in the right direction. We need to give confidence to the public and ensure that the regulations are given a high profile. People felt that the cases in the horse-racing industry were not followed through or collapsed because of insufficient evidence or other problems, so it is important that the Gambling Commission recently published its policy position paper on betting integrity, which outlines the work that it has done and the direction that it wants to take.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/3">As ever, time will overtake me. I am happy for hon. Members on both sides of the House to suggest people who should be on the expert panel that I want to set up. It will include eight to 10 people who will be taken from betting, sport and the police. I had a meeting with UEFA the other day, which is keen on the panel because it spends a great deal of money on integrity issues in football throughout Europe. The expert panel will give advice and support to the Gambling Commission on processes, procedures and what needs to be looked at. It is right and proper that experts in the field offer such support to the Gambling Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> was right to raise the 47 cases. More than half of them did not involve serious issues, but the Gambling Commission was right to ensure that they were investigated. The remaining cases that are under consideration, in some cases by sports' governing bodies, include a number of active cases in which the commission will be further involved. It is difficult to work out the full extent of the underlying problem, particularly as the Commission can work only with gambling operators who are licensed in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.249.0/1">My hon. Friend is right. Again, I put on the record my appreciation for his support for the initial legislation on gangmasters and for his work on health and safety in construction and related industries. He is well respected throughout the industry for the work that he has done on health and safety and on promoting workers' rights. We need more of that in this place, particularly at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.0/2">There was a major lobby last week in the House of Commons. Hundreds of construction workers came to this place to tell us about the difficulties that they face. People who are desperate for work and others who took time off work came to the mother of Parliaments to tell us exactly what the problems are. Those people were angry and frustrated that they could not get jobs because of the cowboys operating in the construction industry, who are often organised by the gangmasters. Those construction workers are looking to this Labour Government to do something to help them to try to get decent jobs and decent conditions in the construction industry, which is vital for this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.0/3">Migrant workers who come to this country for legitimate reasons and for legitimate work are often lured into the twilight world of illegal gangmasters. I caution those who blame the workers and ask them instead to focus on the real villains, who are the illegal gangmasters. Anecdotal evidence from those who have suffered under those unscrupulous people suggests that they are experiencing the same despairing conditions as those who were exposed in the agriculture industry&mdash;none more so than the Chinese workers who perished on the shores of Morecambe bay. That was the rationale behind our introducing the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.0/4">Despite the financial situation, most commentators agree that we can build our way out of this downturn with major construction projects, such as the house building that we are proposing, the Olympic village and related projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.1/1">My right hon. Friend is knowledgeable about the industry and the legislation. He may be aware that last week I asked the Prime Minister whether he and like-minded colleagues would have a meeting on gangmasters in the construction industry. He has kindly agreed, and I look forward to that meeting so that they get a feel for the Gangmasters Licensing Authority's work and how effective it is, and accept that it must be properly resourced.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/2">Companies that pay their taxes and train apprentices for the future are damaged financially, especially small businesses that are struggling to survive and must compete with cowboys in the construction industry. Cowboys often advertise on mobile phones tied to lamp posts, so they are untraceable. It would be helpful if Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs tracked down those mobile phones and asked the people who operate illegally how they pay their taxes and national insurance, and how they treat their workers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-13a.256.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" speakername="Oliver Heald" colnum="256"  time="014:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090513/halltext/90513h0005.htm#09051344000464">
	<p pid="a.256.6/1">Indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.6/2">The River Mimram, in my constituency, features in the WWF campaign and includes a site of special scientific interest, at Tewin Bury, which is home to wetland birds, rare plants&mdash;for example, the southern marsh orchid and the golden saxifrage&mdash;fish and the white-clawed crayfish. It is also a refuge of the water vole, the population of which has collapsed&mdash;it has fallen by 90 per cent. It would be sad to lose the animal that was the inspiration for Ratty in &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot;. The Hertfordshire and Middlesex Wildlife Trust has undertaken a major survey of the vole population using data from Tewin Bury.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.6/3">The River Mimram rises at Whitwell in the constituency of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1638" name="Peter Lilley">the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley)</phrase>, flows through Welwyn and Hatfield, into my constituency and then on into Hertford. Over recent years, these wonderful rivers in my constituency, which are much loved and form an important part of our environment, have suffered. In 2006, the Mimram ran dry. Residents felt helpless&mdash;they have described it to me&mdash;as they watched trout dying and discovered that the rare white-clawed crayfish had died, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.6/4">Recently, the Mimram has had low-flows for far too many years, which is why it features in the campaign. For environmental purposes, it has adequate flow only 1 per cent. of the time, which is worrying, not only because of the rare flora and fauna at the SSSI, but because of what is being lost by local residents. I have visited the Mimram on a number of occasions with Tony Last and Tony Langford from Friends of the Mimram and I pay tribute to their work in highlighting the situation of the river.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.6/5">The River Beane Preservation Society works hard for its river, too. I have visited the Beane north of Watton-at-Stone, with Ian Knight and Dave Stimpson, and I recognise, too, the contribution of Andrew Bott, who is the society's secretary. The Mimram provides the water supply for Welwyn Garden City, and the Beane for Stevenage. Near the Whitehall pumping station, the River Beane runs dry going north away from Watton-at-Stone. There has been some improvement this winter, but the river has adequate flow, for environmental purposes, only 10 per cent. of the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.6/6">It does not need to be like this. These rivers are great&mdash;and could be greater&mdash;leisure resources. An expert report by Entec, for the Environment Agency, shows that the benefits could be worth as much as &pound;32 million to &pound;34 million for the Mimram alone. If boreholes were used farther down the river, the benefits could be achieved at a modest cost. Dry fly-fishing is already well-established further down the Mimram and, in living memory, there was swimming and fishing in the River Beane&mdash;in parts that are now dry in the summer. It is vital that any new borehole for the Mimram does not damage the precious SSSI, but the site being considered at Tewin&mdash;only 1 km from the SSSI&mdash;is causing great anxiety.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.6/7">Is this a sensible way forward? We must keep that wetland wet. Against that background, the additional burdens on water resources in the south and east need to be taken into account. The Environment Agency designates all rivers east of Luton as &quot;over-abstracted&quot; and &quot;over-licensed&quot;. Development poses a major challenge. The east of England plan calls for 83,200 extra homes in Hertfordshire. Yet no sensible plan is in place either for the water resources and infrastructure for those properties, or for maintaining or improving the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.6/8">Hertfordshire is losing water to pollution. It has all the usual problems, as well as bromate contamination at Sandridge, where an old potassium bromate factory has created a plume across Hertfordshire, resulting in higher-than-permitted levels of bromate in water supplies. One borehole is completely out of use, and seven public and three private boreholes have restricted use. The &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle is very important. Why is the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs taking so long to decide the case of the bromate plume? I have asked several parliamentary questions about it; but after four years, still no firm decision has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.6/9">I welcome Thames Water's approach; it says that one case of pollution from its sites is one too many. It achieved 100 per cent. compliance with the Environment Agency's stringent sewage treatment standards at its Hertfordshire sewage treatment works in 2008-09, and it is working hard to keep it that way, with carefully targeted programmes of maintenance and investment. I am glad that it is supporting the campaign. However, it will not welcome some of my later comments about abstraction.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.6/10">None of us can ignore the likely effect of climate change, with Three Valleys Water expecting to lose 5 per cent. of available water by 2030. Decisions will have to be made about our rivers this year. The water framework directive requires our rivers to be in &quot;good environmental status&quot; by 2015, yet the Government's draft plans do not include any improvement in Hertfordshire. Currently, only 20 per cent of our national rivers and lakes are in good status, and the Government's draft plans will improve that by only 4 per cent. by 2015. That is simply not challenging enough and more needs to be done. We need to draw up a proper Government plan to waste less water and reduce consumption to 130 litres per person per day; to keep our rivers flowing, which means altering and amending abstraction licences and, in some cases, moving our boreholes further down river; and to introduce a tiered pricing system for water to help vulnerable people and to reward those who conserve water&mdash;the technology is now available to achieve that through smart metering. We need to help farmers avoid pollution through advice, training and incentives; to create a firm policy on pollution; and actively to regenerate our dying rivers.</p>

	<p pid="a.260.2/1">I welcome the debate and congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> on securing it. I do not know how he managed it, but the debate coincides with the launch of the &quot;Rivers on the Edge&quot; campaign, which it was my privilege to attend last night. The hon. Gentleman spoke of the chalk streams that are at risk in his constituency, but he will be aware that the campaign, which is generously supported by the HSBC Climate Partnership, also focuses on the upper Lea catchment, which is in dire need of attention and has appallingly low flows.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/2">The primary River Lea, which flows through his constituency, is down to about 9 per cent. of normal flows in summer, which could be ecologically disastrous. The campaign also focuses on the River Itchen in Hampshire and, as has been said, the River Kennet. The latter gets a lot of attention&mdash;one could argue that too many organisations are dedicated to saving it, but I will address their work in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/3">I am a keen angler, as is <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1461" name="Charles Walker">the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker)</phrase>, who is not in the Chamber. The Rivers Beane and Rib, in years gone by, particularly in the 1950s, were heralded as fine dry and course fisheries. The grandfather of contemporary angling, Richard Walker, who was from Hitchin, fished the Beane and the Rib. As a child, I remember reading about his exploits in a river that now, I suspect, barely has enough water to cover the tip of a float, never mind to sustain fish life for the bulk of the year.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-13a.261.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1774" speakername="Martin Salter" colnum="261"  time="015:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090513/halltext/90513h0006.htm#09051344000475">
	<p pid="a.261.1/1">Perhaps in the not too distant future, the hon. Gentleman will invite me to fish the Beane when it has some water in it. That is the purpose of the debate and the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/2">I was pleased to launch the parallel &quot;Stand up for Your River&quot; campaign, which is promoted by the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Angling Trust and a number of other organisations. The campaign feeds into the Environment Agency's river basement management plan, the consultation for which closes on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-22">22 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/3">We launched the campaign just outside my constituency boundary in the Newbury constituency, in the aptly named Lower Benyons fishery. Conservative Members might be interested to learn that we anglers refer to Lower, Upper and Middle Benyons and may wish to quiz <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> on which bits of him are lower, upper and middle. We are grateful to the Benyon family for making their fishing available to us and for their contribution to some important wildlife and conservation projects in the Kennet valley.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/4">I ought to declare a number of interests that may make me sound slightly fanatical. I am founder member of the Cleaner Kennet campaign and a member of the Angling Trust, which is the new governing body for angling, having taken over from the old Anglers Conservation Association. I also chair the Blueprint for Water coalition in Parliament. Those organisations, and the Wye and Usk Foundation, are all doing sterling work, for which I praise them.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/5">The River Kennet brought me to Reading. I had no intention of becoming the town's MP; I went there to go fishing&mdash;simple as that. I was lucky that in 1979 and 1980, Reading was a relatively cheap place to buy a house and one of those rare places where small, terraced properties for first-time buyers backed on to the River Kennet in, as the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire will know, Elgar road.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/6">Most riverside properties tend to be outside the reach of the first-time buyer, but it was my privilege to own my own 12 ft of river bank, which, for a mad-keen angler in his 20s, was a bit of dream. I found after a while that I kept catching the same fish, but it was wonderful. I commuted to work, but did not have to commute to go fishing. That is what brought me to Reading and I have a deep affection for the river.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/7">The Kennet and Avon canal, which runs parallel to much of the River Kennet&mdash;until about halfway between Hungerford and Newbury&mdash;had been in a state of disrepair since the 1950s. I was lucky as a young man, until 20 years ago, to be able to fish the Kennet at its peak. It was a crystal-clear chalk stream. Even down to the outskirts of Reading, I could stand and see the bottom in 5 ft or 6 ft of water, which teemed with wildlife. It was an amazing fishery.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/8">Things started to go wrong&mdash;none of us spotted why&mdash;with the opening of the canal. As anglers, we thought it would be inconvenient to have more boats on the river between Reading and Newbury, but we had no idea of the impact that opening and linking the two watercourses would have.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/9">For 50 years, the sediment in the canal had got deeper and deeper. At the entrance to the canal and the confluence with the river, where the waters first mix at Copse lock, just upstream from Hampstead Marshall, one can now see great slugs of silt and turbidity flowing into what is a crystal-clear chalk river further upstream. The gravels consequently silted up, so the light could not get through, which meant that the ranunculus, a protected species that is vital for the biodiversity and shelter of other plant life and invertebrates in the chalk stream environment, ceased to grow. Slowly but surely, the Kennet began to decline.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/10">We can add to those problems the increase in abstraction, as the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire said. It was appalling that the Environment Agency lost the inquiry on the Axford borehole&mdash;I cannot remember what year that happened. There was a reduction in flows, especially in summer, as well as an increase in point source pollution as a result of insensitive farming practice, increased run-off from the road network and a gradual decline of one of the finest chalk streams in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/11">I do not want to bore hon. Members too much about fish, but the grayling, a wonderful fish, is an indicator species. I advise anyone who wants to know about the health of a fishery, especially a chalk stream fishery, to look at the lowest downstream point at which the grayling is found. I used to catch grayling at Padworth, which is well downstream of Thatcham. The most skilled anglers would struggle to find many grayling downstream of Hungerford, some 20 or 25 miles upstream. That is how far the water quality in the river has declined.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" name="Robert Wilson">The hon. Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson)</phrase> referred to increased housing, but the biggest threat&mdash;the 7,500 houses for the Kennet flood plain to the south-west of my constituency, proposed by the independent panel in the south-east plan&mdash;has already been averted. On top of that, we have seen the growth of signal crayfish numbers and increased predation. However, all is not lost. It was my privilege, in 1992, to set up a unique partnership between West Berkshire council, boat owners, wildlife groups, Reading borough council and the angling organisations&mdash;the Cleaner Kennet Campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/13">The campaign has played a key role in lobbying for funding, catchment management plans and habitat restoration projects, which can and will make a difference. If we cease damaging environments and allow wildlife to regenerate and regroup, mother nature will do the rest.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/14">I am a trustee of the old Thames Rivers Restoration Trust, which runs a chalk stream restoration project. That project is levering in funding for habitat restoration and looking at whether there is an environmentally sensitive way to filter out the increased silt and turbidity coming into the river as a result of the canal and chalk stream watercourses being mingled downstream of Copse lock.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/15">National organisations are also highly supportive of the work that we are doing in the Kennet valley. In particular, I want to highlight the work of the former Anglers Cooperative Association, which is now part of the Angling Trust. The association is the only organisation that has used the common law consistently to prosecute polluters, often using civil actions to secure far greater damages than the Environment Agency or the statutory authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/16">The association's 2008 annual report showed that record damages were reclaimed from polluters on behalf of riparian owners and angling clubs. The River Blackwater was polluted with tin oxide in 2002, and a case was settled after many years of delay, with compensation being paid to the Ilford and District Piscatorial Society and the Kelvedon and District Angling Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/17">In Somerset, a farmer was prosecuted for a liquid food waste spill that caused massive damage to the waters of six different angling clubs on the River Brue, which is a beautiful river in the west country. The Environment Agency managed to secure a paltry fine of &pound;1,000, which is hardly a disincentive to the polluter&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> talked about the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle. However, the ACA pursued a civil claim in the courts and secured more than &pound;7,000 in additional damages, as well as &pound;4,000 in costs against the farmer. I am therefore proud to be a member of the association, which has now been absorbed into the new governing body for angling.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/18">On top of that, some other quite inspirational work is going on. The debate is about not just the Kennet and the Lee, but all the rivers of England, and I draw Members' attention to the work of the Wye and Usk Foundation. It is well worth the Minister and the shadow Minister visiting the foundation's website to see how we can adopt a professional approach to the restoration of one of Britain's most famous rivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/19">The river will be under dire threat, particularly as a fishery, if the proposal to build the Severn barrage goes through, and I pay tribute to the work that the hon. Member for Salisbury has done to highlight what an environmental disaster the Severn barrage could be.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.1/1">They are opposed to it to a man, woman and dog. It is not that we are environmental vandals; we want the tidal power of the River Severn to be harnessed, because that could make a contribution to green energy, but we do not want that to happen at the cost of destroying the environment, the spawning habitat of 25 per cent. of all salmon in England and Wales, and the jobs that depend on angling tourism, particularly in the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> and in rural Wales and the border counties. Such a development would run completely contrary to not only the spirit but the letter of the European habitats directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/2">I may be Labour's vice-chair on environmental issues, but if my Government pursue the Severn barrage, I give due notice that I will actively pursue action in the courts with non-governmental organisations and hon. Members on both sides of the House to ensure that the European habitats directive is enforced, because it is not possible, as the directive requires, to recreate a compensatory habitat in this case&mdash;we simply cannot build a new salmon river. We will return to that battle.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/3">The Wye and Usk Foundation was founded in 1996 and then became a company limited by guarantee. It has introduced radical measures to tackle acid rain and the acidification of the upper Wye catchment, which were making it impossible for salmon to spawn. We have seen the removal of man-made and sometimes natural obstructions, which were preventing the fish from reaching their spawning grounds. We have also seen amazing partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/4">We have seen sometimes insular owners of fisheries working together, allowing coarse anglers on to rivers that had been closed to them for many years. We have seen about &pound;6 million of public money&mdash;particularly European money&mdash;channelled through the Wye and Usk Foundation into voluntary groups and professional work carried out by contractors to restore a river that is certainly the pride of Wales and, in my view, the pride of Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/5">There are some big issues facing hon. Members. This is an easy speech for me to make, because I am not standing for re-election, but we as politicians&mdash;we have all been guilty of grubbing around for a few votes&mdash;need collectively to confront the issue of water metering, conservation and the price of water. The public will not value water if we continue to treat it as a throwaway commodity. I have no doubt that the third world war&mdash;I hope to God that there is not one&mdash;will be fought not over culture or religion, but over access to dry land and clean water. That is an inevitable consequence of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/6">The way we allow winter run-off from our rivers is appalling. If hon. Members stand on the Terrace in winter, they will see billions of gallons of water washing away to the North sea, but in a few months we will be complaining about low flows. We in this country are not efficient at retaining, storing and using the resource that we are blessed with. That is why projects such as the upper Thames reservoir at Abingdon must go ahead and why strategic planning decisions must be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/7">I am afraid that such decisions cannot be left to little local councils, with their predilection for parish-pump politics. That is why we have to be big people on the issue of water and be cognisant of the fact that we should be working closely with the powerful coalition of birdwatchers, environmentalists, anglers, naturalists and wildlife groups out there, just as we are working with the coalitions involved with the Blueprint for Water and the &quot;Rivers on the Edge&quot; campaign. Such issues should set the environmental agenda for the next generation, and water must be at the heart of that.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and that scheme was actually introduced in the higher-level stewardship scheme. The gentleman I spoke to at the Environment Agency this morning, who is a great professional, was unaware that it had been introduced&mdash;I kid you not, Mr. O'Hara. Actually, it was introduced by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" name="John Gummer">the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase> when he was Secretary of State for the Environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.3/2">There are other problems apart from those resulting from agriculture that we must address, although the nitrate problem and the nitrate directive are very serious issues, and that is linked to the question of the nil-grazing of stock. If we nil-graze stock such as the Holstein cattle, we will feed them on imported soya, which in turn gives rise to climate change issues elsewhere in the world. This is a global issue that is related not only to rivers in this country. I invite the Minister to address those other factors. Control of mink is seriously needed, for example. If we are to maintain biodiversity, we must keep a balance. Water voles are destroyed by mink, with which we have huge problems on the Avon catchment. Controlling mink means trapping and shooting them, but no one likes doing that to nice furry little mink, which look so nice. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire mentioned the problem of the signal crayfish, the American cousin. It has just about seen the back of the indigenous white-clawed crayfish, which I used to catch in the river in Salisbury as a child, turning over the stones to find them. They were wonderful eating.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.3/3">Another bone of contention and serious problem, which we thought we had licked, is the number of cormorants on our rivers. They consume vast numbers of fish, which upsets the biodiversity in our rivers. The restocking of our rivers with fish cannot keep up with the stock lost to cormorants. In the Salisbury area, 30 miles upstream from the coast, we have huge problems with the loss of both course and game fish. All that is caused by there being insufficient food in coastal areas, including through the loss of sand eels. Again, that shows the various interrelationships and how enormous a brief the Minister must carry as he answers for all these problems in his winding-up speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.3/4">Invasive plants are a serious problem in all our rivers. The Himalayan balsam is by far the worst. When the Himalayan balsam is present at the headwaters of a stream, as it is in the chalk streams of southern England, including the Kennet and Avon systems, everything downstream is clogged up. It has become endemic. Most major areas affected by Himalayan balsam have been identified by the Environment Agency, but if anyone spots it&mdash;if fishermen, for instance, see the plant or notice seeds floating down the river&mdash;for heaven's sake, they should tell the Environment Agency. Not nearly enough effort is being put into the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.3/5">I could go on but I will not, as other Members wish to speak. I will just say that we have no right to plunder our rivers as we are doing. It is our duty to protect our heritage. It is our duty to protect Arcadia and the silver streams of Albion.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.1/1">I am sorry; I got a bit carried away with my enthusiasm for the rivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/2">Another problem is pollution. Mention has been made of specific problems in specific places. Farming must play its part in ensuring that rivers are improved. Everything must be done to prevent the massive pollution incidents that occur from time to time, but those are not the only problems. There is also diffuse pollution. That is why nitrate-vulnerable zones were introduced. However, nitrate problems in river water are not solely to do with agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/3">Certainly, the legislation on nitrate-vulnerable zones does not seem to be fit for purpose. Regulations were introduced many years ago, since which the condition of many of our rivers has improved in terms of nitrate pollution. However, the Minister should be aware that not only agriculture, but sewage systems and various other industries, is involved. The burden on agricultural industry should be viewed in proportionate terms, not in the absolute terms that the NVZ legislation requires.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/4">The cleaning of rivers that pass through private agricultural land is both a private and public matter for which the Westminster and the devolved Governments must take some responsibility. Because we have had a certain amount of pollution, I am concerned about the licences that the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform issues for specific, large-scale civil engineering work such as the gas pipeline through my constituency. Such licences have not been accompanied by conditions on remedying and alleviating the pollution of rivers over which those big schemes pass. DBERR issues the licences, but does not have the powers to ensure that those conditions are implemented, so the pollution goes on.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/5">I shall draw my remarks to a conclusion, as the Minister has a lot on his plate. He will need all the time available to him to respond on all those issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.0/1">Thank you, Mr. O'Hara, for your chairmanship. There are several styles in which I usually make these concluding remarks&mdash;sometimes I am slow and languorous, and at other times, I am like a machine gun.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-13a.278.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" colnum="278"  time="016:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090513/halltext/90513h0009.htm#09051344000505">
	<p pid="a.278.0/1">Indeed. That is where the balance must be struck. On the Bow Bridge aquifer, I will ask the Environment Agency to contact the hon. Lady and discuss that and other issues further. She did a good job of reminding us how important the birds and the bees are, as well as the butterflies.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/2">The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire talked about intelligent approaches to abstraction. I absolutely agree&mdash;that is the direction of travel in which we are going. It is also important to balance supply and demand. On the importance of agriculture, yes, it is a major component of diffuse pollution, but there are many other aspects, too. We must also move forward on those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/3">In the few minutes remaining, I shall turn to some of the issues that the hon. Member for Vale of York mentioned. She spoke comprehensively on many matters&mdash;not only agriculture, but the wider issues surrounding the water framework directive. We all share the same aspirations: to have a sustainable, affordable and secure supply of clean, good quality water and a healthy environment. I think that everyone recognises that achieving that is no easy feat. The two biggest challenges ahead of us in the water sector are the increasing demand for water and our changing climate. The population is growing and the pattern of hotter summers, wetter winters and extreme weather will continue. We also still need to tackle ongoing issues, such as pollution. None of those problems have quick fixes; we must take a long-term view. That is the basis of the future water strategy, which outlines how we intend to deliver our vision right through to 2030.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/4">We are taking a long-term approach, but we will achieve our aims only by working together. Homeowners, businesses, water companies, environmentalists and everyone else need to work with us. In many areas, we are already reaping the rewards. We have made great progress. No one today has remarked on the progress that we have made in cleaning up our rivers across the UK. We have considered issues in highly stressed areas today, but across the UK&mdash;as the title of the debate implies&mdash;we have made progress in cleaning up our bathing waters, beaches and rivers. We have addressed some of the most acute sources of pollution, such as sewage treatment works and overflows.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/5">Fifty years ago, the River Thames outside our doors here was so polluted that it was declared biologically dead, but it now supports more than 120 fish species. Otters and kingfishers have returned to stretches of river from which they were absent for many years. We have been used to figures reported under the general quality assessment, which has shown a consistent improvement in the quality of our rivers since it was introduced in 1990. Let us remind ourselves where we are. Some 72 per cent. of rivers were of good biological quality in 2007, compared with 55 per cent. in 1990. However, we need to go further.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/6">The water framework directive sets exciting&mdash;I have to use these often over-used words&mdash;extremely challenging new targets for the quality of our rivers, and it brings with it a more stringent set of requirements for measuring their quality. We are now looking at the ecological health of our rivers&mdash;not just simple indicators of water quality&mdash;and, indeed, other water bodies including lakes and coastal regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/7">The headline figures look far worse than those reported under GQA, because we monitor many more quality indicators under the directive than under the GQA and because the worst-rated element determines the overall class, yet the quality of our rivers continues to improve. Working with others on the ground&mdash;industry sectors, local stakeholders and local partners including, I am sure, some of those who are listening to the debate&mdash;the Environment Agency has developed many draft river basin management plans. Some people believe that such measures do not go far enough, and I agree. We want them to be more ambitious, but they have to be more ambitious without resting on one individual or one organisation. Across the board, we must all play our part. We are currently exploring ways flexibly to manage areas where water quality standards are falling, and water protection zones are one possibility there.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/8">Agriculture has a huge impact on such pollution, but we have been supporting farmers in their efforts to reduce a range of pollutants, including nitrates. Through the England catchment sensitive farming delivery initiative, farmers have received advice as well as capital grants in priority areas. Such measures will help.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/9">Water companies have a vital role to play, and I am keen to see more initiatives like SCAMP&mdash;the United Utilities sustainable catchment management programme&mdash;and South West Water's Exmoor mire restoration projects. Ofwat is undertaking its periodic review of water price limits for 2010 to 2015. I am glad to say that there are now more than 100 management schemes in water companies' final business plans&mdash;more than double what originally appeared in their draft plans. Misconnections and bringing people together are other issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.0/10">We have much more work to do, but our rivers are continuing to improve. Now more than ever, through the river basin management plans, we have the chance to plan and manage sustainable, long-term improvements in the quality of our rivers. We are all striving to square the circle, deal with all the difficult and challenging issues and bring back the Arcadia that the hon. Member for Salisbury described, and the more that we can engage with that actively&mdash;on the ground, not just in Whitehall&mdash;the more chance we have of success.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.3/1">I am sorry, Mr. O'Hara. I meant that there is a great deal to say within the time allocated for the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/2">Alan Irwin is a licensed aircraft engineer who is facing criminal prosecution in Greece for manslaughter as a consequence of a fatal air accident in summer 2005. In that accident, 121 people died. It would be difficult for any of us to understand or imagine the impact that it has had on his family, and on him and his health, or the consequences of having to live with and deal with such an event hanging over one. That is why I asked for this debate. I gave the Minister notice of it, and I hope that we can get some good, conclusive answers.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/3">At 9.7 am on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-14">14 August 2005</phrase>, Helios Airways Flight 522 left Larnaca for Athens on the first leg of a flight to Prague. The aircraft only partially pressurised and both pilots succumbed to hypoxia, which is caused by oxygen deprivation. Their performance deteriorated rapidly, and they soon lapsed into unrecoverable unconsciousness. With no further input from the pilots, the aircraft continued on its pre-programmed flight to Athens.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/4">The flight was on autopilot for about three hours. It ran out of fuel and crashed at Grammatiko, north-west of Athens, at 12.3 pm. All 121 people on board lost their lives. The accident received worldwide media attention &mdash;indeed, I remember it well&mdash;but particularly in Cyprus, Greece and the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/5">The Greek Air Accident Investigation and Aviation Safety Board investigated the accident, and the final report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase>. It is highly contested on several issues, one of which is the unsupported assumption that Mr. Irwin left the pressurisation mode selector in manual after a pre-flight maintenance task. The report makes it clear that the accident was caused by the crew not identifying the aircraft's failure to pressurise, due in part to the use by the Boeing Company of a misleading warning horn. The United States Federal Aviation Administration recently said that the system creates an unsafe condition in this widely used aircraft. In layman's language, the same sound and tone of horn is emitted for two completely different faults. The pilot and aircrew misinterpreted the sound of the horn as indicating a different fault.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/6">The report found that both pilots were licensed and qualified in accordance with international standards, and that they were adequately rested and medically fit to conduct the flight. The aircraft also conformed to international standards and had no recorded defects. The Cypriot company, Helios Airways, was found to be in compliance with the European joint aviation requirements known as JAR-OPS 1. The last audit of the company, in July 2005, was conducted by UK Civil Aviation Authority inspectors who were contracted to the Cypriot authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/7">Mr. Irwin was working on a short-term contract with Helios Airways for the summer of 2005. It was the second season that he had worked for Helios Airways in Cyprus. He is now facing criminal charges in Greece for manslaughter with potential intent, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. There is also the emotional impact of knowing that 121 people died on the flight. Although there is only one charge of manslaughter, Mr. Irwin is facing criminal charges for 121 deaths, not one.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/8">Mr. Irwin was not insured for the prohibitive cost of defending himself, and his continued defence is now in jeopardy because of the lack of financial support available to him. Helios Airways did not carry legal expenses insurance, which would have indemnified him in respect of the defence costs he now faces.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/9">At 4.25 am on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-14">14 August</phrase>, the aircraft arrived at Larnaca from London Heathrow. The cabin crew reported freezing around the rear service door seal at cruise altitude, and loud bangs during the flight. The captain consequently requested a full inspection of the door. With two other engineers, Mr. Irwin carried out an inspection of the rear service door of the aircraft. They found no fault when they inspected the door on the ground, so Mr. Irwin pressurised the aircraft to reproduce conditions similar to those experienced in flight. This is a normal procedure for a flight engineer. Again, the engineers found no fault with the door, so the aircraft was depressurised. During the test pressurisation, the aircraft pressurised as normal, and as it would have done at altitude in flight.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/10">Mr. Irwin entered the details of his actions in the aircraft technical log and recorded that no fault had been found with the rear service door. At 6.15 am, he signed off the maintenance procedure. That was about two hours before the flight crew arrived to start their pre-flight preparations.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/11">The accident report maintains that Mr. Irwin left the pressurisation mode selector in the manual, as opposed to the automatic, position after depressurising the aircraft. He has stated that he left the selector in the automatic position&mdash;the normal position for flight&mdash;as was his usual practice over, I believe, 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/12">The final accident report states that</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/13" class="indent">&quot;the Board concluded that if the Ground Engineer number one had not returned the mode selector to the AUTO position, this could not be considered an omission as there was no specific requirement to do so.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/14">I repeat that he was not required to leave the selector in the automatic position.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/15">However, the report inconsistently concludes that a contributing factor in the accident was the omission of returning the pressurisation mode selector to auto after unscheduled maintenance of the aircraft. It is that conclusion which forms the foundation of the prosecution of Mr. Irwin.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/16">Since the accident, Mr. Irwin has carried out certain tests recorded on video in the presence of various aviation experts. The tests demonstrate that it is unlikely that he had left the pressurisation mode selector in the manual position after depressurising the aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/17">The draft final report was issued by the Greek board in May 2006. It was sent to the various entitled states for comment under the provisions of &quot;Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation&quot;, which is annex 13 to the Chicago Convention 1944. Despite the fact that Mr. Irwin's alleged omission was the key to the predicted accident scenario, the Greek board would not give permission for him to have a copy of the draft report. After representations by Helios Airways, he was eventually allowed to see only those pages that related directly to his actions. Even though he was unable to appreciate the full picture, only having been given selected pages, he made limited comments through his lawyer on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July 2006</phrase>. Although the state agency is entitled to receive a copy under annex 13, chapter 6.3 of the Chicago convention, the United Kingdom Air Accidents Investigation Branch did not receive a copy of the draft final report when it was first issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/18">On about <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-23">23 July 2006</phrase>, the AAIB was able to send a copy of the report to Mr. Irwin to enable him to make significant and substantial comments. He was given 28 days to submit his comments, instead of the usual 60 days mandated by Greek law. Mr. Irwin acknowledged receipt of the report on the following day and included details of the tests he had carried out. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-26">26 July</phrase>, the AAIB forwarded these comments to the Greek board by e-mail and post. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-04">4 August</phrase>, the AAIB forwarded Mr. Irwin's final comments, which again included details of the test, to the Greek board by e-mail and post. Mr. Irwin requested:</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/19" class="indent">&quot;Should the final report not be amended to include my formal comments, I would like them to be appended.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/20">The state of United Kingdom is entitled to make such a request under the provisions of annex 13, chapter 6.3. The state of Greece is obliged to comply with such a request under the same provision, but it did not do so. Although the AAIB was led to believe that Mr. Irwin's comments had been received by the Greek board, it has since transpired that the comments were either not received or have been mislaid. Therefore, details of the tests that cast reasonable doubt on the contention that Mr. Irwin left the selector in manual were neither included in nor appended to the final report.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/21">Annex 13, chapter 5.13 of the Chicago convention makes provision for an investigation to be re-opened if new and significant evidence becomes available. As the comments of the state of the United Kingdom on behalf of Mr. Irwin do not appear to be in the possession of the Greek board and have not been included in or appended to the final report, they constitute new and significant evidence&mdash;obviously, as they were not included.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/22">The UK AAIB has been asked to make representations to the Greek board to re-open the investigation to consider the comments of the state of United Kingdom on behalf of Mr. Irwin, particularly those related to the tests. Annex 13, chapter 3.1 of the Chicago convention states:</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/23" class="indent">&quot;The sole objective of the investigation of an accident or incident shall be the prevention of accidents and incidents. It is not the purpose of this activity to apportion blame or liability.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/24">It has always been the case that any major air accident has been investigated with the sole purpose being not to apportion blame, but to take the evidence from that investigation to prevent accidents from occurring in future. The Greek final report into this accident is being used openly as the basis for the criminal charges that Mr. Irwin now faces, although his statement was not taken under caution and he was not afforded the usual protection of persons under investigation for criminal wrongdoing.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/25">There is no direct evidence that Mr. Irwin's actions contributed to the accident, yet he has been publicly vilified at extreme personal cost. Mr. Irwin's name was released to the United Kingdom, Greek and Cypriot media during an extremely emotional time&mdash;children were on board the flight&mdash;and as a consequence he became a figure of public hate. Mr. Irwin's actions were portrayed in the media as a causal factor in this accident, and he is now facing criminal prosecution in Greece.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/26">Even if Mr. Irwin had left the selector in manual, which he did not, it is a basic principle in aviation that an aircraft engineer is never responsible for configuring an aircraft for flight: this is the sole responsibility of the flight crew, as part of their pre-flight checks, and the ultimate responsibility rests with the captain.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/27">The cost of a criminal defence in Greece is prohibitive and Mr. Irwin faces the prospect of funding his defence personally. A small amount of funding for all the defendants was secured when the Greek charges were initially served. However, there is now a parallel criminal prosecution in Cyprus and although Mr. Irwin is not yet named in the Cypriot proceedings, this has placed an immense strain on the diminishing funds that are available. Those funds will shortly be exhausted. Mr. Irwin is not in a position to continue funding his defence personally, although the failure to mount a proper defence could lead to a custodial sentence in Greece&mdash;a life sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/28">It is anticipated that the Cypriot proceedings will overtake the Greek proceedings: they are already at an advanced stage, owing to the differences in the two criminal justice systems. Mr Irwin will not be entitled to a reimbursement of the fees paid in Greece, regardless of the outcome of the proceedings. For the sake of clarity, it is important to highlight the fact that parallel criminal proceedings in two different European jurisdictions are as yet not prohibited, though this is the subject to debate at European Commission level.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/29">Thankfully, Mr. Irwin is not included in both cases, but the double proceedings do have an impact on him. The legal resources are now split between two countries and the funding has to be divided between both cases to ensure that a full and proper defence is mounted in both courts. Mr. Irwin's legal team believes that he may not receive a fair trial in view of the damaging and speculative press stories that circulated in the aftermath of the accident.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/30">This accident had a huge emotional impact in both Greece and Cyprus. Mr. Irwin's name and actions were freely discussed in media reports and his home address was also published. Despite receiving various retractions from the UK press after the defamatory comments had been published, the belief remains in the public's eyes that his actions caused this accident. Various senior aviation experts disagree with this allegation, but, as far as Mr. Irwin and his family are concerned, the damage has been done. If the case is allowed to continue in Greece, it is obvious that the media-fuelled speculation and rumours will have an effect on the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/31">Neither Helios Airways nor Mr. Irwin had access to any of the components of the pressurisation system after the accident. They cannot therefore review the tests done during the investigation or carry out their own independent tests. The relevant components are still being held by the Greek Government, although the major part of the wreckage has been released.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/32">I have a number of questions to ask the Minister, of which he is aware. Will he address Mr. Irwin's case with his counterpart in Greece? In light of the issues highlighted in this debate, it is apparent that the prosecution in Greece is misconceived and the use of the accident report is inappropriate under the circumstances. Can the use of the official accident report in respect of criminal prosecutions be raised by the UK with the International Civil Aviation Organisation? Will the Government assist Mr. Irwin with his defence costs in Greece?</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/33">Article 1 of European Union Council directive 94/56/EC of <phrase class="date" code="1994-11-21">21 November 1994</phrase>, establishing the fundamental principles governing the investigation of civil aviation accidents, states:</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/34" class="indent">&quot;The purpose of this Directive is to improve air safety by facilitating the expeditious holding of investigations, the sole objective of which is the prevention of future accidents and incidents.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.280.3/35">Both the UK and Greece have adopted this directive. Will the Minister now make representations to the EU for its members to adhere to the overriding objective of the directive and prevent the misuse of air accident reports being used to criminalise aviation? Will the Minister make representations to the UK AAIB to request that the investigation be re-opened in accordance with annex 13, chapter 5.13 of the Chicago convention, in the light of the evidence that was not considered by the Hellenic Air Accident Investigation and Aviation Safety Board?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-13a.292.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1911" speakername="Claire Ward" speakeroffice="The Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household"  colnum="292"  time="016:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090513/halltext/90513h0011.htm#09051356000121">
	<p pid="a.292.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1595" name="Parmjit Dhanda">the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate. I credit him on his efforts in support of his constituents. He is an assiduous Member, who always fights for more investment in Gloucester. The detail that he has given today shows how much his constituents have benefited&mdash;not only from having a Labour Government, but from having a Labour Member of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/2">My hon. Friend referred to the fact that I am standing in for the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1936" name="Patrick McFadden">the Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. McFadden)</phrase>, who commences his paternity leave today, and we all wish him well.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/3">The subject of this debate is very important, both in the context of the current economic climate and in reflecting the challenges faced by businesses and communities up and down the country. Over the past decade, Gloucester and its hinterlands have made a significant contribution to boosting and underpinning economic growth in the south-west region. It has led the way in developing a high valued-added, advanced technology and manufacturing base, which has driven up skill levels and provided well-paid jobs for the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/4">I recognise that Gloucester&mdash;in particular, its advanced manufacturing sector&mdash;has been hit particularly hard by the economic downturn and recession, and my hon. Friend has worked closely with many businesses to help them through these difficult times. It is vital that the Government and their economic development agencies do as much as possible to help to mitigate the immediate problems faced by local businesses and individuals and to secure the skills base that has been developed so successfully. For example, several high-tech firms&mdash;in aerospace engineering and motor manufacturing, for instance&mdash;in the county are being impacted on through the supply chains.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/5">The situation is being monitored closely by the regional economic taskforce, led by the Minister for the South West and including the RDA. Gloucestershire First, too, has set up an economic taskforce to deal with the business issues associated with the downturn, and the local authority has undertaken work to support local people affected by the downturn. The focus is on better information. The Federation of Small Businesses will survey banks in Gloucester to ensure that they are following the national criteria. The support packages announced by the Government will ensure that the national measures are working on the ground and that the information is getting out through the banks and various agencies. We all hope that that will happen in all our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/6">I cannot pretend that there are any easy solutions or quick fixes to these significant problems. The global downturn requires global solutions, and I am proud of the way in which the Government have led the way in developing ideas and practical actions aimed at mitigating the effects of the recession and preparing for the recovery. The current economic climate means tough choices on public spending. Like other parts of government, businesses and households, RDAs nationally have had to face budget reductions and declining capital receipts.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/7">SWRDA must work within its financial allocation, and re-prioritise its investment plans and existing financial commitments, to ensure that funding is directed in the most efficient and effective way, to help the regional economy and businesses to survive and recover. The agency is re-prioritising its spending programmes and looking for further efficiencies in its own operations. Inevitably, that will impact on some of the work that it has planned. It has informed its partners and stakeholders in the region that it will make announcements about the outcome of its re-prioritisation exercise in June, after its board meeting later this month, and it will consider recommendations. I am sure that officials will draw attention to the strong case that my hon. Friend has made on behalf of his constituents, businesses and developments in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/8">Naturally, concerns have been raised locally, but SWRDA has been extremely responsible in keeping its partners and stakeholders informed of its plans. However, it has signalled that, as part of its refreshed corporate plan, priorities will include planning for a sustainable recovery and longer-term economic prosperity; supporting businesses through the recession; and setting the foundations for a low-carbon economy. SWRDA is playing a key role as part of the Government response to the recession, as set out in its publication, &quot;First Steps: Action for Recovery&quot;, launched in November 2008. The Government have worked with, and through, the RDAs to give help to businesses in the south-west. I shall return to that a little later.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/9">Nationally, supporting businesses is at the heart of the package of measures developed to support what are, in effect, the lifeblood of our economy&mdash;small and medium-sized businesses&mdash;through this difficult period. The package of support, delivered through the RDA-run Business Link networks, provides practical solutions to help businesses to secure credit and finance, to plan for managing day-to-day operations through these difficult times and to plan for future investment priorities. That includes several different schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/10">Under the enterprise finance guarantee scheme, the Government have provided &pound;1 billion of guarantees to support up to &pound;1.3 billion of bank lending to smaller firms. Under the working capital scheme, the Government have provided banks with up to &pound;10 billion of guarantees, covering 50 per cent. of the risk. That will secure up to &pound;20 billion of working capital credit lines for companies and free up capital that the banks will use for new lending. Under the capital for enterprise scheme, we have set up a new &pound;75 million fund&mdash;&pound;50 million of Government funding and &pound;25 million from the banks. Professional fund managers are providing equity investment, which can be used to pay off existing debt, to free up capital for day-to-day cash flow and for future investment for viable companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/11">Working with the European Investment Bank, the Government have helped UK banks to negotiate credit lines of more than &pound;4 billion to provide loans to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.0/1">I am grateful for all investment throughout Gloucestershire. I appreciate that the Minister is concluding her remarks, but after the debate, will she nudge my right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs, when he comes back after his well deserved two weeks' paternity leave, to arrange a visit, so that he can see some of the local projects that she mentioned and to follow up matters with our local urban regeneration company, which would be keen to see him, especially following the <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-18">18 May</phrase> meeting?</p>
