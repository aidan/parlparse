<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.71.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" speakername="Gary Streeter" colnum="71"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h01.htm#60419h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.71.3/1">I am pleased to contribute to this Adjournment debate on the important country of Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/2">Belarus, which is a country of 10 million people, was formerly part of the Soviet Union and is on the doorstep of the European Union. It abuts Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, which are all former Soviet Union countries and now full and welcome members of the EU. Like Poland, Belarus has had a difficult history. It is wedged between Germany to the west and Russia to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1748" name="Alan Simpson">the east. As my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson)</phrase> with his expertise in military history knows only too well, sadly Belarus has seen occupying troops from west and east rampaging over its soil many times during the centuries. Its capital, Minsk, was particularly badly treated during the second world war. Unlike Poland, Belarus remains in poor shape to meet the challenges of the 21st century and a globalising world. Belarus adjoins Ukraine, which was also once a mainstay of the communist bloc but is now a young and emerging democracy that aspires to join the EU, an aspiration that has my full support.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/3">Unfortunately, Belarus, which is a European country, has become stuck in a negative time warp. Since 1994, it has been run by Alexander Lukashenko, who is sometimes described as the last dictator in Europe. I shall illustrate what he and the country are like. I was in Minsk just before the recent presidential elections and it was like stepping back in time. While I was there, Mr. Lukashenko spoke to a national convention in the capital for three and a half hours. His speech was punctuated with Soviet-style applause by the great and the good who were proudly displaying their medals. Every word of that speech was broadcast live by the state-owned television service, and when our meetings were over for the day we could rush back to the ambassador's residence and watch it again on an extended news broadcast. That was only a summary of the highlights but lasted one and a quarter hours. All that was just one week before the country went to the polls.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/4">Since 1994 Mr. Lukashenko has systematically closed down the free press, banned most non-governmental organisations, stopped churches meeting freely, imprisoned political opponents on trumped-up charges, outlawed street protests and filled all key positions in the Government, the judiciary and the electoral commission with his supporters. His party piece, which I did not witness, is to sack Cabinet Ministers on live television, showing firmly who is in charge. I hope that the Government here do not intend to follow that practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/5">Our excellent ambassador in Minsk, Brian Bennett, demonstrates a real commitment to the people of Belarus and is a credit to the Foreign Office. He describes Mr. Lukashenko as someone who is not yet quite a dictator but is a coming dictator. He is slowly eradicating dissent and eliminating opponents. I heard that assessment with a growing sense of foreboding. He presides over an old-fashioned, centrally planned economy that is dependent on heavily subsidised Russian gas and oil. The state-controlled media daily reinforce the message that life in Belarus is good and stable, unlike in the volatile neighbouring countries where, they say, unemployment is soaring. All public sector employment contracts are for 12 months only and if employees do not do what the president demands their contracts are not renewed. It is as simple as that. The public sector in Belarus accounts for well over 50 per cent. of its gross domestic product, so a significant number of people live their lives on 12-month contracts at the president's whim. Any student who takes part in dissident activity is banned from further study.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/6">It is chilling that the president, who is only 52, has a growing iron grip on his fellow countrymen that is becoming tighter by the day. When he was first elected in 1994, not long after the Soviet Union had collapsed, the constitution permitted a president to stand for only two terms. He has recently cajoled the citizens of his country into voting through a change in the constitution to permit him to stand again and, I suspect, again and again. It is worth emphasising that that unacceptable form of leadership is not on the other side of the world or in some bygone era. It is happening now, today on our very doorstep.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/7">I was in Belarus to meet Opposition party leaders in the run-up to the presidential election on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-19">19 March</phrase>. They were campaigning bravely despite constant intimidation, harassment, the risk of imprisonment and personal risk to themselves and their families. Many had been imprisoned several times and accepted that part of being in Opposition politics in Belarus is that they would spend some time in prison. That is part of political life there, rather as we think of campaigning and knocking on doors as being part of political life in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/8">I am pleased that many democracy-building organisations in the west, including America, other European countries and Britain through the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, have worked for many years in Belarus to try to support and build capacity in fledgling parties and would-be politicians who struggle to usher in a new dawn of freedom and democracy in their country.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/9">We all respect the Minister for Europe, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" name="Douglas Alexander">the right hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, South (Mr. Alexander)</phrase>, and I want to say in his hearing that much of the democracy-building work by political parties through the Westminster Foundation for Democracy in many parts of the world is unseen, long term and difficult to measure, but its contribution is one of the most important that the House makes to the developing world and to many countries that have no history of democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/10">One of the good things that happened in the run-up to the election was that most of the Opposition forces agreed to form a coalition around an outstanding man, Alexander Milinkevich, who is as brave and honourable a man as anyone could wish to meet. I had a meeting with him for one and a half hours and left it feeling very humble and that I had been in the presence of a very special person.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/11">One evening, I witnessed 3,000 courageous freedom fighters assembled in the centre of Minsk against the diktats of their Government and despite the best efforts of the police and the state storm-troopers who did everything in their power to deter them. I watched those brave souls march through the snow singing their songs of freedom while the riot police snaked around them. It was a truly inspirational moment that I will never forget. Mr. Milinkevich addressed the crowd and made it clear that they did not seek a revolution but simply wanted free and fair elections so that the people of Belarus could genuinely decide for themselves who should govern them.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/12">It is not a matter for me, for this Chamber or for this country who runs Belarus. It is a matter for the people of Belarus. Our only concern lies in ensuring that they make the decision in verifiably free and fair elections. However, that is not what happened on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-19">19 March</phrase> when Mr. Lukashenko received an astonishing vote of 82.6 per cent. of popular support. We knew that it would be more than the 79 per cent. that he had predicted, but it takes some gall to suggest that 82 per cent. of the population voted for him.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/13">Was that a genuine result? The preliminary report of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is an experienced organisation that we all greatly respect, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/14" class="indent">&quot;It is clear that this election did not meet OSCE commitments and international electoral standards. The arbitrary abuse of state power, obviously designed to protect the incumbent President, went far beyond acceptable practice. The incumbent President permitted State authority to be used in a manner which did not allow citizens to freely and fairly express their will at the ballot box.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/15">It continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/16" class="indent">&quot;A pattern of intimidation, and the suppression of independent voices, including those remaining non-State print media, was evident throughout the campaign. Such actions impeded the possibility for vibrant campaign discourse, and raise doubts regarding the authorities' willingness to tolerate political competition on the basis of equal treatment before the law and by the authorities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/17">It goes on to talk about early voting, which is a very significant point. Whenever we talk about rigged voting&mdash;I shall come on to that point in a moment&mdash;the crucial question is how it is done. The report says that</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/18" class="indent">&quot;regulation of early voting is non-transparent and fails to provide safeguards. The lack of any official protocols to document the record of voting on each day of early voting, as well as the lack of security provisions for the closing and overnight storage of the ballot box, increases the possibility for electoral malfeasance&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/19">It is not enough, it seems, for Mr. Lukashenko to brutalise all opposition forces, or for him to have sole control of all media outlets. He has gone on to ensure that voting procedures can be completely abused.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/20">This is what happens: people who vote early can turn up at the polling booth seven days before election day. It turns out that 31 per cent. of the people voted early. That night, votes are taken away by the election officials, under no scrutiny and with no one overseeing what goes in the ballot boxes, and the boxes are put out the next day with no check made of them whatever. That is one clear possibility of abuse for 31 per cent. of the vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/21">On election day itself, when the rest of the population vote, the system of informing the world of who has voted for whom consists of one person, a member of the precinct electoral commission. Unseen by anyone else or any of the opposition forces and not checked by any independent verifiers, in a small room on his own, he fills in a piece of paper saying who voted for whom. Would we accept that in this country as a fair way of recording who voted for whom? We would not. The situation is ripe for vote rigging and I have no doubt that this vote was completely rigged by President Lukashenko of Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/22">It was announced that the president had won 82.6 per cent. of the vote, but what has happened since? Many brave citizens took to the streets to protest in larger numbers than ever before, but, sadly, the riot police were deployed in far greater force than before and many citizens were attacked and arrested. Hundreds have been imprisoned since <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase> and many of them were imprisoned by judges appointed by Mr. Lukashenko and those loyal to him, and, of course, he is quite capable of removing any judge. Some of those prisoners have not been heard of since.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/23">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase>, I took part in my first ever street demonstration, outside the embassy of Belarus in Kensington. Standing there with people from Belarus, singing &quot;Zhive Belarus&quot;, which means &quot;long live Belarus&quot;, and waving their former white and red national flag was a very moving moment. We were there for about two hours. It was very cold&mdash;we were extremely brave&mdash;and the police were called three times by the people inside the embassy because they were frightened of our street demonstration.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/24">I shall read an eye-witness account of some of the action in Minsk at about the same time. One person has written of her experience of demonstrating about the presidential election results in Minsk:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/25" class="indent">&quot;Buses came to the square. We were surrounded. Riot police jumped out of the buses. They ordered us 'lie down on the ground'. We lay down, and every second or third policemen began to beat us. I held on to Vera.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/26">That is her daughter. She continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/27" class="indent">&quot;Some girl stood in the middle of the tent camp and began to pray. It was so dramatic. I couldn't believe I really was there . . . One policeman grabbed Vera by her hair and pulled. Another screamed at him, 'Don't beat her, don't you see that she is totally young'. The other one beat her nevertheless.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/28" class="indent">They pulled her away. Then they threw me head towards . . . the asphalt pavement. Falling down, I hit the ground with the back of my head. Then they hit me in the face. Now the left side of my face is injured, I have a bruise under my left eye.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/29" class="indent">They grabbed me as some pig, thrown into the bus. They screamed at us, called us pigs, asked what we were doing here, with this revolution. In the bus they kicked me in my back all the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/30" class="indent">I lie on the floor and thoughts are stirring in my head, 'Where is Vera?' I didn't recognise them. I fainted. When I regained my consciousness, I still haven't been able to recognise them for several minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/31" class="indent">Then they prevented us from talking to each other . . . they brought us to the prison . . . the whole corridor was jammed with people. They treated us as real criminals, screaming, 'Face the wall! Stop talking! . . . ' Then they went from one to another, asking, if there were underage children.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/32" class="indent">So we stood near the wall, I have no idea, how long. They arrested us around 3 a.m. And we had to stand facing the wall till around 1 p.m.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/33">I am really sorry if there are people in the embassy of Belarus in Kensington who were scared of 30 people in suits standing peacefully on the street corner chanting a few slogans, but that is as nothing to what the Government of Belarus did to their own people who had the audacity to protest and campaign for freedom in their capital city. But the election is over, the protests, for now, are quelled and Mr Lukashenko remains in office with all the apparatus of the state to keep him there.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/34">What is to be done? My purpose in raising this issue is to ask the Government of the United Kingdom to do all in their power to play their full part in putting the Government of Belarus under pressure to change their ways and provide for free and fair elections. I hope to hear the Government's strategy for seeking freedom for the people of Belarus. I also ask the Minister to spell out his understanding of what the European Union intends to do to keep up this pressure on this European country.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/35">I know that there is no magic solution. No one, of course, is suggesting military intervention&mdash;let us get that out of the way right now. There is no silver bullet, but there are some things that can be done and I have three suggestions. First, the people of Belarus lack basic information about the true state of their nation, their president and the true nature of the EU and the surrounding states. In the absence of a free press, how could they get a balanced picture? Many are poor and have no access to electronic media. Could more be done, perhaps by the BBC World Service, to ensure that more broadcasts in Belarusian are transmitted to get the message across?</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/36">I understand that during the past three or four months the EU has sponsored radio transmissions into Belarus, which is a good thing. However, I was told while I was in Belarus that it is transmitted in such a way&mdash;I will not say, &quot;Typical EU&quot;&mdash;that hardly anyone can receive it. There is a technical problem, but I am not qualified to say what that is. Will the Minister please look into that? It is important that transmission of what is really going on in the outside world takes place and it is important that the EU takes a lead in that. Will the Minister ensure that whatever is being done is done as effectively as possible, and will he say what resources the Government are prepared to commit to getting a message of freedom to the people of Belarus?</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/37">Secondly, a key to this situation is clearly the giant of Russia, right on the eastern border of Belarus. Although I understand that President Lukashenko and President Putin do not enjoy a harmonious personal relationship, Russia is no doubt keen to see a non-democratic neighbour on its doorstep, in contrast to recent events in Ukraine and elsewhere. The economy of Belarus is kept afloat by heavily subsidised gas and oil. I do not wish the people of Belarus ill in any way, shape or form, but sometimes it can take the harsh wind of economic reality to bring a nation to its knees and to its senses. What pressure are the UK Government and the EU putting on President Putin about these subsidies and the Russian approach to Belarus generally? If the President of Russia is keen to portray himself as a democrat and world leader, is it not the case that he should be encouraged to take a more robust approach with this rogue dictator on our doorstep?</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/38">Thirdly, are we listening to the man who has managed to unite almost all opposition forces in Belarus, namely Alexander Milinkevich? He has called for the west to be tougher and more resolute. He has called for us</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/39" class="indent">&quot;to send a stronger message that Belarus has experienced a constitutional coup that brought to power a man who is not eligible for it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/40">He has called for &quot;targeted repressive sanctions&quot; against officials and judges responsible for arrests and jailing of opposition supporters, as well as the state media journalists for &quot;deceitful&quot; coverage of the protests. The EU currently bans visits from about six of the top officials from Belarus, and I ask the Minister whether it is time to extend that travel ban to make it bite more widely and deeply. What does he say in response to Mr. Milinkevich's calls for targeted, repressive sanctions? Does he agree that it should be a priority for the EU to bring about change in Belarus?</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/41">What is democracy about? It is about the rule of law, freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, a strong civil society, respect for human rights and, above all, the ability of a people to elect and remove their leaders through verifiably free and fair elections. None of those elements is present in Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/42">The Conservative party has committed itself, through the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, to working alongside opposition forces in Belarus to stay the course until freedom finally comes to that European country. I appreciate that the Government and our friends in the Liberal Democrats feel just as strongly about the issue as we do. We will continue to raise our concerns about Belarus on the Floor of the House. Some people will say that this matter has nothing to do with us and that our foreign policy should be narrowly in the national interest, but it is in our national interest to help to spread freedom and democracy to all parts of the world. It is offensive to have that tinpot dictator on our doorstep.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/43">I invite the Minister at the end of the debate to satisfy hon. Members that the Government and the EU will marshal all their resources, harness all their political will and do all that they can until the freedoms that we take for granted in this country are present also in Belarus.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.77.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="77"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h01.htm#60419h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.77.1/1">I might just nuance my answer on the totality of the hon. Gentleman's comments, but what he says is right in the Belarusian context. We know that the election was stolen probably by ballot rigging, but also by the total suppression of proper access for alternative voices&mdash;democratic voices&mdash;to the media. The media simply were not able to perform their role in the run-up to the election. Nor is there the structure of alternative voices through non-governmental organisations and civil society that we would expect in a society such as ours, or even in a much newer democracy. Those processes simply have not been allowed to exist, and where they do exist, they have not been allowed to take root and flourish. Again, that is a tragedy for Belarus because it means that it has been denied the opportunity to examine its future in all the different ways that that would mean.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/2">The conclusion that everyone draws is that the election was rigged. I think you were there last week, Mr. Hancock, when the Romanian chairman-in-office of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe made a strong statement on Belarus, making it clear that, across the whole European family, there was no ambiguity about the issue. There is one proviso, but the Council of Europe as a whole was of the view that the election was severely rigged. The oddity is that at the same time as the Council of Europe, the OSCE and most reputable bodies were condemning the election as rigged, the Commonwealth of Independent States concluded that the election was substantively free and fair. That is a significant shame, because it demonstrates a polarisation of views on Belarus between the European Union and those who take a similar view, and Moscow.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/3">Our relations with Russia are of massive significance, but we have to say to the Russians that they are getting it consistently wrong about Belarus by going through a pretence that an election that was clearly flawed was free and fair. It was claimed that President Lukashenko obtained 82.6 per cent. of the vote&mdash;a ridiculous figure by almost any standard. I was almost inclined to ask the hon. Member for South-West Devon whether he could give me an accurate prediction of the result next time, as it is clear that President Lukashenko is ambitious to increase his share of the vote on each occasion. Such predictions may already exist in the presidential palace in Minsk. That cynicism, alas, is what we end up with. There is absolute cynicism about the capacity of Lukashenko to deal as an honest broker on behalf of the people of Belarus with the wider Europe and the wider world. He ends up with little credibility through this flawed or even non-electoral process.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/4">Perhaps I should comment on another important issue that the hon. Member for South-West Devon raised: what happened after the election. There were not only protests outside the embassy in London, although I congratulate him on that. We have not only testimony written witness accounts. Because of the wonders of the modern media, even in Belarus it was possible to see violence of a level that is simply unacceptable being meted out by the security forces and police to non-violent protesters on the streets of Minsk. I know not what happened elsewhere, but I could see on my television screen innocent people being savagely beaten by the security forces in a way that, frankly, ought to have led to criminal charges being brought against them, rather than against those innocent protesters, who were taking part in events that would pretty much be taken for granted in countries such as ours&mdash;and, indeed, throughout the entire European family. Even if such events had taken place in Moscow, they could not possibly have been met with the same kind of reaction by the security forces in Russia as we saw in Belarus. In that regard, Belarus is the back marker: things can take place in Minsk that would not take place in any other capital city or society in modern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/5">What should we do? I again share the agenda of the Member who secured the debate. There is no magic wand or silver bullet; instead, there is a need for consistent pressure over time. It is easy for us all to become agitated at the time of an election, and to say, &quot;Yes, the election was fraudulent, let's protest&mdash;and then let's gently allow this to be forgotten as we move forward.&quot; For all manner of reasons, it is necessary to ensure that we maintain an interest in the Belarusian agenda, because&mdash;returning to my initial comments&mdash;it is an important country within the European family. It is important that Britain works through the European Union. There is no unique British position on this: there must be a common EU position. We should say to our colleagues in the EU that there must be consistency, and there must be a determination to maintain that consistent approach over the weeks, months and indeed years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/6">We must examine what level and package of sanctions can be made available that does not strike against the ordinary Belarusians. It is not a rich country by any standards, although it may be better off than some of its immediate neighbours. It is a fragile society, and its people are entitled to expect better than blanket targets that damage the ordinary Belarusian. However, we are entitled to study the roles of those who run that society, and to consider how we might target sanctions against the leadership and those around it. That is absolutely legitimate&mdash;it is absolutely normal and proper.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/7">We must also look into how we can support free media. That may be done by broadcasting from outside, although there are limitations on that: during the cold war, it was always possible to block signals coming in from the outside. I was rather interested in the concept of an EU radio-wave mountain somewhere, because transmissions are not getting across on the uniform plane in Belarus. However, it is certainly worth examining how we can support media being delivered from outside.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/8">The most important thing is to support free institutions inside Belarus, where that is possible. I am aware that it is difficult, but we ought to try to do it. How do we support civil society, NGOs and free media?</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/9">We must also address the role of Russia. One of the big debates we must have with Moscow in the months to come is about how it sees itself in relation to that part of the world, and how it sees its relations with the EU and the rest of Europe. Frankly, the days of the Russian client states ought to be disappearing, as in the long run the alternative will not be in Russia's own interests. Not long ago, we saw how the client state that it felt it had in Ukraine disappeared and turned into something much more unpredictable, and much more difficult from Moscow's perspective. Moscow now needs to wrestle with the question of how it works with Belarus to get that soft political and social landing, and to do so in a way that allows Russia to maintain good relations with that important neighbour. If we engage with the Russians, it is possible&mdash;I do not say likely&mdash;that we could come up with a common agenda, allowing us to say that we share an interest in helping Belarus to move forward in a direction that is acceptable both to Moscow and the EU. I urge the Minister to look seriously at how we can do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/10">In the end, the assessment must be made that Belarus is left in a much more fragile position than the election result would suggest. It is fragile because the economic and political winds will continue to blow, irrespective of whatever is done by the EU or in Moscow, and of whatever is done in the presidential palace in Minsk. Everyone has an interest in trying to move Belarus forward. If we can do that together and in a way that is consistent with the needs and interests of the people of Belarus, we will have achieved a significant victory not only for the Belarusians but for the wider Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/11">If we fail to do that, I do not predict doom and gloom&mdash;it would be ridiculous to do so&mdash;but Belarus could cause us headaches in the future, so it is worth putting in the effort to try to ensure that we get real progress. That is worth effort in London and Brussels, and it is worth effort with us all, with Moscow, in Minsk.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.83.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="83"  time="010:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h01.htm#60419h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.83.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I remind the Chamber that the debate is about the progress of democracy in Belarus; we are not just discussing a sort of endgame in itself. My hon. Friend has a long track record of promoting democracy, not only for Belarus but for other countries. He is effectively the Conservative party's chairman for the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, which involves all the main political parties and does a tremendous amount of valuable work.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/2">In one sense, my hon. Friend lost his political virginity by demonstrating outside the Belarusian embassy; no doubt he now has a police record. He may decide to ascertain its details under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. All who have spoken so far have warmly congratulated him on raising this subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/3">I am tempted to take a historian's walk down memory lane, although I shall try to restrict myself. It strikes those of us of a certain age that 30 years ago, when I taught military history and defence studies to many generations of British officers, none of us envisaged that the cold war would end as it did. We used to game that out, and the gaming was always pretty bleak: either the cold war would end in Europe with a massive nuclear exchange after political instability and a clash between NATO and the Warsaw pact countries, or there would be a collapse in eastern Europe, but one that involved violence on a vast scale. That is a lesson for many pundits as they consider current crises.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/4">We have discussed central and eastern Europe, and also the middle east, on other occasions. When doing so, we ought to bear in mind how difficult it is for countries in such regions to move from what they had to what we think they should have today&mdash;a pluralistic society, democracy and tolerance.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/5">A number of hon. Members have touched on the history of Belarus; it is pretty awful by anybody's standards. People there have been trampled on by surrounding great powers, whether Austria-Hungary, Germany, the old imperial Russia or the Soviet Union. Belarusian relations with the Poles have been pretty insensitive at times, to say the least. Belarus lost one third of its population in the second world war, and before and after that war it suffered a series of massive purges.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/6">If anything, I am struck not by the fact that the countries of central and eastern Europe have had major problems in adapting to the changes, but by the fact that they have adapted surprisingly well. Whatever the main problems still faced in Belarus, it is something to say that only 15 years after the end of the cold war, there is only one European country left in which there is a serious and major problem, although I do not say that there are no problems in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/7">My final point about the history is that Chernobyl is very close to Belarus. We are commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster; on television this morning there were depictions of the problems still faced by families hundreds of square miles around the site and of what has been happening to a new generation of children. Belarus has been dumped on from a great height by history and natural events.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/8">I agree with those who have said that the great irony is that President Lukashenko would probably have won the election if he had carried on, as far as he could, in a normal democratic way&mdash;perhaps with a bit of the arm twisting and ballot rigging that happens in many democracies, including ours and that of the United States. The supreme irony is that he probably would still have won the election.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/9">As far as I can see, the problem for democracy in Belarus is the apathy and indifference of the majority of the population, who have been brought up among the horrors of their history and have an ability just to survive. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> pointed out, Lukashenko has delivered a degree of economic stability, even if that is propped up by Russia.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/10">The purpose of this debate is to ask the Minister questions about how the British Government can further progress on democracy. In the immediate aftermath of the elections, the Minister said that the Foreign Office was actively discussing with partners specific measures to take in response. Will he elaborate on what further measures the Government might take to bring pressure to bear on the Belarus Government? I accept that that will not be easy.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/11">My party welcomes the conclusions reached at the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-11">11 April</phrase> this year and the European Council's decision to take restrictive measures against President Lukashenko and the Belarusian leadership. However, although it is an important first step, what real impact does the Minister believe a travel ban will have on the Belarusian regime? There is no easy option, but we have seen the limited impact of the travel ban on the regime in Zimbabwe, which in many respects carries out even more horrendous acts against its own people.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/12">I draw the Minister's attention to human rights. Have the Government made it clear to Minsk that it will receive international respect only when it ceases violating the human rights of its citizens and recognises that the detention of individuals for politically motivated reasons is utterly incompatible with democracy? Does the Minister have available, through our Government or EU Governments, a list of individuals arrested purely for exercising what we would understand to be their democratic rights? If he has, what are we doing actively to publicise the fact that such men and women are being held under what we would regard as illegal measures?</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/13">What progress, if any, have the Belarus Government made on their obligation to co-operate fully with the Commission on Human Rights and in particular with the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus? As the special rapporteur's already extended mandate is due to expire, what are the prospects for an independent, credible and full investigation into the cases of forced disappearances and/or summary executions?</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/14">I turn to the issue of support for democracy, a strong element in the debate so far, and pushed by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon. I agree that it is important to keep the issue on our parliamentary agenda; we should not just have a debate and then forget the issue until the next elections in however many years' time. Secondly, that should be done EU-wide. The Government's White Paper on UK priorities for their 2005 presidency of the EU did not mention Belarus; in retrospect, some of us might find that somewhat surprising. I am sure that the omission did not reflect any lack of interest in the issue on the part of the Government, but future major official Foreign Office publications, particularly those that deal with European matters, should highlight Belarus next time.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/15">However, the UK presidency issued numerous statements on behalf of Belarus. What progress has been made since then to increase contact with the Belarusian people and strengthen our support for civil society? I link the question to what my hon. Friend said. What support can we give Belarusian groups that represent democratic parties&mdash;those that visit and those domiciled in the United Kingdom? What resources can we allocate to provide opportunities to inform the population of Belarus? As the hon. Member for Manchester, Central said, it is sometimes difficult to quantify what impact that might have. Even though a large majority of the people in Belarus do not have the opportunities that we have through the internet or even through television, the fact that things are being beamed to them will get the attention of quite a significant minority of the Belarusian electorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/16">In the light of the deteriorating situation in Belarus, do the Government still consider that their decision to close the British Council in Minsk in November 2002 was appropriate? Following the elections, what concrete actions will now be taken to bolster the freedoms of assembly, association and expression in Belarus?</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/17">Finally, I shall discuss two of the neighbours of Belarus. Poland has a great interest in what goes on there because of the large ethnic Polish population that is involved. I recognise that persuading the Poles to intervene politically to influence events in Belarus could be regarded as counter-productive. Nevertheless, they have a direct interest. Poland is a fine example of a country that has moved from the horrors of occupation and totalitarian communism to an open democracy. We should use as much influence as we can to persuade the Poles to do what they can in a practical and constructive way to influence events in Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/18">Russia is obviously the key to persuading the current president of Belarus at least to moderate his policies. We are in a quandary because we currently wish to persuade the Russians to moderate the policies of a large number of countries, not least those of Iran. However, I hope that we will continue, in a drip-drip manner, like water on a stone, to persuade <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">them that, as the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase> said, the continuation of the current regime in Belarus is not in their long-term interests. It would not be to Russia's disadvantage if there were eventually free and open elections in Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/19">As Churchill said, democracy is in many respects a bad form of government, but the alternatives are far worse. We sometimes have to live with the election&mdash;in pretty broad democratic terms&mdash;to office of parties that we do not like and that we regard, to a certain extent, as a threat to regional security at least. Such a situation has occurred in Palestine with the election of Hamas. We have not reached that stage in Belarus, where the progress of democracy will involve a long struggle over the next few years. The raising of this debate by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon is a small way of publicising to the President of Belarus that the United Kingdom does not accept what he is doing. We hope that raising this debate gives comfort and aid to those brave men and women who wish for Belarus to have the open democracy that we are lucky enough to have in the United Kingdom.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.86.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe"  colnum="86"  time="010:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h01.htm#60419h01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.86.0/1">I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">the opportunity that the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> has given the House to discuss Belarus. As other hon. Members have done, I acknowledge and welcome his personal commitment to democracy promotion generally, particularly his important work with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. We are grateful for the important efforts of all parties in taking forward its work. I also thank him for his generous words about Britain's ambassador in Minsk. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is also proud of his work, and I will ensure that a copy of the remarks made is relayed to him at the Minsk embassy.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/2">Today's wide-ranging debate does great credit to the House. It is based on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the experience of my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase>, who spoke wisely about the need for consistent pressure on the Belarus regime, and on the insights and historical perspective given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase>. He had my sympathy until he urged all parties to embrace the liberal cause. Knowing, as I do, the Foreign Secretary's clear views on liberal democracy, I do not relish return to King Charles street this morning and casually mentioning that in the course of an Adjournment debate I had embraced such a cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/3">The hon. Member for Taunton asked a specific question about an interview that I undertook while, it appears, he was enjoying the sun during the recess last week. For clarification, I was asked to list five specific benefits for an individual British citizen. In the course of doing so, I mentioned that the operation of the single market had allowed for cheap flights, which the hon. Gentleman has perhaps enjoyed during the past few days.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/4">I went on to say that those were individual benefits to individual citizens, but one must also recognise that the European Union has been hugely successful during the past 50 years in establishing peace, stability and democracy across the European continent. I hope that there would be agreement in all parts of the House that those are hugely important gains, which the EU has played a role in securing. I am thinking in particular about the transformation of central and eastern Europe to liberal democracies in recent years, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. By any measure, that is an historic achievement that will be judged hugely important and successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> gave us a lower-key historical tour d'horizon than he tempted us with at the outset of his remarks. The Army's loss has clearly been Parliament's gain in terms of the historical perspectives that he brought to bear. He made several important observations about the historical context in which we debate Belarus today. I will endeavour to answer the specific questions that he put to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/6">The backdrop to this debate is that Belarus briefly hit the international headlines last month following presidential elections that yet again delivered a win for Lukashenko, with, as we have heard, an implausible 83 per cent. of the vote. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe election monitors declared the elections flawed and undemocratic. As a result, Belarus has been the subject of considerable debate within the EU, and sanctions are being imposed to apply pressure to Lukashenko's regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/7">As hon. Members have said, it is all too easy to forget the daily struggle of the people of Belarus when the story slips from our headlines. It is critical that we maintain our support for the vast majority of the Belarusian people who will continue to fight for democracy, despite the risk involved, when the election monitors have gone. It is crucial that we maintain the pressure on Lukashenko to change his approach and recognise the democratic wishes of his people. I therefore greatly welcome the contribution that this debate has made to increasing the profile of the problems facing Belarus, and I sincerely hope that there will continue to be debates in this House on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/8">I echo the sentiments of the hon. Member for South-West Devon. We do not support individual candidates or individual parties, because it is for the people of Belarus to choose their future and their future leadership. I, too, have had the opportunity to meet Mr. Milinkevich and to hear directly from him about his desire for a genuinely democratic state and about the struggles that opposition politicians have faced. Speaking, as we do, from the relative comfort and safety of Westminster, as democratic politicians in a longstanding, settled democracy, hearing of such struggles for democratic rights is humbling, as the hon. Gentleman suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/9">Belarus is an anachronism. It is a European country lying on the borders of the European Union. It claims to be at the heart of Europe politically and economically, but the policies of its leadership prevent its developing into that role. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said in a debate after the European Council,</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/10" class="indent">&quot;it is a disgrace that Belarus remains a dictatorship&mdash;the last in Europe&mdash;and it cannot continue in that way.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 444, c. 559.]</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/11">There is indeed no place for dictatorship in modern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/12">Over recent years, the political and human rights situation in Belarus has worsened as Lukashenko has sought to isolate the regime and its people. In answer to the specific question put to me by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk, we have no comprehensive list of the disappeared. The European heads of mission have been trying to ascertain how many people have been arrested over the past few weeks, but have been able to establish only that about 800 people have been arrested. Opposition figures have been arrested, beaten and imprisoned on trumped-up charges, and the European humanities university has been closed. It was the only independent university in Belarus before it was closed because of its promotion of diverse ideas and vigorous debate, and its refusal to promote state ideology. There has been harassment of political parties, a restrictive law on non-governmental organisations, the closure of independent newspapers, new limits on freedom of worship and a new anti-revolution law designed to muzzle any form of dissent.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/13">United Kingdom and European Union policy towards Belarus has been and will continue to be a two-pronged approach. First, we are applying restrictive measures against those who are responsible for the serious deterioration in the human rights situation in Belarus to encourage them to change their ways. Secondly, we will reach out further to the Belarusian people through support for civil society, NGOs and independent media. We will not forget the Belarusian people and their attempt to make their voices heard in a flawed election and in the subsequent demonstrations against a result that they felt was rigged.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/14">In a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase>, I expressed the Government's deep regret about the way in which the Belarusian authorities had held the elections. I commented again on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase> in reaction to the violent breaking up of an opposition rally. EU declarations have also detailed our strong concern about the regime's actions in suppressing legitimate democratic expression.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/15">Depressing as the events of last month were, there is some cause for hope. The election showed that there are people in Belarus who are ready to unite in the fight for democratic values. They showed extraordinary bravery in standing up for the right to vote freely, as we heard in the testimony read to us today, and a determination to change Belarus for the better.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/16">Lukashenko blames such activity on external interference, but, in doing so, he misreads and demeans his own people. The people of Belarus expect honesty and accountability from their Government, and they expect to choose who governs them. No Government who ignore that can be sustainable in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/17">Before I discuss the EU's response to the elections, I shall briefly review the history of its approach to Belarus. EU relations with Belarus stalled in 1997 as a consequence of serious setbacks in the development of democracy and human rights in that country. A particular trigger was the replacement of the democratically elected Parliament with a National Assembly nominated by the President in clear violation of the constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/18">The EU immediately froze talks on concluding the partnership and co-operation agreement with Belarus, and restricted ministerial contacts. At the same time, the EU established clear political benchmarks on democracy and human rights which, if met, would lead to improved relations. However, Lukashenko has made no attempt to improve the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/19">Under the UK's presidency last year, the EU laid down a clear marker that it expected the forthcoming presidential elections to be free and fair, and that it was prepared to take further appropriate restrictive measures if they were not. The EU's concerns mounted throughout the election campaign. During the demonstrations that followed the <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-19">19 March</phrase> election, approximately 800 political activists were detained, some without charge, for up to 15 days. One of the leaders of the Opposition and an ex-presidential candidate, Alexander Kozulin, remains in prison charged with organising group actions to disturb the public peace. He faces up to six years in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/20">As a result, at the <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April</phrase> EU General Affairs and External Relations Council, Ministers agreed to impose travel bans on 31 individuals deemed responsible for the fraudulent election, the violations of international human rights law, and the crackdown on civil society and democratic opposition. The travel ban includes Lukashenko. Ministers also stated their readiness to consider further restrictive measures. They condemned the treatment of political detainees, urged the regime to allow freedom of expression and assembly, and reiterated the EU's commitment to Belarusian civil society.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/21">Members have asked about the BBC World Service and the action that is being taken by the EU to support free broadcasting in Belarus. Let me first set out the position on the World Service. It broadcasts in Belarus in the Russian, Ukrainian and English languages via its shortwave transmitters. A key issue facing the World Service in Belarus is the practicality of reaching its audience. Shortwave transmission is not as audible in some regions as FM transmissions, which are broadcast locally and produce a strong signal. Ideally, the World Service would like to work with FM partners to deliver its product in Belarus, but the media market is tightly controlled and regulated. Given the current political situation, there is no possibility of the World Service or any other western broadcaster getting air time on an existing FM frequency or hiring a new frequency within the country. Therefore, the World Service offering remains shortwave only in a market that is largely FM-dominated. We are aware of no jamming issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/22">On several occasions in recent years, the World Service has examined the possibility of special programming for Belarus. The problem that I have just set out surrounding delivery of the product into the region remains the key stumbling block. The World Service product is available on-line, but, again, access in Belarus is difficult, as home internet usage is low. On-line facilities are mostly available in work places or in public internet cafes.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/23">Following pressure from EU member states, not least the United Kingdom, the Commission launched a second media project at the start of this calendar year. The project is for two years and will cost approximately &euro;2 million. It comprises TV and radio broadcasts from Poland, Lithuania and Germany into Belarus. It also provides funding for internet print media and training of journalists. The radio broadcasts started in February on various frequencies. However, as I said, the media market is tightly controlled, and the EU project faces challenges that are similar to those faced by the World Service because of the current political situation. I hope that the British Government's strong support of the Commission's efforts gives some comfort to the hon. Member for South-West Devon that we will continue to take an interest in the matter, notwithstanding the hurdles that we face in ensuring that the messages are heard by a wide section of the Belarusian population.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/24">Support for the Belarusian population and for civil society is, of course, fundamental to our approach. While holding the regime to account, we must also reach out to the Belarusian people and help them in their struggle for democracy. The UK actively uses bilateral programme funds to support civil society, particularly in the areas of human rights, independent media, good governance, and youth participation in events that are designed to increase awareness of democratic principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/25">We are working with EU partners to consider further steps to increase the EU's contact with the Belarusian people and to strengthen support for civil society, including technical assistance and the opening of an EU office in Minsk. To provide practical support, the EU has transferred &euro;2 million from its TACIS programme to the European initiative for democracy and human rights and decentralised co-operation programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/26">However, we must make it easier to get assistance to NGOs and independent media that work on human rights, good governance, democracy and freedom of expression, and which face constant pressure from the Lukashenko regime. We are investigating with our partners the means of developing more flexible EU funding mechanisms to allow us to increase our direct engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/27">As the hon. Member for Taunton said, it is not only EU partners who remain focused on the current deplorable situation in Belarus. The United States also takes a close interest. President Bush has repeatedly indicated his personal concern for the people of Belarus and has pledged</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/28" class="indent">&quot;to seek justice for the disappeared, as well as for all those who seek to return freedom to Belarus.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/29">US policy closely follows that of the EU: the US demands the same improvements in Belarus before building closer relationships, and the US and the EU co-sponsored last year's UN Commission on Human Rights resolution on Belarus. I assure Members that the EU and the US closely co-ordinated their response to the <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-19">19 March</phrase> presidential election.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/30">The new Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, said in a statement immediately following the presidential elections that he was</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/31" class="indent">&quot;shocked that a dictatorial and abusive regime, such as this one can continue to exist in today's Europe. We will work with other free and democratic societies in developing our response to this situation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/32">The UK and the EU will continue to work closely with the US, Canada and others to co-ordinate and unite our approach for future support of civil society and the people of Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/33">I shall write separately to the hon. Member for Taunton on the nuclear issue that he raised, and ensure that a copy of my response is placed in the Library. Belarus has no nuclear power stations, and all nuclear weapons were withdrawn by Russia in the early to mid-1990s when Belarus joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Chernobyl is in Ukraine, but, as we heard earlier, Belarus got much of the fallout as a consequence of that terrible disaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/34">In bringing my remarks to a conclusion, I shall focus on a couple of further points, in particular the issue of Russia, which was central to the comments of the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/35">I applaud the commitment of the hon. Member for South-West Devon, who continues to put Belarus on the public agenda. In turn, I assure him that the Government are committed to supporting the Belarusian people in their efforts to build a lasting democracy. We cannot and will not ignore those who seek to suppress their efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/36">As a number of colleagues have said during the debate, there is no magic wand, nor any easy and immediate solution. Therefore, I turn to the issue of engagement with Russia. When I visited Moscow at the beginning of March, I raised the issue of Belarus and, in particular, the issue of pricing parity and greater transparency in energy pricing. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised the issue of Belarus with its largest neighbour, Russia, following the elections that took place last month.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/37">The United Kingdom and Europe uses every available opportunity to raise Belarus when appropriate with Russia. The European Union troika met Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-12">12 April</phrase> to set out the EU's concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation, and to explain the decisions taken by Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April</phrase>. We continually stress to the Russians the shared objective that we have&mdash;including the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe&mdash;of encouraging Belarus to meet its international commitments to democracy and human rights. I can assure the House that we will continue to outline to our Russian counterparts our concerns about the deteriorating situation in Belarus.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.0/1">I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend's intervention. His sentiments are similar to the points that I communicated when in Moscow. All of us are concerned about one of the principal challenges that we face in the 21st century, which is failing states. If states fall into criminality and end up with the status of failed state, they create problems not only for their immediate neighbour, Russia in this case, but for the region generally. That is why today's debate is of such importance to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/2">I also made the point when I was in Russia about the reputational damage that I believe was caused in the minds of many western Europeans by the reporting of the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute at the beginning of the year. If Russia were to make it clear that there is a level playing field and a commercial approach to gas supplies, it would contribute significantly to setting right some of the perceptions that took hold at the beginning of the year about the commercial treatment of Ukraine on the one hand and Belarus on the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/3">I share with the hon. Member for South-West Devon no ill will whatever towards the people of Belarus. However, when the Russians tell the British Government that they wish to see a more commercial approach to the provision of gas supplies generally, it should necessarily and appropriately include Belarus in the same way in which it includes Ukraine and other countries. There will be a strong focus on those issues, not least with the spotlight falling on Russia ahead of the G8 summit taking place at St. Petersburg in July.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/4">There is a real opportunity in the months between now and July to continue to impress upon the Russian authorities not only the importance of their conduct in relation to democratic standards within their own borders, but the importance of the messages that they send out through their comments about Belarus and other neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/5">We shall continue to impress those points upon the Russians. We shall try to persuade them that it is in all our interests to have a democratic, prosperous and stable Belarus. The future of democracy within Belarus rests on a credible political alternative to Lukashenko's dictatorship. We will continue to support that ambition.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.93.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1846" speakername="Iris Robinson" colnum="93"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h02.htm#60419h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.93.1/1">I thank the Minister for the opportunity to raise matters of great urgency, upon which the future success of entire communities along Northern Ireland's eastern seaboard rests.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/2">Six years on from the introduction of the cod recovery scheme and the closure of the Irish sea cod fishery, fisheries scientists are unable to tell us in Northern Ireland whether it has had any effect whatever on cod stocks in the Irish sea. Six years on, the Northern Ireland fishing fleet is a shadow of its former self and hundreds of jobs have been lost. Six years on, factories and businesses have disappeared and the industry is approaching a point of critical mass beyond which it might not recover. Six years on, the Government cannot indicate whether the measures that have contributed greatly to the demise of our fishing industry have had any impact. Those left in the industry are exasperated as the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and its scientists continue to do little other than talk, while the industry crumbles outside.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/3">In 1993 213 commercial fishing vessels were registered in the Northern Ireland fishing fleet, but by this year that figure had fallen to a staggering 130. Whereas there were 44 white fish boats in the Northern Ireland fleet five years ago, there are now only 12. In Portavogie, where there were once more than 100 boats in the fleet, there are now just 40. Between 1999 and 2003, the average profit before depreciation of a Northern Ireland-based white fish trawler fell by 76 per cent. to just &pound;10,400. The average profit of a nephrop trawler fell by 48 per cent. to &pound;15,600.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/4">Since 2003, fishermen have had to deal with other factors, such as the huge rises in the cost of fuel oil and the cost of leasing quota, and income will have fallen further still. I spoke to one skipper during the week who told me that whereas fuel for his vessel had once cost 15p a litre it now costs 40p a litre, and that the fuel costs for operating his boat were now up to &pound;1,914 a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/5">Of course we must accept that to a certain extent the price of fuel is beyond the control of the Government. We do not ask for any preferential treatment. We merely ask that the issue is acknowledged and taken on board by the Government in order to understand the lengths to which the industry is being stretched. The cod recovery scheme was implemented six years ago on the basis that it would last for three years. The measures have been repeated each year since and were extended when the Scottish Executive imposed a closure in the north channel that was targeted at Northern Ireland trawlers.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/6">The EU Commission has stated that additional recovery measures are needed only where there is a biological urgency, but where is the biological urgency in the Irish sea, where the science shows that stocks are nowhere near as bad as assumed? Without a grain of evidence to justify the closure of the cod fishery, DARD scientists now tell us that without any substantial evidence they hold out little hope of the scheme&mdash;itself based on erroneous evidence and interpretation&mdash;ever being lifted.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/7">So what have DARD scientists been doing for the past six years, as countless skippers have been forced to decommission their boats, hundreds of fishermen have lost their jobs, factories have closed and countless jobs have been lost in the fish processing sector? Despite the enthusiasm of Northern Ireland Office Ministers, it has become increasingly clear during this period that the approach of fisheries scientists and the spin used in interpreting results has been a significant obstacle.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/8">Progress has been made in improving relationships and attempting to work co-operatively to address the problems faced. Despite that, fisheries scientists have acted in a counterproductive manner. Fishermen are urged to work with DARD to provide the data required for officials to argue their case in Europe. However, whenever that information is collected, fisheries scientists always seem to identify something negative and run with it, at all times ignoring the positive aspects of the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/9">Despite the poor reputation that DARD scientists have earned for themselves, local fishermen and producers' organisations remain committed to working with DARD. At a meeting with Lord Rooker last Tuesday, DARD scientist Peter Jan Schon came under enormous pressure from representatives of the catching, selling and processing sectors of Northern Ireland's fishing industry. He claimed that there was no co-operation from the fishing fleets in Kilkeel and Ardglass, except for Portavogie. That is absolute nonsense and was totally refuted by all present.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/10">Mr. Jan Schon was unable to substantiate his claim. He said that there was no data on the cod stocks in the Irish sea because fishermen were not co-operating. However, thanks to his work, fishermen are barred from fishing the area as a result of the annual cod fishery closure. When asked what he had been doing for the past six years, Mr. Jan Schon had no response.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/11">An associated issue is the barring of prawn boats from fishing in the area closed as part of the cod fishery closure. Mr. Jan Schon stated at the meeting, as DARD has before, that the prawn boats are barred because cod represents a substantial by-catch of prawns. Dick James of the Northern Ireland Fish Producers Organisation then presented the meeting with a copy of a multi-million euro report published in 2002 entitled &quot;Monitoring of Discarding and Retention by Trawl Fisheries in Western Waters and the Irish Sea in Relation to the Stock Assessment and Technical Measures&quot;. The findings of that report included the fact that no cod was caught as by-catch of a conventional prawn trawl&mdash;and who should be named as a participant and contributor to that report, but Mr. Peter Jan Schon. No wonder he had so little to say for himself at the meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/12">It gets worse, however. At a meeting with DARD officials on Thursday last week, Dick James again raised the matter, this time directing it to Mr. Richard Briggs, the Department's senior scientist. Mr. Briggs stated that it was his opinion that the nephrops fishery in the Irish sea was completely sustainable. One scientist has held up progress on the basis that prawn fishing is not sustainable, while another says that the whole thing is news to him. The right hand does not seem to know what the left hand is doing. It is that fundamental level of inconsistency on the part of DARD scientists that has lead to the strain in relationships between those who work in the industry and DARD.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/13">Another associated issue is the shape and location of the box, which fishermen are adamant are incorrect. Currently there is derogation in the centre of the box, where prawn fishing is permitted. However, there is an important fishery to the north-east of the box where fishing is prohibited. When the box was created, the Department used a geological survey, but it quickly became clear that it was not accurate. As a result, one of the most important prawn fishing grounds was included in the closure. When the tides run high&mdash;specifically in the spring, during the period of the closure&mdash;the area supports a significant nephrops fishery. Boats need to be able to get into the area at least every other week to maximise their catch and ensure their continuing viability. The problem has been raised with DARD officials on more than 12 occasions, yet once again they have failed to act in any way to resolve the anomaly. It must now be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/14">At the same time, however, it is clear that DARD as a whole has failed to represent the interests of the Northern Ireland fishing industry effectively. Last year the Food and Drink Federation announced that it was setting out to assess the amount of UK-sourced prawns consumed in the UK. Its findings indicated that the Irish sea could provide a sustainable fishery with a 30 per cent. increase in the nephrops total allowable catch. The Scottish and English Departments ran with those figures and used them to argue for increases in their nephrops quotas, obtaining increases of 31 and 39 per cent. for the west of Scotland and the North sea respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/15">DARD officials denied ever receiving the findings, which were forwarded to them by local fishing organisations. At the same time, they attempted to argue that because they are the poor relations within the UK, they do not stand a chance of getting a fair hearing. Those in the Northern Ireland fishing industry are sick, sore and tired of the Department's abdication of responsibility when representing their best interests in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/16">There is serious concern about the lack of urgency shown by DARD scientists in completing those scientific studies that have been commenced. During August, September and October last year, five boats from Kilkeel kindly gave their permission to be used as part of a DARD study, but eight months later the Department still does not have a date for publishing the findings. Scientists complain about the lack of data, but their performance in turning around the data that they do have is abysmal. They claim that such data are like gold dust, so their performance hardly illustrates a real commitment to helping address the problems experienced by our fishermen.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/17">As for the tie-up scheme, suffice it to say that that DARD owes the industry an apology for being so wide of the mark in its interpretation of the legislation, after having been embarrassed in Europe by Jim Allister MEP. Despite that embarrassment, Lord Rooker has this year refused to grant that lifeline to many of Northern Ireland's fishermen.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/18">We are informed that the decision to refuse aid was based on the fact that the scheme does not provide value for money. If that was the case, why was the scheme operated during 2004 and 2005? If it was value for money in those two years, what has changed in 2006? What has changed is that the cod quota has been decreased by 15 per cent., the haddock and whiting quotas have been slashed, and days at sea have decreased. In fact, given the new and increasing pressures placed on the industry since 2004, it could be argued that it would be better value this year than it was in the previous two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/19">Lord Rooker also states that there is insufficient funding to support a tie-up scheme and that money is already committed to projects in and around our harbours. That is well and good, and I commend the work of the fishing villages initiative in its work to attract millions of pounds of investment into fishing communities, but we must face the facts. What is the point in supporting fishing communities and investing in harbours when the time will soon come when there will cease to be a fleet to support?</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/20">We must now look to the future and to a plan submitted to DEFRA that has the Department's support. With the assistance of the Irish Sea regional advisory council, it is proposed that from January 2007 the fleet should start with a clean sheet, subject to certain criteria. The fleet would be allowed to catch what it wanted, but it would have to report exactly what was landed. Scientists would then assess that data and apply models to get an accurate picture of the health of Irish Sea fish stocks. From those results, they would be able to establish whether quotas were lower than the fishery could sustain, in which case they could be increased, or whether quotas were too high, in which case they could be reduced. Ultimately, we would arrive at the best possible package for both the industry and the conservation of the fish stocks in the Irish sea. The plan has the support of DEFRA and the EU Commissioner, and it has the potential to allow positive progress for the local fishing industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/21">One problem remains, however. It will have taken DARD scientists eight months to report back on five boats being studied over a three-month period. How will the Department fare if it is studying more than 100 boats, 365 days a year? The danger is that DARD will apply the same tired old science to the new data, and the fleet might once again have to pay for the scientists' desire to highlight and emphasise the negative and ignore the positive. There is potential for recovery, but we have a mountain to climb before we can claim it.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/22">In summary, this is the seventh year of the closure of the cod fishery in the Irish sea, but scientists still cannot tell us what effect, if any, it is having on the cod stocks. We were told that the closure would be for three years, yet seven years on we are still being told that DARD cannot go to the EU and argue for its removal, as it has no science to back it up.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/23">The fishing industry in Northern Ireland should always have been a team effort between DARD and those in the industry. Given the precarious state of the industry, I cannot emphasise sufficiently how crucial it is that fishermen, sellers, processors and the fisheries division of DARD work hand in hand, striving to create a sustainable and viable fishing industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/24">We need more effective science, more effective processing of information and more effective interpretation of results. To continue on the current course will lead only to the destruction of the local fishing fleet, which will have a colossal impact on the lives of those villages and communities that have for so long been bound together by the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/25">The bottom line is that we should not be arguing about the creation of a tie-up scheme, which is open only to a fraction of vessels, and we should not be scrambling around attempting to secure transitional aid. Instead we should have a Minister for fisheries, committed to fighting the corner for the local industry, changing EU &quot;wisdom&quot; and striving to create a strategy that would facilitate the recovery of the local industry, not its destruction.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.97.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" speakername="Angela Smith" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"  colnum="97"  time="011:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h02.htm#60419h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.97.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1846" name="Iris Robinson">the hon. Member for Strangford (Mrs. Robinson)</phrase> on securing this debate. I know that she is passionate about the fishing industry, and about the problems of her constituents. She is always well informed, and is forthright in putting across her views. It is clear that she cares deeply about the future of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/2">I assure the hon. Lady that my ministerial colleagues and I share her concerns. We may not always have total agreement, but we all want to see a long-term sustainable future for the fishing industry, which means restructuring and changing it. No one wants to see short-term measures taken that do not deal with the underlying and ongoing problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/3">The hon. Lady highlighted a range of complex issues and the need for change. She spoke about restricted fishing opportunities and increased operating costs, particularly for fuel&mdash;an increase that we are seeing across manufacturing industry as well. The fishing industry needs to face up to and meet changing attitudes to the marine environment. That is a significant challenge, but the Government want to help, because we want to see a long-term sustainable future for the fishing industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/4">I shall do my best to address the various points raised by the hon. Lady. She spoke about the tie-up scheme of financial aid for the fishing industry, and claimed that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development owes fishermen an apology. That claim is not justified. As she said, the industry has faced grave economic difficulties. She said that financial support was the way forward. However, that would address the short-term problems, not the longer-term underlying factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/5">I appreciate the disappointment of the industry that the tie-up scheme was not run for another year. It was not an easy decision, although full account was taken of all the issues involved, including affordability&mdash;the hon. Lady mentioned value for money&mdash;sustainability and priorities within the fishing industry. Lord Rooker, who is listening to the debate, was very mindful of all those issues. He said that it was not an easy decision, but that it was taken in the best interests of the fishing industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/6">The hon. Lady also made a point about having a Minister who fully represents the Northern Ireland fishing industry. I place on record the strong commitment of the Government and the ministerial team, including my noble Friend Lord Rooker, to doing their best to ensure support and sustainability for the fishing industry. We would all have preferred to have a single Minister dealing with the issue. Once the Assembly is up and running and a devolved Minister is in place, we will not have Ministers trying to run several Departments, although we do the best that we can under the additional time pressures that it creates.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/7">It is worth noting that, for the second successive year, the Irish sea prawn total allowable catches were increased. In addition, the Northern Ireland industry was able to avail itself of the significant additional prawn quotas secured for the North sea and the west of Scotland. It is also worth remembering that the Irish sea still has a more generous allocation of days at sea than other areas of the cod recovery zone. Those achievements are worth placing on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/8">The hon. Lady also raised concerns about scientific information. Scientists need to obtain as much information as possible from various sources, for which they need the co-operation of fishermen. I challenge what the hon. Lady said about scientists concentrating on the negative. Scientists give a view of the scientific facts of the case. There is no interest for anyone involved in not presenting the facts as they stand. It is vital, when considering the long-term future of the industry, that we have accurate and precise information, for which we need scientists and the industry to work together. The fear is that if we fail to achieve that, the Commission is likely to adopt a harsher view and take a highly precautionary approach to its decisions, which would give us all cause for concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/9">The only way for the industry to have a sustainable, long-term future&mdash;I am sure that the hon. Lady and her constituents seek that, just as we in Government do&mdash;is with accurate, reliable information so that appropriate action can be taken. There is no interest in anyone having anything other than that. Scientists and fishermen should recognise that they have the same objectives. They will not always have the same views or make the same assessments, but if they do not work together to get a true picture and understand the priorities, we will not be able to take the right approaches or make the case that we want to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/10">The hon. Lady made her case about the cod recovery scheme. A considerable amount of work has been undertaken on that, and much more will be undertaken in the next 18 months, but marine science depends on data collected over a long period. It is not possible to take a snapshot of information that will be meaningful to the Commission or anyone else. We are optimistic that next year's exercise will be a significant step forward, but I cannot promise the hon. Lady any quick fixes. However, she must not think that a considerable amount of work has not been undertaken by scientists and the Department. That work is ongoing, because we need reliable, long-term data to make the case adequately.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/11">The hon. Lady also raised the issue of the purchasing quota. I understand her concerns about the price of the quota increasing, but that is its market value. This is another reason why we need important, accurate information, because if we do not have that, we might not do quite so well with the quota. We have done particularly well with the European Commission to be able to get that information. Unless we continue with that, we cannot give any guarantees for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/12">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and DARD are jointly funding a programme with the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science for fishery independent monitoring of cod recovery by means of egg production surveys. The hon. Lady nods; she must be aware of that. She made proposals in that regard, which we will give certainly full consideration. I welcome her positive steps forward on this issue, which we are keen to pursue. DEFRA and the European Commission are already holding meetings to discuss that, and we want to pursue it urgently. Scientific analysis will not handicap the effectiveness of the exercise in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/13">I was a little disappointed by the hon. Lady's comments about an individual scientist. It is important to recognise the professionalism of the staff who deal with these issues. I hope that she will accept that nobody has any interest in not getting accurate information with which to do their best for the fishing industry. The scientists employed by the Department are working on this issue because they want to ensure that we get the best deal for Northern Ireland fishermen. I hope that she will understand that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/14">I hope that I have addressed all the hon. Lady's points. I have already identified that the prawn total allowable catch for 2007 is a top priority for Northern Ireland. Enthusiastic work is being done to ensure that the TAC is increased in the following year. There is a deep commitment in the Department to ensure a long-term, sustainable future for the industry, but there is no quick-fix solution. The industry is under enormous pressure, and the Government would do it a disservice if we failed to establish what the long-term issues are and how they can best be addressed. We should not simply offer quick fixes that would undermine the industry in the long term.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.118.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="118"  time="015:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h03.htm#60419h03_spnew24">
	<p pid="a.118.0/1">I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">the hon. Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> on having raised a very important debate. The moving speeches made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1859" name="Jeremy Hunt">my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt)</phrase> and the hon. Members for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) and for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) have enabled us to understand the dramatic and traumatic effect that the horrendous conditions they witnessed had on them. We appreciate the way in which they were able to express that in the debate. Never having visited the DRC, I cannot replicate that, but I can bring something to this debate by putting some pressure on the Government and requesting information from the Minister. We look forward to what he has to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/2">When I started my preparation for this debate, I did as I always do and looked at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office country profile for the DRC. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The DRC is ranked near the bottom, 168 out of 177 countries, on the Human Development Index. All the socio-economic indicators are poor, made worse by the last 10 years of war. The education system is in a state of collapse, and the public health system is reportedly a disaster. In December 2002, donors pledged some US$2.5 billion for reconstruction.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/4">I shall return to that amount, because it is a huge figure. The profile continues with a description of what is happening today:</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The UK has been part of the international community's efforts to address basic humanitarian needs in the DRC. Britain has provided support for DDR (demobilisation, disarmament and re-integration) of the various armed groups and funded quick-start programmes to provide health and education to war-affected parts of the country. The UK increased its assistance to help rebuild the country to &pound;40 million pa in 2004/05 and 2005/06.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/6">That is a recognition by the Government of the dreadful state of that country.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/7">As a number of hon. Members have mentioned, the DRC is well endowed with minerals. It has diamonds&mdash;at one stage it was the fourth largest producer of industrial diamonds in the world&mdash;gold, coltan, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> mentioned, and cassiterite. Its forest cover is abundant and rich, if it is sustainably managed, and there are rich agricultural lands. However, as is true of so many other African countries, the DRC's economy needs to be managed properly and to start producing if its dependence on aid is to be reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/8">Surprisingly, I entirely endorse what the hon. Member for Islington, North said about exploitation. It is clear that there has been exploitation by the mining companies, in part because mining takes place in conflict areas. Much of what is produced is smuggled out of the country by the various militias, with not even a penny benefiting DRC's economy. However, exploitation has also taken place because DRC has not had the resources to police mining properly. All such problems require western aid, help and advice to be rectified. If the country could rectify those problems, it could start on the path to prosperity. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> mentioned, some foreign aid is beginning to flow into the country. We must ensure that that transition is sustainable and that it benefits the economy of DRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/9">One the tragic things that I learned in preparation for this debate&mdash;we have not heard much about it today&mdash;is that the habitat of lowland gorillas, which were never particularly numerous, is now so damaged that their number has been reduced to a mere 3,000. Human rights must always be paramount, but let us hope also that one of the things that comes out of the election is a reversal of that environmental damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/10">As has been said, the DRC is Africa's second largest economy south of the Sahara. It has 56 million people, 56 per cent. of whom are Christian. The DRC held a successful referendum in December 2005. If that is an indication of what might happen in the election in June 2006, it bodes well. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey said that 26 million people had already registered for those elections, which is a positive sign. If we can build on that by working with the 16,000 or so members of the UN peacekeeping force who are already in the country and encouraging the European Union not to place its 1,200 to 1,500 troops outside the country in case of an emergency, but instead put them inside the country to prevent potential abuses in the election, that would also be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/11">What else is to be done? The World Bank has produced a huge package of $2.9 billion of aid ahead of the elections, but with strings attached. The Opposition will vigorously hold the Government to account on how that aid is spent and what improvements it will bring. In too many African countries we spend millions of pounds in aid, yet the people are getting poorer. Gross domestic product in the DRC fell from $380 per person in 1960 to $115 per person in 2004, and 80 per cent. of the people still live on less than $1 a day. There is absolute evidence from other African countries that millions of dollars of aid are being put in, but people's standard of living is falling. Uganda is a case in point: in the past four years, the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day has increased from 30 per cent. of the population to 40 per cent., yet millions of pounds worth of aid has been put into the country. We have to get a bit clever about using aid&mdash;we must set specific targets and make further aid dependent on their being reached.</p>
