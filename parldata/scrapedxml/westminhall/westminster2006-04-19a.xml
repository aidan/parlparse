<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.71.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" speakername="Gary Streeter" colnum="71"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h01.htm#60419h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.71.3/1">I am pleased to contribute to this Adjournment debate on the important country of Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/2">Belarus, which is a country of 10 million people, was formerly part of the Soviet Union and is on the doorstep of the European Union. It abuts Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, which are all former Soviet Union countries and now full and welcome members of the EU. Like Poland, Belarus has had a difficult history. It is wedged between Germany to the west and Russia to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1748" name="Alan Simpson">the east. As my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson)</phrase> with his expertise in military history knows only too well, sadly Belarus has seen occupying troops from west and east rampaging over its soil many times during the centuries. Its capital, Minsk, was particularly badly treated during the second world war. Unlike Poland, Belarus remains in poor shape to meet the challenges of the 21st century and a globalising world. Belarus adjoins Ukraine, which was also once a mainstay of the communist bloc but is now a young and emerging democracy that aspires to join the EU, an aspiration that has my full support.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/3">Unfortunately, Belarus, which is a European country, has become stuck in a negative time warp. Since 1994, it has been run by Alexander Lukashenko, who is sometimes described as the last dictator in Europe. I shall illustrate what he and the country are like. I was in Minsk just before the recent presidential elections and it was like stepping back in time. While I was there, Mr. Lukashenko spoke to a national convention in the capital for three and a half hours. His speech was punctuated with Soviet-style applause by the great and the good who were proudly displaying their medals. Every word of that speech was broadcast live by the state-owned television service, and when our meetings were over for the day we could rush back to the ambassador's residence and watch it again on an extended news broadcast. That was only a summary of the highlights but lasted one and a quarter hours. All that was just one week before the country went to the polls.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/4">Since 1994 Mr. Lukashenko has systematically closed down the free press, banned most non-governmental organisations, stopped churches meeting freely, imprisoned political opponents on trumped-up charges, outlawed street protests and filled all key positions in the Government, the judiciary and the electoral commission with his supporters. His party piece, which I did not witness, is to sack Cabinet Ministers on live television, showing firmly who is in charge. I hope that the Government here do not intend to follow that practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/5">Our excellent ambassador in Minsk, Brian Bennett, demonstrates a real commitment to the people of Belarus and is a credit to the Foreign Office. He describes Mr. Lukashenko as someone who is not yet quite a dictator but is a coming dictator. He is slowly eradicating dissent and eliminating opponents. I heard that assessment with a growing sense of foreboding. He presides over an old-fashioned, centrally planned economy that is dependent on heavily subsidised Russian gas and oil. The state-controlled media daily reinforce the message that life in Belarus is good and stable, unlike in the volatile neighbouring countries where, they say, unemployment is soaring. All public sector employment contracts are for 12 months only and if employees do not do what the president demands their contracts are not renewed. It is as simple as that. The public sector in Belarus accounts for well over 50 per cent. of its gross domestic product, so a significant number of people live their lives on 12-month contracts at the president's whim. Any student who takes part in dissident activity is banned from further study.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/6">It is chilling that the president, who is only 52, has a growing iron grip on his fellow countrymen that is becoming tighter by the day. When he was first elected in 1994, not long after the Soviet Union had collapsed, the constitution permitted a president to stand for only two terms. He has recently cajoled the citizens of his country into voting through a change in the constitution to permit him to stand again and, I suspect, again and again. It is worth emphasising that that unacceptable form of leadership is not on the other side of the world or in some bygone era. It is happening now, today on our very doorstep.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/7">I was in Belarus to meet Opposition party leaders in the run-up to the presidential election on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-19">19 March</phrase>. They were campaigning bravely despite constant intimidation, harassment, the risk of imprisonment and personal risk to themselves and their families. Many had been imprisoned several times and accepted that part of being in Opposition politics in Belarus is that they would spend some time in prison. That is part of political life there, rather as we think of campaigning and knocking on doors as being part of political life in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/8">I am pleased that many democracy-building organisations in the west, including America, other European countries and Britain through the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, have worked for many years in Belarus to try to support and build capacity in fledgling parties and would-be politicians who struggle to usher in a new dawn of freedom and democracy in their country.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/9">We all respect the Minister for Europe, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" name="Douglas Alexander">the right hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, South (Mr. Alexander)</phrase>, and I want to say in his hearing that much of the democracy-building work by political parties through the Westminster Foundation for Democracy in many parts of the world is unseen, long term and difficult to measure, but its contribution is one of the most important that the House makes to the developing world and to many countries that have no history of democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/10">One of the good things that happened in the run-up to the election was that most of the Opposition forces agreed to form a coalition around an outstanding man, Alexander Milinkevich, who is as brave and honourable a man as anyone could wish to meet. I had a meeting with him for one and a half hours and left it feeling very humble and that I had been in the presence of a very special person.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/11">One evening, I witnessed 3,000 courageous freedom fighters assembled in the centre of Minsk against the diktats of their Government and despite the best efforts of the police and the state storm-troopers who did everything in their power to deter them. I watched those brave souls march through the snow singing their songs of freedom while the riot police snaked around them. It was a truly inspirational moment that I will never forget. Mr. Milinkevich addressed the crowd and made it clear that they did not seek a revolution but simply wanted free and fair elections so that the people of Belarus could genuinely decide for themselves who should govern them.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/12">It is not a matter for me, for this Chamber or for this country who runs Belarus. It is a matter for the people of Belarus. Our only concern lies in ensuring that they make the decision in verifiably free and fair elections. However, that is not what happened on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-19">19 March</phrase> when Mr. Lukashenko received an astonishing vote of 82.6 per cent. of popular support. We knew that it would be more than the 79 per cent. that he had predicted, but it takes some gall to suggest that 82 per cent. of the population voted for him.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/13">Was that a genuine result? The preliminary report of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is an experienced organisation that we all greatly respect, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/14" class="indent">&quot;It is clear that this election did not meet OSCE commitments and international electoral standards. The arbitrary abuse of state power, obviously designed to protect the incumbent President, went far beyond acceptable practice. The incumbent President permitted State authority to be used in a manner which did not allow citizens to freely and fairly express their will at the ballot box.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/15">It continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/16" class="indent">&quot;A pattern of intimidation, and the suppression of independent voices, including those remaining non-State print media, was evident throughout the campaign. Such actions impeded the possibility for vibrant campaign discourse, and raise doubts regarding the authorities' willingness to tolerate political competition on the basis of equal treatment before the law and by the authorities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/17">It goes on to talk about early voting, which is a very significant point. Whenever we talk about rigged voting&mdash;I shall come on to that point in a moment&mdash;the crucial question is how it is done. The report says that</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/18" class="indent">&quot;regulation of early voting is non-transparent and fails to provide safeguards. The lack of any official protocols to document the record of voting on each day of early voting, as well as the lack of security provisions for the closing and overnight storage of the ballot box, increases the possibility for electoral malfeasance&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/19">It is not enough, it seems, for Mr. Lukashenko to brutalise all opposition forces, or for him to have sole control of all media outlets. He has gone on to ensure that voting procedures can be completely abused.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/20">This is what happens: people who vote early can turn up at the polling booth seven days before election day. It turns out that 31 per cent. of the people voted early. That night, votes are taken away by the election officials, under no scrutiny and with no one overseeing what goes in the ballot boxes, and the boxes are put out the next day with no check made of them whatever. That is one clear possibility of abuse for 31 per cent. of the vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/21">On election day itself, when the rest of the population vote, the system of informing the world of who has voted for whom consists of one person, a member of the precinct electoral commission. Unseen by anyone else or any of the opposition forces and not checked by any independent verifiers, in a small room on his own, he fills in a piece of paper saying who voted for whom. Would we accept that in this country as a fair way of recording who voted for whom? We would not. The situation is ripe for vote rigging and I have no doubt that this vote was completely rigged by President Lukashenko of Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/22">It was announced that the president had won 82.6 per cent. of the vote, but what has happened since? Many brave citizens took to the streets to protest in larger numbers than ever before, but, sadly, the riot police were deployed in far greater force than before and many citizens were attacked and arrested. Hundreds have been imprisoned since <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase> and many of them were imprisoned by judges appointed by Mr. Lukashenko and those loyal to him, and, of course, he is quite capable of removing any judge. Some of those prisoners have not been heard of since.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/23">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase>, I took part in my first ever street demonstration, outside the embassy of Belarus in Kensington. Standing there with people from Belarus, singing &quot;Zhive Belarus&quot;, which means &quot;long live Belarus&quot;, and waving their former white and red national flag was a very moving moment. We were there for about two hours. It was very cold&mdash;we were extremely brave&mdash;and the police were called three times by the people inside the embassy because they were frightened of our street demonstration.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/24">I shall read an eye-witness account of some of the action in Minsk at about the same time. One person has written of her experience of demonstrating about the presidential election results in Minsk:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/25" class="indent">&quot;Buses came to the square. We were surrounded. Riot police jumped out of the buses. They ordered us 'lie down on the ground'. We lay down, and every second or third policemen began to beat us. I held on to Vera.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/26">That is her daughter. She continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/27" class="indent">&quot;Some girl stood in the middle of the tent camp and began to pray. It was so dramatic. I couldn't believe I really was there . . . One policeman grabbed Vera by her hair and pulled. Another screamed at him, 'Don't beat her, don't you see that she is totally young'. The other one beat her nevertheless.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/28" class="indent">They pulled her away. Then they threw me head towards . . . the asphalt pavement. Falling down, I hit the ground with the back of my head. Then they hit me in the face. Now the left side of my face is injured, I have a bruise under my left eye.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/29" class="indent">They grabbed me as some pig, thrown into the bus. They screamed at us, called us pigs, asked what we were doing here, with this revolution. In the bus they kicked me in my back all the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/30" class="indent">I lie on the floor and thoughts are stirring in my head, 'Where is Vera?' I didn't recognise them. I fainted. When I regained my consciousness, I still haven't been able to recognise them for several minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/31" class="indent">Then they prevented us from talking to each other . . . they brought us to the prison . . . the whole corridor was jammed with people. They treated us as real criminals, screaming, 'Face the wall! Stop talking! . . . ' Then they went from one to another, asking, if there were underage children.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/32" class="indent">So we stood near the wall, I have no idea, how long. They arrested us around 3 a.m. And we had to stand facing the wall till around 1 p.m.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/33">I am really sorry if there are people in the embassy of Belarus in Kensington who were scared of 30 people in suits standing peacefully on the street corner chanting a few slogans, but that is as nothing to what the Government of Belarus did to their own people who had the audacity to protest and campaign for freedom in their capital city. But the election is over, the protests, for now, are quelled and Mr Lukashenko remains in office with all the apparatus of the state to keep him there.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/34">What is to be done? My purpose in raising this issue is to ask the Government of the United Kingdom to do all in their power to play their full part in putting the Government of Belarus under pressure to change their ways and provide for free and fair elections. I hope to hear the Government's strategy for seeking freedom for the people of Belarus. I also ask the Minister to spell out his understanding of what the European Union intends to do to keep up this pressure on this European country.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/35">I know that there is no magic solution. No one, of course, is suggesting military intervention&mdash;let us get that out of the way right now. There is no silver bullet, but there are some things that can be done and I have three suggestions. First, the people of Belarus lack basic information about the true state of their nation, their president and the true nature of the EU and the surrounding states. In the absence of a free press, how could they get a balanced picture? Many are poor and have no access to electronic media. Could more be done, perhaps by the BBC World Service, to ensure that more broadcasts in Belarusian are transmitted to get the message across?</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/36">I understand that during the past three or four months the EU has sponsored radio transmissions into Belarus, which is a good thing. However, I was told while I was in Belarus that it is transmitted in such a way&mdash;I will not say, &quot;Typical EU&quot;&mdash;that hardly anyone can receive it. There is a technical problem, but I am not qualified to say what that is. Will the Minister please look into that? It is important that transmission of what is really going on in the outside world takes place and it is important that the EU takes a lead in that. Will the Minister ensure that whatever is being done is done as effectively as possible, and will he say what resources the Government are prepared to commit to getting a message of freedom to the people of Belarus?</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/37">Secondly, a key to this situation is clearly the giant of Russia, right on the eastern border of Belarus. Although I understand that President Lukashenko and President Putin do not enjoy a harmonious personal relationship, Russia is no doubt keen to see a non-democratic neighbour on its doorstep, in contrast to recent events in Ukraine and elsewhere. The economy of Belarus is kept afloat by heavily subsidised gas and oil. I do not wish the people of Belarus ill in any way, shape or form, but sometimes it can take the harsh wind of economic reality to bring a nation to its knees and to its senses. What pressure are the UK Government and the EU putting on President Putin about these subsidies and the Russian approach to Belarus generally? If the President of Russia is keen to portray himself as a democrat and world leader, is it not the case that he should be encouraged to take a more robust approach with this rogue dictator on our doorstep?</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/38">Thirdly, are we listening to the man who has managed to unite almost all opposition forces in Belarus, namely Alexander Milinkevich? He has called for the west to be tougher and more resolute. He has called for us</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/39" class="indent">&quot;to send a stronger message that Belarus has experienced a constitutional coup that brought to power a man who is not eligible for it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/40">He has called for &quot;targeted repressive sanctions&quot; against officials and judges responsible for arrests and jailing of opposition supporters, as well as the state media journalists for &quot;deceitful&quot; coverage of the protests. The EU currently bans visits from about six of the top officials from Belarus, and I ask the Minister whether it is time to extend that travel ban to make it bite more widely and deeply. What does he say in response to Mr. Milinkevich's calls for targeted, repressive sanctions? Does he agree that it should be a priority for the EU to bring about change in Belarus?</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/41">What is democracy about? It is about the rule of law, freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, a strong civil society, respect for human rights and, above all, the ability of a people to elect and remove their leaders through verifiably free and fair elections. None of those elements is present in Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/42">The Conservative party has committed itself, through the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, to working alongside opposition forces in Belarus to stay the course until freedom finally comes to that European country. I appreciate that the Government and our friends in the Liberal Democrats feel just as strongly about the issue as we do. We will continue to raise our concerns about Belarus on the Floor of the House. Some people will say that this matter has nothing to do with us and that our foreign policy should be narrowly in the national interest, but it is in our national interest to help to spread freedom and democracy to all parts of the world. It is offensive to have that tinpot dictator on our doorstep.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/43">I invite the Minister at the end of the debate to satisfy hon. Members that the Government and the EU will marshal all their resources, harness all their political will and do all that they can until the freedoms that we take for granted in this country are present also in Belarus.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Streeter, for that fair presentation of a very difficult situation.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.76.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="76"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h01.htm#60419h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.76.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> on obtaining the debate. That is the formula that we always use on these occasions, but in this case I sincerely mean it, because the debate is both timely and important. It is timely, coming so soon after the rigged election, and it is important because, as the hon. Gentleman explained, Belarus matters both to our country and in the context of the wider Europe. It matters in a more general sense almost at a global level.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/2">One of the simple realities is that Belarus as it exists at present cannot continue indefinitely. The future for Belarus is either a soft landing, whereby it becomes acceptable to and will receive support from the wider Europe, or an abrupt, hard landing, which is not in the interests of the people of Belarus, of the people of the European Union or, in the end, of the people of Russia. None of us needs instability and a political or social black hole in the heart of what is an enormous piece of territory in central and eastern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/3">We have a national interest in Belarus. I notice that the broadcasting signs are on, but I do not suppose that millions of people are glued to this debate. However, even though the debate may be dismissed as not of immediate relevance to people in this Parliament and this country, I emphasise that it matters enormously that Britain and the wider Europe begin to get the debate about Belarus right.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/4">A rather odd thing about Belarus is that it is a member of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe&mdash;the hon. Member for South-West Devon quoted from the OSCE's interim findings on the election. One of the ironies about the OSCE is that to become a member a country has only to say that it subscribes to the organisation's values and does not have to do anything to conform to them. It is interesting that Belarus wants at least that level of international approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/5">Belarus is not a member of the Council of Europe, which makes it unique in the European family of nations. It is the one country that has not been allowed to join. Some people would say that there may be other countries whose standards are not of the highest Council of Europe order, but it is interesting that Belarus is the one country on which there has been agreement that not only does it not approach the standards of democracy and the rule of law that we would expect from a modern European state, it does not even try to approach them. That is a tragedy for the rest of Europe, although it is mainly, of course, a tragedy for the people of Belarus, because they are the ones who, in the end, become the victims of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/6">There is another oddity&mdash;I am not disagreeing with the hon. Member for South-West Devon but nuancing what he said&mdash;in that President Lukashenko almost certainly would have won a free and fair election, partly because the people of Belarus, perhaps wrongly, still see themselves as better off than many of their neighbours who have gone through the upheaval of economic and political change. I strongly suspect that Belarus has much of that to come, so it is a difficulty deferred rather than a difficulty avoided. Nevertheless, President Lukashenko would probably have won a free and fair election, although obviously with a significantly smaller majority than that which he claimed to have obtained.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.77.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" speakername="Gary Streeter" colnum="77"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h01.htm#60419h01_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.77.0/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman's assessment: that was the view of most people on the ground while I was in Belarus. Does he not agree, though, that if someone feeds their citizens a regular diet of positive media reporting about themselves and negative media reporting about their opponents, that does not necessarily give a true picture&mdash;even though it sometimes happens in this country?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.77.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" speakername="Tony Lloyd" colnum="77"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h01.htm#60419h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.77.1/1">I might just nuance my answer on the totality of the hon. Gentleman's comments, but what he says is right in the Belarusian context. We know that the election was stolen probably by ballot rigging, but also by the total suppression of proper access for alternative voices&mdash;democratic voices&mdash;to the media. The media simply were not able to perform their role in the run-up to the election. Nor is there the structure of alternative voices through non-governmental organisations and civil society that we would expect in a society such as ours, or even in a much newer democracy. Those processes simply have not been allowed to exist, and where they do exist, they have not been allowed to take root and flourish. Again, that is a tragedy for Belarus because it means that it has been denied the opportunity to examine its future in all the different ways that that would mean.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/2">The conclusion that everyone draws is that the election was rigged. I think you were there last week, Mr. Hancock, when the Romanian chairman-in-office of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe made a strong statement on Belarus, making it clear that, across the whole European family, there was no ambiguity about the issue. There is one proviso, but the Council of Europe as a whole was of the view that the election was severely rigged. The oddity is that at the same time as the Council of Europe, the OSCE and most reputable bodies were condemning the election as rigged, the Commonwealth of Independent States concluded that the election was substantively free and fair. That is a significant shame, because it demonstrates a polarisation of views on Belarus between the European Union and those who take a similar view, and Moscow.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/3">Our relations with Russia are of massive significance, but we have to say to the Russians that they are getting it consistently wrong about Belarus by going through a pretence that an election that was clearly flawed was free and fair. It was claimed that President Lukashenko obtained 82.6 per cent. of the vote&mdash;a ridiculous figure by almost any standard. I was almost inclined to ask the hon. Member for South-West Devon whether he could give me an accurate prediction of the result next time, as it is clear that President Lukashenko is ambitious to increase his share of the vote on each occasion. Such predictions may already exist in the presidential palace in Minsk. That cynicism, alas, is what we end up with. There is absolute cynicism about the capacity of Lukashenko to deal as an honest broker on behalf of the people of Belarus with the wider Europe and the wider world. He ends up with little credibility through this flawed or even non-electoral process.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/4">Perhaps I should comment on another important issue that the hon. Member for South-West Devon raised: what happened after the election. There were not only protests outside the embassy in London, although I congratulate him on that. We have not only testimony written witness accounts. Because of the wonders of the modern media, even in Belarus it was possible to see violence of a level that is simply unacceptable being meted out by the security forces and police to non-violent protesters on the streets of Minsk. I know not what happened elsewhere, but I could see on my television screen innocent people being savagely beaten by the security forces in a way that, frankly, ought to have led to criminal charges being brought against them, rather than against those innocent protesters, who were taking part in events that would pretty much be taken for granted in countries such as ours&mdash;and, indeed, throughout the entire European family. Even if such events had taken place in Moscow, they could not possibly have been met with the same kind of reaction by the security forces in Russia as we saw in Belarus. In that regard, Belarus is the back marker: things can take place in Minsk that would not take place in any other capital city or society in modern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/5">What should we do? I again share the agenda of the Member who secured the debate. There is no magic wand or silver bullet; instead, there is a need for consistent pressure over time. It is easy for us all to become agitated at the time of an election, and to say, &quot;Yes, the election was fraudulent, let's protest&mdash;and then let's gently allow this to be forgotten as we move forward.&quot; For all manner of reasons, it is necessary to ensure that we maintain an interest in the Belarusian agenda, because&mdash;returning to my initial comments&mdash;it is an important country within the European family. It is important that Britain works through the European Union. There is no unique British position on this: there must be a common EU position. We should say to our colleagues in the EU that there must be consistency, and there must be a determination to maintain that consistent approach over the weeks, months and indeed years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/6">We must examine what level and package of sanctions can be made available that does not strike against the ordinary Belarusians. It is not a rich country by any standards, although it may be better off than some of its immediate neighbours. It is a fragile society, and its people are entitled to expect better than blanket targets that damage the ordinary Belarusian. However, we are entitled to study the roles of those who run that society, and to consider how we might target sanctions against the leadership and those around it. That is absolutely legitimate&mdash;it is absolutely normal and proper.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/7">We must also look into how we can support free media. That may be done by broadcasting from outside, although there are limitations on that: during the cold war, it was always possible to block signals coming in from the outside. I was rather interested in the concept of an EU radio-wave mountain somewhere, because transmissions are not getting across on the uniform plane in Belarus. However, it is certainly worth examining how we can support media being delivered from outside.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/8">The most important thing is to support free institutions inside Belarus, where that is possible. I am aware that it is difficult, but we ought to try to do it. How do we support civil society, NGOs and free media?</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/9">We must also address the role of Russia. One of the big debates we must have with Moscow in the months to come is about how it sees itself in relation to that part of the world, and how it sees its relations with the EU and the rest of Europe. Frankly, the days of the Russian client states ought to be disappearing, as in the long run the alternative will not be in Russia's own interests. Not long ago, we saw how the client state that it felt it had in Ukraine disappeared and turned into something much more unpredictable, and much more difficult from Moscow's perspective. Moscow now needs to wrestle with the question of how it works with Belarus to get that soft political and social landing, and to do so in a way that allows Russia to maintain good relations with that important neighbour. If we engage with the Russians, it is possible&mdash;I do not say likely&mdash;that we could come up with a common agenda, allowing us to say that we share an interest in helping Belarus to move forward in a direction that is acceptable both to Moscow and the EU. I urge the Minister to look seriously at how we can do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/10">In the end, the assessment must be made that Belarus is left in a much more fragile position than the election result would suggest. It is fragile because the economic and political winds will continue to blow, irrespective of whatever is done by the EU or in Moscow, and of whatever is done in the presidential palace in Minsk. Everyone has an interest in trying to move Belarus forward. If we can do that together and in a way that is consistent with the needs and interests of the people of Belarus, we will have achieved a significant victory not only for the Belarusians but for the wider Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/11">If we fail to do that, I do not predict doom and gloom&mdash;it would be ridiculous to do so&mdash;but Belarus could cause us headaches in the future, so it is worth putting in the effort to try to ensure that we get real progress. That is worth effort in London and Brussels, and it is worth effort with us all, with Moscow, in Minsk.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.80.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" speakername="Jeremy Browne" colnum="80"  time="010:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h01.htm#60419h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.80.0/1">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> for securing this debate on what I think everyone accepts is a pressing matter for Europe. At the conclusion of his speech, he asked rhetorically whether the subject of Belarus and the situation there ought to be of concern to this House. The answer to that question is emphatically yes. There are people throughout the world who live in circumstances that we would not wish upon ourselves, and who look to the British Parliament to be a beacon of liberty and to articulate concerns and fears that they are not always able to articulate themselves. Although this debate does not have as high a profile as those attending it would wish, we are making an important contribution by making it clear that we in the United Kingdom are concerned about the state of affairs in Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/2">In passing, I might add that it is also worth pausing to reflect on how important it is that we maintain our own standards of democracy, not least with regard to some of the new voting procedures that have been introduced, so that we can continue to uphold the highest standards, and to ensure that when we talk about other countries we are not seen to be in any way vulnerable to counter-charges from people in those countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/3">To take into account a broad sweep of history, some people might think that the most memorable single day or event of the past 50 years or so was the terrible things that happened in the United States of America on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>. We will certainly continue to witness the ongoing struggle to counter al-Qaeda and its threat to the way of life of people in the west and throughout the world. However, although there was not such a dramatic single image to illustrate it, perhaps the most significant event in international affairs during that period was the collapse of the Soviet Union. As a result, hundreds of millions of people who had not previously enjoyed the liberties, freedoms and values that we in this country often take for granted suddenly had exposure to them in their everyday lives. Those people might not have been able to read newspapers that were produced independently of the state, to gather or form organisations in the way they wished, to speak freely, or to stand in free, fair and open elections. Suddenly, such opportunities presented themselves to those people in a way that they had never done before. That was tremendously significant for the development of the world and of the values that we in this country and this Parliament hold dear. More importantly, that was tremendously significant for the people who live in those countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/4">This debate is of particular interest because for many people there is a sense of unfinished business about Belarus; there is a sense that it is a throwback or hangover from an era that in many other ways has receded and passed. I am not making a party political point, but all those in this House who are keen to champion the liberal cause&mdash;I think that is pretty much all Members of this House, and of the House of Lords, for that matter&mdash;see before us an opportunity to make sure that we continue to roll out such values in Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/5">I, for one, was heartened by the developments in Ukraine a year ago. I say that not only because I am always an enthusiast for an orange revolution&mdash;I think that many other countries would benefit from one&mdash;but because it is a country with a population of similar size to ours that was suddenly exposed to not only freedom of speech and media, but a more liberal economic situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/6">I add a cautionary note: we in this House should be careful not to oversimplify the subject. I say that because when one reads media coverage about Ukraine, it appears to be a good-news story, from a British or EU perspective. We read about all those people, many of whom were brought up under a relatively repressive regime, now being exposed to the great opportunities and freedoms previously denied to them, yet when one reads those articles more deeply, or speaks to those who are knowledgeable about the country, one finds that under the surface there remains a degree of discontent.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/7">Many people&mdash;how do I put this bluntly?&mdash;are concerned about their day-to-day living, their circumstances, and their economic well-being. That follows on from a point made by both previous speakers: the irony is that in Belarus, in other circumstances, the election result may have been less emphatic, but there would probably have been the same overall outcome. That is because for many people, particularly those in fairly dire&mdash;certainly by European standards&mdash;economic circumstances, their day-to-day concerns about pension payments and employment are perhaps of greater importance to them than some of the concepts that we have discussed, such as freedom of speech and of media. That does not mean that those concepts are not important&mdash;they are extremely important, and that is why this debate is so welcome&mdash;but we have to try to understand the motives for people voting as they do.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/8">Even taking into account allegations of vote-rigging and a heavily skewed media, we should not assume that all people in Belarus&mdash;or, for that matter, in other countries that we are similarly concerned about&mdash;are voting in a state of ignorance. In many instances, they may be voting for what they perceive to be their self-interest, and&mdash;we should say this with a degree of humbleness&mdash;they may even be right in their assessment of their self-interest, at least in the short term, although I accept that in decades to come they may be proved to have made a short-sighted decision on their own behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/9">It is right that every country should be free to make decisions about its own economic policies. I, for one, think that the economic policies being pursued by the Government in Belarus are not likely to lead to a prosperous country with happy people, but, for that matter, they may think that the policies being pursued by the British Government are not likely to lead to a prosperous country with happy people. Those are decisions that we need to make in free, fair and open elections. I am cautious about lecturing the people of Belarus about which economic policies are wise for them, because that is a decision that they have to take. However, they may care to look at which countries have been most successful economically and at the policies that those countries have pursued, and they may then come to a conclusion that the policies offered by the Government in Belarus are unlikely to achieve their objective. None the less, that is their decision. Civil liberties issues are quite different; those are universal values, and we should look to promote them, even aggressively, throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/10">I finish with a series of questions or challenges to the Minister, and I hope that he will address them. On my first question, a day or two ago I read in the newspapers an unfavourable report about the Minister that I thought was unfair. He had been asked during a radio interview&mdash;I think on Radio 4&mdash;to describe what benefits the European Union brought the people of Britain. The report appeared to imply that the Minister had not been able to think of a sufficiently robust and impressive case for British membership of the European Union. I think that the Minister cited cheap flights as a good example of how British people directly benefited from our membership of the EU. I do not disagree with that answer, but if we are looking to make a wider point that appeals a bit more to British people's altruism, or at least not to their direct economic self-interest, Belarus is a perfect case study of how we benefit from a joined-up, collective EU approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/11">There is no particular reason or need for individual countries in the European Union to take different approaches to Belarus; we share the same values and we all share our criticism of the recent election in broad terms. We speak more effectively, and in a way that is more likely to gain results, when we are a collective voice championing freedom of speech, free economics, freedom of assembly, freedom of media and all the other freedoms that are the common goals and values of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/12">Secondly, I would be interested to know the Minister's view on how Russia can help with the situation in Belarus; is Russia part of the problem, or part of the solution? How can we in the EU, and how can the British Government, engage Russia in seeking that solution, or at least progress in Belarus? Thirdly, in what way can the United States play a part? The United States Administration has used particularly strong language in describing Belarus. If one reads background briefings about the country, the most strongly articulated case against the president and the conduct of the recent election is in the official briefing notes from the State Department in Washington. Is there an opportunity for the US to offer a more practical role, rather than simply articulating its concern in particularly strident terms?</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/13">Fourthly, what can the UK Government and the EU do to bring internal liberalisation to Belarus? Earlier, we touched on whether that could involve greater access to information. Broadcasting was the example given by previous speakers, but perhaps the internet would also be a suitable way of bringing more information about the outside world to the attention of people of Belarus. Also, contacts, exchange schemes with students, and greater opportunities for people to travel would allow the residents of a country that is, in a way, sealed off from outside opinion to gain greater access to how the rest of the world sees its own Government, regime and way of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/14">Finally, what assessment have the Government made about the external security concerns that arise from the current Administration in Belarus, particularly in terms of nuclear material? Although our primary concern in this debate is the well-being of the 10 million or so Belarusians, having a rogue state within Europe is also a legitimate concern of ours. What implications would that have in terms of organised crime, nuclear material, or any other threats that may project themselves beyond that country's borders?</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/15">I conclude by once again welcoming this debate, which the hon. Member for South-West Devon secured. The subject is tremendously important for liberals across the parties, across the countries of the European Union and across the world. I hope that the very fact that we are holding this debate sends a powerful message about the attitude of the British Parliament. I hope also that the British Government, in their ongoing activities&mdash;both in the EU and on their own&mdash;will continue to send that strong message in the months and years ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.0/1">Thank you for that thought-provoking speech, Mr. Browne.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.83.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="83"  time="010:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h01.htm#60419h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.83.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I remind the Chamber that the debate is about the progress of democracy in Belarus; we are not just discussing a sort of endgame in itself. My hon. Friend has a long track record of promoting democracy, not only for Belarus but for other countries. He is effectively the Conservative party's chairman for the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, which involves all the main political parties and does a tremendous amount of valuable work.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/2">In one sense, my hon. Friend lost his political virginity by demonstrating outside the Belarusian embassy; no doubt he now has a police record. He may decide to ascertain its details under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. All who have spoken so far have warmly congratulated him on raising this subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/3">I am tempted to take a historian's walk down memory lane, although I shall try to restrict myself. It strikes those of us of a certain age that 30 years ago, when I taught military history and defence studies to many generations of British officers, none of us envisaged that the cold war would end as it did. We used to game that out, and the gaming was always pretty bleak: either the cold war would end in Europe with a massive nuclear exchange after political instability and a clash between NATO and the Warsaw pact countries, or there would be a collapse in eastern Europe, but one that involved violence on a vast scale. That is a lesson for many pundits as they consider current crises.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/4">We have discussed central and eastern Europe, and also the middle east, on other occasions. When doing so, we ought to bear in mind how difficult it is for countries in such regions to move from what they had to what we think they should have today&mdash;a pluralistic society, democracy and tolerance.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/5">A number of hon. Members have touched on the history of Belarus; it is pretty awful by anybody's standards. People there have been trampled on by surrounding great powers, whether Austria-Hungary, Germany, the old imperial Russia or the Soviet Union. Belarusian relations with the Poles have been pretty insensitive at times, to say the least. Belarus lost one third of its population in the second world war, and before and after that war it suffered a series of massive purges.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/6">If anything, I am struck not by the fact that the countries of central and eastern Europe have had major problems in adapting to the changes, but by the fact that they have adapted surprisingly well. Whatever the main problems still faced in Belarus, it is something to say that only 15 years after the end of the cold war, there is only one European country left in which there is a serious and major problem, although I do not say that there are no problems in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/7">My final point about the history is that Chernobyl is very close to Belarus. We are commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster; on television this morning there were depictions of the problems still faced by families hundreds of square miles around the site and of what has been happening to a new generation of children. Belarus has been dumped on from a great height by history and natural events.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/8">I agree with those who have said that the great irony is that President Lukashenko would probably have won the election if he had carried on, as far as he could, in a normal democratic way&mdash;perhaps with a bit of the arm twisting and ballot rigging that happens in many democracies, including ours and that of the United States. The supreme irony is that he probably would still have won the election.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/9">As far as I can see, the problem for democracy in Belarus is the apathy and indifference of the majority of the population, who have been brought up among the horrors of their history and have an ability just to survive. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> pointed out, Lukashenko has delivered a degree of economic stability, even if that is propped up by Russia.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/10">The purpose of this debate is to ask the Minister questions about how the British Government can further progress on democracy. In the immediate aftermath of the elections, the Minister said that the Foreign Office was actively discussing with partners specific measures to take in response. Will he elaborate on what further measures the Government might take to bring pressure to bear on the Belarus Government? I accept that that will not be easy.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/11">My party welcomes the conclusions reached at the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-11">11 April</phrase> this year and the European Council's decision to take restrictive measures against President Lukashenko and the Belarusian leadership. However, although it is an important first step, what real impact does the Minister believe a travel ban will have on the Belarusian regime? There is no easy option, but we have seen the limited impact of the travel ban on the regime in Zimbabwe, which in many respects carries out even more horrendous acts against its own people.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/12">I draw the Minister's attention to human rights. Have the Government made it clear to Minsk that it will receive international respect only when it ceases violating the human rights of its citizens and recognises that the detention of individuals for politically motivated reasons is utterly incompatible with democracy? Does the Minister have available, through our Government or EU Governments, a list of individuals arrested purely for exercising what we would understand to be their democratic rights? If he has, what are we doing actively to publicise the fact that such men and women are being held under what we would regard as illegal measures?</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/13">What progress, if any, have the Belarus Government made on their obligation to co-operate fully with the Commission on Human Rights and in particular with the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus? As the special rapporteur's already extended mandate is due to expire, what are the prospects for an independent, credible and full investigation into the cases of forced disappearances and/or summary executions?</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/14">I turn to the issue of support for democracy, a strong element in the debate so far, and pushed by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon. I agree that it is important to keep the issue on our parliamentary agenda; we should not just have a debate and then forget the issue until the next elections in however many years' time. Secondly, that should be done EU-wide. The Government's White Paper on UK priorities for their 2005 presidency of the EU did not mention Belarus; in retrospect, some of us might find that somewhat surprising. I am sure that the omission did not reflect any lack of interest in the issue on the part of the Government, but future major official Foreign Office publications, particularly those that deal with European matters, should highlight Belarus next time.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/15">However, the UK presidency issued numerous statements on behalf of Belarus. What progress has been made since then to increase contact with the Belarusian people and strengthen our support for civil society? I link the question to what my hon. Friend said. What support can we give Belarusian groups that represent democratic parties&mdash;those that visit and those domiciled in the United Kingdom? What resources can we allocate to provide opportunities to inform the population of Belarus? As the hon. Member for Manchester, Central said, it is sometimes difficult to quantify what impact that might have. Even though a large majority of the people in Belarus do not have the opportunities that we have through the internet or even through television, the fact that things are being beamed to them will get the attention of quite a significant minority of the Belarusian electorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/16">In the light of the deteriorating situation in Belarus, do the Government still consider that their decision to close the British Council in Minsk in November 2002 was appropriate? Following the elections, what concrete actions will now be taken to bolster the freedoms of assembly, association and expression in Belarus?</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/17">Finally, I shall discuss two of the neighbours of Belarus. Poland has a great interest in what goes on there because of the large ethnic Polish population that is involved. I recognise that persuading the Poles to intervene politically to influence events in Belarus could be regarded as counter-productive. Nevertheless, they have a direct interest. Poland is a fine example of a country that has moved from the horrors of occupation and totalitarian communism to an open democracy. We should use as much influence as we can to persuade the Poles to do what they can in a practical and constructive way to influence events in Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/18">Russia is obviously the key to persuading the current president of Belarus at least to moderate his policies. We are in a quandary because we currently wish to persuade the Russians to moderate the policies of a large number of countries, not least those of Iran. However, I hope that we will continue, in a drip-drip manner, like water on a stone, to persuade <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">them that, as the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase> said, the continuation of the current regime in Belarus is not in their long-term interests. It would not be to Russia's disadvantage if there were eventually free and open elections in Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/19">As Churchill said, democracy is in many respects a bad form of government, but the alternatives are far worse. We sometimes have to live with the election&mdash;in pretty broad democratic terms&mdash;to office of parties that we do not like and that we regard, to a certain extent, as a threat to regional security at least. Such a situation has occurred in Palestine with the election of Hamas. We have not reached that stage in Belarus, where the progress of democracy will involve a long struggle over the next few years. The raising of this debate by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon is a small way of publicising to the President of Belarus that the United Kingdom does not accept what he is doing. We hope that raising this debate gives comfort and aid to those brave men and women who wish for Belarus to have the open democracy that we are lucky enough to have in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.0/1">I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">the opportunity that the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> has given the House to discuss Belarus. As other hon. Members have done, I acknowledge and welcome his personal commitment to democracy promotion generally, particularly his important work with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. We are grateful for the important efforts of all parties in taking forward its work. I also thank him for his generous words about Britain's ambassador in Minsk. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is also proud of his work, and I will ensure that a copy of the remarks made is relayed to him at the Minsk embassy.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/2">Today's wide-ranging debate does great credit to the House. It is based on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the experience of my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase>, who spoke wisely about the need for consistent pressure on the Belarus regime, and on the insights and historical perspective given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase>. He had my sympathy until he urged all parties to embrace the liberal cause. Knowing, as I do, the Foreign Secretary's clear views on liberal democracy, I do not relish return to King Charles street this morning and casually mentioning that in the course of an Adjournment debate I had embraced such a cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/3">The hon. Member for Taunton asked a specific question about an interview that I undertook while, it appears, he was enjoying the sun during the recess last week. For clarification, I was asked to list five specific benefits for an individual British citizen. In the course of doing so, I mentioned that the operation of the single market had allowed for cheap flights, which the hon. Gentleman has perhaps enjoyed during the past few days.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/4">I went on to say that those were individual benefits to individual citizens, but one must also recognise that the European Union has been hugely successful during the past 50 years in establishing peace, stability and democracy across the European continent. I hope that there would be agreement in all parts of the House that those are hugely important gains, which the EU has played a role in securing. I am thinking in particular about the transformation of central and eastern Europe to liberal democracies in recent years, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. By any measure, that is an historic achievement that will be judged hugely important and successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> gave us a lower-key historical tour d'horizon than he tempted us with at the outset of his remarks. The Army's loss has clearly been Parliament's gain in terms of the historical perspectives that he brought to bear. He made several important observations about the historical context in which we debate Belarus today. I will endeavour to answer the specific questions that he put to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/6">The backdrop to this debate is that Belarus briefly hit the international headlines last month following presidential elections that yet again delivered a win for Lukashenko, with, as we have heard, an implausible 83 per cent. of the vote. The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe election monitors declared the elections flawed and undemocratic. As a result, Belarus has been the subject of considerable debate within the EU, and sanctions are being imposed to apply pressure to Lukashenko's regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/7">As hon. Members have said, it is all too easy to forget the daily struggle of the people of Belarus when the story slips from our headlines. It is critical that we maintain our support for the vast majority of the Belarusian people who will continue to fight for democracy, despite the risk involved, when the election monitors have gone. It is crucial that we maintain the pressure on Lukashenko to change his approach and recognise the democratic wishes of his people. I therefore greatly welcome the contribution that this debate has made to increasing the profile of the problems facing Belarus, and I sincerely hope that there will continue to be debates in this House on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/8">I echo the sentiments of the hon. Member for South-West Devon. We do not support individual candidates or individual parties, because it is for the people of Belarus to choose their future and their future leadership. I, too, have had the opportunity to meet Mr. Milinkevich and to hear directly from him about his desire for a genuinely democratic state and about the struggles that opposition politicians have faced. Speaking, as we do, from the relative comfort and safety of Westminster, as democratic politicians in a longstanding, settled democracy, hearing of such struggles for democratic rights is humbling, as the hon. Gentleman suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/9">Belarus is an anachronism. It is a European country lying on the borders of the European Union. It claims to be at the heart of Europe politically and economically, but the policies of its leadership prevent its developing into that role. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said in a debate after the European Council,</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/10" class="indent">&quot;it is a disgrace that Belarus remains a dictatorship&mdash;the last in Europe&mdash;and it cannot continue in that way.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 444, c. 559.]</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/11">There is indeed no place for dictatorship in modern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/12">Over recent years, the political and human rights situation in Belarus has worsened as Lukashenko has sought to isolate the regime and its people. In answer to the specific question put to me by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk, we have no comprehensive list of the disappeared. The European heads of mission have been trying to ascertain how many people have been arrested over the past few weeks, but have been able to establish only that about 800 people have been arrested. Opposition figures have been arrested, beaten and imprisoned on trumped-up charges, and the European humanities university has been closed. It was the only independent university in Belarus before it was closed because of its promotion of diverse ideas and vigorous debate, and its refusal to promote state ideology. There has been harassment of political parties, a restrictive law on non-governmental organisations, the closure of independent newspapers, new limits on freedom of worship and a new anti-revolution law designed to muzzle any form of dissent.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/13">United Kingdom and European Union policy towards Belarus has been and will continue to be a two-pronged approach. First, we are applying restrictive measures against those who are responsible for the serious deterioration in the human rights situation in Belarus to encourage them to change their ways. Secondly, we will reach out further to the Belarusian people through support for civil society, NGOs and independent media. We will not forget the Belarusian people and their attempt to make their voices heard in a flawed election and in the subsequent demonstrations against a result that they felt was rigged.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/14">In a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase>, I expressed the Government's deep regret about the way in which the Belarusian authorities had held the elections. I commented again on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase> in reaction to the violent breaking up of an opposition rally. EU declarations have also detailed our strong concern about the regime's actions in suppressing legitimate democratic expression.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/15">Depressing as the events of last month were, there is some cause for hope. The election showed that there are people in Belarus who are ready to unite in the fight for democratic values. They showed extraordinary bravery in standing up for the right to vote freely, as we heard in the testimony read to us today, and a determination to change Belarus for the better.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/16">Lukashenko blames such activity on external interference, but, in doing so, he misreads and demeans his own people. The people of Belarus expect honesty and accountability from their Government, and they expect to choose who governs them. No Government who ignore that can be sustainable in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/17">Before I discuss the EU's response to the elections, I shall briefly review the history of its approach to Belarus. EU relations with Belarus stalled in 1997 as a consequence of serious setbacks in the development of democracy and human rights in that country. A particular trigger was the replacement of the democratically elected Parliament with a National Assembly nominated by the President in clear violation of the constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/18">The EU immediately froze talks on concluding the partnership and co-operation agreement with Belarus, and restricted ministerial contacts. At the same time, the EU established clear political benchmarks on democracy and human rights which, if met, would lead to improved relations. However, Lukashenko has made no attempt to improve the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/19">Under the UK's presidency last year, the EU laid down a clear marker that it expected the forthcoming presidential elections to be free and fair, and that it was prepared to take further appropriate restrictive measures if they were not. The EU's concerns mounted throughout the election campaign. During the demonstrations that followed the <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-19">19 March</phrase> election, approximately 800 political activists were detained, some without charge, for up to 15 days. One of the leaders of the Opposition and an ex-presidential candidate, Alexander Kozulin, remains in prison charged with organising group actions to disturb the public peace. He faces up to six years in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/20">As a result, at the <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April</phrase> EU General Affairs and External Relations Council, Ministers agreed to impose travel bans on 31 individuals deemed responsible for the fraudulent election, the violations of international human rights law, and the crackdown on civil society and democratic opposition. The travel ban includes Lukashenko. Ministers also stated their readiness to consider further restrictive measures. They condemned the treatment of political detainees, urged the regime to allow freedom of expression and assembly, and reiterated the EU's commitment to Belarusian civil society.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/21">Members have asked about the BBC World Service and the action that is being taken by the EU to support free broadcasting in Belarus. Let me first set out the position on the World Service. It broadcasts in Belarus in the Russian, Ukrainian and English languages via its shortwave transmitters. A key issue facing the World Service in Belarus is the practicality of reaching its audience. Shortwave transmission is not as audible in some regions as FM transmissions, which are broadcast locally and produce a strong signal. Ideally, the World Service would like to work with FM partners to deliver its product in Belarus, but the media market is tightly controlled and regulated. Given the current political situation, there is no possibility of the World Service or any other western broadcaster getting air time on an existing FM frequency or hiring a new frequency within the country. Therefore, the World Service offering remains shortwave only in a market that is largely FM-dominated. We are aware of no jamming issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/22">On several occasions in recent years, the World Service has examined the possibility of special programming for Belarus. The problem that I have just set out surrounding delivery of the product into the region remains the key stumbling block. The World Service product is available on-line, but, again, access in Belarus is difficult, as home internet usage is low. On-line facilities are mostly available in work places or in public internet cafes.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/23">Following pressure from EU member states, not least the United Kingdom, the Commission launched a second media project at the start of this calendar year. The project is for two years and will cost approximately &euro;2 million. It comprises TV and radio broadcasts from Poland, Lithuania and Germany into Belarus. It also provides funding for internet print media and training of journalists. The radio broadcasts started in February on various frequencies. However, as I said, the media market is tightly controlled, and the EU project faces challenges that are similar to those faced by the World Service because of the current political situation. I hope that the British Government's strong support of the Commission's efforts gives some comfort to the hon. Member for South-West Devon that we will continue to take an interest in the matter, notwithstanding the hurdles that we face in ensuring that the messages are heard by a wide section of the Belarusian population.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/24">Support for the Belarusian population and for civil society is, of course, fundamental to our approach. While holding the regime to account, we must also reach out to the Belarusian people and help them in their struggle for democracy. The UK actively uses bilateral programme funds to support civil society, particularly in the areas of human rights, independent media, good governance, and youth participation in events that are designed to increase awareness of democratic principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/25">We are working with EU partners to consider further steps to increase the EU's contact with the Belarusian people and to strengthen support for civil society, including technical assistance and the opening of an EU office in Minsk. To provide practical support, the EU has transferred &euro;2 million from its TACIS programme to the European initiative for democracy and human rights and decentralised co-operation programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/26">However, we must make it easier to get assistance to NGOs and independent media that work on human rights, good governance, democracy and freedom of expression, and which face constant pressure from the Lukashenko regime. We are investigating with our partners the means of developing more flexible EU funding mechanisms to allow us to increase our direct engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/27">As the hon. Member for Taunton said, it is not only EU partners who remain focused on the current deplorable situation in Belarus. The United States also takes a close interest. President Bush has repeatedly indicated his personal concern for the people of Belarus and has pledged</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/28" class="indent">&quot;to seek justice for the disappeared, as well as for all those who seek to return freedom to Belarus.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/29">US policy closely follows that of the EU: the US demands the same improvements in Belarus before building closer relationships, and the US and the EU co-sponsored last year's UN Commission on Human Rights resolution on Belarus. I assure Members that the EU and the US closely co-ordinated their response to the <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-19">19 March</phrase> presidential election.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/30">The new Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, said in a statement immediately following the presidential elections that he was</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/31" class="indent">&quot;shocked that a dictatorial and abusive regime, such as this one can continue to exist in today's Europe. We will work with other free and democratic societies in developing our response to this situation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/32">The UK and the EU will continue to work closely with the US, Canada and others to co-ordinate and unite our approach for future support of civil society and the people of Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/33">I shall write separately to the hon. Member for Taunton on the nuclear issue that he raised, and ensure that a copy of my response is placed in the Library. Belarus has no nuclear power stations, and all nuclear weapons were withdrawn by Russia in the early to mid-1990s when Belarus joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Chernobyl is in Ukraine, but, as we heard earlier, Belarus got much of the fallout as a consequence of that terrible disaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/34">In bringing my remarks to a conclusion, I shall focus on a couple of further points, in particular the issue of Russia, which was central to the comments of the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/35">I applaud the commitment of the hon. Member for South-West Devon, who continues to put Belarus on the public agenda. In turn, I assure him that the Government are committed to supporting the Belarusian people in their efforts to build a lasting democracy. We cannot and will not ignore those who seek to suppress their efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/36">As a number of colleagues have said during the debate, there is no magic wand, nor any easy and immediate solution. Therefore, I turn to the issue of engagement with Russia. When I visited Moscow at the beginning of March, I raised the issue of Belarus and, in particular, the issue of pricing parity and greater transparency in energy pricing. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised the issue of Belarus with its largest neighbour, Russia, following the elections that took place last month.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/37">The United Kingdom and Europe uses every available opportunity to raise Belarus when appropriate with Russia. The European Union troika met Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-12">12 April</phrase> to set out the EU's concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation, and to explain the decisions taken by Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April</phrase>. We continually stress to the Russians the shared objective that we have&mdash;including the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe&mdash;of encouraging Belarus to meet its international commitments to democracy and human rights. I can assure the House that we will continue to outline to our Russian counterparts our concerns about the deteriorating situation in Belarus.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.0/1">It is right and proper to urge Russia to share our view about the absence of acceptable legal norms and democratic standards. Although it is difficult for Russia to see this, is not the central point, however, that it is not in Russia's own interest to have a failing state on its own borders? A Belarus that lapses into criminality, corruption and gangsterism is not a healthy neighbour for Russia any more than it is for the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.0/1">I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend's intervention. His sentiments are similar to the points that I communicated when in Moscow. All of us are concerned about one of the principal challenges that we face in the 21st century, which is failing states. If states fall into criminality and end up with the status of failed state, they create problems not only for their immediate neighbour, Russia in this case, but for the region generally. That is why today's debate is of such importance to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/2">I also made the point when I was in Russia about the reputational damage that I believe was caused in the minds of many western Europeans by the reporting of the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute at the beginning of the year. If Russia were to make it clear that there is a level playing field and a commercial approach to gas supplies, it would contribute significantly to setting right some of the perceptions that took hold at the beginning of the year about the commercial treatment of Ukraine on the one hand and Belarus on the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/3">I share with the hon. Member for South-West Devon no ill will whatever towards the people of Belarus. However, when the Russians tell the British Government that they wish to see a more commercial approach to the provision of gas supplies generally, it should necessarily and appropriately include Belarus in the same way in which it includes Ukraine and other countries. There will be a strong focus on those issues, not least with the spotlight falling on Russia ahead of the G8 summit taking place at St. Petersburg in July.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/4">There is a real opportunity in the months between now and July to continue to impress upon the Russian authorities not only the importance of their conduct in relation to democratic standards within their own borders, but the importance of the messages that they send out through their comments about Belarus and other neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/5">We shall continue to impress those points upon the Russians. We shall try to persuade them that it is in all our interests to have a democratic, prosperous and stable Belarus. The future of democracy within Belarus rests on a credible political alternative to Lukashenko's dictatorship. We will continue to support that ambition.</p>

	Northern Ireland (Fishing Industry)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.93.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1846" speakername="Iris Robinson" colnum="93"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h02.htm#60419h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.93.1/1">I thank the Minister for the opportunity to raise matters of great urgency, upon which the future success of entire communities along Northern Ireland's eastern seaboard rests.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/2">Six years on from the introduction of the cod recovery scheme and the closure of the Irish sea cod fishery, fisheries scientists are unable to tell us in Northern Ireland whether it has had any effect whatever on cod stocks in the Irish sea. Six years on, the Northern Ireland fishing fleet is a shadow of its former self and hundreds of jobs have been lost. Six years on, factories and businesses have disappeared and the industry is approaching a point of critical mass beyond which it might not recover. Six years on, the Government cannot indicate whether the measures that have contributed greatly to the demise of our fishing industry have had any impact. Those left in the industry are exasperated as the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and its scientists continue to do little other than talk, while the industry crumbles outside.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/3">In 1993 213 commercial fishing vessels were registered in the Northern Ireland fishing fleet, but by this year that figure had fallen to a staggering 130. Whereas there were 44 white fish boats in the Northern Ireland fleet five years ago, there are now only 12. In Portavogie, where there were once more than 100 boats in the fleet, there are now just 40. Between 1999 and 2003, the average profit before depreciation of a Northern Ireland-based white fish trawler fell by 76 per cent. to just &pound;10,400. The average profit of a nephrop trawler fell by 48 per cent. to &pound;15,600.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/4">Since 2003, fishermen have had to deal with other factors, such as the huge rises in the cost of fuel oil and the cost of leasing quota, and income will have fallen further still. I spoke to one skipper during the week who told me that whereas fuel for his vessel had once cost 15p a litre it now costs 40p a litre, and that the fuel costs for operating his boat were now up to &pound;1,914 a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/5">Of course we must accept that to a certain extent the price of fuel is beyond the control of the Government. We do not ask for any preferential treatment. We merely ask that the issue is acknowledged and taken on board by the Government in order to understand the lengths to which the industry is being stretched. The cod recovery scheme was implemented six years ago on the basis that it would last for three years. The measures have been repeated each year since and were extended when the Scottish Executive imposed a closure in the north channel that was targeted at Northern Ireland trawlers.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/6">The EU Commission has stated that additional recovery measures are needed only where there is a biological urgency, but where is the biological urgency in the Irish sea, where the science shows that stocks are nowhere near as bad as assumed? Without a grain of evidence to justify the closure of the cod fishery, DARD scientists now tell us that without any substantial evidence they hold out little hope of the scheme&mdash;itself based on erroneous evidence and interpretation&mdash;ever being lifted.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/7">So what have DARD scientists been doing for the past six years, as countless skippers have been forced to decommission their boats, hundreds of fishermen have lost their jobs, factories have closed and countless jobs have been lost in the fish processing sector? Despite the enthusiasm of Northern Ireland Office Ministers, it has become increasingly clear during this period that the approach of fisheries scientists and the spin used in interpreting results has been a significant obstacle.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/8">Progress has been made in improving relationships and attempting to work co-operatively to address the problems faced. Despite that, fisheries scientists have acted in a counterproductive manner. Fishermen are urged to work with DARD to provide the data required for officials to argue their case in Europe. However, whenever that information is collected, fisheries scientists always seem to identify something negative and run with it, at all times ignoring the positive aspects of the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/9">Despite the poor reputation that DARD scientists have earned for themselves, local fishermen and producers' organisations remain committed to working with DARD. At a meeting with Lord Rooker last Tuesday, DARD scientist Peter Jan Schon came under enormous pressure from representatives of the catching, selling and processing sectors of Northern Ireland's fishing industry. He claimed that there was no co-operation from the fishing fleets in Kilkeel and Ardglass, except for Portavogie. That is absolute nonsense and was totally refuted by all present.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/10">Mr. Jan Schon was unable to substantiate his claim. He said that there was no data on the cod stocks in the Irish sea because fishermen were not co-operating. However, thanks to his work, fishermen are barred from fishing the area as a result of the annual cod fishery closure. When asked what he had been doing for the past six years, Mr. Jan Schon had no response.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/11">An associated issue is the barring of prawn boats from fishing in the area closed as part of the cod fishery closure. Mr. Jan Schon stated at the meeting, as DARD has before, that the prawn boats are barred because cod represents a substantial by-catch of prawns. Dick James of the Northern Ireland Fish Producers Organisation then presented the meeting with a copy of a multi-million euro report published in 2002 entitled &quot;Monitoring of Discarding and Retention by Trawl Fisheries in Western Waters and the Irish Sea in Relation to the Stock Assessment and Technical Measures&quot;. The findings of that report included the fact that no cod was caught as by-catch of a conventional prawn trawl&mdash;and who should be named as a participant and contributor to that report, but Mr. Peter Jan Schon. No wonder he had so little to say for himself at the meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/12">It gets worse, however. At a meeting with DARD officials on Thursday last week, Dick James again raised the matter, this time directing it to Mr. Richard Briggs, the Department's senior scientist. Mr. Briggs stated that it was his opinion that the nephrops fishery in the Irish sea was completely sustainable. One scientist has held up progress on the basis that prawn fishing is not sustainable, while another says that the whole thing is news to him. The right hand does not seem to know what the left hand is doing. It is that fundamental level of inconsistency on the part of DARD scientists that has lead to the strain in relationships between those who work in the industry and DARD.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/13">Another associated issue is the shape and location of the box, which fishermen are adamant are incorrect. Currently there is derogation in the centre of the box, where prawn fishing is permitted. However, there is an important fishery to the north-east of the box where fishing is prohibited. When the box was created, the Department used a geological survey, but it quickly became clear that it was not accurate. As a result, one of the most important prawn fishing grounds was included in the closure. When the tides run high&mdash;specifically in the spring, during the period of the closure&mdash;the area supports a significant nephrops fishery. Boats need to be able to get into the area at least every other week to maximise their catch and ensure their continuing viability. The problem has been raised with DARD officials on more than 12 occasions, yet once again they have failed to act in any way to resolve the anomaly. It must now be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/14">At the same time, however, it is clear that DARD as a whole has failed to represent the interests of the Northern Ireland fishing industry effectively. Last year the Food and Drink Federation announced that it was setting out to assess the amount of UK-sourced prawns consumed in the UK. Its findings indicated that the Irish sea could provide a sustainable fishery with a 30 per cent. increase in the nephrops total allowable catch. The Scottish and English Departments ran with those figures and used them to argue for increases in their nephrops quotas, obtaining increases of 31 and 39 per cent. for the west of Scotland and the North sea respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/15">DARD officials denied ever receiving the findings, which were forwarded to them by local fishing organisations. At the same time, they attempted to argue that because they are the poor relations within the UK, they do not stand a chance of getting a fair hearing. Those in the Northern Ireland fishing industry are sick, sore and tired of the Department's abdication of responsibility when representing their best interests in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/16">There is serious concern about the lack of urgency shown by DARD scientists in completing those scientific studies that have been commenced. During August, September and October last year, five boats from Kilkeel kindly gave their permission to be used as part of a DARD study, but eight months later the Department still does not have a date for publishing the findings. Scientists complain about the lack of data, but their performance in turning around the data that they do have is abysmal. They claim that such data are like gold dust, so their performance hardly illustrates a real commitment to helping address the problems experienced by our fishermen.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/17">As for the tie-up scheme, suffice it to say that that DARD owes the industry an apology for being so wide of the mark in its interpretation of the legislation, after having been embarrassed in Europe by Jim Allister MEP. Despite that embarrassment, Lord Rooker has this year refused to grant that lifeline to many of Northern Ireland's fishermen.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/18">We are informed that the decision to refuse aid was based on the fact that the scheme does not provide value for money. If that was the case, why was the scheme operated during 2004 and 2005? If it was value for money in those two years, what has changed in 2006? What has changed is that the cod quota has been decreased by 15 per cent., the haddock and whiting quotas have been slashed, and days at sea have decreased. In fact, given the new and increasing pressures placed on the industry since 2004, it could be argued that it would be better value this year than it was in the previous two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/19">Lord Rooker also states that there is insufficient funding to support a tie-up scheme and that money is already committed to projects in and around our harbours. That is well and good, and I commend the work of the fishing villages initiative in its work to attract millions of pounds of investment into fishing communities, but we must face the facts. What is the point in supporting fishing communities and investing in harbours when the time will soon come when there will cease to be a fleet to support?</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/20">We must now look to the future and to a plan submitted to DEFRA that has the Department's support. With the assistance of the Irish Sea regional advisory council, it is proposed that from January 2007 the fleet should start with a clean sheet, subject to certain criteria. The fleet would be allowed to catch what it wanted, but it would have to report exactly what was landed. Scientists would then assess that data and apply models to get an accurate picture of the health of Irish Sea fish stocks. From those results, they would be able to establish whether quotas were lower than the fishery could sustain, in which case they could be increased, or whether quotas were too high, in which case they could be reduced. Ultimately, we would arrive at the best possible package for both the industry and the conservation of the fish stocks in the Irish sea. The plan has the support of DEFRA and the EU Commissioner, and it has the potential to allow positive progress for the local fishing industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/21">One problem remains, however. It will have taken DARD scientists eight months to report back on five boats being studied over a three-month period. How will the Department fare if it is studying more than 100 boats, 365 days a year? The danger is that DARD will apply the same tired old science to the new data, and the fleet might once again have to pay for the scientists' desire to highlight and emphasise the negative and ignore the positive. There is potential for recovery, but we have a mountain to climb before we can claim it.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/22">In summary, this is the seventh year of the closure of the cod fishery in the Irish sea, but scientists still cannot tell us what effect, if any, it is having on the cod stocks. We were told that the closure would be for three years, yet seven years on we are still being told that DARD cannot go to the EU and argue for its removal, as it has no science to back it up.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/23">The fishing industry in Northern Ireland should always have been a team effort between DARD and those in the industry. Given the precarious state of the industry, I cannot emphasise sufficiently how crucial it is that fishermen, sellers, processors and the fisheries division of DARD work hand in hand, striving to create a sustainable and viable fishing industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/24">We need more effective science, more effective processing of information and more effective interpretation of results. To continue on the current course will lead only to the destruction of the local fishing fleet, which will have a colossal impact on the lives of those villages and communities that have for so long been bound together by the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/25">The bottom line is that we should not be arguing about the creation of a tie-up scheme, which is open only to a fraction of vessels, and we should not be scrambling around attempting to secure transitional aid. Instead we should have a Minister for fisheries, committed to fighting the corner for the local industry, changing EU &quot;wisdom&quot; and striving to create a strategy that would facilitate the recovery of the local industry, not its destruction.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1846" name="Iris Robinson">the hon. Member for Strangford (Mrs. Robinson)</phrase> on securing this debate. I know that she is passionate about the fishing industry, and about the problems of her constituents. She is always well informed, and is forthright in putting across her views. It is clear that she cares deeply about the future of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/2">I assure the hon. Lady that my ministerial colleagues and I share her concerns. We may not always have total agreement, but we all want to see a long-term sustainable future for the fishing industry, which means restructuring and changing it. No one wants to see short-term measures taken that do not deal with the underlying and ongoing problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/3">The hon. Lady highlighted a range of complex issues and the need for change. She spoke about restricted fishing opportunities and increased operating costs, particularly for fuel&mdash;an increase that we are seeing across manufacturing industry as well. The fishing industry needs to face up to and meet changing attitudes to the marine environment. That is a significant challenge, but the Government want to help, because we want to see a long-term sustainable future for the fishing industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/4">I shall do my best to address the various points raised by the hon. Lady. She spoke about the tie-up scheme of financial aid for the fishing industry, and claimed that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development owes fishermen an apology. That claim is not justified. As she said, the industry has faced grave economic difficulties. She said that financial support was the way forward. However, that would address the short-term problems, not the longer-term underlying factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/5">I appreciate the disappointment of the industry that the tie-up scheme was not run for another year. It was not an easy decision, although full account was taken of all the issues involved, including affordability&mdash;the hon. Lady mentioned value for money&mdash;sustainability and priorities within the fishing industry. Lord Rooker, who is listening to the debate, was very mindful of all those issues. He said that it was not an easy decision, but that it was taken in the best interests of the fishing industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/6">The hon. Lady also made a point about having a Minister who fully represents the Northern Ireland fishing industry. I place on record the strong commitment of the Government and the ministerial team, including my noble Friend Lord Rooker, to doing their best to ensure support and sustainability for the fishing industry. We would all have preferred to have a single Minister dealing with the issue. Once the Assembly is up and running and a devolved Minister is in place, we will not have Ministers trying to run several Departments, although we do the best that we can under the additional time pressures that it creates.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/7">It is worth noting that, for the second successive year, the Irish sea prawn total allowable catches were increased. In addition, the Northern Ireland industry was able to avail itself of the significant additional prawn quotas secured for the North sea and the west of Scotland. It is also worth remembering that the Irish sea still has a more generous allocation of days at sea than other areas of the cod recovery zone. Those achievements are worth placing on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/8">The hon. Lady also raised concerns about scientific information. Scientists need to obtain as much information as possible from various sources, for which they need the co-operation of fishermen. I challenge what the hon. Lady said about scientists concentrating on the negative. Scientists give a view of the scientific facts of the case. There is no interest for anyone involved in not presenting the facts as they stand. It is vital, when considering the long-term future of the industry, that we have accurate and precise information, for which we need scientists and the industry to work together. The fear is that if we fail to achieve that, the Commission is likely to adopt a harsher view and take a highly precautionary approach to its decisions, which would give us all cause for concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/9">The only way for the industry to have a sustainable, long-term future&mdash;I am sure that the hon. Lady and her constituents seek that, just as we in Government do&mdash;is with accurate, reliable information so that appropriate action can be taken. There is no interest in anyone having anything other than that. Scientists and fishermen should recognise that they have the same objectives. They will not always have the same views or make the same assessments, but if they do not work together to get a true picture and understand the priorities, we will not be able to take the right approaches or make the case that we want to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/10">The hon. Lady made her case about the cod recovery scheme. A considerable amount of work has been undertaken on that, and much more will be undertaken in the next 18 months, but marine science depends on data collected over a long period. It is not possible to take a snapshot of information that will be meaningful to the Commission or anyone else. We are optimistic that next year's exercise will be a significant step forward, but I cannot promise the hon. Lady any quick fixes. However, she must not think that a considerable amount of work has not been undertaken by scientists and the Department. That work is ongoing, because we need reliable, long-term data to make the case adequately.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/11">The hon. Lady also raised the issue of the purchasing quota. I understand her concerns about the price of the quota increasing, but that is its market value. This is another reason why we need important, accurate information, because if we do not have that, we might not do quite so well with the quota. We have done particularly well with the European Commission to be able to get that information. Unless we continue with that, we cannot give any guarantees for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/12">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and DARD are jointly funding a programme with the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science for fishery independent monitoring of cod recovery by means of egg production surveys. The hon. Lady nods; she must be aware of that. She made proposals in that regard, which we will give certainly full consideration. I welcome her positive steps forward on this issue, which we are keen to pursue. DEFRA and the European Commission are already holding meetings to discuss that, and we want to pursue it urgently. Scientific analysis will not handicap the effectiveness of the exercise in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/13">I was a little disappointed by the hon. Lady's comments about an individual scientist. It is important to recognise the professionalism of the staff who deal with these issues. I hope that she will accept that nobody has any interest in not getting accurate information with which to do their best for the fishing industry. The scientists employed by the Department are working on this issue because they want to ensure that we get the best deal for Northern Ireland fishermen. I hope that she will understand that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/14">I hope that I have addressed all the hon. Lady's points. I have already identified that the prawn total allowable catch for 2007 is a top priority for Northern Ireland. Enthusiastic work is being done to ensure that the TAC is increased in the following year. There is a deep commitment in the Department to ensure a long-term, sustainable future for the industry, but there is no quick-fix solution. The industry is under enormous pressure, and the Government would do it a disservice if we failed to establish what the long-term issues are and how they can best be addressed. We should not simply offer quick fixes that would undermine the industry in the long term.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.100.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" speakername="Eric Joyce" colnum="100"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h03.htm#60419h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.100.1/1">My aim today is to introduce a debate arising from a visit by the all-party group on the great lakes region and genocide prevention to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Other hon. Members will want to catch your eye, Mr. Hancock, and develop their own themes, so I shall explain the general context of the visit and mention a couple of points that particularly struck me. I hope that the Minister will reply to those points.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/2">I shall start with a specific matter that struck everyone on the visit. Panzi hospital, at Bukavu on the shores of Lake Kivu where eastern DRC meets Rwanda, is a remarkable place. A small number of doctors and nurses provide health care for women who have been victims of sexual violence and injured, often gravely, at the hands of the illegal militias that roam the forests of eastern DRC. To walk around Panzi hospital and talk to the patients, their carers and sometimes their children is a sobering and serious experience, but it was essential that those of us on the visit did so to set our perspectives clearly.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/3">The group travelled across the DRC, which is a vast country, and met politicians such as Dr. Bahamba Hamba, the governor of South Kivu, which includes Bukavu. We also met a chief of the Batwa pygmies and, at the other end of the visit, we met Vice-President Ruberwa and President Kabila, who were extremely generous with their time. We also met representatives of civil society and international figures such as Bill Swing and Ross Mountain who run MONUC&mdash;the United Nations organisation mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is the world's largest such mission&mdash;as well as met former child soldiers, international non-governmental organisations and local NGOs that are supported by international NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1859" name="Jeremy Hunt">The hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1898" name="Mary Creagh">my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh)</phrase> will present their own views, but I think that the group collectively formed the view that Panzi hospital represents a good prism through which to see many of the problems that beset the DRC. The United Kingdom Government could help to tackle those problems both bilaterally and internationally in conjunction with allies in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/5">In 1994, the civil war in Rwanda, accompanied by the genocide perpetrated on the Tutsi minority, led to bandits and killers&mdash;they were given a number of names, including exFAR and Interahamwe&mdash;being displaced into eastern DRC. Initially they were assisted by the UN and semi-settled on the border. Hindsight shows that to have been a mistake, because it led to them running riot in the camps that were set up by the UN. In time, as the UN realised its error and as Rwanda began what has become a remarkable recovery, those bandits and semi-organised militias were displaced into the forests. There, in large part, they remain, augmented occasionally by new recruits, often children and teenagers who are taken forcibly from local communities to provide slave labour and fighters. During the Rwandan genocide, women and children were targeted to remove the next generation of Tutsis; that ruthlessness is now deployed to terrorise communities and enable the militias to subsist in the forest in preference to ending armed struggle and returning either to Rwandan justice or to an attempt to live decent and productive lives in Rwanda or the DRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/6">Sexual violence is not confined to eastern DRC, but there it remains a potent tool of subjugation. Women are routinely raped, tortured and murdered as a crude means of dominating communities and eking out a feral existence in the forest. The fear inspired by the militias frequently leads to families to reject abused women. Such women can be seen as a burden due to their injuries, which are often extreme, and sometimes they are a source of shame for their partners, who often rapidly become former partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/7">Most of those women have no access to health care and live painful lives, with many dying a painful death. A small minority make the long and hazardous journey to Panzi hospital where they are welcomed and provided with the best health care&mdash;modest, but the best&mdash;that the region can muster. Some of those women were deliberately injured during and after rape to make childbirth impossible, which leads to a massive requirement for gynaecological assistance and health care. Others have been subjected to such inhuman violence that it is breathtaking that they are still alive and receiving treatment in a place such as Panzi hospital. Dr. Mukaweye, the head of the hospital, told the group about the practice of most militias of following a rape by discharging a round of ammunition into the victim by the same entry point: those who do not die instantly suffer massive internal injuries. Unbelievably, some of the victims have been saved and have, after many months and sometimes years, been rehabilitated back into their home communities. I had never met anyone like Dr. Mukaweye but I know that there are others in the DRC and all over Africa doing similar work. His and his colleagues' work is inspiring, but the need is so great in eastern DRC that they must constantly fight for funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/8">A recent EU initiative funded by emergency provisions to provide financial assistance to Panzi hospital is soon to end. I am happy that the Department for International Development is stepping in to help the hospital to extend its capacity by constructing a new surgical wing. However, I wonder whether it is entirely appropriate for the emergency to be interpreted in that way by the EU, given the post-war environment in the DRC and the emergence of a large number of women now reporting with injuries following sexual violence, which, ironically, is consequent on the post-war context rather than on the civil war, which has now ended.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/9">Sexual violence is the sharp end of a series of challenges relating both to security and to wider political development. The hon. Member for South-West Surrey will speak about the security question and what the UK can do to help to expand the capacity of DRC forces in the post-election context. Clearly, it is difficult for the international community judge whether to help to expand the capacity of the armed forces of an unstable state that is not democratic or properly organised and whose Government's remit does not extend across the whole country, perhaps not even outside the most heavily populated places. It is a difficult judgment to make to assist such a country to build up its armed forces when they might be used for the wrong purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/10">The coming election may provide an opportunity and a cause for optimism. If everything goes well it may become appropriate for the international community&mdash; perhaps the British Government in conjunction with our allies&mdash;to consider ways in which security forces in the DRC be helped to develop their capacity. Without that capacity, there can be no proper infrastructure development: hospitals and schools cannot operate properly unless people can live safely and use them safely. During our visit, all members of the group were struck by the way in which all the local and international NGOs focused on security, which is not what one would normally expect. One would expect them to focus on services and issues such as justice, human rights and so on, but everyone we spoke to emphasised the importance of security and of building up the capacity of the FARDC&mdash;the DRC's own armed forces&mdash;after the election.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.0/1">I apologise for missing the first couple of minutes of my hon. Friend's speech. I know that he is talking about the east of the country, and he may have been about to make the point that I wish to raise. When talking about security issues, will he also discuss the Lord's Resistance Army and the fact that Otti is still in the DRC? I was in northern Uganda with other Members at the time that the International Criminal Court served its warrant for the arrest of Kony, Otti and three others, but MONUC chose&mdash;there was some confusion&mdash;to give Otti a wide berth. If the UN sanctions mean anything, we have to deal with the LRA. Will my hon. Friend deal with the fact that the DRC is in the midst of all those problems and has to be helped?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.102.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" speakername="Eric Joyce" colnum="102"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h03.htm#60419h03_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.102.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that very valuable contribution. I was not going to mention the LRA, but I shall now that he has mentioned it. It is crucial to recognise that some of these groups are still operating. There has been some progress in that bordering countries have, officially at least, withdrawn their military forces from the DRC. Rwanda has certainly done so. President Museveni, who has recently been recently elected in Uganda&mdash;one can say good things about his time in government, but it is harder to find good things to say about his more recent comments&mdash;spoke of the possibility of making an incursion into the DRC to deal with the problem of the Lord's Resistance Army. It would clearly be far better for the international community to deal with that problem than for Uganda or any other country to make incursions.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/2">MONUC is the UN body in the DRC and to give it some credit, it is doing very good work. Although it is a very large force, comprising between 16,500 and 17,000 personnel, that is a limited number when dealing with 10,000 or so members of the Interahamwe and various other militias, which are only semi-organised in any case. In time, the problem will be a matter for the international community, and the DRC forces, when they have the capacity to deal with it themselves. In the meantime, there is very much a patching-up mentality. MONUC does its best to keep areas safe&mdash;it is deployed, it moves those people around and it catches and kills the odd one&mdash;but until we have a proper democracy in a post-election context and a big effort is made by the international community after that election, the LRA will remain a problem. The LRA is a major problem for the whole region and it is time that the international community focused on it more. I am sometimes concerned, however, that President Museveni uses the LRA as a way of pursuing other political objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree, further to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the intervention of the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, that establishing domestic security, including the build-up of stable armed forces committed to providing it, demands robust international action to end the illicit sale of small arms and light weapons? Given that each year in developing countries in Africa, Asia, the middle east and Latin America about $22 billion is spent on the sale and illicit transfer of such weapons, which kill 400,000 people, is it not vital that we secure the passage of the international arms trade treaty as quickly as possible, then ensure its rigorous implementation?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.103.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" speakername="Eric Joyce" colnum="103"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h03.htm#60419h03_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.103.1/1">I wholeheartedly agree with the hon. Gentleman. All over Africa, and particularly in the DRC, there are millions of small arms, and that situation requires robust action by the international community. There are a number of things we can do. As well as the treaty, one of the ideas raised while we were there was the possibility of instituting air traffic control, which I know has been raised in the past. In Africa, there is very little air traffic control, which explains how arms get moved around. A fairly modest-sized project was proposed a few years ago by the UK Government, but it did not go ahead&mdash;it was quite a contentious issue at the time. I am not sure whether the Minister is in a position to comment on that, but one of the things we could do, besides the international treaty that the hon. Gentleman suggests, is look again at the possibility of establishing some means of air traffic control to monitor who is moving what around. At the moment, people can move weapons around pretty much with impunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/2">As well as physical solutions to the security problems in the DRC, we need political solutions. At the beginning of our visit, we were fortunate enough to meet Dr. Murigande, the Rwandan Foreign Minister, together with the Rwandan ambassador to the great lakes region. It is clear that Rwanda has had some success in encouraging some of the Interahamwe back to Rwanda. There is a package and some have semi-settled back in Rwanda peaceably, but that process has had limited success so far. Some people will not return to Rwanda because they will be brought to justice, and not necessarily through the Gachacha system. They may well be put in prison, so they are reluctant to go back, and often they are the most powerful people in those communities. Clearly, the UK Government, who are listened to very intently by all the Governments of the great lakes region, could have some influence in encouraging more diplomatic efforts to get all the people we can back to Rwanda. Not all of these people are Rwandans, of course&mdash;many may be recruited Congolese&mdash;so the problem is fairly opaque. Rwanda has been doing a great deal, it deserves to be commended, but there is a great deal more that we can all do.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/3">On a more specific level, I would like to mention briefly an ongoing problem with marginalised and abused children. My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield will speak a bit more about this. In an impoverished society, it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to look after children. There is a series of mechanisms by which people in the DRC simply reject their children, who are left to live in the street or in the forest, if they survive at all. There is a phenomenon that has received quite a lot of publicity in the UK press recently. In essence, where the unreconstructed aspects&mdash;if I can put it that way without being too pejorative&mdash;of the theology of some of the more evangelistic Churches comes into contact with people who are not able to afford their children, the children are accused of witchcraft or some such superstitious nonsense as a mechanism to explain problems in the family and the difficulties that beset extremely impoverished people&mdash;and as a means for people to divest themselves of a troublesome child.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/4">We met quite a large number of churchmen&mdash;they were all men, I think&mdash;and a fair number of them were using a rather odd qualifying argument. Not all of them made the argument, but enough did to make it quite worrying. They argued that the problem was not that there was witchcraft among children, but that sometimes the wrong children were accused of witchcraft. In other words, some of the churchmen were saying, &quot;We think that witchcraft exists among children but the problem is that far too many kids get accused of it when they just have psychological problems&quot;. That exacerbates the whole problem by bedding in and giving validity to the idea that such a phenomenon exists. There may be ways in which the Government and other agencies can encourage Churches, which in other modest but important ways operate extremely well&mdash;they provide social services and churches, schools and so forth&mdash;to look again at those practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/5">Those practices do exist, that argument is deployed and we came across it. The phenomenon is seen in the UK because some children from London have been sent back to the DRC and remain there. The UK embassy and the ambassador in the DRC have their eye on the problem, but there is little they can do except monitor it. However, it is important to raise it here and perhaps other agencies, including some of the Churches, will look again at the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/6">The UK Government, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for International Development, the Foreign Secretary and Members of all parties in this House, take a great interest in the role of education in the developing world. We had the opportunity to chat to President Kabila about the possibility of some kind of modest link between some schools in the DRC, probably in Kinshasa, and some in the UK. I think that it will be possible to facilitate that in one way or another. Mr. Andy Sparkes, the UK ambassador in Kinshasa, was very encouraging. I wonder whether it might be possible for the Minister to commend the idea of having a link-up because it would benefit kids in the UK as well as kids in the DRC, although it would be fairly modest and, of course, Francophone.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/7">The DRC is led by President Kabila at the head of an interim Government. Elections will take place soon. The UK Government, particularly through our ambassador to the country, Andy Sparkes, and through the Minister and others, have played an invaluable role in facilitating those elections. Not every party is taking part, although I think that most people will vote. It is a pity that it looks as though the Union for Democracy and Social Progress&mdash;a major opposition party with a good record in opposition under Mobutu&mdash;will not take part, but I think that many of the DRC's voters will take part in the elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/8">At one level, it is a little odd that Britain will soon be the largest donor to the DRC. We have no great history there&mdash;it is a Francophone country&mdash;but that is the way things are currently. Belgium and France could perhaps take more of a leading role. Who knows who will win the election? There must be a modest chance that President Kabila will win it. We got the impression on the trip that if he does, he will take an inclusive approach to choosing his Government and to governing, as opposed to a winner-takes-all mentality, which would send people straight back to the bush and alienate very talented people such as Vice-President Ruberwa and others whom he needs on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/9">Let me mention the groups that made the trip, which we found to be invaluable, possible. They include Oxfam, Christian Aid, Tearfund, the Rainforest Foundation, War Child, Save the Children and Amnesty International. All those organisations have hugely valuable programmes in the DRC. They help to support local non-governmental organisations and to build capacity among those NGOs, which will perhaps be their most important role in the longer term. In addition, our embassy in Kinshasa is doing a sterling job&mdash;a magnificent job. Andy Sparkes, Jo Gauld and their colleagues deserve recognition for that.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman give us the benefit of his experience of a recent visit to the DRC and tell us what he learned about the preparations for the June elections? Those elections are a vital precursor to further stability in the DRC. Did he learn how the European troops were to operate with the UN troops already in the country to ensure that there is at least a semblance of free and fair elections?</p>

	<p pid="a.105.1/1">That is a good point and that matter formed one of the main focuses of our visit. There is room for some optimism that there will be more or less effective elections across the DRC, although perhaps not to the standards of the UK. The position will be more difficult in rural areas. We were struck by how many people had their IDs to vote and by the apparent effectiveness with which MONUC is preparing. We had a lot of time with Bill Swing, Ross Mountain and a commander of a Pakistani battalion&mdash;one of the generals on the ground in the Bukavu area. They will give a lot of confidence to people, especially in more populated areas, that it will be safe to vote. No one is suggesting that there will be violence against those who vote. The militias are largely staying out of the process, so I think that there will be a pretty good turnout. Clearly, one has to put that in context. One can look at what happened in the early 1960s, but the forthcoming election will probably be the first real election in Congo at which there is pretty much universal suffrage.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/2">Let me mention Oona King, who founded the all-party group during her period in the House. It is largely because of her efforts that we are having this debate and the issue is being raised today on Sky television and &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; by the team that we took with us. Today's edition of <i>The Guardian </i>carries a good article on the issue. We also took Johann Hari of <i>The Independent </i>with us and that newspaper, too, is providing coverage.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/3">I believe that the interest in the DRC in Parliament&mdash; at this debate there has been a good turnout of hon. Members from both sides of the House&mdash;and the interest in the media presage a period when the country will step out of the shadows. Four million people have died there, but that figure comes from epidemiological surveys, not daily bombs, so the issue is less media-friendly. I cannot blame the media for that, but now, in the pre-election period, we have a chance to raise the profile of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We hope that the election will be successful, I look forward to hearing what the Minister and other hon. Members have to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">the hon. Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> both on his excellent speech, which I wholeheartedly endorse, and on the excellent way in which he chairs the all-party group. I, too, was a member of the group that went to the DRC. I should also like to add to his praise for the work done by Oona King, the former hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow. The fact that in 2003 the DRC did not feature at all in the top 10 recipients of UK aid but by 2004 was the second biggest recipient after India shows the success of Oona King's work in setting up the group and raising the profile of a part of the world whose profile certainly needs to be raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/2">Africa, for all its vibrancy, sometimes seems to prove the inverse of the saying, &quot;The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.&quot; One could say that in Africa the grass is always browner on the other side of the fence, because wherever one goes and whatever appalling poverty one finds, there always seems to be somewhere even worse off. One goes to a Nairobi slum, where children with HIV eat charcoal because they are so hungry, and one wonders what could be worse. Then one goes to the DRC. There, despite the street children, the begging and the hunger, security is so bad that poverty alleviation is barely on the agenda. People simply do not have the luxury of worrying about starving: they face the even more immediate danger of being raped or murdered as they sleep in their beds at night.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/3">On the all-party parliamentary group trip, we met villagers who slept in the tea plantations at night, terrified that if they slept under their own roof they would be attacked as they slept. In visiting Panzi hospital, to which the hon. Member for Falkirk referred, we visited what is perhaps the world's only specialist rape hospital, where hundreds of women wait for operations because of rapes that are often so bad that multiple operations are needed. I met a woman who witnessed militia kill her five children and husband and put their bodies into sacks. She was then raped by three men. I heard of a 22-year-old woman who was raped by seven soldiers, after which a gun was fired into her genitals. Remarkably she survived, although she needed six operations. Now, amazingly, she wants to become a nurse.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/4">With no justice system to speak of, rape in the DRC can barely be called a crime. It is more a weapon of mass destruction. It is the means by which militia know that they can destroy a village: if they rape the women, they destroy the slender fabric on which some of the poorest and most fragile communities in the world depend. The lesson of this terrible madness is simple. There can be no poverty alleviation without security, no AIDS drugs without security, no agricultural development without security and no democracy without security. But there is no security.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/5">The army, whose soldiers are supposed to be paid a meagre $10 a month, remains unpaid. The salaries are issued by the central bank and then lost in a giant river of corruption that has as many tributaries as the River Congo. Government soldiers therefore end up practising the rape and extortion that they are supposed to be stamping out. For example, four senior officers are currently being sought for various offences, including a lieutenant colonel who is being sought for the rape of a 14-year-old girl. The army is refusing to hand the officers over&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.107.3/1">The point about these terrible stories of rape and the atrocities that one encounters somewhere like the DRC is that, time after time, when one asks local people what they really want, the answer is very simple: they want to end the culture of impunity. That culture of impunity in the DRC started with the infamous article 15 of an earlier Kasai constitution, which encouraged people to d&eacute;brouiller, or manage for themselves. That was a kind of licence for people to look after themselves, whatever it involved. It continued through the Mobutu kleptocracy and has now spread like a cancer beyond looting and extortion to rape and murder.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/2">The international community has been generous in financial terms, but ultimately ineffective. Shamed by the blind eye that we turned to what happened under Mobutu because of the cold war, and doubly shamed by our inaction in the Rwandan genocide, we have since showered money on the DRC. Some $1.2 billion is spent annually financing the 17,000 UN troops in what is the most ambitious peacekeeping force in the UN's history. The DRC is now the top African recipient of UK aid. Soldiers from the Pakistani UN contingent, whom we met on the trip, were decent and brave, but they have a very limited mandate, and they often end up simply chasing the militia from one part of the country to another. That is a particularly sensitive issue in the Kivu region, where the Rwandan Hutu Interahamwe militia are being chased inland, further away from the border areas and, significantly, further away from Rwanda, to which everyone agrees they must return.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/3">The most that can be said of MONUC is that it has succeeded in stabilising the situation and has made elections possible. That should not be underestimated, but what happens after the elections will be crucial. The model has to be what happened in Sierra Leone, where the UN was prepared to stay for three years after the election and where it made a commitment to train the local army for a full 10 years. Sierra Leone is a tiny country compared with the DRC, so the price will be huge, but if we want to stop the rapes, the extortion and the regional instability that affects not just the DRC but Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, we have no alternative.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.0/1">During my hon. Friend's visit, was he able to gauge at all whether the UN stabilisation force has been effective at reducing the number of forced child recruits in the various rebel armies? Does he think that that problem has been tackled at all?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.108.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1859" speakername="Jeremy Hunt" colnum="108"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h03.htm#60419h03_spnew12">
	<p pid="a.108.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising an important point, to which I intend to return. The simple answer is that the UN has stabilised the situation, but we now have to persuade the child recruits who joined the militias to come back out of the bush, and determine whether the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process, under which the child recruits are demobilised and reintegrated back into the communities, is actually working. The international community seems to have devoted a lot of money to making that process happen, but when one actually looks at the DDR camps, there seems precious little evidence of that money on the ground, so he legitimately raises a concern about whether the policy is as effective as it should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/2">Returning to the issue of the UN force, we have to recognise that a UN peacekeeping force can only ever deal with the symptoms of a problem, not the cause. Attacking the causes of the problem will involve much more fundamental action, including an international arms trade treaty, referred to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>, and serious reform of the unpaid, untrained and undisciplined DRC army. We must consider whether some of the money spent on UN forces would be better spent on training that army. We must exert maximum pressure on the post-election regime to stamp out the corruption that filters off soldiers' salaries before they are received.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/3">Given our substantial influence in Rwanda, we can do much more to help facilitate the return of the estimated 10,000 Interahamwe militia members, who terrorised the population of the DRC in a desperate attempt to avoid repatriation. We need an internationally agreed repatriation corridor, complete with credible, publicised amnesties for the majority of militia members who had no part in the 1994 genocide.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/4">We all hope that the June elections come off successfully. Some 26 million people have registered to vote and there was overwhelming support for the new constitution. However, there are plenty of reasons for caution. Consider this: a Head of State gives in to pressure from the west for reform; he declares his country a multi-party state; the newspapers explode with new-found freedom; civil society, the military and politicians agree on a transition to democracy; nearly 400 political parties are formed. Am I talking about the DRC under Kabila in April 2006? No, that was Zaire under Mobutu in April 1990.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/5">When we see pictures of that old kleptocrat shaking hands with President Kennedy in the 1960s, we are reminded that Mobutu was as credible to the west then as Kabila is now. We wish President Kabila well, especially if he wins the election, but we urge him to recognise that, when the time comes, it will not be the acquisition of power but the courage to hand it over peacefully that will place him in Africa's pantheon of respected leaders.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/6">I conclude with a couple vignettes about the child soldiers whom I met in Congo. Rafiqu, aged 13, was driven by poverty to leave his family and join a militia called the Mudundu 40, a rebel group that later merged with the Mai-Mai militia. He learned how to use Kalashnikovs, mortars, M160s and rocket propelled grenades. In his three years as a rebel militia soldier, he was involved in four battles and he thinks he killed about 30 people. Four years later, he is undergoing rehabilitation in a camp run by the excellent organisation Save the Children.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/7">Sadiq, a 12-year-old, woke up to find that militia had stormed into his house and were raping his sister. They then abducted her. In a perverted twist of logic, he joined the same militia to see whether he could get her back. On one occasion, he remembers his commander telling him to execute 10 men, which he did. Now he is undergoing rehabilitation in a Save the Children camp, where he says that for the first time he is in a community with people who care about his future.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/8">Such children are starting their lives again. The DRC is starting its life again. It is not for us but for its people to solve their problems. However, when we find those all-too-rare people&mdash;whether they be former child soldiers, an about-to-be-elected President, people working in rape hospitals or young politicians in Kinshasa&mdash;with the vision, determination and courage to deal with the problems, we in the international community must do everything we can to give them the support that they need.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1859" name="Jeremy Hunt">the hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt)</phrase> for their valuable contributions and for the good humour with which they conducted themselves during our trip, which was very testing at times. I was grateful for their good humour and good nature throughout.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/2">I add my thanks to the UK ambassador Andy Sparkes and to Jo Gauld, who accompanied us and helped arrange our trip, and I pay tribute to the DFID team in Kinshasa and to our ambassador in Rwanda. I echo the comments made about my friend and former colleague Oona King, who founded our group seven years ago. At 7 pm tonight, &quot;Sky News&quot; will feature some of the people whom we visited, particularly those at Panzi hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/3">Hon. Members need no explanation of the situation in the DRC. During the past eight years, the wars and actions of armed groups have brought people there to their knees. Access for humanitarian groups is restricted by a lack of security outside the main cities. In a recent report, the International Crisis Group estimated that 4 million people had died in the previous eight years of conflict. That means that about 1,200 have died every day in their villages, in the tea plantations and the bush&mdash;out of the range of the lenses of the UK and general western media.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/4">We have seen a war waged through arms in the DRC, but now a second war is taking place, waged through HIV/AIDS. There is war also waged through the disruption of basic services and, as has been said, a culture of corruption at all levels, which means that soldiers who should be demilitarised are not paid. So they go back, take up arms and start the cycle of violence again.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/5">I should like to touch on the Panzi hospital, which my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman mentioned. I shall give some numbers that reflect what is happening in South Kivu province. Last year, the hospital treated 3,500 rape victims, 1,000 more than in 2004 and 50 per cent. up on the numbers treated the previous year. There is evidence from South Kivu that after the explosion and violence of 2004, things calmed and tailed off. However, things are escalating again.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/6">An estimated 10 women are raped there every day. As we heard, the rapes are carried out with violence&mdash;with the use of knives, bayonets or bullets. The victims are sent back to their communities as cripples and outcasts. We received a report entitled &quot;Women's Bodies as Battlefields&quot; from one of the non-governmental organisations in the DRC. It sums up better than any of us could how women are used in the ongoing war.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/7">The militias' aim is to degrade society by degrading women and its values. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that 45,000 women and girls have been victims of sexual violence in the DRC. The international community needs to ensure that each individual, hidden, private sexual tragedy becomes a collective and public human responsibility. One NGO worker told us, &quot;We do not want homes for raped women or orphanages for children born of rape. We want those women to go back to their villages and be reunited with their husbands and for their villages to take collective responsibility for them. We want those children to have the right to grow up and go to school like any other child and not to bear for the rest of their lives the stigma of the unfortunate way in which they were conceived.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/8">The women at Panzi have often been carried over non-existent roads&mdash;sometimes by their grandmothers, on piggyback&mdash;to seek treatment. My hon. Friend mentioned the incredible work done by Dr. Denis Mukaweye, who runs the hospital on a shoestring. I am glad to be able to tell the Minister that DFID is constructing a new building there. That is wonderful. It will mean that the women who are in for continuous operations will have to wait less time before they go back to their villages.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/9">We heard the story of a woman aged 72 who had been raped in front of her sons-in-law. She refused all treatment and chose to die, rather than return home to the shame that she felt had been visited on her and her family. We heard stories of women abducted by the Interahamwe, gang raped every night, left pregnant with their rapists' babies. How can a mother be taught to love a baby from a man who has used such terrible violence on her? Many girls know that they and their babies will be rejected and even killed if they return to their villages, so they are left with no choice but to stay in the camps. In all the conversations about the programme to disarm, demobilise and reintegrate soldiers, scant attention was paid to the fact that few of those young women, while not formal combatants, have been successfully demobilised and reintegrated. It is difficult to talk about these terrible stories, but it is important that our group visited such people. We heard the stories and saw what was happening. It is important that things are put on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.0/10">The children of the DRC have no social and legal protection. The social pathologies of the violence, abuse and rejection of children are generalised across its society and go unpunished. The sexual abuse and rape of children is widespread. We must be aware, and be wary of, just examining what hits the western papers and is trendy in the international aid community at any given point, whether that be children accused of witchcraft or child soldiers. Such problems are huge and endemic, but they also stem from the situation of children and their having no legal and social protection.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/1">As one of the joint chairs of the all-party group on street children, I, together with two colleagues, will visit the DRC later this year, once the elections have been held. Will my hon. Friend detail the dispersal that happens there? How much does it compound the whole problem and the difficulties in which children find themselves?</p>

	<p pid="a.111.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that useful question. Before we left for the DRC we had a briefing about the demobilisation and demilitarisation. In general, a series of armies travel with their women, children and families. They are sometimes transported thousands of miles to be demilitarised in one place and are then put back into a brigade in another place. I am unsure about the situation of children being demilitarised and demobilised, and I shall be interested to hear what he finds out.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/2">There is a problem of women sometimes being left thousands of miles away from their partners and ending up in new camps. We visited camp Saio in Bukavu. It is not like a military camp as we in the west would imagine one; there are bunches of chickens hanging around and cabbages growing, because people have no food or money. They live on $10 a month if they are lucky&mdash;if they receive it. While their men are away being demobilised those women and children have no money on which to survive. There are problems with the men and their families in the demobilisation campaign and the payment of their wages. As the hon. Member for South-West Surrey said, it is clear that the money simply is not getting through.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/3">One in five children in the DRC will die before their fifth birthday. We visited a Batwa pygmy village, where the children looked like they had chicken pox because they had so many spots on their heads. I asked what was wrong with one of the babies and the interpreter told me that I was looking at mosquito bites. The babies had so many bites because the mothers were sleeping out with them under the tea plantations every night, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned. We cannot imagine what it must be like to sleep in the rain with a tiny baby. Development or progress will happen only when such children and their parents have the security to sleep in their beds, when we can provide them with bed nets and when they can receive the education that they so desperately want.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/4">We visited Mbuji-Mayi in Katanga province, where three years ago it was estimated that 5,000 children were living on the streets. People are currently trying to ascertain how many street children there are in Mbuji-Mayi itself. Some 80 per cent. of them have been accused of witchcraft. We visited a centre run by Save the Children, which aims to reunite those children with their families, and to give them a roof over their heads, something to eat and somewhere to wash. Our first sight on arriving at the centre was of 40 naked boys. I took a picture, which I probably would not have been permitted to do had I been in the UK. It was one of the few moments of light relief&mdash;all these naughty boys squirting each other and dancing around for us in the puddles.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/5">It is important to put the accusations of witchcraft into the social and economic context in which they occur. There is no slack in families any more, because of the years of disruption caused by the war and the poverty of families. People are unable to feed the children. Some children have been tortured in order to be exorcised; they suffer all sorts of violence. We heard one story of a 16-year-old girl who was beaten to death by her father for being a witch. I was impressed by some of the leaflets that have been produced&mdash;I have copies, should colleagues like to look at them&mdash;which try to educate the local population that every family can suffer bad luck and unemployment and that a child who sleepwalks or who has epilepsy is a normal child, not a witch.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/6">I conclude with a few remarks about the hopes for the DRC. We all hope that the elections scheduled for early July will represent a new dawn, but they are unlikely to be either elegant or flawless. I hope that they will be good enough to convince the DRC's citizens and the international donors that the first step on the path to a better future has been taken. I want the UK Government to play an active political role in the great lakes region to ensure the repatriation of armed foreign groups, whether we are talking about the Lord's Resistance Army or Interahamwe. We also have a role to play in Kinshasa in ensuring better aid co-ordination between the many countries that offer goodwill and are working there to improve people's lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/7">Like the hon. Gentleman, I want the UN to remain in the DRC to provide long-term protection for the civilian population. We should extend the UN's mandate to training the FARDC, which is currently being done informally. I want it put on a formal footing. In addition, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> said, an international small arms treaty to end the traffic in small arms is vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/8">I want our Government to work with that of the DRC to end the culture of violence with impunity, to instigate rape laws to punish those who currently engage in sexual violence with complete impunity, and to work on the better management of resource exploitation through the mining code, the forestry code and western companies. The DRC needs to abolish the death penalty to give some comfort to the people who have committed such atrocities that they will at least be guaranteed the right to life. The new Government need to think carefully about the quick wins that they will have.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/9">I look forward to working with politicians in all parts of the House to ensure that the DRC is at the heart of all our parties' political policy development over the next 20 years, rather than just over the next 10 or five. I look forward to working with civil society and the Churches in the DRC to provide basic services and ensure that people can sleep in their beds at night.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">the hon. Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. No nation is more worthy of a debate in this House than the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The debate could not be more timely, given that we are approaching the first democratic elections there for 46 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.1/2">I do not think that there is any disagreement that the DRC has been dealt an appalling historical hand. The recent history of that part of Africa is among the most desperate of any region. The various conflicts that have so tragically gripped that huge nation for the past 10 years are without precedent or peer. Some 4 million people&mdash;more than the entire population of Wales&mdash;have perished during the various conflicts. More people have been killed in the conflicts in the DRC than in any other conflict since the second world war. Given carnage on that scale, one would think that the headlines would be screaming about what is happening in the DRC, yet the conflict goes relatively unnoticed and unreported, and still it continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.1/3">We have heard some harrowing details from members of the all-party group that visited the DRC recently. Children have been betrayed of their childhood by being forced to serve in the various militias. It is estimated that 300,000 children have served at one time in some of the competing militias, and children as young as seven have been forced to carry arms. We have learned that in parts of the east of the country children comprise as much as 40 per cent. of the militias.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.1/4">There is no point in going over the political history of the DRC. That depressing and sad tale is familiar to everyone in this Chamber: the brutal, extractive colonial regime, and the bizarre and disastrous Mobutu years, which were followed by the DRC being plunged into a de facto civil war. What is particularly reprehensible is the behaviour of some of the DRC's near neighbours, which for years have taken advantage of the perilous conditions in that country and intervened for purely selfish reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.1/5">The DRC has not even started to sort out its many difficulties and challenges, but the elections are the best chance that the country has to secure a reputable future and the stakes could not be higher. If it has successful elections, it could have a bright and rosy future. The DRC is the third largest county in Africa and the fourth most populous. It is endowed with fantastic natural resources and should be able to sustain not only itself but the whole central African region. It seems that, perversely, the DRC has suffered most grievously for being in possession of natural resources and wealth, as all manner of people, from colonial rulers to voracious neighbours and corrupt rulers, have sought to acquire some of its wealth for themselves. It is as if the DRC won some great natural lottery but has never been able to cash in the winning ticket.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.1/6">I visited the DRC last year, but not with the all-party group. I wish I had been able to join colleagues on that trip, as it sounded fascinating. I went with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy to Lubumbashi in Katanga province. Katanga province is at the heart of mining country, which was the engine that drove most of the DRC in the past 30 years. I visited the famous Jacobins mines, which were so famously looted by Mobutu, and saw the first signs of the green shoots of recovery. Foreign investment has started to go into Katanga, which means that some of the dilapidated mines are starting to roll back into production. I hope to see further progress when I visit again this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.1/7">I found people who were looking forward to a new democratic era with a great deal of excitement, but others who have been thoroughly disappointed in the political process over the past few decades. They have been let down by successive politicians and therefore feel great anxiety and apprehension about the next few months and years, but the Congolese have so much to gain from a new democratic republic. The DRC is at a crossroads: if the process is successful, it will have an opportunity to catalyse the whole of the greater region of central Africa, if not of the whole of the continent. Politically, a new DRC with a normal political life could assist the progress of democracy throughout central Africa. Economically, the reconstruction of a country that is bigger than western Europe and endowed with incredible natural resources and mineral wealth could serve as an indispensable engine to drive the whole of the central African region, if not the whole continent. Culturally, a dynamic and vibrant DRC, with its fantastic music and incredible and unique history and culture, situated as it is right at the heart of Africa&mdash;between north and south, east and west&mdash;could act as a catalyst for all of African culture, including arts, science and technology, and in all its diversity could communicate that to the rest of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.1/8">That is what is at stake for the DRC. Economically and culturally, it could start a new African renaissance. However, that is dependent on several factors. Probably the two most important are a fair and free election that is seen as such, and an end to the fighting and interventions from near neighbours. There is no doubt that the elections will be an immensely complex task for the new Independent Electoral Commission. The registration process alone has been tortuous, and the election timetable has rightly been delayed because of logistical and communication difficulties in assuring that everybody in that huge nation has been registered.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.1/9">As we heard from other speakers, the country has seen the usual political posturing before the election by some political protagonists. It is disappointing that some of the main contenders for the election have chosen not to register as presidential candidates and that there are fewer candidates registered for election to the legislature than there are seats in it. The latter may be the result of communications difficulties in that huge country, but, more seriously, it may show that some individuals and political parties are dangerously suspicious of the electoral process and of each other. I ask the Minister what he is doing further to engender confidence among the political parties and protagonists so that they can feel confident about participating in the election.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.1/10">The international community has been positively engaged in ensuring that the elections are conducted fairly and freely. As we have heard, the United Nations has its biggest deployment of resources in the DRC and has been instrumental in trying to persuade rival militias to lay down their arms and be repatriated to their home nations. Over the Easter recess, I was in New York and popped in to see some officials in the United Nations. The most obvious sign of its work in the Congo are the blue beret soldiers, but a swathe of activity in respect of relief, development issues and local economic regeneration goes on underneath the surface. I welcome the EU's decision to send the German-led European Union force to assist MONUC during the election. Will the Minister say something about British participation in that force and whether the UK Government will do everything possible to ensure that the mission is a success?</p>
	<p pid="a.113.1/11">I also welcome the new package from the Department for International Development. The UK may now be the biggest bilateral donor to the DRC. That is to be welcomed on both sides of the House, and I hope that the Government will be encouraged to do much more. Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether aid is getting through to the hardest pressed parts of the country and what the UK Government are doing to support the many NGOs that are active in that huge nation. During my visit to the DRC, particularly in Katanga and Lubumbashi, I noticed the almost total lack of civil society. Will the Minister say what we are doing to help to build capacity within civil society, as that will be crucial in the post-election period?</p>

	<p pid="a.115.1/1">Absolutely, Mr. Hancock. I shall conclude my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/2">What will the UK Government do to discourage near neighbours from becoming involved in skirmishes in the DRC? It is not as if we are without influence in the area, particularly in Uganda and the other Commonwealth nations. I urge the UK Government to do all that they can to encourage greater co-operation between all the partners in the central African lakes region, and to ensure that the shared ambitions and agenda for the area are addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/3">Most importantly, what are the UK Government doing to ensure that there will be free and fair elections, and will there be assistance in the post-election period? No election in Africa has gone uncontested by the losing opposition, so we have no right to expect that this one will be any different.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/4">Lastly, can we ensure that after the election it will be the Congolese who get their hands on the mineral wealth and the natural resources of their country? That will be very important&mdash;a key issue&mdash;as the DRC enters the post-election period.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Hancock, for the fair way in which you are chairing t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">his debate. I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> and for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1859" name="Jeremy Hunt">the hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt)</phrase> for the report of their harrowing experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/2">We must consider the history and the victims of the DRC. I believe that I am the only Member in this Chamber who has a substantial Congolese community in their constituency. The community that I have the honour to represent dates back to the 1960s, when Patrice Lumumba's family first arrived in the Finsbury park area of Islington. They have been there ever since, and there is a substantial Congolese community as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/3">A local church, St. Mellitus, and its excellent priest Father David Ardagh-Walter, actively work with the community. The church has services in Lingala and in many other ways gives wonderful support to distressed people in the community. I put on the record my appreciation of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/4">I have not had the good fortune to visit the DRC&mdash;I hope that I will in the not-too-distant future&mdash;although I have visited Rwanda and Angola. I had an experience that does not in any sense compare with that of my colleagues, but it involved an interesting point of history. I visited the Royal Museum of Central Africa in Brussels, which was constructed by Leopold. On one level, it is a bizarre and absurd folly, but at another level it shows the lunacy of the Belgian policy in the Congo from the mid-19th century onwards and the way in which Leopold manipulated the Congress of Berlin to get exactly what he wanted, which was the private ownership of the Congo. Human rights abuses have gone on ever since. Indeed, there were many reports of human rights abuses at the turn of the century. Roger Casement, a British diplomatic representative, exposed many of them. Sadly, he was later executed for his part in the Easter rising, but he is fondly remembered in Islington for his work in helping to bring about Irish independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/5">The intensity of media coverage of conflicts around the world is a distorting prism. It used to be said that a war was serious if it was happening, but that it was very serious if Kate Adie was there&mdash;it had to be taken notice of. We now have 24-hour news running on cable channels all over the world, but if I were to step outside this room, stop 10 people in the street and ask them where is the worst conflict in the world, they would talk about Iraq and Afghanistan, and perhaps Colombia; I would be very surprised if anybody mentioned the DRC, or, indeed, any conflict in Africa. I am not minimising the effect of those other conflicts, but at least 3 million people have died in recent years in the DRC. The deaths, violence and abductions continue. A first world war rate of slaughter is happening in one of the largest countries in Africa with the largest mineral resources available anywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/6">It is clear that the intrusion in DRC affairs by forces from Angola, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Uganda and several other countries over the years has not helped the situation, but made it made it much worse. The Lusaka accords allowed an opportunity to withdraw those forces, and in many cases the formal armies were withdrawn, but I am far from convinced that informal support is not being given to forces in eastern DRC by neighbouring countries and Governments. We should be very cautious about those countries' protestations of innocence.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/7">On immigration matters, Committee Room 14 hosted a meeting of hundreds of Congolese people who were terrified of being returned to DRC. I hope that the British Government will no longer return people to DRC, but recognise that the situation there is incredibly dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/8">Several speakers mentioned street children. Unless we do something to support street children&mdash;the victims of war&mdash;by giving them hope, education and housing, they will become the terror gangs, criminals and fighters of tomorrow. They know no other course.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/9">Finally, we must consider what the international mineral companies are doing and where coltan, diamonds, gold and all other minerals are coming from. The Congolese people see nothing of those minerals, neither their benefits nor their profits, but because of them, they see environmental destruction, conflict and the arming of illicit groups. There are people in this very city who have made an awful lot of money out of the death and destruction in DRC, and they, too, should be brought to book.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.0/1">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">the hon. Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> for securing this debate. I pay tribute also to his colleagues, the hon. Members for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) and for Wakefield (Mary Creagh), for describing during the first part of this debate their informative and moving journey to the heart of darkness.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/2">When the hon. Member for South-West Surrey talked about security being the root of all requirements for the people of the DRC, I wrote &quot;stability&quot; on a piece of paper in front of me. I shall discuss four strands of that stability, and it will be interesting to hear the Minister's comments on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/3">My first point is about political stability and the forthcoming elections. It is ironic that the country is called the Democratic Republic of Congo. The jury is emphatically out on whether it is democratic, and we shall no doubt find out in due course. Although elections are important and a precursor to achieving stability in most countries, they are not always a solution in themselves, as we have learned to our cost in Africa and elsewhere many times before. The elections are necessary, but I hope that we regard them as the start rather than the conclusion of a process. They are a milestone on a journey, but we should not assume that the elections in themselves will achieve the social outcomes that we want.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/4">My second point is about funding and the financial contribution of the international community. I n a spirit of bipartisanship, I pay tribute to the British Government for their general enlightened attitude to the DRC and other countries. Among advanced and prosperous western countries, through troops and other means, Britain is seen as taking a lead in putting in place aid and measures that support the stability of a country. I only urge the Government to continue to think imaginatively about how they can lead that process. I do not think that anybody present thinks that the solution to the ills of the DRC lies entirely in increasing the volume of aid that richer western European countries provide; none the less, using money intelligently and in places where it can have the maximum impact is important. The Government must continue to pursue that course.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/5">My third point is about the economy. I differ slightly from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on this matter. The DRC is blessed with a potential source of wealth. No country can succeed unless it is able to create prosperity for its citizens, so I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman that that the wealth must be structured so that it finds its way to the people of that country. However, international companies, including experts based in this city, have a role to play in ensuring that mineral resources and other infrastructure, including transport, are organised so that they can bring maximum benefit to the people of that country. Far from thinking that there is a potential conflict between western involvement and the prosperity of the Congolese, I think that there is potential for a harmonious synergy that would benefit them.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/6">My final point about the four strands of stability relates to civil structures. We have already heard from the hon. Members for Buckingham (John Bercow) and for Wakefield about the need to reduce the number of arms available in the DRC, to pay soldiers so that it is in their financial interest to remain attached rather than detached from formal structures, and to integrate militias formally into an overall national force, which is a difficult process. When creating those civil structures, it is essential to reduce corruption in the public and private sectors, so that people have confidence in the institutions that exist to serve them.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/7">In conclusion, on behalf of my party, I pay tribute to the Government for the work that they are doing and have done. I hope that the Minister can make further progress on the four areas that I have described this afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.0/1">I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">the hon. Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> on having raised a very important debate. The moving speeches made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1859" name="Jeremy Hunt">my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt)</phrase> and the hon. Members for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) and for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) have enabled us to understand the dramatic and traumatic effect that the horrendous conditions they witnessed had on them. We appreciate the way in which they were able to express that in the debate. Never having visited the DRC, I cannot replicate that, but I can bring something to this debate by putting some pressure on the Government and requesting information from the Minister. We look forward to what he has to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/2">When I started my preparation for this debate, I did as I always do and looked at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office country profile for the DRC. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The DRC is ranked near the bottom, 168 out of 177 countries, on the Human Development Index. All the socio-economic indicators are poor, made worse by the last 10 years of war. The education system is in a state of collapse, and the public health system is reportedly a disaster. In December 2002, donors pledged some US$2.5 billion for reconstruction.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/4">I shall return to that amount, because it is a huge figure. The profile continues with a description of what is happening today:</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The UK has been part of the international community's efforts to address basic humanitarian needs in the DRC. Britain has provided support for DDR (demobilisation, disarmament and re-integration) of the various armed groups and funded quick-start programmes to provide health and education to war-affected parts of the country. The UK increased its assistance to help rebuild the country to &pound;40 million pa in 2004/05 and 2005/06.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/6">That is a recognition by the Government of the dreadful state of that country.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/7">As a number of hon. Members have mentioned, the DRC is well endowed with minerals. It has diamonds&mdash;at one stage it was the fourth largest producer of industrial diamonds in the world&mdash;gold, coltan, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> mentioned, and cassiterite. Its forest cover is abundant and rich, if it is sustainably managed, and there are rich agricultural lands. However, as is true of so many other African countries, the DRC's economy needs to be managed properly and to start producing if its dependence on aid is to be reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/8">Surprisingly, I entirely endorse what the hon. Member for Islington, North said about exploitation. It is clear that there has been exploitation by the mining companies, in part because mining takes place in conflict areas. Much of what is produced is smuggled out of the country by the various militias, with not even a penny benefiting DRC's economy. However, exploitation has also taken place because DRC has not had the resources to police mining properly. All such problems require western aid, help and advice to be rectified. If the country could rectify those problems, it could start on the path to prosperity. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> mentioned, some foreign aid is beginning to flow into the country. We must ensure that that transition is sustainable and that it benefits the economy of DRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/9">One the tragic things that I learned in preparation for this debate&mdash;we have not heard much about it today&mdash;is that the habitat of lowland gorillas, which were never particularly numerous, is now so damaged that their number has been reduced to a mere 3,000. Human rights must always be paramount, but let us hope also that one of the things that comes out of the election is a reversal of that environmental damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/10">As has been said, the DRC is Africa's second largest economy south of the Sahara. It has 56 million people, 56 per cent. of whom are Christian. The DRC held a successful referendum in December 2005. If that is an indication of what might happen in the election in June 2006, it bodes well. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey said that 26 million people had already registered for those elections, which is a positive sign. If we can build on that by working with the 16,000 or so members of the UN peacekeeping force who are already in the country and encouraging the European Union not to place its 1,200 to 1,500 troops outside the country in case of an emergency, but instead put them inside the country to prevent potential abuses in the election, that would also be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/11">What else is to be done? The World Bank has produced a huge package of $2.9 billion of aid ahead of the elections, but with strings attached. The Opposition will vigorously hold the Government to account on how that aid is spent and what improvements it will bring. In too many African countries we spend millions of pounds in aid, yet the people are getting poorer. Gross domestic product in the DRC fell from $380 per person in 1960 to $115 per person in 2004, and 80 per cent. of the people still live on less than $1 a day. There is absolute evidence from other African countries that millions of dollars of aid are being put in, but people's standard of living is falling. Uganda is a case in point: in the past four years, the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day has increased from 30 per cent. of the population to 40 per cent., yet millions of pounds worth of aid has been put into the country. We have to get a bit clever about using aid&mdash;we must set specific targets and make further aid dependent on their being reached.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.0/1">Although we do not want to live in the past, is it not important that people should not enjoy impunity for offences committed in the past? On that principle, and in light of the fact that the alleged founder and leader of the Union of Congolese Patriots was arrested and transferred to the auspices of the International Criminal Court in March this year, does my hon. Friend agree that it is extremely important to send out a message that actions have consequences and that further referrals of Government and Opposition leaders in the DRC will therefore inevitably be required?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.120.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="120"  time="015:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h03.htm#60419h03_spnew26">
	<p pid="a.120.1/1">I was going to refer to the international arrest warrants that my hon. Friend mentions. It is extremely important that there is a good likelihood that those who have committed atrocities will be arrested and punished by the international authorities. We can learn from our experience in other parts of the world. Atrocities have clearly taken place on a massive scale in the DRC.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/2">I shall draw my remarks to a conclusion because I want to give the Minister plenty of time to tell us what the Government are going to do about the dreadful situation in the DRC, but I should like to concentrate on the elections for a moment. Let us hope that the 16,000 peacekeepers can be deployed to ensure free and fair elections. There is quite good press coverage in the DRC at present. Let us hope that the press can operate freely and fairly during the elections, so that we and the citizens of the DRC can be thoroughly informed of what is going on in them.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/3">Following the elections&mdash;which, as has been said, will be quite inclusive&mdash;the rule of law needs to be properly established. One of the worst things that that we have heard about during the debate is the treatment of children, not only their forcible recruitment into the various militias, but the lives of street children who have to live other than in their own homes at night and who can be picked up, taken to police stations and tortured there. There are many similar child-related issues&mdash;sorcery has already been mentioned. Perhaps the most tragic thing in the world is human rights abuses against children, because they are even more defenceless than some adults. All of us&mdash;particularly the Government through aid and the NGOs&mdash;have a great deal of work to do to help street children.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/4">One issue that has not been mentioned is the number of people in prison. Often, a prison sentence in the DRC is a death sentence. The prisons are overfull and people are there without proper trial. Following the elections, we will be looking for re-establishment of the rule of law, a proper justice system and a proper penal system.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/5">This has been an illuminating debate. The Government can do a great deal. Other colleagues have said that we should put pressure on the DRC's neighbours, Rwanda and Uganda, which are after all friends and allies of ours, to sort out their militias. That will not be easy, particularly given the situation in Uganda with the Lord's Resistance Army. However, I cannot understand why the world has stood by and let the Lord's Resistance Army operate in the way that it has, particularly with the recruitment of child soldiers. We look forward very much to what the Minister has to say about DRC. No doubt he will bring a great solution to that dreadfully afflicted country.</p>

	<p pid="a.121.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> on securing today's debate. I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss such an important topic, and I acknowledge the excellent contributions to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/2">I have only a limited amount of time, but I should like to welcome the all-party group's commitment to the great lakes region, its recent visit and the information that its members have shared today. I thank our former colleague Oona King for her work and acknowledge the thanks of hon. Members who participated in the recent visit for the work of our ambassador and staff in the DRC and Rwanda, including DFID staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/3">The Democratic Republic of Congo has reached a critical moment. Success or failure over the next few weeks and months will have a wide-reaching impact. The 60 million people of the DRC have suffered enough. They want to see an end to the years of autocratic rule, conflict and destruction. We have heard figures this afternoon, and I confirm that the Government fully appreciate the scale of the problems in the DRC. About 80 per cent. of the population live in abject poverty on less than $1 a day. The latest UN figures put the number of internally displaced people at 1.5 million&mdash;the result of continuing violence, mainly in the east. There is a long way to go before we can give the Congolese population the stable, secure and prosperous future that they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/4">What needs to be done? Free and fair elections will form the first step towards democratic and accountable government. Secondly, the new Government must be representative of the full range of Congolese interest groups and accountable to the people who elected them. All the key players should have a stake in the peace. Next, the new government will need to build a greater respect for human rights and the rule of law. Everyone here today will be aware of the terrible abuses that are occurring on a massive scale in the DRC. Many of those take place in the east, at the hands of armed groups, and frequently&mdash;something that the Government find particularly disturbing&mdash;of the Congolese army itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/5">As the elections draw nearer, the Government in the DRC are increasingly clamping down on freedom of expression. At the same time, we are seeing an unchecked rise in the volume of hate speech against certain ethnic groups. The new Government need to tackle all those abuses. As has been strongly demonstrated, the DRC badly needs a reliable, neutral, well trained and properly paid army. We are seeing the beginnings of a new army, but most soldiers are still unpaid, unfed, poorly equipped, and have not yet received effective long-term training.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/6">We obviously need to see an end to the high levels of corruption and the mismanagement of natural resources. Most of all, we need to sustain the huge amount of support and commitment from the international community that has been given in recent years, and we need to ensure that that continues after the elections. Let me say in response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> that we also need to ensure that the aid budget is spent effectively and that it benefits the people.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/7">The UK is working to support the DRC in developing a stable and prosperous future. Several speakers mentioned the hospital in Panzi, and I am pleased that through the Department of International Development a further &pound;440,000 will be provided over two years to help with infrastructure and the training of doctors.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/8">A number of hon. Members raised the issue of children accused of witchcraft. We agree that it is a disturbing phenomenon with real human rights implications. Last year, as part of the UK presidency, we led an initiative to raise awareness of the problem of so-called child witches in the DRC, and we will continue to work with civil society groups, established Churches and the Congolese Government to push for further action to address the problem. Through DFID and the British embassy, the UK contributes to programmes under UNICEF, Save the Children and other NGOs that aim to protect children. While on the subject of children, I commend the idea of a link-up project between schools in the DRC and in the UK, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/9">A key issue raised by hon. Members was the army. Primary responsibility rests with the DRC to provide a secure environment. Creating a new army after years of conflict is a huge task, and the FARDC consists of seven integrated brigades of troops from all factions. The UK offered &pound;3 million for basic life-needs support&mdash;things such as tents and water&mdash;to the newly integrated brigades and their families. That will help them to make ends meet and to stop them preying on the local population, but the assistance is offered on the condition that the Government ensure that the troops are paid.</p>

	Action Teams (Middlesbrough)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.124.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" speakername="Ashok Kumar" colnum="124"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h04.htm#60419h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.124.1/1">I record my sincere thanks to Mr. Speaker for granting me this debate. I have been trying to secure a debate for three or four months, and I am glad finally to have done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/2">I want to speak on an issue that is important to the estates that make up half of my Middlesbrough constituency. The actions plans are important to delivering the Government's programme of getting people off welfare and into work. A key part of such a programme, which has to be based on specialist work, is building confidence and giving self-esteem back to the families and communities that have suffered a history of unemployment. That approach has a particular relevance to communities such as those that I represent in Middlesbrough.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/3">I remember in the 1980s and 1990s knocking on doors in south Middlesbrough, a part of my constituency that suffered massive unemployment. It was a shock to the system to knock on every other door and find that no one was working, that everyone was unemployed. Whole families were jobless. We waited for a Labour Government. I am happy to say that, thanks to the present Government, we are now in a much better situation&mdash;it has completely changed. In my constituency, unemployment has dropped by 50 per cent. since 1997, and employment on Teesside is very different from what it was. Youth joblessness has more or less gone. Once upon a time, many left school on the Friday and signed on at the labour exchange on the Monday. I am happy to say that those days have gone.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/4">The policies that my colleagues and I in the Labour party championed have finally been implemented, and we are now seeing success, but the sheer impact of the dark years of the past still linger among those who lost valuable work skills during that time. As a result, intensive work is still needed in particular areas and social groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/5">Middlesbrough council has always been active in developing welfare for work and intermediate labour market schemes. Many of them are targeted on particular communities and estates in the town. One initiative was the setting up of the action team for jobs project. The programme is now five years old, and it is managed locally by Working Links. It was originally offered a contract by the Department for Work and Pensions worth some &pound;1.4 million a year. The contract is now in its third which runs from April 2004 to an extended expiry date of October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/6">The action team targets most of Middlesbrough's wards, including Coulby Newham, Hemlington, Marton, Ladgate, Nunthorpe, Park End, Stainton and Thornton, all of which I represent. Resident participation in the scheme is voluntary, and the majority of clients are accessed through outreach in a range of community venues such as shops, post offices, libraries and Sure Start centres. An estimated 30 per cent. of clients are incapacity benefit claimants, and more than 40 per cent. are ex-offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/7">Project support is tailor-made to individual needs, and there is no limit on the length of time that the action team may support an individual. The longest time an individual has been with the action team is 20 months. Consultants work with clients to alleviate barriers to employment by paying for site safety passports, driving lessons, specialist training, new clothing for interviews and travel costs. The Working Links action team for jobs currently employs in Middlesbrough eight case consultants, who recruit participants on to the programme and work one to one with clients, and a job search consultant, who works intensively with job-ready clients to place them into their desired appointments. Of the 1,214 clients involved with the action team across Middlesbrough, 554 were placed into employment&mdash;the target was 380 for the year&mdash;of whom 62 per cent. sustained full-time employment. That is an incredible record.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/8">I want to focus on a project in my constituency: Hemlington Works. As the name suggests, the project is geared towards helping jobless people in Hemlington, south Middlesbrough. The project helps people who face barriers such as economic and social isolation, low-skill levels, lack of work experience and low self-esteem and confidence. I had the honour of opening the Hemlington Works centre in April 2004. The project is a multi-agency partnership, funded by Jobcentre Plus and Middlesbrough council, which provides support through a range of providers to people seeking work in the Hemlington, Coulby Newham, and Stainton and Thornton areas. The main partners are Middlesbrough council, which provides the management; Working Links, which engages with incapacity benefit and income support claimants; and Jobcentre Plus, which provides advisors on disability and for lone parents. Other agencies that offer support include Connexions, the Shaw Trust, Pertemps, the Prince's Trust, Reed in Partnership and Community Campus.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/9">The project helps local residents to improve their chances of gaining employment. It is a working partnership that provides specialist knowledge to people of the estate, and offers a consistent and high-quality service to local men and women. So far, 150 of the 525 clients involved with the project have found sustainable employment beyond 13 weeks. That is a credible performance considering that the area bore the brunt of the devastation of the '80s and early '90s, and has high indices of illness and incapacity benefit claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/10">Hemlington Works is funded until March 2008. If the action team for jobs element goes in October, the project will carry on with the support of the council and other providers, but the Working Links action team is the key provider of work with income support clients and, crucially, incapacity benefit claimants. That is a key factor, given the new drive for people claiming that benefit to be diverted back into work, which is a priority for the Department for Work and Pensions and the Government. The loss of that service would be detrimental to employment and training provision as a whole, as only intensive, localised, personal and flexible support can work with such hard to reach and often alienated groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.0/1">As I was saying, areas such as Hemlington have received much help from the Government over the years, and that has been warmly welcomed by local people and by Middlesbrough council, but much of the funding comes as a part of a cocktail&mdash;that is, it comes from a variety of sources, including local authorities, national Government, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and the voluntary and community sectors. All parties to that funding have their own priorities and programmes and a recurring problem is that the different funding agencies often have different cut-off dates.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/2">I appreciate that the DWP, with other Departments, emphasises to project managers the importance of having good exit strategies, but I have to tell the Minister that in the context of a three-year programme, that can mean that local organisations are expected to prepare to wind up in an orderly fashion just as they are beginning to produce good results in the community. That is a feature common to many social regeneration programmes and it has been identified as a key weakness by many independent observers and social analysts.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/3">A recent study on urban regeneration programmes in England and Scotland by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an organisation that I admire, said that many local initiatives championed by sponsoring Ministries had a</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/4" class="indent">&quot;lack of common vision on which to build consensus and guide policy, and a short-term approach to regeneration policy and funding.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/5">The foundation also argued that capacity-building in local communities was a long-term process, and that although physical regeneration programmes can be accelerated, work with people and communities affected by a history of unemployment needed time.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/6">Finally, I have a concern about people working on the action team for jobs programme. Their contract has been extended until October. They are dedicated staff, and they have given a lot of their valuable time to make things work, but they need reassurances as much as their clients do. I am concerned that if no long-term extension to the programme is granted, they will seek employment elsewhere in the private or public sectors and in consequence bring the project to a premature end. They have done sterling work with a community that values that work, and with individuals and families who have clearly benefited personally from their intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/7">I hope that the Minister will take on board what I have said. I hope that she will reassure me that the need to keep the programme is recognised, and that she will give support to the action team for jobs in Middlesbrough, because many of my constituents strongly believe that it has done valuable work. It is thanks to the Labour Government that we have been able to achieve so much success.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.126.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" speakeroffice="The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform"  colnum="126"  time="016:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h04.htm#60419h04_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.126.1/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase> on securing the debate. I know of his concerns about the action team because he wrote to me recently about it. He works extremely hard and diligently in representing the interests of his constituents in Westminster, and I congratulate him on that, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/2">I agree entirely with the tribute that my hon. Friend paid to the work of action teams, both in his constituency and more widely. The action teams were a pilot programme that we started in 2000, and there are now 64 action teams around the country. They are focused in areas of particular deprivation and worklessness, and their strength is that they can engage in more innovative ways of reaching people, so that they can start discussing the possibilities of work with people who may not have sought that as an option for themselves. They can then work through and tackle the barriers that individuals face and help them into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/3">Through the action teams across the country, nearly 160,000 people have successfully been supported back into work. Some teams are run by Jobcentre Plus and some by private and voluntary sector providers, including Working Links, which is one of our key providers. We have looked at the performance of private and voluntary sector providers. It may interest my hon. Friend to hear that in the particular set of interventions that we are talking about, Jobcentre Plus teams tend to do better than some private and voluntary sector providers; that certainly interested me. Jobcentre Plus teams tend to be better at reaching out to those who are very distant from the labour market, whereas in an outcome-based contract, the private and voluntary sectors tend, on the whole, to go for those who are easier to reach, so that they can hit their target.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/4">That leaves us with a challenge as we think about the next phase of the work. On the whole, the action teams have been extremely successful. In the year up to February 2006&mdash;not the whole year, just 11 months&mdash;the action team in Middlesbrough outperformed its targets. It achieved 477 job entries against a target of 380. Its target for reaching those people who are distant from the labour market and would not be reached through the new deal programmes was 266. In fact, the action team reached 356 people. It is a good record, and I congratulate the action team on its work.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/5">We must set the context in which we are considering the future. When we established action teams, there was little activity or active labour market intervention with people other than those on the traditional new deal schemes, such as jobseeker's allowance. So the new deal for young people and the new deal 25-plus were up and running, and we were beginning to experiment with a new deal for lone parents, but there was little intervention with the incapacity benefit group and with the broader income support group, and there was no intervention with those who were not claiming any benefits but who were, nevertheless, out of work. Therefore, it was in that context that we established the action teams.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/6">Since the establishment of the action teams, we have created Jobcentre Plus, bringing together in one place the processes to claim benefit and the initial and continuing advice to support people back to work. It is an innovative second phase of our welfare reform programme. As this round of the action team programme comes to an end, we are thinking about the future in the context of a changed environment, with Jobcentre Plus starting to engage in a much more active way with people with whom, in the past, it would not have engaged. That includes people on income support, those who claim incapacity benefit, and those who do not work but do not claim any benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/7">The second change, of which my hon. Friend will be well aware, involves the proposals and propositions contained in the welfare reform Green Paper. Through pathways to work, which, by October, will be up and running in about one third of the country, we are beginning to engage actively with incapacity benefit claimants in the early stages of their lives on that benefit. It is one of the most effective labour market interventions attempted throughout the developed world to deal with that group of people who face incredible barriers and huge challenges in trying to return to the workplace. Through pathways to work, we have successfully ensured that 8 per cent. more people than ever before have come off incapacity benefit during the first six months of their lives on that benefit. This is a new innovative engagement with people on incapacity benefit that did not exist when action teams were first created.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/8">As my hon. Friend will know, we have plans to ensure that pathways to work are offered across the country by 2008. We have reprioritised our departmental budget and have secured an additional &pound;360 million to ensure that it can be offered to all new incapacity benefit claimants by 2008. Much of the work carried out initially by action teams will be encompassed by pathways to work. We have also decided that the next phase of the roll-out of pathways to work will not be done through Jobcentre Plus but through private and voluntary providers. It is such ground-breaking public policy that we want lots of innovation and the greater flexibility that the private and voluntary sector enjoy, which is not always present in statutory agencies. The private and voluntary sector is often better placed to get multi-agency working, which my hon. Friend talked about, on the ground. We want to experiment and to keep trying to discover what works so that we can build on that best practice as we roll out services to our clients who are on incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/9">I have had long discussions with Working Links and have absolutely no doubt that it will be active in the new market that we are creating to provide the services for people in local communities. There will be opportunities for Working Links to carry on doing much of the work it has been engaged in to date in places such as Middlesbrough and elsewhere. I had a meeting yesterday with Working Links in Wales about its work. It is very much action-team led at present, but it will develop in the broader context.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/10">I hope that my hon. Friend will take my next important point back to his constituency. There is a concept in the welfare reform Green Paper which is incredibly important in tackling worklessness in the much more constrained fiscal environment of the coming years. Throughout the country, under the Labour Government, there have been many new programmes and innovations involving training and skills deficits, worklessness and community regeneration in which access to a job is a vital and central ingredient.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/11">The &pound;100 million a year that goes into Bradford, for example, to tackle worklessness comes from the Department for Work and Pensions, the Learning and Skills Council through the Department for Education and Skills, local authorities, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister via the inner-city regeneration programmes, Europe and the regional development agencies. There is a huge range of funding streams, many of them targeted at the same group of people. As my hon. Friend rightly said, they have different time frames and slightly different objectives, but they are all trying to do the same thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/12">What is proposed in the welfare reform Green Paper will bring the separate funding agencies, the funding streams and the partners together as a consortium in a locality, starting in cities where worklessness is one of the most challenging problems. We will set them very simple outcome targets and shift away from a process-driven endeavour to an outcome-driven effort. I hope that they will then decide either to pool their budgets or at the very least align them and work together to achieve the objectives, which will give much greater flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/13">We have negotiated with the Treasury what is quite a breakthrough in the way in which we run the public finances: an agreement in principle&mdash;we have to work through the detail of it&mdash;that if a city or a locality is effective in getting more people into work and therefore cutting the benefit bill, some of the savings that the Government get can be reinvested in the city through further services. That will give Middlesbrough and other parts of the country a framework in which they can operate in a creative way, responsive to their local circumstances. It will enable them to tackle the very long-term and difficult worklessness that my hon. Friend, like most hon. Members, faces in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/14">Jobcentre Plus, the welfare reform Green Paper, pathways to work and the city strategy are informing how we look forward. At the same time, we are looking carefully at the lessons we have learned from the action teams, and we are taking things forward. For example, we know that outreach work is particularly important in respect of certain groups who might be very distant from the labour market&mdash;there might be cultural boundaries or third-generation worklessness in families, or there might be issues to do with low skills levels or poor English. Individuals face a range of barriers, and outreach is a key way of trying to start that initial engagement, which draws people into appropriate programmes to bring them closer to the workplace. We have understood that.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/15">Something else we have understood is the power of discretionary funding. My hon. Friend described the way it is used in Middlesbrough. Traditionally, many of the new deal programmes have been very process-driven. If we can get more discretion into the way in which we operate, we can build services around the needs of the individual in a much more direct and beneficial manner, and therefore get more effect for the money we spend, and help more people who are coming into work through that. We will take on board those lessons as we move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/16">We will continue to have an area-based approach, which is what the action team for jobs was all about. That clearly makes sense. We hope that that will grow through the city strategy, but until that strategy is in place across the country, we will take and pull together the money that went on the action teams for jobs and money that has been used for ethnic minority outreach work, for example, and for the working neighbourhood pilots&mdash;another area-based pilot that has been taking place across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/17">What we are thinking of then doing&mdash;my hon. Friend can reflect on this and write to me if he feels it makes sense in respect of his constituency&mdash;is leaving it to Jobcentre Plus at district level to determine how best to allocate those resources. We will concentrate the resources, probably on the 1,000 most deprived wards in the country, but we will leave the decision on how best to use that money to the Jobcentre Plus district manager.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/18">In some instances&mdash;this may be the case in Middlesbrough&mdash;the decision might be made to continue the work of the action team for jobs work which my hon. Friend believes is so effective. I hope that district managers will properly consult local representatives and other stakeholders, but allowing that discretion at local level is the beginning of the decentralisation in the use of resources that I want to see. That is the most effective way to have an impact, particularly in an environment of tight financial constraints.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/19">The sum that we are talking about is probably in the region of &pound;90 million over the two-year period. The resources are generous; we are not cutting the programme. We will just try to learn lessons, decentralise decision making, and then leave things for the local district managers to decide. What happens in Middlesbrough will not be my decision; it will be the district manager's decision. He is closer to the ground, and he will make more effective decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/20">I hope my hon. Friend agrees that what matters is not the programme itself; it is the work that that programme undertook. We want to maintain that and to learn from where it has been effective. It has been more effective in some areas than in others. We need to engage with those areas where it has been effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/21">The aim in respect of this very difficult group of people who have never really thought about work before is to reach out to them and to bring them into the labour market so that they can enhance their lives and contribute to the local and national economies. That is groundbreaking. Letting many flowers bloom in different areas is a good way of moving forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/22">We are determined to tackle worklessness. I know that that also underpins my hon. Friend's concerns about what happens in his area. We also want to ensure that, through the use of our resources, we provide greater opportunity for all. The right to work is as important as many other civil rights that we have all been pursuing in our various guises throughout our working lives. Work gives one not only the wherewithal to sustain oneself and one's family, but a network of friends. It also ensures that within a community and a circle, a person has status and purpose. That gives them a sense of value and contributes to the strong community that we know makes for a better Britain.</p>

	Special Needs (Somerset)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.131.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" speakername="Ian Liddell-Grainger" colnum="131"  time="016:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h05.htm#60419h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.131.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate, on a very sensitive and important issue that affects us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/2">The very term &quot;special needs&quot; places pupils and their parents in a separate category with labels all of their own, not all of which are complimentary. They are different&mdash;they did not mean to be different, but they are. People with special needs do not automatically slot into any mainstream. In the textbook of education, they are unfortunately classed as not normal, which is a harsh thing to say. Special needs covers a multiplicity of factors that can influence a child's schooling at all stages, levels and ages. Some children may be struggling to overcome dyslexia, as I am. Quite often, their home life is also strained in many ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/3">Disabilities of mind, body, behaviour, upbringing and spirit can all qualify for the strange status and mythical term &quot;special needs.&quot; Society, with commendable politeness, puts every person with special needs, including myself as a dyslexic, down as &quot;challenging people,&quot; which is a difficult term.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/4">In Somerset, we owe a great debt of gratitude to the dedication and professionalism of the men and women who run the county's education service, especially Jon Rose, who heads it, and Mike Turner, who looks after all special needs teaching. They are two exemplary people. Without their efforts, special&mdash;or, dare I say, challenging&mdash;people would require something extra from state schooling and could be considerably worse off. I have no gripe with the specialists and staff at the sharp end, but&mdash;there is always a &quot;but,&quot; as the Minister knows&mdash;I have a real concern about the financial decision making at local and national level. That is why I asked for this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/5">The town of Minehead in west Somerset is probably best known for Butlins&mdash;it has the largest Butlins&mdash;buckets and spades, normally in that order. However, for a resident of the town with a child who fits into the category of special needs, there is a wonderful facility available at the Minehead first school, an excellent school that has recently had a top-flight report. The question is, how long will the accountants allow it to stay? Rather like what is happening in the NHS to cash-strapped hospitals desperately trying to balance their books, the money for special needs seems to matter more than actually meeting the needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/6">Somerset county council plans to close six special needs units. When I say the county council, I mean the elected leadership. It is unfortunately a political plan. The people who will be left to make it work will do their utmost to stretch resources and to provide as much care as they can. If they fail, what transpires will lie squarely at the feet of the elected councillors.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/7">Minehead is not the only place that will be seriously affected by the new policy. However, it typifies the geographical layout, unfortunately, of much of the county of Somerset. I wonder whether the Minister has ever been to Minehead.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.3/1">The Minister shakes her head; I urge her to come, she would love it. I would supply her, if she likes, with good maps and a list of useful items that she should bring, such as buckets and spades. She should certainly look around the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/2">The point that I am trying to make is that Minehead is a long way down a meandering and overcrowded road. It is a long way from anywhere else. It is not easy to get to and public transport already leaves an enormous amount to be desired. The sheer distance between communities makes the provision of all educational needs much more arduous and extremely financially complex. If facilities in the six special needs units are withdrawn, the consequences are obvious: either the children will physically have to travel further, or the specialist staff that remain in the schools will have to make longer journeys instead. For society&mdash;for all of us&mdash;either course carries a high price.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/3">I am told that the proposed solution for Minehead will be a small specialist unit based within the area, possibly at our college or middle school, and the staff will have a remit to travel around the different schools in the area&mdash;to give the Chamber some idea of the scale, London fits easily into west Somerset&mdash;as a sort of flying squad of educational specialists. It sounds workable at first, I agree, but there will probably be only four specialists, who will all have to spend several hours a day simply getting about. The sums do not seem to add up. The time for being with each child will be more and more limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/4">I am concerned mainly as the Member of Parliament who represents west Somerset and Bridgwater, but I have always listened with great interest and reasoned care to organisations of parents who have children at special needs units in Somerset and who are trying to protect the existing services. I pay tribute to their determined stance. Let me quote briefly what they have written about the proposed change. They say:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/5" class="indent">&quot;It will undermine the educational opportunities of children, and take away an important element of communities. It will weaken the educational provision for children with special needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/6" class="indent">We are not against willingness to change, or value for money&mdash;we are against a half-baked plan being pushed through a half-baked process at great expense and without any sense of direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/7" class="indent">We oppose this plan because it is stupid and the work of a bully who refuses to engage with the communities she is undermining.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/8">Those are strong words from the parents of children with all manner of behavioural and other disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/9">The bully's name is Councillor Gloria Cawood, who holds the education brief for the county of Somerset. She has apparently accused the parents of self-interest, as though the provision of special needs was like building a new housing estate. She has not put it so brutally, but I think that she thinks that those people are nimbys in their crudest form. Politicians, we all know, do not always hit it off with pressure groups, but they ought to go out of their way to be careful when it comes to dealing with the parents of children with special needs. Such parents do not form a pressure group in ignorance. They are informed and well aware of how complex the issues are, and as they have to deal with children with special needs every single day of their lives&mdash;they live with them, they are their children&mdash;they understand the cost and, quite often, the pain. They are always the first to praise the professionals who help, without a shadow of a doubt.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/10">Mrs. Cawood has made some very influential enemies. I understand and accept that the Minister holds no responsibility for Somerset county council, but I hope that she will join me in wishing an early end to the misunderstandings that have arisen and a beginning to sensible discussion. Only by dialogue can the problems be resolved to the benefit of those children.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/11">Unfortunately, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase> cannot be in the Chamber because of other priorities in the House. However, he has been in contact with the group whose views I have just quoted. He told me that he has penned an open letter to the county council voicing his concern as the Member of Parliament for Taunton. I am delighted that he has finally got off the fence&mdash;rah, rah! I would have liked him to have made a contribution, but unfortunately he cannot. He does, however, realise the importance of helping the children at all levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/12">Perhaps it is because special needs span such a wide range of human difficulties that we politicians are guilty of trying to avoid the issues. The more we look at the subject, the bigger the problems seem to become, and, as the Minister knows, the more money they cost to tackle. Our system of distributing resources is seriously flawed. Governments of any persuasion provide cash to local education authorities and prefer not to be involved unless something goes badly wrong. We have all had experience of that in our constituencies. The fault is almost always somebody else's and unfortunately the buck never stops.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/13">The Minister will probably regale the Chamber with details of the generosity of her Administration. That is fine. bit I have little doubt that more money is still needed, not only for Somerset but throughout the whole nation, especially in rural areas, given the great distances and problems that they face. So many people choose to ignore or do not understand the issue of rural deprivation. Perhaps other counties argue their cases with more fervour and get a bigger slice of the available cake. I do not know, but surely more resources are needed for everybody&mdash;surely an issue as complex and sensitive as special needs deserves and should receive a more flexible approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/14">Right now about 90 children in Somerset are deemed to require such special needs help that the county has to export them to get it. Those 90 children go to neighbouring counties at Somerset's expense. However, the numbers are similar in most English counties; for example, Devon sends Somerset some of its own children and Somerset thus recoups precious cash. That is the norm. If special needs provision is to be left to the counties to administer, surely that is an odd manifestation of best practice. I am not saying that it should not happen, but I wonder why it does and would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/15">My investigations into this complicated area of policy have local and personal origins. Dyslexia runs in my family. I have two dyslexic daughters and I have made it my business to seek the best specialist advice available. As a parent, I have consulted Britain's foremost authorities on special needs. When I met one of the three most renowned experts in the country, of whom I believe the Minister is aware, I was very surprised to learn that none of those three had discussed special needs with any Minister; in fact, they have never been to the Department to talk about the overall picture of special needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/16">Given that Professors Ricky Richardson, David Skuse and Richard Kitney are among the three best brains in the country when it comes to assessing special needs and advising on treatment, that lack of contact is a serious oversight. I ask the Minister whether she would be prepared to extend an invitation to those three gentlemen so that she can talk to them about the future of special needs&mdash;not merely in relation to me or anyone else, but in relation to the whole country&mdash;to ascertain the best way to help special needs children. The children must always remain the priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.3/17">My purpose today has been to highlight the real concern in my constituency. It is the pressure on the country and the problems that lie ahead for professionals and parents alike that are the cause of my concern. I would be delighted to do what I can to help the Minister reach a decision on the best way to help children throughout the United Kingdom.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.134.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" speakername="Maria Eagle" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills"  colnum="134"  time="017:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h05.htm#60419h05_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.134.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" name="Ian Liddell-Grainger">the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger)</phrase> not only on obtaining the debate, which is on an important subject&mdash;especially so in his area at the moment&mdash;but also on the way in which he set out his concerns. I share his objective of securing better outcomes for children with special educational needs in Somerset, given that I used to be Minister for disabled people. I would prefer to call children with special educational needs disabled children, because they equate to that similar group.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/2">It is unfortunate that some recent debates on the subject were based on a fundamental misconception of Government policy, particularly in relation to special schools and special provisions. I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is categorically not the Government's policy to close special schools or to force children into mainstream education irrespective of their needs, their parents' wishes or of any support that they might receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/3">The hon. Gentleman mentioned politics, and I know that in some instances local decision makers have resorted to alleging that they are driven by pressure from elsewhere. When one looks at the legal powers, one can see that the argument is not sustainable. None the less, it can gain currency. It is not the Government's policy to have inclusion at all costs. However, it is our policy to ensure, when suitable, if the parents want it and if it is likely to help, that disabled children should have access to mainstream education in greater numbers than in the past, when it was too easily assumed that separation was best. As a consequence of such policies, many young disabled children did not receive the quality of education that they deserved, and it set them off in life with a disadvantage that was hard to overcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/4">Some argue that inclusion has gone too far. However, although the number of special schools has declined over recent years, the number of children taught in them has remained broadly constant at around 1.2 per cent. of the total school population. Everyone in the Chamber believes that it is the quality of the child's educational experience that is important, and not where they are taught. Children can thrive in different settings, even at different times of the day. There is nothing wrong with having specialist provision in a mainstream setting where, if suitable, children can switch between one and the other, but it depends on the individual needs of the children and the capacity of those settings to meet such needs. There is no dogma: we want what is best for children. The hon. Gentleman made it clear that that is what he seeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/5">Our policy, clearly stated in our long-term strategy document &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, is to build capacity across the system by encouraging local authorities to develop a continuum of provision through building the capacity of mainstream and special schools to cope with that range of needs, co-locating special and mainstream schools when sensible, and promoting collaboration between schools in order to share expertise.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/6">As has always been the case, changes will continue to be made to individual schools, both special and mainstream, in the light of local needs and demands. Local authorities and schools are best placed to respond to the needs of pupils within their area. It would not be sensible for me to spend my time sat at a desk in Whitehall making decisions about school reorganisations in Somerset or anywhere else. We do not want to return to that way of doing things.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/7">Thinking about what is best for children is what I assume is going on in Somerset. I assume that that is what is behind the plans for reorganisation in other places, too. I emphasise, however, that the Government's aim is to improve outcomes for disabled children; it is not to marginalise or ignore their needs, nor is it to use reorganisation as a way of making provision worse. Plans that emerge, although being locally determined, should demonstrably make improvements and should make things better for disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/8">The hon. Gentleman may well be aware that, from December this year, all public sector bodies, including local authorities and schools, will come under a duty to promote the equality of opportunity of disabled people generally, including disabled children. Proper chances at school will be a key part of those bodies being able to demonstrate that they are fulfilling that duty, which is being brought in under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/9">The hon. Gentleman suggested that I might talk about the great generosity of the Government in terms of increased funding. I am obviously extremely predictable; I was going to make brief mention of the fact that there has been a big increase in funding. There is no doubt about that. Certainly, between 1997&ndash;98 and 2003&ndash;04, there was a big increase in extra funding for special educational needs, both in per-pupil terms and overall through specific special grants. Between 2001&ndash;02 and 2005&ndash;06, the spend went from &pound;2.8 billion to &pound;4.1 billion, specifically in respect of special needs, and there has been an increase of &pound;360 million through special grants. Somerset has had its share of that; its increase is just slightly under the average.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/10">So there is no doubt that there has been more money, but in the current spending review there have also been additional opportunities through the &quot;building schools for the future&quot; programme, which is worth more than &pound;2 billion a year. That provides a stimulus and investment for local authorities so that they can transform the pattern of local provision for children with special educational needs and disabled children and put particular emphasis on co-locating mainstream and specialist provision for children with special educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/11">I hope that the suggestions being made in Somerset will lead to an improvement in outcomes for disabled children; that is what the authorities ought to aim to do. However, it is a matter for local decision. As is the case with the hon. Gentleman, my local council does not happen to be under the political control of the party of which I am a member, so there can be substantial debates locally about issues such as schools reorganisation. Of course I agree absolutely that we should listen to parent pressure groups because they really are the experts, and know on a day-to-day basis the precise impact on individual children of what can sometimes seem like bureaucratic and process-based changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/12">On the decision in Somerset, I think that the council has decided to make the changes. It has gone with option 3, I think, which will mean something to people in Somerset. It will now have to justify that, via the process of the school organisation committee, which has a decision-making capacity. If there is no consensus&mdash;it does not seem that there is, from what the hon. Gentleman said, and from what I have been told&mdash;the independent schools adjudicator will make the final decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/13">I hope that everybody concerned in the area will look to improve outcomes for the disabled children who will be affected and their parents. That has got to mean listening carefully to what parents have to say, although it does not necessarily mean acceding to everything that they suggest. In that respect, I endorse the hon. Gentleman's call for sensible discussion locally. That has got to be the next step, now that the council has decided what it wants to do on the basis of its various options. There has to be even more consultation and proper listening, so that parents feel a part of the process and that their concerns have been listened to, and if the council is to assuage their fears. They can then either agree with, or at least understand, what it is trying to do through the changes that it proposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/14">The hon. Gentleman suggested that the buck never stops, because central Government send money out and say, &quot;Don't ask us to make a decision. Here's the money. You sort it all out. We want these kinds of outcomes.&quot; I think that the buck does stop; it tends to stop in local elections. When the power to make such decisions is at a local level, it is clear where the accountability lies. I am sure that at some stage the local electorate will decide whether whatever emerges from the proposals for change has worked. That is as it should be; the decision should be with the local electorate. I am sure that at some stage the parents will be able to make their views known in a highly effective way that makes politicians listen.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.0/1">I do not disagree with the Minister. One problem, as she is aware, is that there is now a press blame game. The press are leading the agenda; they are pushing it forward. The Minister is right, but does she agree that we are talking about the most vulnerable parents, who do not have time to get involved in active politics because looking after the children for whom they are responsible&mdash;as we all are&mdash;takes up so much time on a day-to-day basis?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-19a.137.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" speakername="Maria Eagle" colnum="137"  time="017:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060419/halltext/60419h05.htm#60419h05_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.137.0/1">It sounds to me as though the parents are already involved in active politics, given that they have been seeing their local Members of Parliament from all parties and garnering support. That is my definition of some active involvement in local politics. As those who perhaps have more expertise, the parents would be listened to carefully by all local stakeholders. Some councillors and officials&mdash;I am not pointing fingers at particular people; I do not know any of them&mdash;may wish that the parents were a little quieter, but consultation and discussion locally is about listening as well as talking.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.0/2">Between all sides, the matter will have to be resolved and one hopes that that will be done in a way that satisfies the vast majority and that there will be consensus. Certainly the hon. Gentleman and I agree&mdash;I hope that many people in Somerset, including parents, also agree&mdash;that the outcomes have to be better for the disabled children receiving teaching and support in the units proposed for closure. My understanding is that a significant transition period is proposed between now and when the closures are due to come into force. That helps, but clearly those making the proposals will have to do more convincing for stakeholders to accept them fully.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.0/3">When I had a look at Somerset's reputation and its Ofsted reports, I saw that there were encouraging things to be said. I accept that Somerset's last Ofsted report was in January 2002 and so predates by some significant time the proposals that we are discussing. None the less, it is clear from the reports that there is some good practice and provision and that there are good arrangements to build on, which is encouraging. That must be a positive thing. We want better outcomes for all disabled children locally, but Somerset is not starting with a blank slate.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.0/4">The hon. Gentleman said that more money was needed for rural areas. I hope that I have convinced him that there is more money. It sounds to me as though what is needed now is good old-fashioned negotiations and discussions among all the parties. I am sure that he and hon. Members of other political persuasions will be involved in ensuring that that process is as successful as possible. I hope that, as a result, the decision that is implemented and the arrangements that are finally made will do better by the children in the units proposed for closure. That is the bottom line. In no way would the hon. Gentleman, the Government or anyone else in this Room endorse any changes that made things harder or worse for disabled children. We want improved outcomes. The policy of the Government and the extra money that has been sent down to localities such as Somerset are clearly aimed at improving outcomes. We have to aspire for all our children and we do. I am sure that many people in Somerset apart from the parents do just that as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.0/5">I note that the hon. Gentleman has family experience of dyslexia. He made points about experts who are around somewhere&mdash;in the Palace, as I understand it.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.1/1">The hon. Gentleman says that we are talking about a spectrum disorder and he knows better than I, because of his experience. Tackling spectrum disorders forms an important part of the Department's work in respect of moderate learning disability. We try to garner expertise and use it where we can.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/2">In that regard, I am happy for my officials and, if there is a sensible point to it, for me to meet the people that the hon. Gentleman suggests. We have some links at departmental level with those who deal with dyslexia&mdash;for example, the British Dyslexia Association, with which he might be familiar. We funded the production of its resource pack for schools called &quot;Achieving dyslexia friendly schools&quot;. Somerset is one of the better counties in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/3" class="indent">It being twenty-six minutes past Five o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the sitting lapsed, without Question put.</p>
