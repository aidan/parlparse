	<p pid="a.71.3/1">It is no bad thing to mention Leeds and Man United at the present time, and it was in that spirit that I chose to debate the Leeds contribution the UK economy. I welcome my colleagues, and our regional Minister, who serves our region brilliantly. I thank her for her work, and for attending today.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/2">I aim to spell out the huge contribution that Leeds makes not only to Leeds city and the regional economy, but to the UK economy as a whole, as that does not receive enough emphasis. I am known in the House and elsewhere for emphasising the poverty that still mars our city, and the statistics show that, sadly, Leeds is still in the top 10 of the most unequal cities in the country. It is still divided between those with the benefit of income, wealth, prosperity and property, while others-many of them in inner city areas such as my constituency-lose out on good jobs, good housing and quality of life chances for themselves and their families. I am certainly not complacent about the needs of my neighbourhood and of people in Leeds. Every job lost means that we must work hard to obtain another to take people into the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/3">My impetus for today's debate was a former colleague's comment. Boris Johnson is now the Mayor of London, and last October he was reported to have said in a keynote speech in London:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/4" class="indent">&quot;No disrespect to Manchester&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/5">Obviously he thinks that Manchester is important-</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/6" class="indent">&quot;but if you want to stimulate the Manchester economy-and Leeds and Newcastle-you invest in London.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/7">I say with no disrespect to Manchester, &quot;No Boris, you are completely wrong. You invest in Leeds to ensure that London and the UK economy thrives.&quot; We turn it round.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.71.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" speakername="John Battle" colnum="71"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0001.htm#10012062000372">
	<p pid="a.71.5/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman, who is absolutely right. Leeds's role as a financial centre is vital, and we must remain connected, and link the country together economically, metaphysically and through transport links. If we do not have a high-speed link to London, that will jeopardise not only the Leeds economy, but the UK economy. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the spirit in which he made his intervention, particularly as I may have been interpreted as being anti-London, which I am not. However, the contribution of Leeds as a whole must be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/2">Leeds's great economic strengths lie in its economic diversity and adaptability over the years. The hard work and ingenuity of the people who live and work in Leeds blend past manufacturing and production with enterprise and commerce. That blending is unique, and I shall refer briefly to historical tradition, the story of Leeds, and the current statistics, but I also want to press the case for Leeds to continue as an economic powerhouse. We need a stronger future focus on skills and training for the 21st century and better public transport, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" name="Andrew Pelling">the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling)</phrase> said-and I am sure that we all agree with his comment-to link us to the rest of Britain. Crucially, we need the high-speed rail link. Without Government intervention in those two vital infrastructure areas, Leeds's continued growth will be held back during the 21st century, as will the UK's prospects.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/3">Some of my colleagues are historians and know the story of Leeds. They may want to slip out for a coffee break because they have regularly heard me speak about its history. Leeds has a long tradition of regenerating itself from within since the Romans crossed the ford on the river Aire, and the Venerable Bede mentioned the market town of Leeds and the little hamlet. Henry VIII's chaplain, John Leland, referred to the Leeds market on the bridge. It was a centre for trade and commerce in the region throughout the ages, and the city was built up around that bridge with various industries and trades. The root of Leeds's economy is in my constituency in the great Cistercian abbey of Kirkstall, which was built in the 12th century.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.5/4">The abbey had a huge sheep farm, and a fulling mill, and employed the whole neighbourhood in wool production, from shearing to drying. It developed smelting, forging, tanning, weaving and pottery making. The template was set for a diverse economy, and over 400 years Leeds developed into the textile centre of Britain, linked to the continental cloth markets. It was recognised in places such as Florence, Italy, France, Belgium and Holland as the place for commerce and trade in the textile industry.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.72.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20b.72.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.72.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" speakername="John Battle" colnum="72"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0001.htm#10012062000374">
	<p pid="a.72.1/1">I am tempted to say that debates on diversity and multiculturalism must stretch as far as places such as Rothwell, Garforth and Pudsey-places that were independent, and some of which were named in the Domesday Book before Leeds. Elmet was certainly there first, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1570" name="Colin Burgon">the Member for Elmet (Colin Burgon)</phrase> is here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/2">The notion that Leeds can blend a collection of urban villages around itself and could build on those strengths since its organisation into a metropolitan district is significant, because it adds range to that diversity of industries. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Leeds moved away from wool textiles, which shifted to Bradford. It then became a centre of engineering excellence with great names, such as John Marshall, Benjamin Gott, John Barran, Matthew Murray and Blenkinsop. The rail industry, and locomotives were also important. The textile industry grew up with new manufacturing, and Armley Mills in west Leeds was the largest factory in the whole world. With that shift to become an engineering centre of excellence, Leeds produced hundreds of engines and trains that are still seen throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/3">In 1892, Leeds had 900 factories and workshops, and was the workshop of Britain. The names of the great industrialists and engineers are on the walls of the town hall and the civic hall in Leeds. Leeds's great tradition involved not just production, but the trade link of commerce. In the 1890s, <i>Leeds Illustrated</i> said that it was in trade that Leeds began to shine, and that it was a town of a hundred different trades making everything from shoes to machinery, from furniture to Yorkshire Relish.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/4">That diversity involved not just making, but trading. As we moved towards the turn of the 20th century, Leeds became known as the city of 1,000 firms. It had moved on from wool, textiles and engineering to the great diversity of a production economy. It was characterised as one of the most diverse economies in the world. It was not dependent on a single industry, company or mine, but was involved in textiles, clothing, engineering, printing, production of chemicals and toiletries, and financial services. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central referred to financial services. Price Waterhouse was founded in Leeds in 1865, so there was a tradition of financial services even in those early days. In 1911, printing employed more than 8,000 local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/5">On the diverse economic base of a self-made city, small and medium-sized firms grew up locally. Leeds became a regional centre of business, and thrived on the interaction between diverse industries and firms, which enabled Leeds to develop new ideas, to be innovative and to move forward, providing employment not only for the city, but for the whole region. As we moved into the 20th century, Leeds had a strong manufacturing and production base, and a long tradition of commercial activity. It had a thriving economy of its own, but it was the hub of a wider regional economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/6">By the time I was born in 1951, Leeds was a city of 5,000 firms. Today, it is a city of 29,000 firms, many of which are small and medium-sized, but that illustrates its energy for innovation and regeneration. In the '70s, there was a shift from manufacturing to services in both the public and private sectors. The universities developed-the huge Leeds university and Leeds Metropolitan university-as did hospitals such as St. James's university teaching hospital. Local government developed with that reorganisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/7">In the mid-20th century, there was a shift from manufacturing to retail and the great stores. Indeed, the whole notion of town centres, high streets and shopping was not too far removed from Leeds. The first great general store in the UK was Leeds Industrial Co-operative Society in 1893. Marks and Spencer grew from the business of Michael Marks who, as everybody knows, had a penny bazaar in the market. Clothing was produced by Burton and Hepworth.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/8">When I served as a councillor in the '80s, I worked on the economy of Leeds and on economic and employment development, and I remember a very significant figure. Between 1977 and 1987, 17,500 jobs were lost in manufacturing, particularly in the traditional engineering sector. At the same time, 17,500 new jobs were created in the service sector for both public and private professional services. Banking, accountancy firms and lawyers moved into the city at that time, but there was a shift from the inventive skills of 19th-century engineers to the flair of retail and business services. Creeping through at the end of the 20th century, we find the new science, technology and creative industries of the digital age based in Leeds, as the city transforms itself, quietly, as if within a chrysalis, to move into the 21st century. Today's city of 29,000 firms is still a diverse, permanently changing economic base.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/9">Such diversity enabled Leeds to avoid the worst of the depression of the '30s. There was economic intervention to help people in Leeds. The unemployed were asked to build the civic hall as a job project, and to invest in public buildings. Because of its diversity, Leeds survived the worst of that depression. That was also true in the '80s through the local council's intervention and focus on job generation. I will return to that issue shortly. Diversity has helped Leeds to survive, but it does not happen by accident. The city needs support, encouragement, fostering and investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/10">In 1893, the Leeds chamber of commerce in its annual report recognised the</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/11" class="indent">&quot;good fortune of Leeds in having an economy based on a diversity of manufacturing and commercial activity.&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/12">Its editorial suggested that by keeping the two activities together, Leeds would thrive. That is the city's real strength.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/13">Today, Leeds is a city of over 775,000 people, and it is the fastest growing city in the country. It is not an ageing city; young people are moving into Leeds, and it is increasingly seen as a young city. The average age in Leeds is dropping, which is good news, because the ideas will remain. Leeds is halfway between London and Edinburgh, and is situated between Hull and Liverpool. If someone puts a dot on the map and says that they want to relocate Parliament because the River Thames is starting to flood, they could not find a better centre of Britain in which to do that than Leeds, but I shall not go down that route.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/14">At present, Leeds employs 445,000 people in local manufacturing, commercial and public services. Every day, 100,000 people from the wider region of Bradford, Wakefield, Dewsbury, Halifax, Harrogate and York come into to Leeds, and every evening, 100,000 people leave. Their work is in Leeds, which acts as a giant economic lung, breathing in the work of the people from roundabout. It is still the third largest manufacturing centre in the UK, the UK's largest provincial printing sector and the second largest financial sector. It has 90 private legal practices and 12 head offices. Five FTSE 350 companies are based in Leeds, including companies such as Northern Foods and Asda. Yesterday, Asda sent me an unsolicited note to say that its contribution to the UK economy is &#163;13 billion per year-0.9 per cent. of gross domestic product. Of course, Asda's great operations are not only in Leeds, but it shows that some of the top companies are now based there.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/15">Leeds employs 105,000 people in high-value, knowledge-based intensive industries of the future, which is good news. It also employs 29,000 people in the digital and media industry, which means that Leeds has that strength for the new computer age of the internet and new communications, and it is well positioned for the 21st century. Contributions to the UK economy are now measured in gross value added, rather than the old GDP. Latest estimates put the GVA figures for Leeds at &#163;17 million, but once we add in the goods and services that the Leeds economy pulls in from the wider region, it is estimated that Leeds contributes over 1.5 per cent. of the country's GVA. It makes a larger impact economically than just that made by the local people. Bringing people into the city brings dynamism to the economy, not only for the region but for the country as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/16">Per head of population, GVA was &#163;22,387 in 2007, which is 112 per cent. of the UK average, and 134 per cent. of the regional average. Leeds was the only area in Britain where GVA per head was higher than the national average. In other words, Leeds really does punch above its weight. The economic impact of the city means that its economic footprint-that is the phrase-goes far beyond the administrative boundary of the Leeds district and includes Rothwell, Pudsey, Garforth and other areas of the city. That has been recognised recently by Government in the City Region project, which works on things such as the Aire valley project, and which will generate another 27,000 jobs over the next 10 to 15 years. That has been recognised by the Government and the Yorkshire development agency, but I wonder whether the economic impact is being fully backed up.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/17">I want to stress that Leeds is in a strong position and is expected to generate 34 per cent. of the region's future employment within the next decade. That was spelled out this week in a report published by Centre for Cities, which undertook research analysis of the economic performance of 64 English towns and cities and the outlook for 2010. The report stated that in 2008, 62 per cent. of jobs in England were in cities and 39 per cent. of those were in just five cities-London, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool and Leeds. Of England's high-skilled workers, 62 per cent. are in those cities, which is a 40 per cent. concentration in top cities such as Leeds. In other words, the report recognised Leeds as one of the country's top economic powerhouses, well placed to thrive as the UK emerges from the recession. It will be one of the big hitters that will make a difference to whether there is a strong sustainable recovery, or whether we have a so-called double-dip recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/18">I would like to quote from this week's <i>Yorkshire Post</i><i>, </i>which mentioned the Centre for Cities report that underlined the role of Leeds as an economic driver. The chief economist of Yorkshire Forward, Patrick Bowes, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/19" class="indent">&quot;We welcome the news that Leeds is among those cities expected to drive the UK's economy out of the recession as we believe that Leeds is central to helping the region move quickly out of recession.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/20">I could not agree more, but I would say that Leeds is central to the UK as a whole. Interestingly, the Centre for Cities report focused on two points-the need to boost local skills and the need to improve local public transport links. Those are the two key areas that now need underpinning in the Leeds economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/21">I will briefly touch on skills and training. As I have mentioned, Leeds has a tradition of practical intervention-what we would now call &quot;fiscal stimulus&quot;-to make sure that it does not sink during a recession. I mentioned the building of the civic hall; during the '80s-in the face of the recession, cuts under Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Government, and radical reductions year on year in public investment in the local authority-we had a visionary leader, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase>, who cannot be with us this morning. He understood that we needed to produce programmes for skills training to ensure that people were not left behind.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.1/22">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> is present; he worked with the next leader of the council, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1627" name="Jon Trickett">the Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)</phrase>, who built up the partnership to see whether the public and private sectors in Leeds could work together. That was innovative work at the time. There was intervention to develop skills, and to build public-private partnerships, to ensure that the diverse economy of Leeds survived.</p>

We should not confuse London, the great metropolis, with the City of London. It is the neo-liberal policies that we have unfortunately fallen into the trap of following so enthusiastically that have done so much damage, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1570" name="Colin Burgon">the Member for Elmet (Colin Burgon)</phrase> made clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/3">I said that I did not want to lower the tone too much, and I do not think it is lowering the tone to refer to Leeds city council under its present management. Coincidentally, it is meeting this afternoon, and I thought I would avail myself of the agenda, to see what issues it is pondering at this important time. I am sure that as usual the Leeds Members will receive a letter from the chief executive informing us of the resolutions that bring us back into line. Some important issues are being discussed, and one of them relates to &#163;7 billion of public expenditure in Leeds, of which &#163;2.6 billion is spent by the city council, and the rest by the health service, the universities and the whole range of services. A motion calls for more democracy in the control of those moneys. That is probably a fair call. We could indeed make a start on more democracy by having the largest party on the council taking control of it. That would be a good step away from its present problematic leadership. People in the business community have told me that the Tweedledee-Tweedledum leadership arrangement in Leeds does the city no good at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/4">Another motion congratulates the Leeds Labour MPs, quite correctly, on their support for the Leeds arena. We all welcome the fact that nearly &#163;10 million has been approved for expenditure on that. It will boost the city and is long overdue.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Elmet has already referred to the green economy; I am being totally non-partisan in my approach to that matter, because the motion that most attracts my attention has been put forward by a member from a different, minority party on the council, and it calls for it to accelerate the rate at which the city cuts its carbon dioxide emissions. Leeds as a whole now emits about 6 million tonnes of carbon a year, and the motion calls for a 10 per cent. annual cut in that. That would be an enormous stimulus to the economy of Leeds. I hope we shall receive a letter from Leeds city council telling us that that is the policy approach we should adopt.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.4/6">Cutting CO2 emissions always seems a great burden, but in fact it is a great generator of jobs, and Leeds is well placed to capitalise on that. Even if, as we have heard, our manufacturing sector has diminished over the years, it still employs about 40,000 people-10 per cent. of the work force. Many of those people are in engineering. We have already heard about the hoped-for boom in offshore wind in the North sea, off the Humber, and I am sure there will be other marine technologies. That is where the RDA can step in and make a big difference. We need those turbines to be manufactured in the UK, but so far all the press coverage of that great bonanza suggests that many of the jobs will go to Germany and Denmark.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.84.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" speakername="Paul Truswell" colnum="84"  time="010:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0003.htm#10012062000393">
	<p pid="a.84.0/1">I congratulate my constituency neighbour, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" name="John Battle">the Member for Leeds, West (John Battle)</phrase>, on securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">To a great extent, I shall follow what was said by my great friend, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1570" name="Colin Burgon">the Member for Elmet (Colin Burgon)</phrase>. The pair of us sometimes feel as though we have been consigned to the Jurassic Park wing of new Labour-<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i>-and perhaps my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1722" name="Colin Challen">the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">When my right hon. Friend secured this debate, I looked at the answers to some of the parliamentary questions that he had tabled. I realise that by its very nature, this is a wide-ranging debate, but I shall focus on a statistic in one of those answers to which reference has already been made. It is that 43,000 people in Leeds are employed in manufacturing. It sounds like a large number; indeed it is. However, for a city such as Leeds, with a proud manufacturing tradition-as was mentioned by my right hon. Friend and others, it includes tailoring, textiles, light and heavy engineering, and printing and pottery; a whole raft of manufacturing trades-it is an indictment of the untrammelled market forces and neo-liberal economics that have gripped the UK, sometimes by the throat, over the past 30 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4">I may be genetically programmed to support manufacturing and to recoil at such statistics. In one way or another, the whole of my family have been employed in manufacturing. My father worked in a dirty little foundry as a moulder and core-maker. When I visited it as a child, the place seemed like something from Dante's &quot;Inferno&quot;. I do not look back on that through rose-tinted spectacles.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/5">We hardly need rehearse at length how global recessions in the early 1980s and 1990s, compounded by Tory slash-and-burn policies, dramatically undermined our manufacturing base. One of the worst problems was the self-induced disaster of the early 1980s, inspired by the tragic and dogmatic monetarist experiment when Margaret Thatcher was seduced by the siren calls of von Hayek and Milton Friedman. It is often said, I think rightly, that between them they did more damage to the British manufacturing base than the Luftwaffe.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/6">It was not only bloated and inefficient industries and companies that were destroyed by that failed monetarist experiment. Many fell victim to the triple pincer of high exchange rates, which made exports prohibitively expensive, high interest rates that made investment extremely difficult, and cuts in public spending that effectively destroyed demand in the economy. The Tories removed not only the fat, but the vital organs-and even the soul-of manufacturing industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/7">To my mind, it was refreshing that the Labour party in Government was able until recently to point out the callous economic crime that had been perpetrated against our communities. From the lessons learned, the party was able to justify the reflationary package rightly embraced by the Government. As a result, many of us, including my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet, got the wind in our sails and were able to go out and sell it to our electors.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/8">Why should we now be changing tack? Is it because the vacuum left by the reduction of our manufacturing industry has, as we have been told, been filled by the financial services sector, which has its own set of rules and imperatives to which we now feel obliged to genuflect? I hope that that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/9">I do not decry other sectors, but I wish to concentrate on manufacturing for a moment. My hon. Friends the Members for Elmet and for Morley and Rothwell cannot be caricatured as languishing in the past by harking back. My constituency still shows the vital relevance of manufacturing. I shall mention a handful of companies. Each, in its own way, is a UK, if not world, leader. There are others, but time prevents me from mentioning more.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/10">ATB Morley, which was visited on Monday by my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West, was established in 1897. It produces sparkless motors for use underground in various mining industries across the world. It is a world leader. Last year, the company was given the Queen's award for international trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/11">A. W. Hainsworth, which was founded in 1783 and is one of the few textile companies remaining in my constituency, is still in the hands of the same family. It manufactures specialist fabrics, including flame-resistant fabric for firefighters' uniforms and baize for billiard tables; it weaves the cloth for the Woolsack-part of the furnishings in the other place; and its uniforms graced the field at Waterloo. Its most recent innovation is the wool coffin. Some have made the pun about &quot;resting in fleece&quot;. The wool coffin has been embraced by the funeral industry, not only in the UK but across the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/12">Airedale International is the largest UK manufacturer of chillers and computer room equipment in the UK. It may not be the cheapest, but because of its durability, it provides value-for-money kit-something that the Government ought to take into account in their procurement policy. We should focus not only on the bottom line but on the value for money that we could often get from UK manufactured equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/13">Those firms, the majority of them with long histories, do not want special treatment or featherbedding. However, it is not sufficient to pat them on the head and congratulate them on their resilience and innovation. My right hon. Friend was right to point out that they need the Government and their agencies not only to ride to their assistance in difficult times but to identify their value and to provide them with the support and expertise that they need to continue to prosper in difficult circumstances and beyond. For example, we should ensure that they can benefit from events such as the 2012 Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/14">As my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell rightly said, we need to assist those industries to expand in order to meet the green agenda. Several of those companies have started to meet that agenda and have the capacity to do even more. However, we need to remove some of the bureaucratic obstacles that they have to surmount. For example, Leeds and Bradford Boiler Company is the exclusive manufacturing partner for a new process called resomation, a more environmentally friendly alternative to cremation. That is my second mention of death and burial. Perhaps I have an obsession with them. It was Benjamin Franklin who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/15" class="indent">&quot;In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/16">Obviously, the death part provides some commercial opportunities. Leeds and Bradford Boiler Company has been waiting 18 months for the Ministry of Justice to approve the process for use in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/17">As my right hon. Friend rightly said, we need to provide support through training and skills, to assist manufacturing industry to get away from the greasy rag image and to promote manufacturing to young people who have left school or university.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/18">I am aware of the time, so I will conclude by saying that I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister can give us an assurance that manufacturing industry will not play second, third or fourth fiddle to other sectors, such as the financial sector, and that it will remain at the forefront of public thinking when it comes to the development of our local economies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.90.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="90"  time="010:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0004.htm#10012062000400">
	<p pid="a.90.1/1">No. I am not going to give way to anybody, because I have only five minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/2">The Centre for Cities report states that there is a clear disparity between the cities that will find recovery easier and the others, based on a multitude of factors. The report highlights that our major cities will play a vital role in helping us to recover from the recession. I would have thought that new Labour Members would agree. The report says:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Major cities in particular have the potential to reinforce their position, and generate jobs and growth as the global economy recovers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/4">That is what we all want. Leeds is clearly a major city, as the report states. It notes that Leeds, Birmingham, London, Liverpool and Manchester have 36 per cent. of the entire population of the UK but 39 per cent. of the jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/5">If we accept the importance of Leeds to the UK economy, it is vital to establish first how badly the recession has hit Leeds and, secondly, how Leeds can respond in future. The right hon. Member for Leeds, West has assiduously asked a raft of parliamentary questions, but I must highlight one answer in particular, from the Economic Secretary to the Treasury:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The Government recognise that the global economic downturn has affected all regions within the UK.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/7">Well, that is earth-shattering; we knew that already. She went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Yorkshire Forward, as the regional development agency in the region, has taken forward a number of initiatives to provide assistance to families and businesses in these difficult times.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-10-20.1411"><i>Official Report</i>, 20 October 2009; Vol. 127, c. 1411W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/9">Even Sir Humphrey would be proud of that answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/10">I am glad to say that the Minister who is here today has provided the right hon. Member for Leeds, West with many answers more constructive than that one. However, in one of her answers, on recognising Leeds's importance to the economy and the strength of its financial sector, she seems proud to note that the effects of the recession in terms of loss to the sector</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/11" class="indent">&quot;could be around &#163;820 million&quot;.-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-01-12.944"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 January 2010; Vol. 22, c. 944W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/12">Her pride seems to stem from the fact that the figure is approximately half that estimated in a Deloitte study in 2009. I am not sure whether that will provide comfort for the estimated 1,200 to 1,400 people in Leeds who have lost their jobs. As I suggested earlier, although the financial sector is important to Leeds, it is not the only important sector. The city has one of the most-if not the most-diverse economies in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/13">The number of liquidations at the moment is worrying. There were 26,978 voluntary corporate liquidations between the second quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of 2009. The Minister should consider carefully that 241,000 businesses in the UK are on the Government's tax deferred scheme. At some point, that tax must be repaid and that will put more businesses in jeopardy.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/14">My time is almost up, so I turn to the importance of Leeds to the future. The Centre for Cities report that I quoted makes it clear that Leeds has a clear role in the UK's future. Last March, a Leeds city council policy briefing note showed that during the last decade, manufacturing employment declined by 20 per cent. The socialist Members present are rewriting history. As one of the socialist Members said, manufacturing actually started to decline under the Labour Administration of the 1970s. There has also been a big decline in manufacturing over the last 12 years under this socialist Government. An incoming Conservative Government will be internationalist in their outlook; they will provide the infrastructure that Leeds needs; they will provide the skills that this Government have failed to provide; and they will give the people of Leeds a better future than this old-fashioned, tired Labour Government have managed to provide.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.95.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="95"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0005.htm#10012062000407">
	<p pid="a.95.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. The project is essential to the future of communities that have relied on traditional industries, such as coal mining. Having said that, we hope to make a contribution to clean coal technology in future with the technology that is available today.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/2">It is crucial to consider how the north of England can contribute to our strategy across the country as a whole. We have had many debates in the House about the opportunities that there are-or have not been-in the north of England. Given that the inland port would be a strategic rail-freight interchange that a number of Government reports have said is essential to the development of transport around the country and to the supply companies that would supply the freight to go on to the stock and the rails, I cannot think of anything more exciting than getting this inland port under way as the next step in Doncaster's future. That is what I want to press upon the Minister today.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/3">The council is, as we are, keen to progress the matter, and a permission could be issued by <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-01">1 March 2010</phrase>. I very much hope that that will not be delayed by an unnecessary public inquiry. The only unresolved issues relate to the Highways Agency and I believe, as does the council, that those can be satisfactorily resolved locally between the Highways Agency, Doncaster metropolitan borough council and the developer, without resorting to a public inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/4">Doncaster council has been in regular dialogue with the Highways Agency and the developer's consultant since the pre-planning application stage discussions. The purpose of those discussions was to work towards reaching a resolution acceptable to all parties on issues pertaining to the strategic road network. Notwithstanding that, the Highways Agency has said that it has no &quot;in principle&quot; objection to the proposed inland port and that it has full confidence that outstanding issues will be resolved based on its consultation response to the application.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/5">Work is being undertaken by all parties to resolve the remaining three issues: acceptance of the travel plan, agreement by all parties of the detail for the proposed signalisation scheme of M18 junction 3, and the upgrade of the westbound merge layout at junction 3 to accommodate the development traffic. I know that the Highways Agency is keen to consider traffic flows, as is the Department for Transport, but sometimes we are in danger of losing out on the strategic impact of proposals by not allowing them to move faster. That results in a huge cost for local authorities and the developers as the clock keeps ticking and time is wasted.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/6">It should also be noted that the scheme developers will contribute to the upgrading of the M18, so we have a win-win situation, and delay can only cost more for everyone concerned. I was therefore surprised to see a letter from the Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber-I have very good relations with the office and I know that it tries to do things in everyone's best interests-stating that the decision on call-in was in abeyance, possibly for three more months, while the Highways Agency undertook modelling work in relation to the M18. The letter I received from Felicity Everiss stated that the decision is</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/7" class="indent">&quot;currently being held in abeyance. Doncaster MBC are aware of this. This is because, in our view, there are some substantial highway issues still to be addressed, which whilst unresolved would mean any decision now by the Secretary of State on whether or not to intervene, would not be based on the full facts raised by the application. The Highways Agency is currently working with Doncaster's Planning Department and the applicant to address these concerns and will let us know the outcome in due course. We anticipate that this will be within three months.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/8">I say to my hon. Friend the Minister that that is an unnecessary and costly delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/9">As I have said, the project is crucial to regeneration in this part of Yorkshire, particularly south Yorkshire, and would regenerate a former coal mining community. The site of the inland port is in a dip that lies alongside the disused Rossington colliery. As I have said, it is estimated that the proposal will deliver between 3,000 and 5,000 jobs. I would have expressed joy at the creation of 100 jobs, but we are talking about thousands of jobs. The development is directly accessible from a former mining community, where high levels of deprivation still exist-including employment deprivation-and where alternative prospects are limited unless we get the right development to sustain those communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/10">The proposal would contribute to the early implementation stages of the Finningley and Rossington regeneration route scheme, which is a proposed strategic transport scheme that improves accessibility to new job opportunities and contributes to the development of land. The proposal would support the development of a more competitive city region by improving the links between key components in transport infrastructure such as rail freight distribution, Robin Hood airport, the motorway network and the regeneration areas of south Yorkshire and Sheffield city region.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/11">The proposal would also contribute to reducing 5.5 million lorry miles a year on motorway networks and 425,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. The concept of rail freight interchanges, including those set out in the proposal, is supported by Network Rail. In a letter to Doncaster council on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-16">16 March</phrase> as part of the consultation on the inland port planning application, Network Rail identified Doncaster as a</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/12" class="indent">&quot;rail hub with good connections to all principal areas of the UK.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/13">The concept is also complementary to Network Rail's Control Period 4 investment programme, which includes the upgrade of the Peterborough-Lincoln-Doncaster line to enable it to be used for efficient freight rail.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/14">The proposal also supports the policy of the Department for Transport on strategic rail freight interchanges, particularly the need to establish major rail freight interchanges across the country. It is absolutely clear that the inland port would fit into the transport vision described in the Government's own document on the future planning of transport, &quot;Delivering a Sustainable Transport Strategy&quot;, which was published in 2007. The executive summary of the subsequent document, &quot;Delivering a Sustainable Transport Strategy: The Logistics Perspective&quot;, which was published in December 2008, sets out the fact that central to the Department's goal is the need to</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/15" class="indent">&quot;support national economic competitiveness and growth by delivering reliable and efficient transport networks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/16">The proposals will result in a private sector investment of approximately &#163;300 million in a regeneration priority area, as identified in the Yorkshire and Humber regional spatial strategy. That investment will support, as one part of the jigsaw, our economic recovery during and after the recession and our future competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/17">The proposal would contribute to the intermodal logistics sector in Doncaster, which was also identified in the Yorkshire and Humber regional spatial strategy as a priority sector for Doncaster due to our excellent position on the strategic transport network, our position near the Hull ports and, of course, work force availability. It should also be noted that the proposed development would include 22,000 square metres of green roofs, mainly on ancillary buildings, rather than warehousing; 158 hectares of woodland and agricultural land to accommodate a project to mitigate environmental impacts, including the replacement of ecological features and wetlands and indigenous tree and hedge planting; and funds to support and co-ordinate important training and employment schemes in the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/18">I hope that I have given enough ammunition for my hon. Friend the Minister and the Department to ensure that an early decision can be made. I hope that there will be an early decision not to call it in, based on the submissions that have been made and the points my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough and I have made today, and on an understanding that the matters concerning the Highways Agency can be left to the local authority to resolve in partnership with the agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/19">I do not believe that a public inquiry would serve any purpose, other than to delay a project that is good for Rossington, Doncaster and Yorkshire and the Humber. Realistically, we are in a period of speculation about the general election and we all know that in such circumstances there can occasionally be a tendency for Departments to slow down. I hope that that will not be the case and that my hon. Friend the Minister will put his foot is on the accelerator to ensure that schemes that will help us out of the recession and build a better future can proceed without further delay. My hon. Friends and I would be happy to meet with him, or any of his ministerial colleagues, to discuss any more details if that would be helpful in getting the matter resolved.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.98.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1542" speakername="Shahid Malik" colnum="98"  time="011:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0005.htm#10012062000410">
	<p pid="a.98.1/1">I fully accept that the number of objectors is quite limited, and that it has diminished since the proposal process began.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/2">It might be helpful if I commented on some of the relevant national policy issues raised by the application, some of which my right hon. Friend alluded to. The Government support the transfer of freight from road to rail where it is practical and economically and environmentally sustainable. We recognise that a consistent and effective framework is needed to support the competitive and efficient operation of the UK logistics industry. We also recognise that both private and public investment and consistent planning decisions will be needed to support the strategic development of freight infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/3">On the issue of support for longer-term freight growth by rail, rail can deliver goods quickly and reliably to where they are needed and help reduce both congestion on our roads and carbon emissions. For longer-term freight growth and further modal shift to occur, rail needs to be able to compete effectively with heavy goods vehicles on the roads. Rail freight has become a vital driver of UK economic growth: it moves coal for electricity generation and aggregates for construction; it makes just-in-time deliveries for the manufacturing sector; and it takes an increasing share of the domestic retail and supermarket supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/4">Rail freight produces five times less CO2 emissions per tonne carried than road freight, and up to 15 times less noxious emissions. A container train can remove 50 HGVs from our roads. Emissions from HGV traffic have grown significantly since 1990-by 25 to 30 per cent., using the revised assessment from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. HGV traffic is a significant source of greenhouse emissions from transport; it is second only to cars and vans, and international aviation.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/5">A network of strategic rail-freight interchanges is a key element in aiding the transfer of freight from road to rail and in supporting future rail-freight growth. Interchanges of all types will be required to support that, but the Government believe that there is a particular market need for a network of strategic rail-freight interchanges-for large new interchanges with intermodal capacity and rail-connected warehousing-to support the development of rail in the general freight market.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/6">Yorkshire and the Humber is a growth area for the logistics, supply chain and distribution industries. It has good transport links, land and labour availability-including in the political sense. Clusters of activity are already developing in south Yorkshire and parts of the East Riding of Yorkshire. On modal choice and sustainable distribution more generally, we believe that it is important for all modes of transport to be able to compete on equal terms, so that customers can make an informed choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/7">Since road transport is currently not required to pay its full external costs, we provide targeted assistance for the use of rail, inland waterways and coastal or short-sea shipping to enable those modes to compete on a level playing field. We also continue to provide our capital support scheme-the freight facilities grant programme-which helps to offset the capital cost of providing rail and water freight-handling facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/8">That said, there are some markets for which mode shift is not appropriate, and for a large number of logistics movements, road haulage remains the only practicable option. We seek to reduce the impact of road freight transport by promoting more efficient freight operations, chiefly through best practice and driver training schemes. However, each planning application must be considered on its own facts and merits.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/9">Let me turn to the role of the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. It is important to recognise, as my right hon. Friend does, that in considering the application, the Secretary of State would not be responsible for determining the detailed merits of the proposal. The decision is rather whether, under the Government's call-in policy, the application should be called in for determination by the Secretary of State, or whether it should be left to Doncaster council to take the final decision. It is clear from listening to my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> that their preference is for the latter.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/10">As my right hon. and hon. Friends may be aware, the kinds of cases that might be called in include those that, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, may conflict with national policies on important matters; have significant effects beyond their immediate locality; give rise to substantial regional or national controversy; raise significant architectural and urban design issues; or involve the interests of national security or foreign Governments. Our general approach is not to interfere-I restate &quot;not to interfere&quot;-with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. Parliament has entrusted them with responsibility for day-to-day planning control in their areas, and it is right that, in general, they should be free to carry out their duties responsibly and with the minimum of interference.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/11">However, there will be occasions when it may be considered necessary to call in a planning application and have the Secretary of State determine the matter, instead of leaving the decision to the local planning authority. Our policy is to be selective about calling in applications. In general, we will take that step only if the planning issues are of more than local importance. It is worth bearing in mind that only 0.01 per cent. of all planning applications are called in. Between 2006 and 2008, the number of cases called in fell by more than two thirds, and the numbers are still falling.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/12">It is clear, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley suggests, that a decision to call in adds significantly to the costs for all parties involved, and adds significant delay to the process. That is why we are keen to use the power selectively, especially in the current economic climate. She was absolutely right to stress that point. Looking forward, my Department has committed to leading a review of the call-in process, with the aim of achieving significant time savings. The review will report in early March. Obviously, that information is not directly relevant, but I hope that it will be useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/13">The current application was formally received by the Government office for Yorkshire and the Humber on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-01">1 December</phrase>, following referral by Doncaster metropolitan borough council under the terms of the Town and Country Planning (Development Plans and Consultation) (Departures) Directions 1999. The application was referred because the proposals would be a departure from the provisions of the Doncaster unitary development plan, as the application site falls within the green belt.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/14">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-03">3 December</phrase>, the Highways Agency formally requested the Government office not to proceed to consider the application until such time as the motorway impact issues had been resolved. It was anticipated that that could take up to-I stress &quot;up to&quot;-three months. Obviously, it could take much less time, notwithstanding where we are. The Government office's view was that there were some substantial highway issues still to be addressed, which, while unresolved, would mean that any decision taken now by the Secretary of State on whether to intervene would not be based on the full facts raised by the application.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/15">Consequently, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-10">10 December</phrase>, the Government office wrote to Doncaster council and the applicant to notify them that the scheme would be put in abeyance while the transport assessment work was finalised. We will monitor developments with the Highways Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.0/1">Let me say to my right hon. Friend and to my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough, that I am more than happy to meet for a discussion on the issue. My right hon. Friend has powerfully articulated her concerns, which are absolutely genuine, and I am sure that they are shared by her constituents and people in the sub-region, and in the region more widely. I am certainly happy to meet her so that we can speak with relevant officials. She also spoke about ensuring that the foot is on the accelerator. We would not want unnecessarily to slow down something that is so strategically important, not just to her constituency but, potentially, to the whole of the region and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/2">The Government office is keeping in regular contact, and we will review the position in March at the latest, at which time the Highways Agency suggests that the assessment work will be completed and agreed. Once progress has been made on the highways issue, a submission will be sent to Ministers with a recommendation on whether the scheme is one in which the Secretary of State should intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/3">My right hon. Friend will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to comment in any way on the scheme at this stage. To do so could jeopardise and prejudice the Secretary of State's decision on the referred application. However, I can assure her that he will carefully consider all the matters raised by the inland port application, including relevant policy issues, and that a conclusion will be reached on the balance of interests. He will also take into account my right hon. Friend's views as expressed in this debate, in correspondence and in the possible future meeting that we have discussed. Having considered all of that, he will then decide whether intervention would be justified.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/4">I understand that my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley, and my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough, are keen for the Secretary of State to reach a decision as quickly as possible on whether to call in the application for his own determination. In that respect, this debate has demonstrated that my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley is a great advocate for her constituents and, indeed, the constituents of others in and around the area. I shall ensure that officials submit the case to the Secretary of State as soon as possible, and I certainly would expect that to be within three weeks of the Highways Agency's notification of agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/5">I am happy to meet my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley and my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough. I have taken on board everything that they have said this morning, and will do all that is within my power to ensure that the matter is fast-tracked, so that they can have a decision about whether the application ought to be called in, without commenting on the merits of the application itself-</p>

	<p pid="a.103.1/1">I am grateful to you, Mr. Evans, for ensuring that we have a full hour and a half for this important debate. As this may be my last opportunity to speak about human trafficking before I leave Parliament, I thought it appropriate to assess the state of modern-day slavery in the United Kingdom, the effect of the absorption of the UK Human Trafficking Centre into the Serious Organised Crime Agency, and the need for a national human trafficking watchdog.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/2">First, I pay tribute to the officers of the all-party group. I have been greatly supported by the three vice-Chairmen: <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2024" name="Clare Short">the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short)</phrase>, Baroness Butler-Sloss, and the shadow Deputy Leader of the House, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1475" name="Shailesh Vara">the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara)</phrase>. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase>, who is in the Chamber today, has played an invaluable part in the overall strategy, and I thank him for that. I also thank the shadow Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, and the shadow Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase>, for their kind comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/3">It would be remiss of me not to mention the many Ministers who have paid tribute to my fight against modern-day slavery, including the Solicitor-General; the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" name="Alan Campbell">the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase>; the Minister for the Cabinet Office; the Under-Secretary of State for Health; the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland; the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1686" name="Gillian Merron">the hon. Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron)</phrase>, who has responsibility for public health; the Minister for Children, Young People and Families; the Foreign Secretary; and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1748" name="Alan Simpson">the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson)</phrase>. I must not forget the sterling work of the Chairman of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/4">Everyone wants statistics. They give people a sense of bearing, as from a compass, and they feel happier when they have something against which to judge where they are. The problem is that statistics on human trafficking are difficult to come by. By their very nature, they are unreliable and problematic to read. The Home Affairs Committee's report in May 2009 stated that there are an estimated 5,000 victims in the UK, and according to the Ministry of Justice website, Home Office research estimates the total social and economic cost of trafficking in the UK at about &#163;1 billion in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/5">Statistics from police Operation Pentameter 2 identified 169 victims of human trafficking, 13 of whom were children; 406 suspects were arrested and 67 were charged with trafficking in human beings; 15 people were then convicted of trafficking, some with related offences; 822 premises were visited; 6,400 police intelligence reports were gathered; more than &#163;500,000 in cash was recovered from the criminals who were arrested, and court orders placed restraining orders on criminal assets running into several millions of pounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/6">The Home Office has stated that approximately 360 children are trafficked into and within the UK each year. ECPAT UK-End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and the Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes-co-ordinates a coalition working for the protection of children's rights, including Anti-Slavery International, Jubilee Campaign, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Save the Children UK, The Children's Society, UNICEF, and World Vision UK. ECPAT, which services our all-party group, and does so very well, estimates that 60 per cent. of children rescued from traffickers later go missing from local authority care.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/7">Between March 2003 and April 2009, the POPPY Project in London, which provides shelter to trafficked women, received 1,233 referrals of women over 18 who were acknowledged to have been trafficked. The Home Affairs Committee's report last year stated that at least 100,000 people are trafficked into and around the EU each year. There are rumours of boys moving from Russia through Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia as sex slaves, but there are no numbers. In a high security prison in Bucharest, which I recently visited, one man admitted driving a transit van weekly across the Pyrenees transporting trafficked women from Romania into Spain. He would not give me any numbers, but he did that for several years. There is a combination of anecdotal and statistical evidence, and it is not surprising that Nick Davies recently questioned the scale of human trafficking in the UK in a challenging article in <i>The Guardian</i>. The statistics are spasmodic, unreliable and unproven. Unfortunately, modern-day slavery is not tidy, visible or neatly packaged, and it is not surprising that Mr Davies's article unleashed an outburst from non-governmental organisations, sex workers, former trafficked victims, women's rights workers, officials, MPs, and so on. Everyone weighed in to complain about his views.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/8">By its very nature, modern-day slavery is hidden. Much of it is underground, most of it goes undetected, and much of it is orchestrated by sophisticated criminal gangs whose footwork is much faster than the lumbering steps of the law. The House must not underestimate victims' very real fear of coming forward-and anyway, how do they do so? If they are sex workers, they are prisoners; if they are forced labour, they are working covertly to get rid of debt; if they are domestic slaves, they usually have their passports taken away; if they are child victims, they are usually used as Fagins by their parents or distant relatives to carry out street crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/9">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase>, a former Home Office Minister, for pushing forward the agenda, largely single-handedly, including persuading the Prime Minister to sign and ratify the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings, and for the creation of action plans involving 11 Departments. I am pleased to see the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" name="Alan Campbell">the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase>, in his place and about to give a powerful answer to some of my points. The Home Office has always been the lead Department in such matters, but I am sure that hon. Members will be interested to know that the Scottish Executive, the Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Justice, the Attorney-General's Office, The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department of Health, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Department for Communities and Local Government, and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are all involved in trying to tackling this difficult problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/10">It is important to acknowledge the Government's financial commitments. The Ministry of Justice and the Home Office awarded &#163;3.7 million to the POPPY Project over two years, and funding for the human trafficking centre has almost doubled from &#163;834,000 in 2007-08 to &#163;1.7 million in &#163;2008-9, and &#163;1.6 million in 2009-10. However, despite those initiatives, the signing of conventions, and the involvement of 11 Departments, the problem remains as opaque as ever. Some people say that it is getting worse. Modern-day slavery will continue while people in undeveloped countries are forced to feed the appetites of populations in developed countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/11">We are witnessing a worldwide phenomenon. The largest number of children trafficked into the UK are from China and Vietnam. Many of the women trafficked into sexual slavery fly via the Netherlands from west Africa. An increasing number of victims trafficked into Spain come from south America. The French suffer from human trafficking, but do not like to admit it. Moroccans and Tunisians are viewed as illegal immigrants, rather than as people who are trafficked. As pilfering and violence become epidemic, and as the rule of law collapses in Haiti following the terrible national disaster, child trafficking will quickly emerge as children are left abandoned or orphaned, and predators move in. What is the state of play in this country?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.105.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" speakername="Anthony Steen" colnum="105"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0006.htm#10012062000416">
	<p pid="a.105.1/1">I was hoping to ask a question about that in the House this morning, but unfortunately we did not get that far. There is no doubt that during events such as tsunamis and earthquakes, children are separated from their families and parents, and sadly there will be many orphans in Haiti. It is a very poor country-one of the poorest in the world-and I cannot see that traffickers, who are predators, will fail to come forward and take children away, either from children's homes, or by deploying distant relatives who will say that they are going to care for them, but those children will never be heard of again. I wanted to ask the Prime Minister a question this morning about what is being done to alert international aid agencies to that prospect. There is no evidence for it yet, but it is inevitable, and the question is how it can be prevented, and on what scale it will take place. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/2">I was coming on to look at the situation in this country. Until the summer of 2008, it seemed that the Government were keeping up the pressure. However-and this has nothing to do with the Minister-I have a feeling that once the Council of Europe convention was ratified and implemented, that impetus might have been lost. Perhaps we need a new impetus from the Government in the dying embers of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/3">A good example is the implementation of the national referral mechanism in April 2009. In the first six months ending in September 2009, 347 people were referred as suspected victims of trafficking. There are 180 Government officials who have been specially trained as assessors. Dividing 347 by 180, we are entitled to ask what each of those officials are doing for the rest of the time when they are not looking into their two referrals. Those 180 Government officials are referred to as &quot;competent authorities&quot; and are tasked with the job of deciding whether any of the victims referred to them have been trafficked. I do not understand why we need 180 officials-that number could probably be cut by two thirds. Who trained them? What were they trained for, and are they the right people to do that job?</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/4">There is a bigger question about the relevance of recognising someone as a victim of trafficking, and about the authority of the competent authority. Even if an individual is recognised as trafficked, the Ministry of Justice, through the Director of Public Prosecutions, can still pursue criminal cases against them. The pattern is well established, with the Crown Prosecution Service totally ignoring, and treating as irrelevant, the decision of the competent authorities employed by the UK Border Agency and, by implication, denying the existence or legality of the Council of Europe convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/5">Let us take the case of V, a Vietnamese boy who was assessed as aged 17 but who was 15 when he arrived in Britain. He was given a positive, conclusive-grounds decision in which the competent authorities identified him as a victim of trafficking. In spite of that, he was given a 45-day reflection period, as required by the Council of Europe convention, but once he had served that 45-day delay, he was sentenced. The fact that he had been subject to a decision by the competent authority, which stated that he had been trafficked, was completely irrelevant. The Crown Prosecution Service charged him with cannabis cultivation, and he was convicted at Huntingdon Crown court in August 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/6">There are many such cases; I have a number of them. I have raised the issue with the Solicitor-General and with the Director of Public Prosecutions. If somebody has been trafficked and described as such by the competent authority set up by the Government, how can they possibly be prosecuted and sentenced? The competent authority's statement that a person has been trafficked becomes an irrelevancy, because it does not have any meaning. The question then is: does it have any meaning for the Solicitor-General or the courts?</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/7">Such cases make a joke of the 45-day reflection period. What is the point of recognising individuals as victims under the national referral mechanism if criminal cases are then pursued against those same people? What is the significance of the Government signing the Council of Europe convention, if children and young people found to have been trafficked-whether Roma children or Chinese boys-are left with no emotional, psychological or practical support to help them navigate the administrative and legal nightmare of human trafficking legislation? It goes totally against the words and spirit of the convention. Not only is the national referral mechanism being side-stepped by the law, the principles in the convention of supporting, helping and advising children are being totally ignored.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/8">The Government state that their goal is to make the UK a hostile environment for human traffickers, but they have made it a totally hostile environment for the victims. Domestic workers who come to the UK on diplomatic visas to work for diplomats are not able to change employers without losing their immigration status. That makes them particularly vulnerable to abuse because they have no escape route from such a situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/9">Kalayaan is a London-based, well-run non-governmental organisation that supports migrant domestic workers. It reports that it refers 6.9 per cent. of the diplomatic domestic workers it encounters to the UK Human Trafficking Centre as victims of trafficking. That is compared with 0.1 per cent. of domestic workers in private households. That dramatic difference is an obvious cause for concern, and I led a delegation to the Minister for Borders and Immigration (Mr. Woolas) on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-24">24 November</phrase> last year. All the heavyweights on the issue of human trafficking were there, and the Minister buckled under the arguments. He could see no reason why the diplomatic visa should be changed so that those who were imprisoned or abused by officials in foreign embassies or delegations could escape. As it is, they cannot escape. If they do escape, they have no passport and are sent home where they came from. These people come from embassies and they are terrified about their future and the future of their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/10">I would like to mention other cases, but some victim support organisations are reluctant to release information. It is hard to raise the problem with credibility when one does not have the details. Of course we want to protect the privacy of victims, but we can do that and share information at the same time. There are increasingly difficult problems in getting even the vaguest information from some of the organisations that are specifically funded by the Government to look after victims of trafficking. Will the Minister consider whether he could provide some guidance to those organisations and suggest that acting like a guard at Fort Knox, preventing anyone from getting in, or meeting, listening to or speaking to any of the victims, is not a good way to encourage an open and transparent society?</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/11">I have a case from one such organisation, the POPPY project. It could not give me the name, or details of the courts or the police, which was not very helpful; none the less, I will relate some of the information. This case took place last November, when a referral was made to UK Human Trafficking Centre regarding 21-year-old Chloe-apparently she was 21, although I do not know whether her name was actually Chloe.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/12">Chloe had approached the central London Sapphire unit-a police unit-having been violently raped that night. Although she did not say that she had been trafficked, it became known that her &quot;boyfriend&quot; had links to the sex industry. She described owing a debt of &#163;20,000 to the people who brought her to the UK-it is clearly a case of trafficking-which she had to pay off by working in restaurants. She claimed to be very afraid of those people and appeared highly traumatised.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/13">The police officer at the Sapphire unit picked up on the indicators and tried to access support for Chloe. They put her in emergency accommodation for that night, but were unable to accommodate or support her after that. Chloe suggested that she would be able to stay with a &quot;friend&quot;, but it was known that the friend was involved in managing a brothel. When the police officer called the UK Human Trafficking Centre to make the referral, she was informed that as Chloe had been out of her exploitative situation for some time, she was not eligible to enter the national referral mechanism-one can see the bureaucracy that has built up.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/14">The concerns are first about the UKHTC, which has been severely criticised in relation to the NRM and the many non-governmental agencies using it. That seems to be one of its weaknesses. The UKHTC, which has three staff-as opposed to the 178 or 177 in the UK Border Agency-should have recognised Chloe as an extremely vulnerable individual with immediate support needs. She had approached the police and was seeking assistance regarding the criminal justice system, support, accommodation and identification. That was last November. The date on which she escaped her exploitative situation should have had no bearing on her potential status as a victim of trafficking, and the rights and support to which she would be entitled.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/15">Chloe clearly described several indicators of trafficking for labour exploitation, which were passed on to the UKHTC. In addition, the Sapphire officer noted several other indicators suggesting that she may also have been sexually exploited. As a potential victim of trafficking, Chloe should, at this stage, have been housed and supported appropriately, and then informed about the NRM. The significant point is that the UKHTC's refusal to refer her to the NRM effectively denied her the opportunity to access any support. As the Minister will know, the UK Border Agency deals with women from outside the EU, but it will also deal with women from inside it. Chloe probably came from an EU country, but because she was denied an NRM referral, she could not get any other support. I have a number of such cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/16">What happened in this case reflects a lack of concern for the safety of the individual. The victim should be accommodated in a place of safety, and an NRM referral should then be made, if appropriate. In this case the woman was close to being returned to someone who was known to have connections with the brothel management. I would like to be more specific, and I am sorry that I cannot be, but the problems I face prevent me from saying more. However, I think that the principle is well established.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/17">Having raised the issue of domestic slavery and the problem that one Department did not follow law under the convention even though another Department was involved, I want to come to local authorities. Local authorities referred 57 children to the national referral mechanism last year. What happened to them? I do not know whether the Government or anybody else knows where they have gone, but I do not. Have they been assessed by the competent authorities? Who has been responsible for their welfare? Has section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, which places a duty on the UK Border Agency to safeguard the welfare of children, made any difference? Does the Minister have any information about how section 55 is changing the conduct of the UK Border Agency? Should it change it? Does the Minister have any statistics? They are one thing we probably do not have.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/18">I am deeply troubled that, for some reason, Britain cannot look after its own children, let alone vulnerable children from overseas. In fact, our track record on losing children in care has put us near the top of the league, and it is not the sort of league that a developed country such as Britain should even be in, let alone lead. There is a lot of shame there, which we should acknowledge and do something about.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/19">We know that it is impossible to find foster parents for foreign children who speak no English. We need a national campaign to find foreign language-speaking residents who are willing to foster. At the moment, the best that we can do for trafficked children is to place them in local authority child care homes, but that does not mean very much given that many of them, sadly, experience understaffing, which results in many hundreds of children escaping. Such children are not in care at all, because the homes are like an open hotel-often not a very good hotel-that they can leave whenever they like.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/20">For that reason, I am convinced that it would make sense for every trafficked child to have a guardian ad litem appointed from the moment that they are acknowledged to be a trafficked child. Such a guardian would ensure their safety, as well as ensuring that they are not abused by the legal or administrative systems and that someone keeps an eye on their welfare. Guardians ad litem work well in Britain, their track record is good and their results are impressive. Why not use a tried-and-tested system, rather than trying to invent a new one?</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/21">If we really mean what we say and want to implement the Council of Europe convention effectively-with a bias towards victim protection-rather than create a culture of deportation, we need fewer &quot;competent authority&quot; officials, with different training and a different approach. Child care workers would be far preferable to UK Border Agency officials. It is therefore important that we get the national referral mechanism right and then ensure that the guardians ad litem are in place to take over.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/22">Inevitably, a victim's first encounter with the police or border officials will affect his future outlook. Our failure to change the culture of deportation and disbelief in turn explains why our record of prosecutions and convictions of traffickers is less successful than that of countries such as Holland, Italy and Austria, where the public authorities are known to be on the side of the victims, and where victims understand that the authorities are there to help them. It is worth mentioning that the most recent uncovering, by the Austrians, of a multi-country human trafficking ring took place only because all the victims were willing to give evidence. That was an impressive outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/23">By contrast, there have been worrying reports that UK officials are not on the side of victims at all. In one case, the competent authority identified a woman-I will call her P-from India as a trafficking victim as part of Operation Tolerance Pilot, which ran from May to December 2008. The UKHTC then informed the POPPY project that the decision was void because it had not been taken under the new national referral mechanism, and that it wanted to put her through the process again. That was despite the fact that the original decision had been issued by a Government agency. From what I have said, the Minister will understand both the appalling bureaucracy, rules and regulations and officialdom that have built up as a result of our signing the convention against human trafficking and the attitude of UK Border Agency staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/24">What is to become of the UKHTC? The 35-strong, south Yorkshire-based staff will be merged into the 4,000-strong, Home Office-run Serious Organised Crime Agency, and its specific tasks will be diluted, if not washed away. The principle of establishing a multi-agency organisation, which would act as a central repository for all information on human trafficking and offer strategic and operational support and a 24/7 support line for advice, including on the care of victims, deserved a chance. I certainly supported the establishment of the UKHTC in Sheffield three years ago. The idea that the centre would conduct research, develop training, share best practices and develop an improved knowledge and understanding of the way in which criminal enterprises associated with human trafficking operate was perhaps somewhat over-ambitious, but its important task of co-ordinating statutory bodies, such as local authorities, the UK Border Agency and police, reflected sound thinking.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/25">Following the centre's absorption into SOCA, however, any suggestion that it can achieve any of those objectives must be seriously questioned, and the possibility of its being independent has been shattered for ever. It will be neither independent, nor able to deliver the goods; it will be lost in a huge organisation of 4,000 staff. The Government like things bigger and centralised, which is perhaps why the UKHTC is being absorbed into SOCA and why the human trafficking team in the Met will be absorbed by the much larger clubs and vice unit. However, big does not mean better. As Schumacher said, &quot;Small is beautiful&quot;, and I know that myself from the Schumacher college in Dartington in my constituency, which is very small and very good.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/26">How successful has the UKHTC been? It is just over three years old. On the plus side, it is a one-stop shop for statutory agencies, local authorities, the police and the UK Border Agency. In that respect, it has proved valuable, but it has been less successful in achieving its other objectives. Nor has it been able to provide real help to the voluntary sector-it has just not had the resources. Some argue that it would be better if the Government spent &#163;1.6 million a year funding non-governmental organisations with a proven track record in dealing with human trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/27">The time has arrived for the UKHTC to concentrate on what it does best: co-ordinating the statutory services. For the rest, we must make better use of the voluntary sector and establish a national human trafficking watchdog-some European countries would call it a national rapporteur, but we, being English, call it a watchdog. The concept of a national watchdog goes back to the 1997 Hague declaration, which was the first international document to recommend that EU member states establish a national reporting mechanism. In this country, we report to a watchdog, but people in other European countries report to a rapporteur.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/28">The modern-day slavery watchdog would act as a central repository for all information on human trafficking. It would be charged with collecting facts, figures and statistics, monitoring weaknesses, speaking up for NGOs, ensuring the adequacy of victim accommodation, checking that the guardian ad litem system was working properly and the like. It would contribute to a better knowledge and understanding of the root causes of trafficking, the modus operandi of traffickers and their criminal networks, and the different forms of exploitation. Indeed, a more complete picture of the extent of the crime is precisely what we need. That would increase our knowledge and facilitate our work against this phenomenon, and we could more effectively identify victims of trafficking and provide appropriate support to them. A watchdog would be part of the solution, and it should be based in the Home Office, although independent of it. Its task would be to see that Government agencies deliver on outlawing human trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/29">The police have recently recovered 15 victims of human trafficking in Northern Ireland, but we have no idea of where they fit in or of the scale of trafficking in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, although local authorities in Scotland recently referred six children to the national referral mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/30">The UK Human Trafficking Centre will be completely absorbed into SOCA, which is exempt from freedom of information registration, because it handles security issues. I do not know whether my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1379" name="Damian Green">the Member for Ashford (Damian Green)</phrase> knows that; it is a quite interesting point about SOCA-one cannot get any information out of it. What are the implications of that for reporting to Parliament?</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/31">If it is impossible for SOCA to report to Parliament, there is even more reason for us to establish an independent role for a national watchdog. The watchdog would report annually to Parliament and make recommendations on the development of national policies and action plans, without itself being a policy making agency. For example, what could be done to improve the situation regarding the confiscation of traffickers' assets that have been transferred overseas?</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/32">My private Member's Bill, the Anti-Slavery Day Bill, is to have its Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-05">5 February</phrase>. I want to introduce a national anti-slavery day to reinforce the focus and the understanding of the general public. Such a day would continue to draw attention to the evils of human trafficking post-Wilberforce, and to how that is displaying itself in British society. An anti-slavery day would cost the taxpayer nothing, but could do a great deal of good. I hope that the Minister will say how he feels about that. I hope that all parties in Parliament will support me on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-05">5 February</phrase> and help me to get my Bill through the Commons quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/33">In summary, we need a national referral mechanism, to be administered by welfare or social workers rather than immigration officials; a guardian ad litem system for trafficked children, to support them through legal and administrative hurdles; and work permits and identity cards for victims of trafficking while they are resident in the UK, to give them the ability to work in the UK just as they do in Italy. That would encourage them to give evidence against traffickers without fear of being returned to their source country, where there would be a risk of re-trafficking. We need a national network of shelters for women and children, whatever their age, who are victims of trafficking, and a proactive and dedicated police force on human trafficking-the Pentameter initiatives were welcome and should be revived in every police force and carried out every year. We also need a national human trafficking watchdog, working with Government but independent of them; and a change in visa arrangements so that domestic workers brought into the UK to work for foreign embassy officials are free to seek other domestic work and not forced to return home. Finally, we need an annual UK national anti-slavery day, which will make sure that the crime is kept firmly on the agenda and does not get consigned to a dusty drawer.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/34">I hope that, when I leave the House at the general election, the work in which I have been involved will continue, in both the Commons and the Lords. I hope also that I shall be able to give service to the groups from the human trafficking foundation charity I am establishing. It is deeply depressing that in spite of Wilberforce's achievements in outlawing slavery 203 years ago, modern-day slavery is a new canker in our midst, with human beings being degraded while society stands by and does little.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.112.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1822" speakername="Fiona Mactaggart" colnum="112"  time="015:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0007.htm#10012062000419">
	<p pid="a.112.2/1">I shall be brief. I want to make three points. First, I echo the concerns of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" name="Anthony Steen">the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen)</phrase> about the closure of the Metropolitan police trafficking unit. In my view, that unit has hugely improved the policing of the issue. It is a great pity that it is not to continue, and is to merge with the clubs and vice operation, which, in my experience, has put insufficient focus on the experience of the victims of the vice trade. I do not have any particular beef with the Serious Organised Crime Agency; it is a question of effectiveness and victimisation. If that mistaken decision is to be proceeded with, I urge the Minister to institute a mechanism to ensure that any new arrangement has that victim focus and does not end up in the sort of cosy arrangement that I have seen in the past in vice policing, in which the exploiters and the police come to a deal that stops the neighbourhood nuisance, but not the exploitation. That is a cause of serious anxiety.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/2">Secondly, I want to urge on the Minister the need for a powerful information campaign about the legislation, which he helped to introduce in the House of Commons, making it an offence for any man or woman-any customer-to pay for the sexual services of someone who is forced to provide them. One of the most powerful effects of that legislation, potentially, is that it could deter customers from such behaviour, and so reduce the market for those who have been exploited, thus reducing the profits of traffickers and exploiters and the extent of exploitation. That chilling effect will not occur unless the law moves from being secret-as it largely is at present, frankly-to being publicly and widely known.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/3">In women's lavatories there are frequently stickers on the back of the door-it is not quite the same for loo doors in the gents'-giving the local Rape Crisis telephone number, or something like that. I want every urinal to have, at eye level, something to warn chaps who are thinking of paying for sex that if they do, and do not know with absolute certainty-without any doubt in their mind-that the person who offers herself to them does so of her free will, without having been bullied into it by a pimp or trafficked, they will be committing a criminal offence and will be prosecuted. I believe that if such an approach were taken, there would be a difference to the trade. I am normally rather sceptical about Government publicity drives, but I think that the one in question could reduce crime and exploitation significantly.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/4">Thirdly, I want to mention the recent European Court of Human Rights decision in the case of Ms Rancheva. She had gone to Cyprus from Russia under an artiste's visa. She ended up in debt, and it seems clear to me that some people-trafficking operation was involved. She tried to leave the club that she was in, and a few days later was found dead on the pavement, after falling from a balcony. There was no criminal prosecution in connection with the events leading up to her death, but there was a prosecution under the European convention on human rights. Cyprus was found guilty of failing to protect Ms Rancheva and failing to put in place a proper framework to fight trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/5">One issue at the heart of that seems to be that Cyprus had allowed a sex industry to flourish in a semi-public place. People who thought that they would be artistes, or performers in public clubs, were actually operating in the sex industry. It appears to me from the judgment-of course I do not know any more than is in the published press release and so on-that the margin between Ms Rancheva selling herself in prostitution and exotic dancing had been diminished, or smoothed out, to such an extent that she was in effect being prostituted. She did not want to be; she wanted to go back to Russia.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/6">The key issue in that case is the existence and public acceptance of gross sex exploitation, at an industrial level, in which people are allowed to participate. The case of Ms Rancheva is a very strong argument for the Government to intervene in a similar activity in the UK, by which I do not mean exotic dancing, although the activity happens in the context of exotic dancing. In almost every local newspaper in the UK there is a page of advertisement for &quot;fresh Thai girls&quot;, for example, or &quot;new girls today&quot;. That is advertising trafficked women for men's sexual pleasure. I believe that that should be prevented. Various Ministers have sought to reach settlements with the publishers of those newspapers, so that they voluntarily stop publishing the advertisements, but guess what? They carry on, because they are a source of much profit-oh, what a surprise.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/7">I believe that unless the UK Government take action against that type of publication, they risk, following the Rancheva judgment, being in breach of our obligations under the European convention on human rights. I urge the Minister to examine that and, if his legal advisers conclude that I am right, to introduce urgent legislation to prevent such advertising, because if these adverts run in freely available newspapers, of course people think that the work is safe and legitimate, but it is actually not safe and legitimate work. It is work that has at its heart the most grotesque exploitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/8">The appalling thing about how human-trafficking for sexual exploitation works is that the degradation that trafficked women experience, and their experience of the sex industry, sometimes mean that, having escaped from it into impoverishment, isolation and loneliness, they re-enter the sex industry, in a so-called voluntary way, because it is the only way they know of generating income to survive. If women do re-enter the industry, they end up with some of the problems described by the hon. Member for Totnes, in relation to their immigration status and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.2/9">It seems to me that there is a duty on Government to stop providing comfort to those involved in the industrial-scale exploitation of people who, because of their immigration status and gender, are vulnerable to the most appalling exploitation of their human rights. There are things that we can do, and I urge the Minister to do them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.116.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" speakername="Denis MacShane" colnum="116"  time="015:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0008.htm#10012062000425">
	<p pid="a.116.0/1">I, too, pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1881" name="Anthony Steen">the hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Steen)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1822" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase>, but I shall start with the hon. Gentleman. He made a valedictory speech, but with his customary brio he only looked forward, giving a series of marching orders to my hon. Friend the Minister. I hope he will accept some of them, particularly those about not blending the specialist units into a blancmange. We have seen the equality, race relations and disability councils being turned into an amorphous pudding that is far less than the sum of its parts. What disasters can sometimes be produced by administrative tidying up.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/2">There are aspects of this issue that we can all cover. I am very proud that it was on this Government's watch, and particularly during the last five years, that significant steps were taken. You, Mr. Evans, as a fellow delegate to the Council of Europe, will know how we all joined together to persuade the then Prime Minister, the right hon. Tony Blair, to sign and later to ratify the convention on human trafficking. Even that will only work if real effect is given to it. Next week, the Council of Europe will debate the convention, with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1646" name="John Prescott">the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)</phrase>, the former Deputy Prime Minister, giving an opinion on it. I look forward to hearing what he has to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/3">However, with the usual dreary penny-pinching, platitudinous approach of Whitehall, the official briefing paper for the Council of Europe delegates-you may not yet have seen it, Mr. Evans, as it arrived only today-said in effect, &quot;Jolly good thing, but not a penny more for the experts group on action against trafficking in human beings.&quot; I most sincerely ask my hon. Friend the Minister just to find &#163;50,000 or &#163;100,000; if he does not want to use pounds, he could send euros. The currencies are about the same, so it will not make much difference, but we should show a token gesture of appreciation of that work.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/4">We then come to what we can do. The speeches we have heard this afternoon are similar to those that I have heard over the last few years. We have not yet made that decisive breakthrough. Part of the problem is that there are still powerful forces in this country-I do not doubt their sincerity-who believe that there is no problem with women of almost any age above immediate post-puberty childhood selling their orifices for the sexual satisfaction of men.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/5">The English Collective of Prostitutes makes an extremely nefarious and negative contribution to the debate. It is constantly cited on &quot;Newsnight&quot; or in <i>The Guardian</i> and other newspapers as some kind of expert authority on the problem. However, the collective, its supporters and spokesmen in the House and elsewhere, and those journalists who write about it, are in complete and utter denial about the extent of the problem. They fall into the trap of having a debate over statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/6">The hon. Member for Totnes made it very clear that there is no satisfactory figure. The reason for that is that we are talking about illegality; we are talking about fear; we are talking about underground problems; we are talking about trafficked girls that service men in south Yorkshire being controlled through a mobile phone by their Chinese pimp in Soho. There is no easy connection to make.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.117.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" speakername="Denis MacShane" colnum="117"  time="015:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0008.htm#10012062000427">
	<p pid="a.117.1/1">My position is simple. We will stop slavery only when we stop demand for it by making it illegal. We cannot stop slavery by exhortations or books and sermons.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/2">The Archbishop of York, Dr. John Sentamu, wrote powerfully in the <i>Yorkshire Post</i> about the problem of trafficking. I am not really in favour of men in long robes sitting in the House of Lords in the name of a faith, but he came down to London to organise a vote on a Government Bill-he wanted to unstop the undoubted blockages in the Lords. That Bill was passed into law just before Christmas; it makes it a crime-I cannot say this often enough-to have any paid-for sex not only with trafficked women but with anyone forced or coerced into offering their sexual services.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/3">I very much agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Slough that we need more publicity. I like to stop at Leicester Forest East motorway station, near the constituency of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, who is Chairman of the Select Committee on Home Affairs. I stop there for breakfast early in the morning when driving to Rotherham, and often after my second cup of tea I go to the loo. It would be no bad thing if, at any height, there were reminders that if I took advantage of trafficked girls-I am sure that such services are offered in Leicester, as they are in every other city in the country-I would be committing a crime. That action could be undertaken now by the police or by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/4">We may have dealt with kerb crawling. We recently had the extraordinary example of a premier league football manager who was caught by <i>The Sun</i> coming out of one of those wretched industrial brothels before Christmas, but his name is not recorded because his lawyers are agitated about it. I grant that it is difficult to name him. I grant that naming and shaming may not be acceptable to many. I grant that there are many problems in that field. However, until we start the process of naming and shaming, which we have started to do with kerb crawlers, we will not start reducing the demand side. I am worried, as is my hon. Friend the Member for Slough, that the Bill that was passed by the House of Lords just before Christmas may not be made operational. There is a culture of macho-ism in the police; as a result, combating this area of crime is regarded as not being as interesting or rewarding as others.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/5">I conclude with a reference to the anti-trafficking alliance. It promotes good literature, some of which is produced in Chinese. I have a copy here, but there is little point in reading into <i>Hansard</i>, as I do not understand Chinese. The alliance states:</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/6" class="indent">&quot;If you are a man who is about to sleep with a woman working in prostitution, think twice! She may be trafficked and you could be charged with rape.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/7">It quotes Natalia, a Russian survivor of trafficking. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/8" class="indent">&quot;If men stopped paying for sex, if they understood and stopped there would be no trafficking, there would be no demand for girls, there would be no money in it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/9">I have to say to my right hon. Friend the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, for whom I have affection and respect, that he must speak up much more clearly on the demand side.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/10">In an earlier debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes-if I may, I will call him my hon. Friend-who has been so shabbily treated by the press in what is his last period in the House, and the hon. Member for Wellingborough disagreed with me about the demand side issue. I hope now that we are beginning to change our minds. I thoroughly endorse all the recommendations. Given that the Home Office has undergone a complete culture change in the last couple of years and has become extraordinarily courageous under the present Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase> and previous Home Secretaries, it would be exciting if it adopted one or two of the measures and then promoted them before this Parliament comes to its end.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/11">None the less, the root cause remains demand. As long as there is demand-as long as one premier league football manager grants himself the privilege of going to a brothel and having sex with someone who may or may not have been trafficked-we will not stop the practice. We must focus on the demand side.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.1/1">The hon. Gentleman was a member of the Committee that produced that excellent report-if we can share in the compliments. One of the points that was raised in that report was the concern that the Metropolitan police's human-trafficking unit was going to lose its funding from the Home Office. That poses a problem, particularly for London. Given that the Minister is here, is it not right that we should make a plea that some-if not all-of that funding should be restored?</p>

	<p pid="a.119.2/1">Clearly, the Minister has heard that plea on a number of occasions, and he has now heard it again. Given the difficulty in tackling and addressing the issue, and in identifying the number of victims, it seems a great pity to lose or dilute expertise, or to reduce the funding that is required to finance the expertise. I can see the Minister frantically scribbling away. I am sure that he is writing into his notes a commitment to providing the funding that is required, and he will shortly have the opportunity to confirm that that is the case.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.122.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1379" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="122"  time="015:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0009.htm#10012062000436">
	<p pid="a.122.0/1">As I said, only 57 of the 527 under-18s have been referred under the national referral mechanism. In the five years to 2009, 452 people were arrested for human trafficking offences, of which only 110-less than a quarter-were convicted. I am sure that the Minister shares my concern over those figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/2">I visited the UK Human Trafficking Centre in Sheffield last November and it was interesting to see its work. My conclusion is that having a central point for information on trafficking has been of great value to police forces, the Crown Prosecution Service and other agencies. UKHTC demonstrates the importance of specialisation when tackling new types of crime. An important aspect of its work was international co-operation, for example, through chairing the Interpol human trafficking group.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/3">The team at UKHTC informed me that they were having more success in prosecutions than the figures appeared to show because traffickers were being prosecuted for offences other than trafficking-the so-called Al Capone approach. The Minister is nodding enthusiastically about that. However, that gives rise to the worrying thought, identified in the Select Committee report a couple of years ago, that the CPS has problems with the drafting of current trafficking legislation. I wonder if he has anything to say about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/4">As we have learned from other countries, in the run-up to the Olympics, we must pay attention to the danger that more people might be trafficked here for that period, when hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of new people will be here. Perhaps the Minister would also address that point. Although I have kinder words to say about UKHTC than my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes, the work that it does must be linked to prevention work. The Conservative party has urged the Government to focus on countries of origin. We were pleased to see mention of that in the millennium goals. However, many who work in this area, in particular the very good charity, Stop the Traffik, are concerned that campaigns are being targeted in the wrong way. Instead of specific resources being allocated for anti-trafficking campaigns, Stop the Traffik argues that Department for International Development aid campaigns should incorporate messages about trafficking. At a time of restricted public spending, that would seem to be a valid method of warning those in poorer countries of the dangers. Will the Minister consider a more inclusive approach? Is he in contact with colleagues in DFID about such matters?</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/5">The Conservative party policy document on this matter concentrated on better co-ordination between state agencies, in particular on ensuring that each police force and local authority has a strategy to deal with suspected victims of trafficking. Looking back on that, we are concerned that there appear to be problems with the national referral mechanism at a local level. Better information still needs to be provided to local authorities and police forces so that they are aware of the problem, are better able to identify victims and are more confident in using the mechanism. It is having a fairly patchy effect across the country.</p>

The most important defence we have is our borders. We want to replace ad hoc police operations with a national border police force, which would be much more effective at combating trafficking at the border. The Government's failure to tackle Britain's poorest borders has resulted in a disastrous rise not just in organised immigration crime, but in trafficking. My hon. Friend has raised a huge range of subjects, and I promise him that I will think seriously about the future arrangements that he would like to see. He has made some points about the serious problems with the current arrangements, so I will sit down and let the Minister deal with those.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate and concur very much with his concerns. Does he agree that the real problem is the inconsistent application of section 113 of the Police Act 1997? A chief constable may wilfully refuse to amend or remove allegations against people who have never been charged or convicted of a criminal offence, and as a result of malicious or vexatious accusations, those allegations cast a pall over their professional life?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.129.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" speakername="Edward Vaizey" colnum="129"  time="016:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0010.htm#10012065000119">
	<p pid="a.129.1/1">I completely agree with my hon. Friend. That is similar to an issue that I suspect both he and I have encountered of innocent people having their DNA taken by the police. The default position for the police is that they simply will not change or amend the details. They have no sense at all of the effect that that might have on individual. One suspects that they take the view that it is convenient for them and increases the information available to them, but there is no sense beyond that of their wider duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/2">This is completely outrageous and a huge offence against natural justice. As a result of what happened to my constituent, he is, in effect, unemployable. I admit that I would not employ him on the basis of simply reading his CRB check. A new offence seems to have been created by the 1997 Act whereby an allegation against someone can blight the rest of their life. That old film clich&#233;, &quot;You can walk from this court without a stain on your character,&quot; is no longer true. It seems that under the CRB, once an allegation is made, a person is guilty as charged, even if they are found not guilty.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/3">Another issue that I want to address is the inappropriate use of CRB checks. I recently discussed the effect that they were having on children's authors with a well-known children's author who regularly visit schools. I appreciate that some of these points may be out of date, because I gather that the issue has been reviewed as a result of the uproar caused by the creation of the Independent Safeguarding Authority. However, as a snapshot of what people are up against, the author's letter is telling and, given that she is a well-known children's author, very well written. She stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Recently, there has been a huge upsurge in the number of schools insisting that visiting authors have CRB checks. This is despite the fact that we are never (not least for insurance reasons) left alone with children, and that we are usually only in a school for a few hours. Many of us do have CRB certificates, but some do not, and getting one is not easy-they have to be secured through an 'umbrella' organisation, and authors, as self-employed freelances, tend not to belong, nor to want to belong, to such things. Even when they do, it can take ages for clearance to come through.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/5">I have covered that point already. She continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/6" class="indent">&quot;In the meantime, visits are being cancelled and children, while being 'protected' against an infinitesimal risk, are being denied the far greater benefit of meeting an author and possibly being inspired to read&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/7">The author concedes that the problem</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/8" class="indent">&quot;seems to be not so much the law itself (daft though some of us think it is) but the interpretation of that law by schools, and particularly by Ofsted... The whole thing is becoming massively more complicated by the delayed (and botched) introduction of the new 'ISA' checks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/9">She then makes a telling point about the whole climate created by the CRB:</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/10" class="indent">&quot;On top of this there is the question of what we are doing to children by implying that all adults, and even their favourite writers, are potential threats.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/11">As I said, I understand that some progress has been made, but even Sir Roger Singleton stated in his report that the Government must do more to communicate how the system works and what the benefits are.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/12">We all know of cases-yes, I have had one in my constituency-where exchange visits that have gone ahead without any problem for years have had to be cancelled because the parents in host families suddenly had to take CRB checks. To coin a phrase, we cannot go on like this. The Government have created a monstrous and-I use the word advisedly-Orwellian bureaucracy. Between 9 million and 11 million of us fall under the remit of the CRB; in fact, I am astonished that I myself, in my capacity as a Member of Parliament, have not been asked to provide a CRB check when visiting a primary school. The CRB costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds. It processes about a million people a year. It is decimating voluntary working, creating a climate of fear and putting people off getting involved in civic duties. Does the Minister truly believe that it is making us safer?</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/13">At the very least, can the Minister commit today to providing clear guidance for employers and voluntary groups to deal with the confusion that seems to arise about schools asking for CRB checks and to make employers aware of the processes? Can she provide a clear threshold, based on time spent working with children, for when a CRB check should be applied?</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/14">Can the Minister commit to reducing the time taken for the checks? Can she commit to reducing the need for multiple checks? Can she publish in the next few days the number of complaints made by hon. Members on behalf of their constituents and, in general, complaints about the CRB and its delays?</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/15">Can the Minister provide an annual assessment of how the CRB has allowed us all to sleep safer in our beds? Can she confirm, for example, that there has been a statistically significant drop in the number of attacks and assaults on children, which, of course, I would welcome as a result of the creation of the CRB.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/16">As I said, the case of my constituent who had allegations appear on his CRB form that had been thoroughly investigated and dismissed was the straw that broke the camel's back. I have been informed of several cases through my surgery and my postbag of people who are exasperated by the workings of this bureaucracy, and that is why I felt compelled to call for this debate and why I will listen intently to what the Minister has to say about the CRB.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.131.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="131"  time="016:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0010.htm#10012065000120">
	<p pid="a.131.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Evans, I believe for the first time. I shall not repeat the facts about the establishment of the Criminal Records Bureau as they have been outlined by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase>. Instead, I shall get straight on to some of the points that he raised, and in particular go into detail on why we have repeat disclosures, and on disputes about information.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/2">The hon. Gentleman has not tried to discuss an individual case; regardless, I point out that I cannot discuss individual cases, but I am happy to facilitate a meeting between him and the leading people at the CRB and to be present at it myself, if that would be helpful. I hope that we can catch each other after the debate to make arrangements to do that as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/3">The main subject of the debate is the enhanced disclosure. The CRB currently issues standard and enhanced disclosures. Standard ones include information about criminal records but also information about cautions and other police information. Enhanced disclosures include, critically, other local intelligence-the kind of local intelligence that was not released in the case of Ian Huntley. That is one of the reasons why it is particularly important.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/4">The hon. Gentleman discussed delays of five months. I shall go into performance statistics in a little more detail, as he indicated I might. Five months is an unusually long time, as most checks are done quickly, and must mean that there has been a need to acquire information from different police forces and perhaps elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/5">The hon. Gentleman asked specifically whether the protection of vulnerable adults list will be taken on by the Independent Safeguarding Authority. It is at present undergoing transfer so that any cases on the POVA list from last autumn will be transferred to the ISA. Some will be case-worked again-there may be issues around the decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/6">I wish to make it absolutely clear that a work permit does not require a CRB check. I am not quite sure whether that is what the hon. Gentleman was asking, but it is worth reading it into the record that a work permit itself does not require a check.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/7">The Thames Valley police force has a backlog, but it is one of six forces where the CRB has made a special arrangement to allow staff to access police records directly so that most cases can go through quickly. It is going well with the six forces. In addition, 20 CRB staff are embedded with the Metropolitan police due to the difference in IT systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/8">We hope to see more of that, because it means that most checks will be done quickly by trained and dedicated staff. In some small forces, there are very few people to do them. All it takes is for one person to be sick, and the force's ability to deal with the backlog can be affected. I have the latest performance figures of the Thames Valley police; if I do not have time to read them into the record, I can provide them to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/9">I want to correct a slight misapprehension about fees. Perhaps it is not a misapprehension; maybe it is based on fact. The fees for a disclosure are &#163;36 for an enhanced disclosure and &#163;26 for a standard disclosure. They are, of course, free for all volunteers, who account for about 22 per cent. of the total, or one in five. Any additional fees may be charged by the bodies that collect the forms and submit them to the CRB on behalf of the applicants. Some local authorities and others provide that service for a fee; others do it for free. It is up to the individual to shop around, should they want to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/10">There is quite a lot of public support for the CRB. Nine in 10 people agree that those who do paid or voluntary work with children should be checked and would be willing to be checked themselves, and nearly three out of four members of the general public think that the CRB is making a difference. I contend that the fact that 98,000 people have been prevented from working with children and vulnerable adults is an argument for the success of the scheme and a challenge to some of the points raised by the hon. Gentleman at the end of his speech.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.136.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1518" speakername="Jim Cunningham" colnum="136"  time="016:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0011.htm#10012065000126">
	<p pid="a.136.1/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Evans. I think this is the first debate I have attended that you have chaired and I look forward to your guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/2">I do not know whether the Cadbury announcement makes this an opportune moment to raise these issues. There has been a lot of concern in the west midlands over the Kraft takeover of Cadbury. Kraft does not have a good reputation for retaining employees, or on plant closures. Perhaps when the Minister gets here he could consider putting pressure on Cadbury to at least meet representatives of the labour force. Just before Christmas, I met the trade unions along with a number of other west midlands MPs. They were having great difficulty getting information regarding the takeover bid. Perhaps he could arrange with Kraft the start of discussions with the trade unions. They certainly have concerns about jobs and plant closures and they need reassurance. I hope he can do something to get those discussions going.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/3">In initiating this debate, I knew that the Government had been working hard to deal with the west midlands economy. This is not an attempt to denigrate the Government's attempts to help the west midlands economy. I am sure the Minister knows that despite the Government assistance, the west midlands, which I have always said is the powerhouse of the British economy, has been struggling over the past few years. The recession has affected the west midlands more seriously than any other region because it is a manufacturing area and an innovative area. It has a great reputation for the production of skills and contains a number of great universities. Nevertheless, in the west midlands, manufacturing is allied to trade. When world trade goes down, manufacturing in the midlands is a victim.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/4">Running alongside that, the west midlands probably has the highest unemployment rate in the UK at approximately 10 per cent, and we are obviously concerned about that. The area also has the fastest rate of job-shedding in the UK, and there are 12 per cent. less jobs in manufacturing compared with 2008. Employment is not predicted to return to 2008 levels until 2015. The 18 to 20-year-old age group has seen the largest rise in unemployment, to 32.2 per cent., and the area has the worst performance of all regions in terms of business activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/5">The Minister will know that in recent years we have had the cases of MG Rover and Peugeot; there is the looming closure of one of the Jaguar Land Rover plants, and there is a lot of discussion about that. However, there is some good news regarding Jaguar, as it has said it has a 10-year programme for the midlands. That is good news given all the uncertainties. Recently, Ericsson decided to pull out of Coventry, despite the fact that the Government are still in discussions with it to see whether they can persuade it to stay. We must pay tribute to the Government for that, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1517" name="Geoffrey Robinson">the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson)</phrase> has played a major part in those discussions. We hoped that he would be here today, but he has obviously been held up. I pay tribute to him for his efforts, along with those of Ministers and trade unions, to see whether Ericsson could be persuaded to stay in the west midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/6">The decline of manufacture is nationwide and not only in the west midlands, although that area has borne the brunt. To be fair, there has been a lot of diversification in the west midlands over the last 20 years, which has been an important element. As I have indicated, car manufacturing has declined in the past, and only recently Aston Martin announced the cutting of 300 full-time jobs and 200 temporary jobs at the Gaydon plant as a result of falling sales figures. However, the good thing is that Aston Martin is stopping in the midlands, and we could get growth in that area in the future. It is not necessarily all doom and gloom, although it is for those employees who are affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/7">Anyone who has gone through unemployment-and I have-knows what it is like to be unemployed. People lose their dignity and worry about their family, and that can create family situations that are not very pleasant to say the least. The husband and wife are constantly under pressure and worried about their children and their mortgage. Those are some of the effects of unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/8">Although, as I said, Jaguar Land Rover has given us a lot of good news, it had an extended Christmas closure in one of its west midlands plants. There is a lot of bad feeling about what happened with Peugeot and the way that &quot;consultation&quot; was carried out in Coventry. It was arbitrary; there was no consultation at all. Trade unions feel that many continental manufacturers treat their employees differently from the way British employees are treated. In other words, British employees feel that they do not have the same protection as their colleagues on the continent. That has been a concern for a long time.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/9">We must also take globalisation into consideration. Despite the Government giving companies tax credits, work still goes abroad. It is difficult to prevent that work from going abroad because of what is called outsourcing. The regional development agency in the west midlands has invested a considerable amount of money to mitigate the recession in the area, and it has also given Ericsson money. As I said earlier, we are still trying to prevent that closure.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/10">The work goes, of course, to economies and countries where the costs are lower. The British worker is competing against employees abroad who are working for far less-in China or Singapore, for example. Recently, we have had the case of Kraft, and as I said, workers in the UK feel that they are not getting the necessary protection. That cannot be said too often. With every closure, workers have been kept in the dark. France and Germany have used short-time working subsidies to protect manufacturing jobs. Those countries have a massive trade surplus, and we have a deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/11">We must accept that the construction industry has gone through a bad time, but we recognise none the less that the Government have a number of schemes to kick-start the construction industry. We need affordable houses in this country, but we will not get them by building on green areas such as Kings Hill on the outskirts of Coventry, where the green belt is in jeopardy. The area is environmentally valuable. Residents in the area are not saying that we should not have new houses in Coventry; they are saying that there is capacity for about 25,000 houses on Coventry's brown belt, so there is no real need to bring Kings Hill into the equation. The matter has gone to a planning appeal. We do not know the outcome, as it is being reviewed, but I wanted to highlight it.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/12">I understand that any eco-housing proposals for Coventry would have to be agreed by Coventry city council. In other words, a voluntary scheme has been proposed for Coventry, as it has throughout the country. It will not be imposed on anybody. If Coventry does not want it, we will not get it. That is what I understand from the Minister for Housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/13">We need to do more to retain skills in the west midlands in the UK. We will need them whenever the economy starts to take off. In past economic downturns, we have often found that we lack skills when the upturn comes, which can create many problems for small and large businesses. We also need a strong science base. Coventry, with its two universities, has a lot to offer in that respect. Other universities in the west midlands-I am not too familiar with them-are probably in the same position. A lot of innovation and effort have gone on in the west midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/14">Coventry has a skilled work force, but 20 per cent. of people aged 20 to 24 have a national vocational qualification of level 1 or below. They are the most likely to be unemployed. I know that the Government are considering what can be done to get such groups into employment. As I said, I welcome Jaguar Land Rover's 10-year plan. Not only has it created 100 jobs; those jobs are graduate jobs, which shows that Jaguar Land Rover is taking remaining in Coventry seriously. What happens after the 10-year programme? We will deal with that as we go along.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/15">Advantage West Midlands is running a graduate internship scheme. There is also a national internship scheme. We must congratulate the Government on launching new initiatives to create new apprenticeship schemes, and we should support them as much as we can. In the past, apprenticeships have been neglected. They were certainly neglected by the previous Government. I remember that Rolls-Royce got rid of its apprentice schemes many years ago. I am glad to see that the schemes are coming back.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/16">We had discussions with Rolls-Royce this morning about its future in this country, which looks positive despite the recession. The company has a number of interesting ideas about developing new plants. Ansty in Coventry will be one of the plants to be developed. It gives us a lot of heart to know that Rolls-Royce is planning to stop in Coventry for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/17">When we look on the positive side, we must give a bit more credit to Advantage West Midlands, which created Ansty technology park on a new site. We have had a setback with Ericsson, but when the upturn comes, as I am sure it will, Coventry will be in a good position for that area to take off.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/18">We have had problems at Coventry airport, but whatever people think about that airport, the fact remains that many small businesses are on that site. Because of the structure of the lease, they have to negotiate with the airport company, which is in liquidation, so there is concern about the jobs and businesses on the site. I am told that Coventry city council is negotiating with two partners; I do not know who they are. It seems to be quite positive about the fact that it can save that site and possibly the airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/19">My concern is not necessarily about the airport itself, but about the consequences if the airport expands. Because there is no infrastructure, expansion would create major problems in the area, and I have always been suspicious that it would be a substitute for Rugby. Nevertheless, whatever I think about the airport, there are many small businesses there and they depend on that site. There is a lot of concern about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/20">We went through a period of post office closures in Coventry; everybody has been through that. We welcome the fact that the Government have invested &#163;150 million per annum to support the Post Office. The fact remains that the Government certainly did not pursue their proposal on privatisation, and we do not know what will happen in the future. The Opposition certainly want to privatise the Post Office. That could have consequences, but nobody ever voted for post office closures in the House, as far as I can remember.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/21">Nevertheless, many positive things are going on in the Coventry area, as I have said. Not only in the Coventry area but nationally there is empty property relief, for which many small businesses campaigned for many years. I know that the Minister will want to give me a detailed response, but I have a few more points to make before I finish. It is heartening that Rolls-Royce has been awarded a &#163;258 million contract to build engines for Royal Navy sea helicopters, some of which will certainly go to Ansty. We should consider some of the other things that the Government have done. The car scrappage scheme has been a major success, with about 15,000 transactions in the west midlands alone. I therefore welcome the scheme and the fact that the Government will extend it, as that is a positive measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/22">Let us consider the green economy. Lots of exciting work is going on in low-carbon technology, particularly in the Coventry area. E.ON is working in partnership with a Coventry company-Advanced LEDs-to develop a low-carbon LED streetlight, known as Marlin, providing local authorities with low-carbon and energy-efficient streetlights. Another good aspect is that Remploy, which has struggled to survive for many years, will play a major part in the production and shipping of the lights. Again, there are lots of positives about what is happening in Coventry and other parts of the west midlands. In fact, some of the technology to which I have just referred will be used not only in Coventry but in Rutland and, later this month, possibly Blackpool. Such innovation needs to be promoted.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/23">The CABLED-Coventry and Birmingham low emission demonstrators-project is an electric car trial in the west midlands run by E.ON. It, too, has been awarded Government funding from the ultra low carbon vehicles demonstrator competition, and is a trial of 110 electric vehicles with ordinary drivers in Coventry and Birmingham, with 25 cars being tried out in Coventry. The idea is to study how practical and efficient those vehicles are. Charging points will be installed in Coventry in a mix of car parks and kerbsides. That will no doubt generate quite a bit of debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/24">We need to encourage such innovation and keep the results in the west midlands-we need to ensure that nobody tries to pinch the patents, use them abroad, then export things back to this country. Other investment is going on. Regional bodies such as Advantage West Midlands contributed regeneration funds of &#163;296 million from 2006 to 2009. I end by saying that it is very important that the Minister unlocks the banks, as it were, particularly to give support for small businesses in the west midlands and nationally. Unless that is done, we in the west midlands will face major problems. Again, it is the small businesses that suffer the brunt of decisions taken by companies such as Ericsson. It is vital to get that money to them as soon as possible.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.140.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1553" speakername="Ian Austin" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="140"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0012.htm#10012067000026">
	<p pid="a.140.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1518" name="Jim Cunningham">the Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham)</phrase> on securing this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/2">My hon. Friend is an excellent constituency MP. He has made it his business, in a lifetime of public service, to ensure that the challenges and opportunities that face the local economy are at the top of everyone's agenda in Coventry and the west midlands. I do not know whether it is widely known that he left Scotland in 1959 and travelled south in search of work. He wanted to go to America, but his parents would not let him. America's loss was Coventry's gain. Since arriving in Coventry, he has-first as a worker at Rolls-Royce, then as a trade union leader in the city, a councillor, and leader of the city council, and now as an MP-always fought unstintingly for more jobs and greater prosperity for people in his area.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/3">My hon. Friend is right to say, as he did today, that the west midlands has been hit hard by the recession. We have been hard hit, like every other region. However, some areas have been hit harder, not as a result of mistakes or decisions made over the past few years, but because of mistakes made over the past 40 years, with the accompanying structural weaknesses in skills, transport, trade, and levels of innovation in the regional economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/4">The structural weaknesses of the past four decades mean that, on a like-for-like basis, output in the west midlands has lagged behind the national average since 1976. That is why the economy in our area has been hit harder than that in some other areas. However, the good news is that today's figures show that unemployment in the west midlands fell by 20,000 over the last quarter-the second-highest fall in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/5">Every job lost during the recession is a tragedy for the families affected. Nobody can promise-no one would believe us if we did promise-to protect every job and save every company, but we must be able to say to those who lose their jobs that the Government are on their side. We will step in with more help, and more support with training and so on, to help people back into work as soon as possible. That has been our approach in the region over the past 18 months or so.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/6">Our No. 1 priority has been to help the region's businesses through the downturn and get the region focused on modernising our economy. Ours was the first region to establish a taskforce to bring all public-sector partners together with the business community, trade unions, local authorities and universities, so that we could co-ordinate the region's response to the downturn.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/7">My hon. Friend spoke about Ericsson. Like him, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1517" name="Geoffrey Robinson">the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson)</phrase>, for the work that he is doing on the issue. I am pleased to say that a similar approach to that which my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South, spoke about is now being taken in Coventry by the Ericsson partnership to address the redundancies. I thank and pay tribute to him for the support that he has given to that partnership.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/8">By working together, ours was the first region to extend lending to businesses, saving thousands of jobs through the regional loan fund. Ours was the only region able to extend funding to businesses in that way. We brought banks and businesses together, as my hon. Friend asked us to do, to try to get lending moving again. As a result, 680 businesses have been offered loans worth almost &#163;70 million through the enterprise finance guarantee scheme. In Coventry, 22 companies have been offered loans totalling almost &#163;3 million. Ours was the first region to launch a regional housing action plan to keep the construction industry moving.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/9">As my hon. Friend said, our region has benefited from additional Government investment-&#163;1.5 billion extra-to keep the housing industry moving and to save jobs in the construction trade with a number of new schemes, including the kick-start scheme and the local authority new-build scheme. They have all provided much-needed new homes for people in the west midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/10">Ours was the first region to launch a programme of subsidised jobs, training places and low-cost university courses for graduates struggling to find work last summer. That initiative is now being copied by other regions and extended by the Government nationally. Since November 2008, the Jobcentre Plus rapid response service and the Learning and Skills Council have worked with 700 employers to help more than 54,000 employees at risk of redundancy try to ensure that their jobs are not lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/11">Bids for support from the future jobs fund will create almost 10,000 jobs in the west midlands, 500 of which will be in the Coventry area. That is the second highest number of any region in the country, which means that I am delivering on my pledge to ensure that the west midlands gets more than its fair share of available resources.We have accelerated spending on major public-sector infrastructure projects, such as Coventry's new deal for communities, to ensure that new investment can go ahead and new homes can be created.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/12">My hon. Friend talked at great length about the car industry, using his expertise and knowledge. He lobbied hard for the introduction of the car scrappage scheme, so he will be pleased to hear that it has generated more than 240,000 orders already, and has helped many component companies in the west midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/13">Through the regional development agency, Advantage West Midlands, we are providing &#163;30 million over the next three years to support the low-carbon vehicles plan from the new automotive innovation and growth team. There are also encouraging signs that Coventry is well placed for recovery because of the work that people in the region have done to modernise the sub-regional economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/14">At a national level, a whole range of measures will assist businesses in Coventry. For example, the pre-Budget report extended the enterprise finance guarantee scheme for a further 12 months. That will hopefully address the access-to-finance problems that my hon. Friend highlighted this afternoon. &quot;Going for Growth: Our Future Prosperity&quot; builds on the strategic approach set out last year in the policy document, &quot;Building Britain's Future-New Industry, New Jobs&quot;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-20a.142.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1553" speakername="Ian Austin" colnum="142"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100120/halltext/100120h0012.htm#10012067000028">
	<p pid="a.142.1/1">I know how hard my hon. Friend has worked to build support and lobby for the NUCKLE project over the past few years, and he is right to identify it. As I understand it, we are still waiting for the business plan. As a result of his question this afternoon and the lobbying that he has done, I will ask for the scheme to be considered. We will go to the partners to ask for the project to be accelerated as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/2">On the new industries and new jobs agenda, we are considering how we can turn opportunities in the digital media, and in low-carbon, high-tech manufacturing, into jobs and business opportunities in the west midlands. Late last year, I announced four working groups in the region to see how we can exploit the new industries and ensure that the west midlands does not lose out on investment opportunities in the future. I have asked Advantage West Midlands, through the taskforce that I established, to set up four working groups that bring together representatives from private industry and the universities to look at opportunities for the west midlands in those specific areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/3">First, there will be a new low-carbon group chaired by Julia King from Aston university. Members will include Ministers from the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Secondly, we will have a digital creative industries group, which will be chaired by Jonnie Turpie from Maverick TV. The Minister with responsibility for creative industries has agreed to join that team. Thirdly, we will have a health-care technologies group, chaired by David Gleaves of MidTECH. I have asked the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" name="Mike O'Brien">the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, to play a part in that, as we work out how to bring the jobs and the new medical developments to the west midlands.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/4">Finally, an advanced manufacturing group will be led by Harry Reilly of Brintons Carpets and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1845" name="Lynda Waltho">the Member for Stourbridge (Lynda Waltho)</phrase>. Mr. Reilly also chairs Beacon Manufacturing Group, which is planning how we can lead the way in new manufacturing technologies, just as we did in the past-something that my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South, mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/5">There are opportunities that Coventry can benefit from. We are supporting and encouraging innovation and investment-based projects in Coventry through AWM. For example, &#163;4 million has gone to the Serious Games Institute at Coventry university, which has helped the west midlands become a leader in digital media. There was an investment of &#163;6.4 million in the Rugby Power academy to meet the demands of the new low-carbon energy economy. There has been significant investment in Modec, the world-leading, Coventry-based manufacturer of commercial electric vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/6">Through AWM, we are investing substantial sums to position the region to lead the country in science and innovation. There has been an investment of &#163;77 million in the Birmingham-Warwick research alliance, through Birmingham science city, for the areas of energy, advanced materials and translational medicine. There is &#163;20 million to support the development of clinical trialling and experimental medicine facilities in the translational medicine part of the science city programme. We are also investing in a health technologies design institute at Coventry university. The manufacturing technology centre at Ansty has received a &#163;40-million investment. We are committing &#163;40 million to a &#163;2-billion programme to regenerate Coventry city centre, a key element of which is the Friargate commercial master plan for the area around the railway station, which recently received planning consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/7">One of Coventry and Warwickshire's greatest strengths is the fantastic work of the Warwick manufacturing group at Warwick university and the work of Coventry university.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/8" class="italic">Sitting adjourned without Question put (<phrase class="standing-order" code="10(11)">Standing Order No. 10(11)</phrase>).</p>
