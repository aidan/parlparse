<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26a.85.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" speakername="Jeremy Wright" colnum="85"  time="010:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051026/halltext/51026h01.htm#51026h01_spnew12">
	<p pid="a.85.0/1">I should also declare an interest: I am a non-practising member of the criminal Bar.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> said, the difficulty with what the Government have in mind in relation to criminal legal aid is that although the junior Bar would probably have no objection to the redistribution of money from the top ranks of the Bar to the lower ranks, that is not what is going to happen. The Government have indicated that cuts will be made at the lower ranks of the Bar to the criminal legal aid budget, but there will be no corresponding transfer to those ranks. That will create a number of significant difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/3">There is no doubt that there is room for reform in the system of payments to the Bar. I accept that the current system is ridiculous. Based on the amount of preparation I do on a Monday night for a Tuesday morning case as a member of the Bar, I could be paid &pound;46.50 or &pound;1,500</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/4">a review in May, but it did not materialise. The criminal Bar has been waiting a long time for them to explain their long-term vision.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/5">The hon. and learned Lady summed up the issue well. It is not whether we pay high-ranking barristers &pound;200,000 or &pound;300,000 a year; it is whether we can attract the best quality applicants to the junior criminal Bar, not because we compare&mdash;this is where I disagree with her&mdash;the earnings of the junior Bar with average earnings throughout the country. We need to attract the best quality advocates to do the vital job of defending and prosecuting in our criminal courts because they could instead go into other strands of the legal profession, such as the commercial Bar. They could become commercial solicitors or go into other professions with far higher rates of pay. Barristers spend a lot of time and, now, money to train for the criminal Bar. We need to attract them and to retain them. It is not automatic that those who join the criminal Bar become silks and make the sort of money that has been mentioned. It is the junior Bar that needs the Government's attention. I hope that they will give it that attention and they recognise the problems.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-26a.120.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" speakername="James Plaskitt" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions"  colnum="120"  time="015:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051026/halltext/51026h03.htm#51026h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.120.0/1">Everyone who contributed to the debate had the same motivation to do so: as constituency MPs&mdash;I include myself in this&mdash;we have all wrestled with difficult constituency cases over the years. Constituents have become embroiled in the CSA, and the agency has let them down in one way or another. Hon. Members have spoken of distress, tears and anguish, and we have probably all seen those things in our surgeries. That is why many of us have long-held concerns about the state of the agency and want to see the problems addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/2">I felt that we were having a constructive discussion. Hon. Members have brought their genuine experiences to the table and, quite rightly, they want me to answer questions about the agency. They are concerned about the parents who are enmeshed in these matters. More essentially, they are concerned about the children.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/3">We were having a debate of that type until we reached the previous contribution, which unfortunately indulged in raising other issues. That suggests that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> is perhaps not as interested in the agency as he is in other matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/4">Turning to the meat of the debate, I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> on securing this opportunity as well as on is clear that I am not talking about a success story, and there is no point pretending that I am doing anything other.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/5">However, it is important to keep a certain perspective on what is going on at the agency. In our surgeries, we all&mdash;me included&mdash;come across the cases that have gone wrong in one way or another. Almost by definition, we do not come across the cases that are working. Before rushing to judgment, therefore, we need to be a little careful to determine whether the thing has completely failed and whether we have the whole picture in front of us.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/6">We must bear it in mind that since the agency was established, it has collected &pound;4.5 billion of child maintenance payments and that 527,000 children are being supported by maintenance payments because of the CSA. We do not hear about the cases that get processed and set up in six weeks, although I assure hon. Members that there are some.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/7">Nor are we paying attention to the quite sharp recent increase in action by the agency to chase non-compliant non-resident parents. Let me share with hon. Members the figures on the issuing of liability orders, which is the necessary preliminary step to taking action to recover debts and non-payments. In 2002&ndash;03, the agency issued 2,383 such orders; in 2003&ndash;04, it issued 3,885; and in just the first six months of the current financial year, it issued 4,539. The impression that is sometimes created is that the agency is falling down on the job and doing nothing to chase non-compliant non-resident parents, but that does not quite match the entirety of the picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/8">We all know, however, that alongside those elements of the agency that work&mdash;I am pleading for perspective here&mdash;there are far too many elements that do not. I shall not pretend for one moment that the agency's performance is in any way acceptable; it has let far too many people down and the issues need to be addressed. The hon. Member for Wycombe is perfectly right to quote back at me things that I said in the House of Commons as a constituency MP. I said that these issues had to be tackled and I consider myself quite fortunate because I am now in a position, perhaps, to ensure that we do something about them. Indeed, we are doing something about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/9">The new chief executive went in nearly six months ago, and he and his team are doing a root-and-branch analysis of the agency, with nothing being left unexamined. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> wants to know whether my ministerial colleagues and I are asking all the tough questions to get to the bottom of the agency's problems. I am happy to reassure him that that is exactly what we are doing. The questions are very tough, and the task that the chief executive has been given is extremely challenging.</p>
