<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16a.197.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="197"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0030.htm#06051659000010">
	<p pid="a.197.2/1">Being officially &quot;incapable&quot; corrodes the confidence and aspirations of the toughest. In Nottingham, 30,000 individuals feel like that every day. We can now do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/2">Some 18 weeks ago, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions wrote to me, as he did to many, to let me know that I was one of 100 MPs who have among the highest number of incapacity benefit claimants in their constituencies and what the Government proposed in their Green Paper. I am sure that he wrote also to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1746" name="John Heppell">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East(Mr. Heppell)</phrase>. My hon. Friend is here today, but his Whip's duties prevent him from speaking. However, I know that he feels strongly about getting people off incapacity benefit, as does <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1748" name="Alan Simpson">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/3">As the chair of One Nottingham, our revived local strategic partnership, I know that it is keen to seize the opportunities to be offered by the Green Paper. Individual partners in my city have already done some tremendous work. The city council, Jobcentre Plus, the greater Nottingham partnership, the learning and skills council, the voluntary sector and many others have introduced innovative and important projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/4">Those partners and others need to build on that work, taking their efforts to the level necessary to meet the magnitude of the challenge to be set by the Government, doing so not from a bureaucratic perspective but from the perspective of the incapacity benefit claimant. We are doing so in close co-operation with the skills board, one of the five theme partnerships that work closely with One Nottingham. With the lowest rate in the United Kingdom of level 2 achievement, and the UK's worst reading levels atage 11, they know the problems that Nottingham faces. They also know that long-term preventive measures in education and skills are needed to complement the remedial measures necessary to deal with incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/5">It is One Nottingham's intention to respond promptly when the Government ask for expressions of interest in creating a city strategy on incapacity benefit. Local partnerships deliver. They have done so in Manchester, where &pound;1.75 million of neighbourhood renewal funds have been used on the highly successful stepping stones project, and in Edinburgh, where the equivalent of the local strategic partnership has led innovation on incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/6">One Nottingham will allow unique access to all the partners in our city, including organisations dealing with crime, health, education and liveability as well as skills. We also intend working closely with our conurbation and county partners. To take matters forward, a consortium will be created that will include key local and national players. It will pool money, create new flexibilities, push back the boundaries of devolution. Beyond that, it will work out the most effective structures for execution and delivery, which can be monitored and held to account. A lot of planning has already taken place. During the past three months, our local area agreement, our floor target action plan and our community strategy have converged to present an aligned and coherent set of targets, which can be the foundation of our city strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/7">The local area agreement sets a target for the reduction in the number of incapacity benefit clients over three years. The target will move from the current 65 per cent. of people in our city in employment to80 per cent. The target reductions for invalidity benefit claimants in our city have been set at 1,129 this year, 2,258 next year and 3,387 the year after that. That may sound ambitious, but for Nottingham to reach its share of the Government's target of a 1 million reduction will require 6,425 people to leave our incapacity benefit register. That is another indication of the efforts that will be needed to take us to a different dimension&mdash;more even than what has already been done.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/8">Our local area agreement stretch targets already link to specific evidence-based programmes on training, child care and health. That valuable pre-planning will obviously sharpen as our expression of interest is prepared, and if it is successful in June, we shall want our consortium to be up and delivering before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/9">We are delighted that, within days of the launch of the Green Paper, the Secretary of State accepted my invitation to come to Nottingham and give the keynote address at our One Nottingham conference on building a city strategy for incapacity benefit. Ironically&mdash;or appropriately&mdash;that conference was held in the Aspley ward in my constituency, where one in eight people are on incapacity benefit and 56 per cent. of people have no qualifications whatever. It is the ward with the lowest entry rates into higher education among the 18-20 age group in the whole of the UK. It was appropriate and welcome that the Secretary of State took the message to a heartland area that is so obviously in need of the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/10">That was followed up on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase> by a broad-based series of workshops involving officials from the Department for Work and Pensions and many local partners, which began thinking through what shape our strategy should take. That work continued and last Tuesday&mdash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-05-09">9 May</phrase>&mdash;a delegation of partners from One Nottingham was able to play a full part in the DWP's stakeholder event on incapacity benefit in London. We were pleased to welcome the new Minister; it was probably his first official engagement after the reshuffle. He made a telling contribution at that event, and I am sure that he will do so today, too. The Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/11" class="indent">&quot;I very much welcome One Nottingham's support for this initiative and look forward in due course to seeing your proposals as to how you would use a City consortium to build on your existing work and that of your constituent partners.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/12">One Nottingham, with its partners, is ready to submit that expression of interest. It is a big task, but we have proved that such big tasks can be done; an example is unemployment. In Nottingham, unemployment has fallen by 2,700 to 11,300&mdash;that is according to the International Labour Organisation measure&mdash;since 1997. That is not just a statistic; it means that 2,700 individuals and their families now have self-respect and a better quality of life, and are now contributing to society, rather than feeling that they are being a drain or burden on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/13">However, we must do more, especially to address that forgotten group of those trapped on incapacity benefit. There are 17,600 IB claimants in Nottingham, more than half&mdash;53 per cent.&mdash;of whom have been on IB for more than five years. The excellent district manager of Jobcentre Plus told me that a person who has been on incapacity benefit for two years or more is more likely to die or retire than find work. That is a damning conclusion from a local expert professional. We will do something about that. Some 7,700 of that number have mental problems, and I will address those difficulties later. In addition, there are 6,820 lone parents and 10,200 older workers on related benefits. Reaching and helping those groups will be the mission of our city strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/14">On top of the human price that we pay there is also financial waste. Around &pound;5.6 million is paid in incapacity benefit in Nottingham alone each month. Add to that housing and council tax benefit and forgone income tax revenue from people who are not working, and the bill mounts up massively. We are interested to explore the incentives for recyclingany savings made into more incapacity benefit programmes. I am pleased that the Government floated that as a possibility; we need to explore that carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/15">The savings in incapacity benefit spending need to be retained locally&mdash;not nationally or even regionally&mdash;so that local partners can see something for their effort and investment of energy. The money needs to be reinvested locally to expand the city strategy even further, so that we can get the next tranche of people nearer to work. It needs to be retained locally because it needs to flex and we need to be sensitive to the local context and initiatives, rather than imposing a top-down model.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/16">The average IB beneficiary receives the king's ransom of &pound;83.86 a week. For those who say that the higher levels of benefit paid to long-term IB recipients have encouraged people to stay on IB, let me point out that in Nottingham 42 per cent. of all IB claimants are not getting the higher rates. They did not have sufficient national insurance and so have to depend on income support. That group has been increasing while the number of IB recipients has been going down. More people in Nottingham&mdash;7,300&mdash;have to claim income support because they did not have sufficient national insurance than are receiving the long-termIB rate. There are 7,200 such people.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/17">In households in which no one goes to work, both money and self-esteem can be in short supply. A lack of positive role models can result in generation after generation getting stuck in the benefits trap. Getting people on to IB and its predecessors&mdash;invalidity benefit and sickness benefit&mdash;was sometimes seen as a way to mask soaring unemployment levels. People in Nottingham&mdash;in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East, in my own and in Nottingham, South&mdash;have paid a heavy price for that policy failure over many years. We are delighted that that is now being seriously addressed by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/18">One Nottingham, which was created to help in deprived areas, sees the clear link between benefit dependence and hardship. It was shown in the figures that I received from the Department for Work and Pensions all those months ago that half of the most severe pockets of deprivation in Britain are in the 100 constituencies with the largest number of IB claimants. If we tackle incapacity benefit, we tackle poverty. People in my city do not accept a system that perpetuates hardship and denies people the opportunity to better their lives by accessing the world of work, and we want to do something about it. The vast majority of people who start receiving IB want to go back into work. That has been proven in survey after survey as well as by anecdotal experience, which I am sure hon. Members on both sides of the House share. Our city strategy will provide those people with tailor-made, local help to go back into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/19">The Government have made great progress since 1997, reducing the number of new claimants by one third and turning round the massive rise that took place when numbers trebled between 1979 and 1997. The Government have also put the pathways to work programme into every core city in the country, and those programmes have piloted a new approach that offers increased support to IB claimants in return for an increased responsibility to do what they can to return to work. By 2008, IB claimants in Nottingham will, for the first time, be able to benefit from the pathways to work programme, which is being rolled out nationally. It was pioneered successfully in our nearest city, Derby.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/20">One Nottingham obviously has an interest in the impact that IB claimants can have on regeneration&mdash;for example, in mentoring youngsters, teaching literacy or helping to reduce antisocial behaviour. If just one in 10 IB claimants get back to some form of activity in our city, there will be 3,000 extra brains and pairs of hands helping to regenerate our city. We want to build on the work of the voluntary and community sector, Enable and the local learning and skills council to create volunteering experience as a route to work. Volunteering is a safe place in which to build up confidence, self-esteem, experience, skills, the work habit and discipline. It is, in effect, work experience, which looks good on a CV, and the volunteers realise that if they can work for free, they can work for money. Most areas in the country have a volunteer centre accredited by the national body, Volunteering England, which operates like an old-style job centre and which the consortium would look to develop in our city.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/21">Although the new deal for disabled people has shown increased success, with job starts for incapacity benefit claimants in Nottingham increasing from 120 in 2002 to 390 in 2005, and 52 per cent. of all those registering for the new deal for disabled people in Nottingham starting work in 2005&mdash;a very good record indeed&mdash;the scale of the activity is not large enough to do more than scratch the surface. Our consortium will need to examine how we can use outside providers, such as the Shaw Trust, Working Links, Work Directions and many others, to work alongside local providers to liberate the talent and potential in the disabled people of Nottingham. One Nottingham and our partners will never advocate forcing people with physical and mental difficulties back into work. That is not appropriate. However, we will not shrink from using our city strategy to challenge the fatalistic culture of storing people on incapacity benefit without offering them ways forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/22">When we receive documentation relating to an expression of interest we will need to think seriously about governance and how to take the consortium forward. How the consortium works and how it is structured will be key. None of the local partners will have dealt with central government on a task of such size and scope. Passive representation will not do. Each consortium member must bring revenues to the pool and take responsibility for specific targeted and measurable activity. A small full-time core team is likely to be needed, under its own chief executive, to measure achievement and provide a forum for day-to-day learning and interaction of the many providers that we will need if we are to make an impact on the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/23">One of the key early decisions of the consortium will be how to franchise and commission our 6,000 share of the 1 million national target. That represents more than 700 incapacity benefit claimants whom we wish to get off the register in each of Nottingham's nine area committees, should our consortium choose to break the task down at that level, so that it lies alongside the new developments taking place on neighbourhood management. Even that work will need to be further sub-divided into target groups, such as single parents, older workers and those with mental health issues. All the low-hanging fruit has been picked, so long-term relationships in each locality have to be built between providers and commissioners around workable and realistic delivery plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/24">I hope that I will not disappoint the Minister in saying that I do not want a big blast of figures next year that make him feel good about how well the programme has been implemented early. I want a steady growth in those figures, rather than a quick fix that peters out, and I am sure that he feels the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/25">We have been incredibly excited by the idea of taking control of the incapacity benefit challenge locally. We must now enter the uncomfortable phase of reality checking, being honest about local capacity and allocating responsibilities and accountabilities that will stay the course. Our consortium will tackle a number of key issues, the first of which is the incapacity benefit routine.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/26">It is difficult to leave the security of incapacity benefit payments for regular work payments. A bad back, depression or stress can often recur. Members of a Jobcentre Plus focus group recently mentioned their suspicion that Jobcentre Plus only wants to talk to them to take away their benefit. They fear the transition to work and the impact on, for example, tax credits, housing benefit and final incapacity benefit payments. If the employment does not work out, they have the reverse situation. One suggestion that came out of the consultation in Nottingham is that we should look to retain stability by, for example, keeping housing benefit and free prescriptions for a transitional period. We need to reward people financially for working by making the incentive great enough to overcome their fear of moving from incapacity benefit and reassuring them that we will take every possible step to ensure that the transition is easy and smooth and not something to fear.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/27">The second issue is flexibility. When we first went to see the Prime Minister and the then Secretary of State at No. 10, it was encouraging to hear over and over again that the Department and the Government wanted to be as flexible and open as possible on ideas about extending and changing some of the rules that inhibit those on incapacity benefit in getting back into work. Some excellent flexibilities already exist, and incapacity benefit claimants can earn up to &pound;81 per week for one year, although many do not know that or do not know how to take advantage of the arrangements. A locally based city strategy will, I hope, be much better placed to get that information to claimants and be sensitive to their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/28">Giving us real authority to act locally will mean that our consortium is able to judge how resources can best be applied by sector and by area. The problems in the white working-class estates of outer-city Nottingham that I represent will, of course, differ from those in the inner-city, multi-ethnic areas of mixed housing tenure that are more typical of the constituency represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East. We will need to be sensitive to such problems, and by creating city-based strategies with a lot of flexibility, the Government will allow us to tackle them all at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/29">I must flag up for the Minister the fact that the move by Jobcentre Plus towards regional contracting has taken away local district managers' ability to invest in and purchase what they know is needed. The Department for Work and Pensions could demonstrate flexibility by looking again at whether it can let the local Jobcentre Plus manager have more control over his or her budget. I do not expect the Minister to answer that question today, but if he has any thoughts about it and cares to write to me, that will be most welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/30">We need to work out how those with short-term or treatable incapacity spend the period of their rehabilitation on incapacity benefit and then come off it once they are fit again. We need to offer a menu to help reintegrate these people back into work and we need to plan flexibility and discretion in relation to incapacity benefit exit. The individual's variability of performance over time is also a critical issue, particularly where their mental health is involved and they suffer, for example, from bipolar illness. We need to use reasonable adjustments. We need to make use of volunteering and permitted work, but there should also be also scope for social firms and charities to pioneer alternatives. The Government have offered flexibilities, and the Minister knows that we will test that offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/31">The third issue is re-skilling. In the case of longer-term injury, it is easy for claimants to find their skills out of date. A year out of the information technology industry, for example, can be a long time. Even outside fast-moving technology industries, the pace of change is increasing year on year. Skills upgrades need to be created by all our partners. We need to break down the artificial barriers and silos from top to bottom, including in central and local institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/32">If we have our own city strategy, there will be nobody to blame. If we cannot get deals done locally, we will not be able to point the finger at a convenient Minister and say, &quot;If only they did this&quot; or, &quot;If only they did that&quot;. If the responsibility is ours, we will need to face up to things locally and strike deals. Where deals cannot be made, we will come to the Minister and ask for the barriers to be removed, but the onus will be very much on us.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/33">The rules must be made crystal clear and ensure, for example, that when an IB claimant follows an agreed training and FE programme they do not lose their benefit. Further education institutions that reach out to claimants who are long out of education should be rewarded and not penalised, for example, by Ofsted, since success rates might be low. I have mentioned that to the Minister in private. Where further education institutions fulfil their educational mission to reach out to those without qualifications, that should be understood in Ofsted's marking and weighting system. Ofsted should not say that such people should attain at the same level as those who are cherry-picked by the establishments, often against those establishments' judgment and drive. However, when people are marked down, colleges have to take those unenviable decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/34">Fourthly, there is a need to build bridges to work. I have alluded a little to that. It is difficult for those who have never been on benefits to appreciate how it feels. I have had a brief spell of unemployment, and even though I knew I had a job coming up at some point in the future it was completely debilitating. It knocks a person's confidence sideways in a way that nothing else can. It destroys self-esteem, it is demoralising and it can often evolve into depression and even clinical depression. It is easy for someone to believe that because they are claiming incapacity benefit, they are generally incapable of any work or any contribution, or of being any use to society or their immediate family. That can happen not just if someone has an ailment or injury but if they have wider mental problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/35">Morale and motivation needs to be revived. Effective person-to-person contact has to be ensured and, above all, our Nottingham approach will recognise thatIB claimants should have an important say in their road map to a better future. We will also ensure that our programmes meet their needs rather than just fuelling local or national bureaucracies.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/36">It will be our ambition to ensure that everyIB claimant has a personalised road map that shows the training or work experience that they need. Over time, we will develop ways of putting real choice in their hands about where they can access the help that their map signposts for them. One way might be to trial a pilot in learning or guidance accounts. Those should not just be the preserve of undergraduates or people at advanced level. As the revival of the learning account concept takes place, I hope that incapacity benefit claimants will find their rightful place in that pantheon. We have to live the rhetoric that many people on incapacity benefit want to get back to work. We must trust them to take the right decisions, with the right help, for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/37">Our Nottingham programme will have anIB claimants customer group, which will let us know whether we are meeting the needs of claimants. We are also considering using Jobcentre Pluses and geographical information systems&mdash;GIS&mdash;to door-knock. There is nothing like good, old-fashioned canvassing: eyeballing people and asking what they need and when they need it, with trained advisers taking the work of the estate-based local learning champions, a concept that we have pioneered in Nottingham, to a higher level.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/38">Why not reward those on incapacity benefit who mentor a youngster at school, help the elderly or take on work as a park keeper as a bridge towards more appropriate and fulfilling work? That would reward those who want to keep working but cannot necessarily work conventionally. It would augment their income and raise their aspirations, confidence and experience. Nottingham is lucky enough to have strong community and voluntary sectors, and it is our aim that they will play a key role in our city strategy on IB issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/39">Finally, we have already identified the work on mental health that we need to do with our health partners. Many people just need personal encouragement. Employment and the full reacquisition of social skills are as important as treating medical symptoms. There are massive service delivery implications for GPs and cognitive behaviour therapists, who will be needed to work not with the odd customer but with thousands of people. That needs to be carefully worked through, with colleagues in the health service and primary care trusts&mdash;particularly in the new era of practice-based commissioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/40">There is also a need for employers to be given awareness training and education; they need to be able to achieve compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and provide appropriate mental health support to employees as well as occupational health support for those returning from time on incapacity benefit. There is a leading role for private and public sector organisations in piloting the arrangements and setting an example.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/41">Most of the surveys and studies do not bear out the view that employers do not want to take people who have been on incapacity benefit, or that there is discrimination against people with a mental incapacity or mental ill health. None the less, an example should be set, not least by the big public and private sector employers. We need the whole team at the table, in the local context, in Nottingham, just as is happening at ministerial level in the national context.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/42">As the Secretary of State said last week, we are beginning</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/43" class="indent">&quot;a process of policy renewal that will help us to better address the endemic problem of worklessness facing many of our major towns and cities. Looking to the future. Being prepared to adapt and change. Always being prepared to develop new and better tools through which we can support local re-generation and economic development.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/44">In the brief conversations that I have had with colleagues from other parties&mdash;the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties&mdash;I have gained the impression that they, too, are anxious to exploit to the full the possible advantages of the new way of ensuring that people on incapacity benefit can lead more fulfilling lives. We certainly want to replicate that at local level. The issue is not a partisan one; it affects people&mdash;indeed, it affects claimants&mdash;of all political views or none, and does not discriminate on those grounds. We should not either.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/45">Our consortium would be keen to add some of the seedcorn funding, which I understand will amount nationally to some &pound;90 million from the deprived areas fund, but we see that only as an addition to the pooled resources that we have locally. A key point will be to enable all the individual organisations and agencies to come together. Of course we will welcome the additional resources, but the project lies in our own hands. The real prize in the next few months&mdash;this is something else that is evident from our consultations&mdash;will be to build a relationship, with trust, with central Government, so that the proposed freedoms and flexibilities can be negotiated with our national partner at the Department for Work and Pensions, to bring about real benefits for the people of Nottingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/46">In Nottingham we know that the number of incapacity benefit claimants needs to be reduced. We are working towards a clear strategy on how to do that. Working closely with all our partners we intend to submit an expression of interest to the Department for Work and Pensions, as soon as the Minister requests it. I wish him well in his new appointment and hope that he will retain his position long enough to see the initiative through. It will be a long-running effort and will take a lot of setting up. I am not trying to keep the Minister from his ultimate rightful post in Cabinet, but I hope that he will be allowed a sufficient period to get involved in the issue and see it through&mdash;not just for Nottingham's sake but for the sake of all the other pathfinders who get city strategies in the first wave. I could not wish for anyone more capable to do the Minister's job, and we do not want to lose him, now that he has started out on the path.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.2/47">I hope that by raising this debate, I have reinforced the Minister's view that the agencies and organisations in Nottingham collectively look forward to meeting the challenge of making a serious impact, not only on the problems of incapacity benefit but on more fully realising the potential of the individuals who claim it but would welcome a return to appropriate work. Nottingham is a great city; our revival is continuing and our ambition is not to let the talents and potential of a single person in our city go to waste.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16a.208.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="208"  time="010:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0031.htm#06051659000070">
	<p pid="a.208.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/2">I want to speak about the national role of the DWP in bringing to fruition some of the local ideas that we have heard about today. The Department's first role is to introduce legislation following the Green Paper, and any indication that the Minister can give us today about the likely timing of that will be gratefully received. Given the range and detail of the issues that have been rehearsed today relating to the strategy in the city of Nottingham and the rest of the country, it is important that sufficient time be allowed to scrutinise the matter in detail. I would be grateful for anything that the Minister can say about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/3">Two other issues relating to the approach so far about which there are real concerns are, first, funding, and secondly, the arrangements for contracting with voluntary sector organisations such as those that the hon. Gentleman told us were involved in the consortium in Nottingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/4">The overall package in the welfare reform Green Paper for funding the pathways to work scheme was &pound;360 million. The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the importance of rolling out the scheme properly in Nottingham. I have looked at the pilots elsewhere, and it is clear&mdash;this is the view of many of the organisations that have commented on the matter&mdash;that &pound;360 million is not enough to ensure that a roll-out on the scale that the hon. Gentleman wants in Nottingham and elsewhere can be taken forward. Even a calculation based on a written answer that I received suggests that the cost of the scheme is &pound;400 per claimant, in which case over two years the total funding needed would be &pound;440 million. However, that estimate does not include the cost of the back to work credit or the condition management programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/5">I was surprised, to say the least, having tabled a parliamentary question to ascertain what proportion of that &pound;360 million is for back to work credit and what proportion is for the condition management programme, to be told simply that the information was not available. That raises concern in my mind about how the Department calculates the figures and whether we will see pathways lite, which is not what people in the One Nottingham consortium or anywhere else really want or need. A further point is that the&pound;360 million will supposedly come from existing DWP budgets. I am keen to hear from the Minister where the axe will fall to release even that inadequate sum for rolling out the pathways to work project.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/6">I mentioned the condition management programme, as did the hon. Gentleman, in relation to necessary medical assistance. A successful condition management programme rolled out nationwide is dependent on a supply of properly qualified professionals such as cognitive behaviour therapists, but there is a shortage of such therapists and they take up to five years to train. It is important that the Minister in his response addresses how to ensure a supply of properly trained condition management professionals and properly qualified employment advisers. I also want to know how the importance of having people in those areas comes up against the current cuts in DWP staff in a number of areas&mdash;and, as I know from my own experience, how that has an impact on morale.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/7">The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the important issue of engaging the voluntary sector and the private sector in delivering many of the back to work schemes that are starting. The separation that that entails and the engagement of such organisations are very important. The Government have talked about that, which I welcome, because a separation between the benefit decision-making process and the back to work help can be an important tool in engaging people in back to work activity without their fearing that they will be challenged on or lose their benefits. That might lead to Jobcentre Plus and the DWP moving into much more of a commissioning role: rather than delivering back-to-work services themselves, they will commission voluntary and private sector organisations of the sort that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/8">However, it is important to know how these contracts are to be set up. I think that that will be specified in legislation at national level; perhaps the Minister will spell that out. The Green Paper addresses the engagement of the voluntary and private sectors on a target-driven basis. In terms of the setting out of the contracts, it is important that there be sufficient flexibility to allow the kind of local initiative that the hon. Gentleman described. It is also important that sufficient time be available within a contract for a local organisation to develop and work through the best methods for engaging people in its area. Too often we hear about voluntary organisations coming up with programmes that, as the hon. Gentleman described, spend too much time working on next year's funding application rather than delivering the services that they are setting out to deliver.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/9">It is also important, as the hon. Gentleman said, that welfare to work&mdash;welfare reform&mdash;provides real support for employers. I was privileged during the Easter recess to visit the Working Links project in the Parkhead ward in Glasgow; some such projects have been picked up on in the plans being developed in Nottingham. One of the most striking things about that Parkhead project is how it engages with employers to help individuals once they have been placed in work not to lose that job. It can often be found that for people who might never have been in work or who have not engaged with the workplace for a long period, the basics of being in employment&mdash;such as turning up on time and dealing with their employer on a day-to-day basis&mdash;are an entirely new experience, and having support to deal with that is very important. I hope that providing real support to employers, and beefing up the access to work scheme, which is very important for helping people with disabilities back into work, can all be part of what the Government introduce.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/10">The hon. Gentleman rightly drew attention to the importance of mental health, and he will know that depression and anxiety-related conditions are now the largest cause of new on-flows to incapacity benefit, and that people once on incapacity benefit for other reasons often become depressed as an associated condition, so tackling those mental health-related conditions is very important. He said that the One Nottingham consortium that was planning to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/11">That requires reform of the personal capacity assessment in particular. In the Green Paper, the Government talked about setting up a taskforce to look into reforming the PCA for people with mental health conditions. I understand that that taskforce has still not been set up. Will the Minister address that? Dealing with this issue is of great importance in terms of the wider point that the hon. Member for Nottingham, North made on the need to provide support that is as locally driven and flexible as possible, to help people in Nottingham who need it to get back into work.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16a.212.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1468" speakername="David Ruffley" colnum="212"  time="010:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0031.htm#06051659000090">
	<p pid="a.212.0/1">That is an important point, which is why I call for the Minister to publish some statistics. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the question is not quite as easy as it looks. If it were, many more people would be getting on buses, and going from one side of Glasgow, Edinburgh or Manchester to the other, and we would not face this problem. I take his point.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">In some quarters, such as the third and private sectors, the Green Paper's proposals have been judged to be rather sketchy. We look forward to seeing detail in the Bill and I urge the Minister to tell us the likely date of its publication, not just for my benefit but for that of the stakeholders outside this place. I shall make it easy for him: can he narrow it down to summer or autumn? A specific month is not necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">I want to raise some points that bear on the likely success of the city strategy model, which are applicable to all other means of welfare to work delivery, outside cities. The first is the key role of the voluntary and private sectors. In the Green Paper, we are told of the city strategy model and that</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Each consortium would also be expected to make use of private and voluntary sector providers to deliver additional employment support.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/5">I shall not rehearse the arguments brilliantly set out in a document from the Oxford Economic Forecasting company prepared for the Employment Related Services Association. In essence, it argues for what the National Audit Office has urged: a complete top-to-bottom change in the letting of welfare to work contracts on the part of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/6">There is not a level playing field. Private and voluntary sector providers already understand that some of the contracts let to them are of very short duration, which means that they cannot plan and invest for the future by hiring people and buying premises. There are low-value contracts for which it is not worth tendering. Short tendering times and last minute tendering by Jobcentre Plus make it very difficult for the third and private sectors to make proper bids. Quite amazingly, there is sometimes a change in the specifications that a private or voluntary sector provider has to meet after their bid has been accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/7">Those issues must be flagged up because of the ambition that we regularly hear about from Ministers, which I share, to get more private and voluntary sector provision, provided it is as effective as or more effective than the public sector alternative. We are talking not about cost considerations but about what is effective in getting more people back to work more swiftly in more sustainable jobs. The private and voluntary sectors are not getting a fair crack of the whip. The city strategy will work only if we reconsider procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/8">My second concern relates to the target of getting 1 million off benefit within 10 years, and there is obviously a disaggregation of that figure: there will be a target for each city. Of course, that will mean not getting 1 million people into work but getting them off benefit. There is a huge issue here for those of us who grind through the statistics with a great deal of joy in our heart&mdash;it is a genuinely fascinating subject. The destination of some of those who come off incapacity benefit will be to return to income support or jobseeker's allowance, or just to disappear altogether. We should place proper emphasis on getting as many of that 1 million as possible back into work, not just off benefit; they are two radically different things.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/9">I shall not delve into the view of Her Majesty's Opposition and my views about whether getting 1 million off incapacity benefit by 2016 is too ambitious. The Secretary of State calls it a stretching target, but I wonder about it. I say that for one simple reason. I pray in aid only what the Work and Pensions Committee said in the past couple of weeks, that the</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Department has not met its commitment to produce incapacity benefits caseload forecasts to 2016&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/11">and that it should do so immediately. It also stated that clarification of the baseline by which the aim will be measured is urgently required.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/12">That must be right, because unless we know what the predicted off-flow is, particularly in respect of those over 50 who will reach retirement age between 2006 and 2016, we cannot get a sensible idea of how well the Government are doing in terms of hitting their target.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/13">That brings me to my third concern, which the hon. Member for Nottingham, North will share: how far will the city strategy or any other strategy tackle the problem of existing claimants? That issue needs a good and thorough airing for the following reason. Having been an old Treasury hand pre-1997, I know how to qualify spending commitments and I noted that page 48 of the Green Paper states something about how the needs of the existing stock in pathways to work areas will be catered for:</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/14" class="indent">&quot;As resources allow, we will, over time, consider extending work-focused interviews to existing claimants&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/15">Three qualifiers in one sentence&mdash;&quot;as resources allow&quot;, &quot;over time&quot; and &quot;consider&quot;&mdash;is not bad. That bears on what so many of us have pointed out: the &pound;360 million from existing budgets to roll out pathways to work nationally seems a serious underestimate.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/16">Why do we say that? We know that incapacity benefit personal advisers will need upskilling, that there will need to be better training and that there is a shortage of therapists. Professor Layard is probably arguing on the high end of the spectrum when he says that 10,000 cognitive behaviour therapists might be needed to deliver pathways as a high-quality intervention in the condition management programme. Listening to this debate, I wondered whether the consortium in Nottingham will have the ability to tackle what seem to be serious supply-side constraints, be they in physiotherapy or cognitive behaviour therapy.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/17">Employers are important in the area of welfare to work. The Work and Pensions Committee said that employers seem to have been</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/18" class="indent">&quot;largely overlooked in the Green Paper&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/19">All of us who speak to the stakeholders&mdash;the voluntary, private and public sectors&mdash; agree with that. No matter how much help and support an incapacity benefit claimant or disabled person may receive, if employers do not change their culture there will be difficulties. They must also change it in respect of statutory sick pay and the 28 weeks for which someone who may still be under contract to a company can take time off work because of illness, be that a mental health condition or otherwise. Employers are not doing enough to intervene and give such people support, because they might have been off sick for six months before they do one day go on incapacity benefit. As we all agree, unless incapacity benefit claimants are helped and supported early in their claim, the chances of their returning to work reduce almost exponentially.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/20">The Minister can help the city strategy model by telling us a bit more about his plans for changing statutory sick pay. What will he do to improve employers' attitudes when they work in consortiums of the kind that the hon. Member for Nottingham, North outlined? What plans does the Minister have to reform medical certification, which is first encountered by a claimant when they are on statutory sick pay and are going to their local GP? We need to hear more about what the Government intend to do with the new personal capability assessment, which is meant to be about what IB claimants&mdash;and those on statutory sick pay who are potential claimants&mdash;can do, rather than just focusing on the illness. To do that, we have to understand what the role of employment advisers in doctors' surgeries will be, not just for individuals on incapacity benefit, but&mdash;I stress this&mdash;for those on statutory sick pay who are not yet in the benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/21">The Minister will want to consider all those points. I had a discussion with him before this debate; we decided&mdash;well, I did, anyway&mdash;that we are men of good will, and that what we were talking about, essentially, is an exercise in improving the legislation in a crucial area of public policy and social justice as much as we can. If some questions raised cannot be answered today, I hope that they will be answered in Committee. I once again thank the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, who has, typically, raised an important issue, and has done so in his own special way.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.0/1">I do not know whether I have to declare an interest based on what my hon.

	<p pid="a.216.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. There has been remarkable progress. The areas where the problem has been greatest have seen the most remarkable improvements and turn-around. There has been genuine progress in the transformation of individual families' material well-being and employment has changed the culture within families. However, even within those families who have an adult in work, there are still too many&mdash;I think it is about 40 per cent.&mdash;in which the child experiences material poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/2">Listening to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase>, I think that the good people of Parkhead will be over-visited, as I, along with the local Member of Parliament,<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1986" name="David Marshall">my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, East(Mr. Marshall)</phrase>, will be visiting the area this Friday to talk about the specifics in the east end of the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/3">London is the richest city in Europe, yet almost half the children in inner-city London still experience real poverty. That cannot be right. We all agree that it cannot be right. The city strategy, pathways into work, the new deal, the national minimum wage and investment in primary education are all about driving those children out of poverty and into opportunity, so that they can help break what is an all too common cycle in generations of families.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/4">I shall respond to some points that hon. Members have made during our thoughtful debate. I hope that it sets the tone for our dialogue throughout the entire welfare reform agenda. I thank hon. Members for welcoming me to this new post.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North made some points about local flexibility for Jobcentre Plus managers, and I shall take him up on his invitation to reflect on whether we have the flexibility right at local level. Our approach to local flexibility must be consistent. If we say that in city strategies, local people who know the local specifics should design a mechanism that helps to drive up employment and alleviate child poverty, it is right that we should provide opportunities for people to tell us what barriers exist in national and regional policies, structures or mechanisms as they roll out those strategies and make their expressions of interest. We will do what we can to remove as many of the barriers and working operations that those who submit well- founded expressions of interest say get in the way of their ambition to deliver a locally designed, effective way of finding people employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/6">Several hon. Members made the point about qualifications. I have said this before, but the generation currently in education is the first for whom the global economy is the norm. People are no longer competing with the person in the same street, country or on even the same continent. It is a global competition. To equip those children and teenagers in the global economy, skills and qualifications are crucial. One sobering statistic is that 40 per cent. of lone parents who are out of work have no qualifications whatever. That is one genuinely worrying statistic.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West alluded to how we provide an opportunity for those folk who have no formal qualifications, are not in employment but have the phenomenal responsibility of bringing up children. We must strike the right balance to ensure that they learn and acquire skills and qualifications, whether academic or others, to make them more employable in the global economy. He gave his own sense of that in terms of the challenge from eastern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/8">A question was asked about the city strategy timetable. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North will receive over the next few days detailed guidance about the expression of interest. Some very good work is being done in Nottingham, but I know that he accepts that if we are going to deliver on our collective ambition, we have to take that good work delivered by good people to a different scale and reach. That is the case for all cities that submit an expression of interest. We expect a delivery plan over the following three to four months. Our current thinking is to have 10 to 15 pathfinders in the first tranche of the roll-out. There is flexibility in that, too, because if there are more than 15 high-quality expressions of interest, we may go further.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/9">I thank my hon. Friend for his compliments on the support that he received from officials at the Department for Work and Pensions. They will welcome his words, because they put enormous energy into the initiative, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" name="Margaret Hodge">my predecessor, the right hon. Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge)</phrase>, who has now gone to the Department of Trade and Industry. She had a personal interest in the initiative. The appropriate level of support and guidance&mdash;but not interference&mdash;will remain available for local consortiums that want additional support and to share best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> raised points about capacity in the health service and the attitude of employers. We are in constant dialogue with officials and Ministers in the Department of Health and elsewhere on the matter. We all share an ambition&mdash;it is shared across Government, so that there is no lack of will and determination to achieve it&mdash;and we are engaged in detailed conversations about capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/11">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1468" name="David Ruffley">the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds(Mr. Ruffley)</phrase> pointed out, if we are to reduce the number of incapacity benefit recipients by 1 million, supporting people in getting work is not all that is needed. We must prevent people from going on to incapacity benefit in the first place. That is a matter of working with GPs, primary care trusts, and, crucially, employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/12">The initiative is not just a matter of employment opportunities and the changing of employers' attitudes towards people on incapacity benefit and people with mental health problems; it is about working with employers to prevent people from slipping out of economic activity into the depression and lack of confidence that we heard described by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, which leads them to leave the workplace and claim incapacity benefit. This is not just about getting people off incapacity benefit; it is about a sensitive approach to preventing them from going on to it&mdash;something that I am sure we can profitably discuss in the next few months. I have already engaged in conversations about that with the national employment panel.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/13">The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds raised points that also arose in other hon. Members' speeches this morning. We expect that the national roll-out of pathways will largely be achieved in partnership with the voluntary and private sectors, with the proviso that he suggested that it should provide value for money and be effective. We think that working in partnership with local agencies will provide the dynamism, flexibility and spark that will help us with the national roll-out.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/14">I have two things to say about the voluntary sector. First, now that we have greater ambitions for the voluntary sector and are asking it to do more, we cannot ask it to do so on a cycle of annual budgets and annual contracts. It is not feasible, fair, effective or cost-effective, and it will not deliver on our collective ambitions. As we all know from our conversationswith representatives of the voluntary sector, when organisations are asked what they want to do first, they often say, &quot;My first priority in my one-year contract is to get a renewal for next year. My main role in week one is to scope next year's funding plan.&quot; It is not reasonable to request the voluntary sector to work in that way, particularly if we are asking it to do more. I hope that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds is reassured by the fact that the pathways contracts, for example, will build a three-year cycle, which will give a greater sense of stability.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/15">My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West gave his own interpretation of the point about vacancies in cities, but it is my understanding that the Department for Work and Pensions has published a detailed analysis. I shall look at it, and if there is a gap in the analysis I shall of course do as my hon. Friend suggested. As to contracting, external consultants are currently reviewing how we contract, and whether we do so in the most cost-effective and productive way. Once we conclude that work, I shall of course share it with hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/16">We have come to the conclusion of a helpful discussion. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North again, and not only on securing the debate. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South-West have taken a keen interest on how we support those who are economically inactive, how we drive up employment opportunities and how we end the cycle of low aspiration in families. Cities are key parts of that. They are engines of economic regeneration and development and I thank my hon. Friend for securing the debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.1/1">It is a pleasure to introduce this debate. I suspect that we will have quite a few debates on the financing of the Olympics in the next six years. It is appropriate to visit the subject now, because we are getting past the stage of general concept and into the practical, gritty reality. The Olympic Delivery Authority has been established and the chief executive of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games is now in place. There is also the public inquiry into the site, and people are beginning to talk seriously about funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/2">In the past few weeks, David Higgins, in almost the first words that he has uttered in his capacity of chief executive of the ODA, has suggested that the infrastructure costs would be not &pound;1 billion, as originally thought, but &pound;3 billion. It was not clear exactly what those costs referred to, but the implication was that the man running the show has a much more realistic&mdash;and pessimistic&mdash;picture of costings than has hitherto been portrayed.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/3">Also, the Mayor has indicated in the past few days that he might have to acquire land, at considerable cost&mdash;pessimists have argued that an equivalent of possibly double the London council tax contribution will be needed, which is not something that was considered previously. I do not know what the truth is on those items&mdash;we shall come to questions about that later&mdash;but costings are now crucial and the issue of a properly financially disciplined games needs to be firmly set out.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/4">I share the all-party consensus that hosting the games is potentially good for Britain and good for London. We should support the games and ensure that they are a success. Success is not just about sport but about funding and the wider economics. My other motives for approaching the issue are several, the first of which is that I represent a constituency in south-west London.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/5">I was surprised and a bit taken aback by the strength of feeling that I encountered on the doorstep in the past few weeks from people who had realised for the first time the extent of the council tax increases that they face&mdash;because of the nature of property valuations in London, many are nearer &pound;40 than &pound;20 a year. It is not so much the cost, which I guess most people can afford&mdash;at least at the upper end of the income scale&mdash;as the feeling that things are open-ended and there is much more to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/6">In trying to justify the games and explain things to my constituents, I appreciate that their response is not just a grumpy reaction to paying for the games. Twickenham is already a sporting Mecca and we are proud of that. There are the usual frictions associated with stadium communities, but we are proud of our association with rugby union. However, the key thing about the sport is that its big events&mdash;from the World cup down to internationals&mdash;are self-financing. It does not depend on largesse from London or the Government. Indeed, one of the gripes of rugby union is that corporation tax has to be paid on its profits, just as if it were a company, and the surpluses go to the Treasury, not back into grass-roots sport as they should&mdash;a point that I have made to the Minister and the Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/7">We now have another big spectator sport in Twickenham. As a fellow Yorkshireman who grew up with rugby league, I know that the Minister will be pleased that Twickenham now boasts a rugby league side that sits above the mighty Wigan in the premier league. Like rugby union, however, rugby league is a self-financing sport and does not depend on subsidy.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/8">We have also have bad experiences locally of national funding of sport, which has jaundiced an awful lot of people's thinking. I suspect that the biggest participant sport locally is swimming. We have one public swimming pool, which is open and heated. For my first five years as an MP, I battled with Ministers and Sport England to get some support from the lottery for the pool. Initially that was ruled out on grounds of pure dogma&mdash;under no circumstances would the lottery support open pools&mdash;but, with the help of the then Sports Minister, we got the fatwa lifted. However, we were then told that although the pool was an admirable project, which would serve many thousands of people and was no longer barred on principle, Sport England did not have enough money, so we had to go for a cheaper patch-and-mend solution. Unfortunately, a few months after the announcement we were told that there were hundreds of billions of pounds available from the sports lottery for the Olympics. I think the Minister will understand that a lot of my constituents&mdash;the tens of thousands who use this community facility&mdash;are a little jaundiced when they hear about the way in which the Olympics are being funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/9">My final local point is that, like all communities, we have local athletes of whom we are very proud. Unfortunately, in the case of Twickenham, the most celebrated name recently has been that of the gymnast Ben Brown, who publicly announced that he was no longer able to continue training for the Olympics because there was no support for him. I know that the Chancellor has subsequently come forward with a handsome sum of money, but I think it was too late in his case.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/10">I paint this picture because I want to try to convey to the Minister the fact that in my area, as in many parts of London, let alone other parts of the country, there are mixed feelings about the way in which the Olympics are being funded. There is a general sense of pride and optimism, but also grumbling. I am anxious that the grumbling should not become anger, and to that end we must ensure that things are properly managed financially.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/11">A second personal reason for wanting to introduce the debate is the work that I did before I became an MP. I was involved in the oil and gas industry, with projects that were often as big as the Olympic games. In the private sector, no less than in the public, there can be massive errors and cost overruns. I have recently been reading about the travails of my former company in its projects off Sakhalin island in Russia, where costs are several hundred per cent. more than budgeted. In the private sector, there are disciplines to deal with that, which we used to call scenario planning. Managers are forced to set out what could happen rather than what they would like to happen and think will happen. In the funding of the Olympic games, I do not sense a hard scenario planning discipline. Are people looking at worst case scenarios, budgeting for them and preparing for the worst possible outcome, not in order to knock the games or undermine them but to be hard-headed and ruthlessly realistic about the prospects? That is my background and why I have come to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/12">We are all concerned with trying to make a success of the games. Success is about money as well as sport. As the Minister knows, recent Olympic games have a mixed history. Some have been unambiguously successful: Seoul, Los Angeles and probably Barcelona&mdash;although there has been an argument about the legacy of the buildings there&mdash;are normally included in that category. Some have been commercially successful, although perhaps not successful in sport: Atlanta is the obvious case. Some were disasters, some for purely political reasons: Moscow and Munich. We have had commercial disasters, of which Montreal is the obvious example. Sydney massively overran and, most recently, in Athens costs escalated from &pound;2 billion to &pound;8 billion in broad global terms, and there is continuing anxiety about how Greece will cover that. We clearly want London to be at the top end of the range, rather than the bottom.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/13">In order to try to analyse the problems, I have been trying to get a handle on the costs of the games. One of the difficulties is that quite apart from the big document that the costs are contained in, they are being presented in many different ways. Revenue and capital are also mixed up, there are differences between cash flow and balance sheet accounting and all kinds of conventions are being used, so it is difficult to get a handle on the costs that we are talking about and how they are being set off against revenue streams. In simple terms, so we can talk from a common base, my understanding is that the cost of the Olympics can be roughly put into three main categories.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/14">First are the operating costs of &pound;1.5 billion, which are predominantly commercial and are covered by TV rights, tickets and sponsorship, although there is an explicit Treasury guarantee on that component. Secondly, there is &pound;2.4 billion in funding from the lottery, London council tax payers and the London Development Agency for the village's essential infrastructure, the transport, the stadiums and the security costs. The third, slightly ambiguous bit includes elements that were to be funded anyway, such as the Lea valley development and the village, which was originally seen as a purely commercial project, but which might not be now, given the Mayor's comments. It also includes the &pound;7 billion envisaged for transport, which may or may not be necessary, but which would be desirable. We therefore have a rough range from about &pound;4.5 billion to &pound;12 billion, depending on what we do or do not include.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/15">The big challenge for the organisers&mdash;the Government are, of course, centrally involved&mdash;is how to ensure that the costs do not explode as they have in other public and private sector projects. I am sure that the Minister is fed up to his eyeballs with all the pessimistic stories about previous public sector projects, but what amuses me is that people always choose the Wembley stadium project as a bad example, when in fact it has been pretty successful compared with many other projects, because the cost overrun is only 20 per cent, the project is overdue by only by a year and almost all the extra costs have been borne by the commercial partner, Multiplex. That is rather a good outcome compared with many other projects, such as the Jubilee line, let alone real horror stories such as the Scottish Assembly or the British Library, which is probably the ultimate disaster case, having cost 10 times the original estimate and been 10 years overdue. Clearly, we are not heading down that road, but a lot of discipline will have to be exercised if we are to get close even to the outcome of the Wembley project, although of course the Government and the organisers cannot allow such an outcome, because the Olympics must be delivered on time.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/16">The central problem is that the organisers must ensure that the project is delivered not only on cost, but on time. Some pretty sophisticated thinking is going into understanding how we can improve on previous public sector experience with big projects by drawing on best practice, as happened in the case of theT5 terminal, which is the model that is now being used. The central problem, however, is that although the Government, the Mayor and the people who will be operationally responsible are thinking about best practice, the people in the construction industry are also learning from experience. People do not get to be the chief executives of big construction companies by being Mother Teresa&mdash;they are hard-headed people and they have learned the lessons. Companies do not want to be the next Multiplex, so they will put in very high bids for contracts that involve rewards for coming in under cost and penalties for going over cost&mdash;nobody will take the risk of overshooting. When the bids come in, I suspect that we will be shocked by how big they are, and Mr. Higgins has perhaps been preparing us for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/17">I want to set out a long series of questions. I hope that the Minister can answer them and that they will trigger discussions among colleagues in the room. I think that they will form the basis for a whole process of questioning and public accountability in the months and years ahead. First, can the Minister explain what Mr. Higgins meant? Which infrastructure costs was he talking about? Was he talking out of turn or was his estimate of the cost escalation sensible and prudent?</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/18">Secondly, and related to that, when will the KPMG study on the cost of the Olympics be published? What is the Government's estimate of construction cost inflation? We do not need to get such information from an expensive commercial consultant, because it is presumably available to the Bank of England and the Treasury. According to unofficial estimates, cost escalation is about 7 per cent. a year, rather than 3 per cent. a year, but is that correct?</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/19">Leading on from that, once the KPMG study has been finalised, who in the Government or the ODA will be responsible for monitoring and modelling the construction industry over the next five to six years? I ask that because an awful lot of work will be going on. I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> spoke about this in a recent debate. Although the transport projects, the London gateway project and the bridge are complementary to the games, they are also competing with the games for construction raw materials and labour. Who will monitor supply and demand in the construction industry? Has anyone got a grip on that? Presumably it is not the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Is it the Department of Trade and Industry or the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister? Is anyone in Government or involved with the project considering the overall flow of supply and demand in the construction industry and how that will affect costs as the project rolls forward?</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/20">There is a question about new items of cost. There is the possibility, raised by the Mayor, of the compulsory acquisition of land&mdash;of London buying land that was hitherto assumed to be part of a voluntary, purely commercial exercise. Will that happen? I do not know what the risks are, the current state of play or the Government's assessment of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/21">There is a series of questions about how the ODA and the various partners to the Olympics will deal with the pressures that I have described. One question is about how they will deal with issues of design. There is clearly a big difference of strategic focus betweenthe Mayor and Lord Coe. I am not a great fan of the Mayor of London, but I believe that he said the appropriate thing for an elected politician when he said that London</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/22" class="indent">&quot;was not in the position of spending additional monies on iconic buildings&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/23">but he was promptly contradicted by Lord Coe, who rather tartly observed:</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/24" class="indent">&quot;We wouldn't want a tin-shed Games on the edge of a city.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/25">Reading those quotations, one sees that there are very different perspectives on how the games and the facilities should be designed and costed. It is appropriate to ask the Minister where the Government sit in that controversy. What end of the spectrum are they at? Do they broadly agree with the Mayor or with Lord Coe? Where will they throw their weight in the argument?</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/26">Another question about how the Government in particular could help with the management of potential costs relates to the subcontracting of much of the construction work. One of the more worrying documents that appeared in the last few weeks was the report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which I am sure the Minister has seen. It says that whereas London's GDP will benefit by some &pound;6 billion, non-London will lose &pound;2.8 billion. In other words, the rest of Britain will be worse off than if another country had staged the event. I present that not as a negative debating point but to make the point that the provinces of Britain could benefit from large-scale outsourcing and prefabrication in respect of a great deal of the work. They will have lower construction inflation, too. Clearly, the process needs to be managed, and I ask the Minister who is managing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/27">There is a series of questions about sponsorship. The &pound;1.5 billion needs to be met through aggressive and successful sponsorship. We all wish the sponsors well. It is a worthy cause and I hope that they are able to raise the money, but it is a big ask, because we are talking about more being raised in sponsorship than the whole marketing budget for British sport in any one year. What happens if the sponsorship falls short and the &pound;1.5 billion operating budget cannot be met? Who is first in line to take up any slack if the sponsorship does not come in as we hope it will?</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/28"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">My hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> has been pursuing a series of issues relating to the link between sponsorship and the integrity, the copyright, embedded in the Olympic symbols. Quite rightly, the Government have been tough in insisting that those symbols should be protected. There is real intellectual property there, and protection is essential to encourage sponsors to come forward. There is an issue of detail, because we are all beginning to hear from small businesses that are irritated or frustrated that they cannot muscle in on the Olympics. The question for the Government is about when they will produce the guidelines that explain exactly how the integrity and intellectual property elements of the Olympic symbols are to be protected. What guidelines will govern people who try to encroach on that terrain?</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/29">There are also questions about security; we know from the Athens experience that that can blowthe financing of the games wide open. Clearly, the Government have to give security priority. If the security budget goes way beyond what was in the bid document, where will the slack be? To what item of the budget will the Government look to offset any escalation in security, as could well arise for very good reasons?</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/30">There is also an issue about the legacy and its costing. Who will benefit from the legacy? In the past few months, a change in the concept of the Olympic village has emerged; the village could become a more valuable, high-density development than was originally envisaged. Presumably, that means that after the games it will be worth a good deal more. That is positive, but who will have first access to that money? Will it be London, the Government or the International Olympic Committee? Under what formula will any upside be apportioned between the various partners? Similarly, who will take the first hit if it all goes badly? I am not clear that there is a clear protocol that defines which of the various supporters and guarantors will be first in line to take both the benefits and the losses that might arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/31">How far have we gone in clarifying what will happen to some of the legacy buildings? I am aware that the IOC has praised the London Olympic bid for the thinking that has gone into legacy work. That is a very positive sign. As one who represents the rugby Mecca, I was somewhat struck by the proposal, current until recently, that the main likely future for the big stadium was to downsize its capacity from 80,000 to 25,000, and that it would probably then be used for a London rugby club. Harlequins, my local rugby club in Twickenham, is good and well supported, but even with the recent expansion of capacity, it operates at about 10,000. It is not at all clear how any London rugby union or rugby league club operating in the east end close to West Ham will be able to pull in anything remotely like 25,000 spectators. The concept I have talked about may have disappeared, but it would be useful to have clarity on whether the issue has been resolved, and if so, in what form.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/32">We acknowledge that it was necessary to enter various guarantees, involving notably the Treasury, but also London as a result of the memorandum of understanding with the DCMS. The lottery is also a potential support. However, from what I have read and discussed, what is missing from the picture is the exact relationship that would exist between those three potential guarantors and support bodies in the event of things going wrong. Who will take the first hit when, and under what conditions? We need more clarity on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/33">Among my constituents there is a mixture of pride and hope on the one hand, and worry, anxiety and even a degree of cynicism about the funding of the games on the other. The feeling is that the present generation of politicians of all parties is only too happy to scoop up the credit for having brought the Olympics to London, but in six, seven or eight years' time somebody else will have to pay the bill. If we are to prevent that anxiety from degenerating into outright cynicism, it is important that we should be absolutely up front and clear about the costs, risks and potential dangers, and that we should face them now.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is traditional to say that, but I also congratulate him on the content of his contribution. He made it very clear that the Liberal Democrats are fully supportive of all the work being done to ensure that London in 2012 has the best ever Olympics and Paralympics. However, he also made it crystal clear that our support comes with a clear understanding that we will be critical friends of the project, and that we will not be prohibited in any way from seeking answers to some of the crucial questions&mdash;questions that were raised not only by my hon. Friend's constituents in Twickenham but by people across the country. I am delighted that he had an opportunity to put a series of questions to the Minister, and I am sure that we all look forward to the responses.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/2">There have been many debates in this Chamber and elsewhere about the Olympics and Paralympics. During them, it has been traditional for the relative merits of the cities of Loughborough, Bath and Sheffield to be aired, and for the virtues that they have to offer in respect of the Olympic movement to be extolled. I am prepared today to agree to a self-denying ordinance to make mention no more of my wonderful city and the contribution it can make, if we get a similar assurance from the Minister in relation to Sheffield.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/3">The crucial thing so far has been the cross-party support for the Olympics. In a recent letter from the IOC to the Secretary of State, the IOC praised that cross-party support and made it clear how important it had been in securing the Olympics and Paralympics for London in 2012. I must place on the record therefore my considerable disquiet at the winning of the Olympic games having been used in a Labour party election broadcast in the run-up to the recent local elections. I know that that concern is shared by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase>. We have raised it with the Secretary of State, and we have been given a clear assurance that such events will not be repeated, which I welcome. We have also been assured that there will continue to be the opportunity for members of Opposition parties to work closely with the Government on the various issues that will no doubt come before us over the next few years, because this is a crucial project. It has not been said so far in this debate, but it has been said elsewhere, that seeking just to build the Olympic park and to make the associated transport arrangements is the equivalent of seeking to secure within just six years two terminal 5s. This is a huge project. My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham is absolutely right to say that it is critical that we examine and question issues relating to the cost of this mammoth undertaking at all stages and to what happens if things go wrong, as they are likely to in one way or another. He rightly asks questions about who will pick up the tab and who will get the huge benefits that may come.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/4">It is crucial that we do not see the winning of the games a year ago as the end of the matter. One of the diligent researchers in my office came across a quotation from Polybius, made over two and half millennia ago:</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Those who know how to win are much more numerous than those who know how to make proper use of their victories.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/6">In a sense, that is what our debate is about: ensuring that we make proper use of our success in Singapore a year ago. Scrutiny mechanisms must be in place to ensure that we do not have the sort of fiasco we had with the millennium dome or the many other public sector projects to which my hon. Friend referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/7">We must ensure, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> rightly said, a sustainable legacy. That includes an environmentally sustainable park and many other aspects. We will be critical friends of the project, and from the outset enormous praise must be given because of the huge progress already made. That progress was recognised by members of the visiting IOC delegation recently. They rightly said that we were years ahead of some other cities that had previously won the great honour of hosting the Olympic games in their countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/8">The London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 was passed in record time, and it will set up the various bodies that run the games. The ODA and LOCOG are both now well under way, and soon we shall see the official launch of the ODA, even though it already has some excellent people on board&mdash;people in whom I have a great deal of confidence. The organising committee has begun to search for the first tier of sponsors, which is an example of good, early progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/9">London 2012 now controls 90 per cent. of the land at Stratford and has done deals with the majority of landowners. As my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham says, we still have the compulsory purchase order inquiry to come, but good progress has been made. Work has already begun on the Olympic site with the burying of what were previously overhead power cables. Recently, Stratford International station has been completed, which will open next year once the final stage of the channel tunnel rail link is completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/10">During the past 48 hours, we have seen the success of the national lottery, not just in meeting the &pound;14 million target for this year's Olympic lottery games but in exceeding it by more than &pound;2 million. We know that work is under way to consider all aspects of cost. My hon. Friend rightly referred to the KPMG study, and we look forward to that report. I hope that it will touch on the issue that he raised of inflation costs. A figure of roughly 3 per cent. has been assumed, but many people are saying that inflation costs in the construction industry are running somewhere in the order of 7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/11">Understandably, there will be concerns. My hon. Friend said that we should be &quot;ruthlessly realistic&quot; about the cost of the games, and that notion should apply at all stages. The fullest information must be made available, so that as many people as possible can be engaged in the necessary scrutiny. We do not wish to be left in the same situation as Athens&mdash;some are saying that it will still have to find somewhere in the region of &euro;9 billion or &euro;10 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/12">We know that there are huge challenges ahead, and my hon. Friend mentioned many of them. I do not wish to repeat things, but I shall discuss additional concerns. A huge challenge is being given to the national lottery in respect of the money that it is to secure both from its traditional funding sources, where money will be taken away, and from the money raised through the specific Olympic promotions. Despite the recent successes&mdash;overall lottery ticket sales have increased for three years on the trot, which is welcome because of the money that is going to good causes&mdash;there are some clouds on the horizon.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/13">One such cloud relates to lottery-style games, which are increasingly being run by gambling operators and have no mandate to raise money for good causes, yet offer lottery-style arrangements. They confuse consumers, are at odds with the duty of the Gambling Commission to ensure that gambling is conducted in a fair and open manner, and are increasingly diverting money away from the national lottery and the good causes that it supports, including the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/14">I also have a concern about possible impacts on the national lottery of the newly-established online lottery, monday. Recently, on the Floor of the House, I asked the Minister whether it had been set up as a result of a loophole being found in the existing legislation. I was told that that was certainly not the case and that it was all perfectly above board. It seems odd that monday is claiming that it is offering a prize of &pound;1 million, yet the operators are set up as a so-called society lottery, for which the legislation requires that the maximum prize be &pound;200,000. The only way in which it can offer&pound;1 million is by linking five individual lotteries, but I understand that such linking is also not permitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/15">We have concerns about how that particular online lottery is operating. It is setting itself up very deliberately&mdash;its advertisements are clear&mdash;in competition with the national lottery. I recall the Minister assuring me during debate on the Gambling Bill that everything possible would be done to protect the national lottery. I am in favour of society lotteries. I moved amendments to propose that such lotteries that provide funding for hospices, for example, would be protected. The monday operators have found a loophole in the legislation, which I hope will be examined quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/16">My hon. Friend and I share the growing concerns of some Londoners about the contribution that they will have to make. My party has argued, and the Conservative party has supported us, that there should be a cap on the total contribution that London council tax payers should make to the running of the games. Londoners will benefit more than those in other parts of the country, but there is a limit to what they should realistically be expected to pay. They should not be put into a situation where they have no certainty about how long they will have to make the contribution for. I must point out something that is rarely said in a debate about London council tax contributions. The total contribution is estimated at &pound;625 million, but the Mayor of London has always made it clear that that represents &pound;550 million going towards the Olympics and Paralympics, and the further &pound;75 million has been included for potential cost overruns.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/17">I am also concerned that Londoners may not get the full benefit that they seek. One concern is whether we are doing sufficient to ensure that people in London have the necessary skills to acquire the jobs that will be created. A recent Local Government Association report expressed concern that not enough was being done about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/18">Another area of concern relates to tourism, for which the Minister also has responsibility.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16a.234.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" speakername="Hugh Robertson" colnum="234"  time="011:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0033.htm#06051659000211">
	<p pid="a.234.0/1">I entirely take the point. However, the central point is that the original budget of&pound;220 million is unlikely to sustain the post <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/2">Thirdly, I have always felt that there is a contradiction at the heart of the process. The Mayor has always been commendably honest about his reasons for supporting the Olympics: he wants to regenerate the east end of London; it is his lifetime's passion. However, that is not the Government's key priority; they want to deliver the 2012 Olympics on time and on budget, as the best games ever. The temptation for the Mayor to try to get a little more for his key lifetime's project of regenerating the east end will be irresistible. That will necessarily add to the pressures on the budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/3">Fourthly, the cost of acquiring land in the lower Lea valley&mdash;and therefore of site assembly&mdash;is bound to have risen dramatically since we secured the Olympics. That is an inevitable product of the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/4">Finally, to pick up on the point made so clearly by the hon. Member for Twickenham, I looked up the inflation rate of building costs, and the current estimate is that it stands at 7 per cent. However, the bid document shows it to be 3 per cent. My second question for the Minister is therefore this: is the funding package of &pound;2.375 billion still accurate, and in particular how have the estimates for security at&pound;220 million and for construction sector inflation at3 per cent. altered since we debated the Bill?</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/5">The third area of concern is to do with LOCOG. It has rightly received wide praise for the progress it has made since the bid was won&mdash;particularly, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> said, during the IOC visit. When the Bill was going through Parliament, we were told that LOCOG would have an operating budget of &pound;1.46 billion. That was made up of&pound;550 million from the IOC; &pound;310 million from ticket sales in its role as an event manager; &pound;100 million from revenue, licensing, merchandising and the like; and &pound;500 million from sponsorship. However, in answer a week ago to a written question that I tabled, the Minister told me that LOCOG's budget is now&pound;2 billion. My third question to the Minister is why has the budget risen from &pound;1.46 billion to &pound;2 billion, and when was that increase announced? In connection with that, does the Minister still stand by LOCOG's original expectation that it would produce a profit in excess of &pound;100 million? Clearly having to raise so much more must throw that profit forecast into doubt.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/6">My fourth area of concern is the BOA&mdash;the fourth pillar of the Olympic board. It is in the market looking for sponsorship. We have raised the issue with the Minister before. Private sponsorship is now an extraordinarily congested field&mdash;a point made by the hon. Member for Twickenham. As far as I could see in my brief survey, LOCOG is in for either &pound;1.5 billion or &pound;2 billion; UK Sport is looking for &pound;100 million, as announced by the Chancellor in the Budget; the Youth Sport Trust, albeit a charitable organisation that has already secured sponsorship for the UK school games, is also in the market looking for money; and the National Sports Foundation, which the Minister launched in April, is looking for private sponsors. That strikes me as an incredibly congested field. A number of sports bodies are likely to be competing with each other and possibly against each other, so my fourth question for the Minister is how does the DCMS, which is the only body that can regulate or act as umpire, plan to regulate the market, and what are its priorities?</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/7">London 2012 has two central sporting objectives. The first is to put more British athletes on the rostrum, and the second is to increase the number of people who take up sport. The first has been dealt with as a result of the Chancellor's announcement in the Budget, but the second very firmly has not. Many people are making encouraging noises about how we want to get more people, particularly young people, involved in and taking up sport for all its health and educational benefits. So far, however, no pot of money will pay for those improvements, and they will not happen by magic. The Greeks tell me that fewer of them participate in sports now, after the Olympics, than before. The Australians, whom I visited last month, told me that there was no discernable take-up in sport as a result of the 2000 Olympic games. The fifth question is how can the improvement in mass participation be financed? Connected to that, does the Minister believe that through Sport England, the structure is capable of delivering the improvement?</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/8">In conclusion, I congratulate the hon. Member for Twickenham on securing this timely and useful debate. I thank all those who have contributed, including my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk, and of course the hon. Member for Bath. I would like the Minister in his winding-up speech to address five key questions. First, what plans does DCMS have to ensure that the whole and not merely the east of London benefits from the games? Secondly, is the funding package of &pound;2.375 billion still accurate, and what are the estimates for security and construction sector inflation? Thirdly, why has LOCOG's budget risen from &pound;1.5 billion to &pound;2 billion, when was it announced and does it still hold to its target of producing more than &pound;100 million in profit? Fourthly, how do the Government plan to ensure that the sponsorship market is properly regulated? Finally, how are the improvements in the mass participation agenda to be structured and delivered?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16a.235.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" speakername="Richard Caborn" speakeroffice="The Minister for Sport"  colnum="235"  time="012:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0034.htm#06051659000219">
	<p pid="a.235.0/1">I shall try to answer the many questions that have been asked, but first I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is always good to update the House, and this is an opportune time to do so. I shall try to answer the questions as I go through my response to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/2">As has been reflected again this morning, <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July 2005</phrase> was a momentous day. There was great rejoicing and a great feeling of pride when Jacques Rogge said London. Several of us present today were at the announcement, and we also saw the fantastic celebrations in London and the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. We must now manage those expectations into reality, and the hon. Gentleman brought us down to earth to start analysing how we are doing so. I hope that what I shall say will provide some assurances that we are well on the way with the management of the project. It will be managed probably as no other major project in which Government have been involved has been.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/3">We are determined that the London Olympic and Paralympic games will be a memorable and inspirational event that leaves a lasting sporting, social and economic legacy, and that not only London but the nations and regions throughout the United Kingdom benefit and gain from it. It has rightly been said that the challenge facing us is formidable. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> said, the biggest construction project in Europe is terminal 5, which is running at &pound;5 billion, but we are embarking on a project twice the size in half the time. By any standards, it is a challenge, but the prize is a legacy that will last for generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/4">The regeneration of the Lea valley&mdash;one of the most deprived parts of the UK&mdash; will make it into a stage fit for the greatest sporting and cultural show on earth. Although we rightly focus on the Olympic games, we must put the event in context. It is the gateway to the Gateway: the gateway to the Thames Gateway, which is a 20-year project and, again, probably one of the largest investments in transport, social and housing infrastructure anywhere in Europe. What we are discussing will bring about between &pound;13 billion to&pound;15 billion of investment, with a lasting legacy of not just a stadium or other sports facilities but housing, as we have heard, improved transport infrastructure, schools and health care. That is an integrated regeneration package, of which the Olympics are part.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/5">The games will also bequeath a powerful sporting legacy to the whole UK, as I have said. Those 60 days in 2012 will give many young people throughout the UK the unique opportunity to see elite sportsmen and women competing at close hand. I have talked to people who saw the 1948 Olympics, and the experience is vivid in the mind of many of them. I hope that tens of thousands of young people will for years to come be affected in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/6">We have heard many times about the inspiration of competing in one's own country. We are determined to capitalise on that, creating a new generation of elite sportsmen and women in the UK. London will inherit major new sports facilities, including an aquatics centre, a velo park, a hockey arena, an indoor sports arena and the main stadium, but the UK will also benefit from top-class sports facilities. That is how what we are doing differs from Australia's approach and that of many other countries that have won the right to stage the Olympics in the past. Through the nations and regions group we shall invest&mdash;and are already investing&mdash;in sport and recreation facilities. An impetus is added in the Olympic context.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/7">The work will also bring considerable lasting benefit to business and the economy throughout the UK. The games are expected to create 7,000 jobs in the construction industry alone. In addition, a further 12,000 jobs could be created as a result of the legacy development of the Olympic park area. A cultural Olympiad is planned to coincide with the games and a wide range of cultural events will be staged throughout London and the UK. Jobs are likely to be created in the cultural sector as a result, and stage managers, lighting technicians, producers and artists will co-ordinate a massive programme of events.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/8">The games will also offer a considerable boost to the tourism industry in the UK, by putting this country in the biggest shop window in the world. The games are seen by billions of people, and visitors will naturally want to see what else the UK has to offer. It is essential to consider tourism&mdash;a matter that the hon. Member for Twickenham raised. It has always been difficult to get visitors to one of the most famous capitals in the world, if not the most famous, to go to other parts of the United Kingdom. The games give us an opportunity to do that. Only yesterday I was discussing with representatives of visitBritain how we could capitalise on the Olympics and other sports events and use London as the gateway to the rest of the UK. We are now receiving a level of co-operation from Visit London that we have not had before.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/9">I am fairly confident that we shall be able to do what was done in Sydney where there were an extra1.6 million visitors between 1997 and 2001, with a spending power of 6 billion Australian dollars between them. We should expect to do equally well or, I should hope, better, in 2012. Tourism industry leaders forecast that hosting the 2012 games should be worth at least &pound;2 billion to our visitor economy. Those benefits will fall particularly on London. However, we are committed to ensuring that the 2012 Olympics will maximise the potential for job creation, training and business growth throughout the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/10">Early progress has been made, as both Government and Opposition Members have I think acknowledged, as, recognising the need for fast progress, we either passed or at least framed much of the relevant legislation ahead of <phrase class="date" code="">6 July</phrase>, to get a flying start if London proved successful. By <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase> this year, more than &pound;40 million had been spent on essential preparatory works. To date the Chancellor has announced an additional investment of &pound;200 million in our most talented athletes between now and 2012. The London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 has received Royal Assent, and I want to acknowledge the support that we received from all parties in the House, and indeed in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/11">The Olympic Delivery Authority has been established and its board appointed. Its board is one of the most significant to have been created while I have been the Minister, and I was very pleased at the number of people who came forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/12">Let me digress slightly, however, on the issue of the Olympic board. The IOC delegation came here to look at the progress that is being made, and everybody will acknowledge that its report was very good, but I get very concerned when I see articles that are as ill-informed as the one in yesterday's <i>Evening Standard</i>. It was headed &quot;Get a grip now on the Olympics,Ms Jowell&quot; and was written by Rowan Moore, who I understand&mdash;I have never met the guy&mdash;is the paper's architectural critic. The IOC delegation made it clear that it gets all the cuttings from the British press, and its members are incredibly well informed&mdash;they know what goes on in Select Committee and in the press.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/13">Let me quote just one bit of Rowan Moore's article to show how ill informed he is. He writes:</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/14" class="indent">&quot;For much of the time since the bid was won, it has been hard to know who is in charge. It took months to announce the chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority, when it could usefully have been done a day after the victory.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/15">A 10-year-old student of politics would know a lot more about how this place works than Rowan Moore does, and the headline ought to be &quot;Rowan Moore, get a grip on the facts&quot;, but the fact remains that the article will now appear in the IOC's files. Rowan Moore is doing a disservice to the Olympics and to this nation. As Opposition Members have said, no one could have been more open than the Department, and I invite Rowan Moore to come and check his facts.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/16">What concerns me more, however, is that when the Secretary of State asked the editor of the <i>Evening Standard</i> whether we could have the right to reply to the article just to put the record straight&mdash;after all, we are talking about a national programme&mdash;she was denied that right. I say this more in sorrow than in anger, but that article, with its ill-informed commentary, will now be in the IOC's file, and we do not even have the right to reply to put the record straight. Broadly speaking, in the run-up to London winning the bid, editors and the press were very supportive&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.238.1/1">In a minute. The press were very supportive, and we welcomed that. All I am saying to them is, if they want the information, they can come and get it, but will they please not put such ill-informed articles in papers and then try to argue, on the back of that, that the thing is likely to go wrong? As the hon. Member for Bath said, there will be constructive criticism, and that is absolutely right&mdash;we can accept that.</p>

	<p pid="a.238.6/1">May I draw the Minister back to the debate? As I sat on the Back Bench, I noted that he was asked more than 37 questions, but he has spent the past three and a half minutes on what I would suggest is a rant about an issue that he should take up outsidethe room. He should perhaps spend the next 13 to15 minutes answering our questions, which are totally relevant and which would give him the opportunity to put on the record his support for our comments and to let us know that the financial probity of the games is secure, rather than spending time on a rant against a newspaper.</p>

	<p pid="a.239.2/1">If the hon. Gentleman wants another Adjournment debate, he can have one. I am more than willing to spend hours in front of hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/2">The EDAW consortium has been appointed to design the Olympic park and infrastructure. The relocation of high-voltage overhead power lines into tunnels underground is under way to deliver an essential improvement to the environment of the Olympic park. A charitable trust to support cultural and sporting initiatives associated with the games has been announced. That initiative is worth &pound;35 million and will see the end of the Millennium Commission with the funding going to the trust. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase>, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport hosted a business summit, which was attended by more than300 business representatives and was massively oversubscribed. The summit set out the key challenges and opportunities facing business, including up-to-date information about procurement. That was followed up with a further business summit in the west midlandson <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-09">9 May</phrase>, which was organised by the regional development agency, Advantage West Midlands, which is very proactive. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>, the Olympic Delivery Authority announced updated plans for the Olympic park site. Camelot's income target for raising lottery income for 2005-06 was met, and indeed exceeded by some &pound;2 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/3">The first &quot;Go for Gold&quot; scratchcard was launched on <phrase class="date" code="">28 July</phrase> and sold faster than any other &pound;1 scratchcard launched by Camelot since November 2002. A second edition was issued in September 2005. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>, a new &pound;1 winter sports scratchcard, &quot;Win Gold&quot;, was also launched. During its recent visit, the International Olympic Committee expressed itself well pleased with the progress that is being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/4">In 2003 the Government agreed a public sector funding package of &pound;2.375 billion to deliver the Olympic venues and infrastructure and to secure the development of athletes. The package will be funded from the Olympic lottery, the sports lottery, other lotteries, the Greater London Authority and the London Development Agency. The bulk of the package&mdash;&pound;1.5 billion&mdash;will be met from the lottery. The Olympic lottery has already raised some&pound;16 million. It is expected to raise a total of &pound;96 million in 2006-07 and to deliver a total of &pound;750 million by 2012. The sports lottery will deliver &pound;340 million for elite athletes and associated sports infrastructure. The &pound;200 million of Exchequer money that the Chancellor announced in the Budget is on top of that.</p>

	<p pid="a.240.1/1">I will come to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/2">Other lottery funding of up to &pound;410 million will come on stream from January 2009-10. The London Development Agency will deliver up to &pound;250 million from 2008-09. The Greater London Authority has agreed to contribute up to &pound;625 million from the London council tax precept. The funding that comes on stream this year accounts for around a quarter of the public sector funding package. I recognise&mdash;this was clearly spelled out during the London local elections&mdash;that hon. Members are concerned about the impact of the precept on London council tax payers, particularly in west London. However, to put the financial impact in context, it is expected that average London home owners in band D properties will pay 38p a week, or a total of &pound;20 a year. As hon. Members know, that formula has been used in many United Kingdom cities, including Manchester for the Commonwealth games and Sheffield for the World Student games. That is reasonable because those cities received considerable investment in their infrastructure. The formula has been tested, and given the massive benefits that the games will bring to the UK and particularly to London as a whole, we feel that it is justifiable to put that financial burden on London.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/3">I recognise that hon. Members are concerned about the risk of increased gambling addiction&mdash;the hon. Member for Bath raised the matter&mdash;resulting from the Olympic lottery. The Gambling Commission will be looking at the monday lottery, and if there is a move away from what Parliament intended, we will revisit the matter. We believe that the risk of problem gambling will be very low. The national lottery is not generally associated with problem gambling. Indeed, around70 per cent. of the adult population play the National Lottery, but spend relatively small amounts of money. The average weekly spend on the lottery was just over &pound;2.84 in 2004-05. In 2004, only 3 per cent. of calls to GamCare&mdash;the organisation that looks into problem gambling issues&mdash;concerned national lottery products. Olympic lottery games need to be approved by the National Lottery Commission, and the NLC's statutory duties include preventing excessive play. It would not license a game that it considered encouraged that.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">The hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> raised the issue of how cost increases would be addressed. We went round the world and looked at cities that had staged the games: Munich, Barcelona, Sydney and Moscow. We also looked at what Athens and Beijing were doing. The cities that we looked at, Sydney especially, were generous in giving us advice. As I have said before, two or three major themes emerged from that. One is that the first two years are crucial if people are to keep costs on track. What is needed is a company with the powers of compulsory purchase, which we have, and planning, and a robust budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/5">It is also important to ensure that there will be a sustainable legacy. If there was any failure in Sydney, it related to the legacy. Sydney is spending &pound;10 million a year servicing not debt but a main stadium that does not have a tenant. Another problem is that there are now two arenas in Sydney, although it wishes that there was only one. The tennis went down to Melbourne, which now has a massively underused tennis park. The legacy is important in terms of both sports infrastructure and the cost of that. We have considered the issue carefully as we have gone through the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/6">It also became apparent to us that there are three stages to an Olympics. One is winning the right to stage the games, and we put together a formidable team to do just that for 2012. The second stage is producing the infrastructure, which basically involves construction and which we are doing through the ODA. The third stage is to deliver the games, which is the role of LOCOG. That body is chaired by Seb, and Paul Deighton is the chief executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/7">The overarching body is the Olympic board. There are three stakeholders: the Government, the Mayor and the British Olympic Association. The Olympic board provides a strategic overview. The Government have learned the lessons of Wembley and the dome. There will be no Government interference in the ODA other than to give clear instructions and to ensure that it carries out its duty within a budget that will be defined and negotiated with the ODA. The ODA board is skilled; indeed, it has expertise like no other board that we have put together. I am very confident that the chief executive, the chairman and indeed the entire board will carry out the project and will do so with transparency.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/8">We are committed to tight control of the funds, but we have never shied away from the possibility that costs will increase. The Government have given assurances that they will act as ultimate financial guarantor should there be a shortfall between Olympic costs and revenues. The 2003 memorandum of understanding between the Government and the Mayor envisages how any cost increase would be managed. We have rehearsed this many times in Committee, but I repeat that the memorandum explains that, should the shortfall between Olympic costs and revenues exceed &pound;2.075 billion, the Government would expect to discharge that responsibility in a sharing arrangement to be agreed as appropriate with the Mayor of London, and through seeking additional national lottery funding in amounts to be agreed at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/9">A number of hon. Members are suggesting that we place a cap on the amount of London council tax that can be drawn on to support the development of venues and infrastructure for the Olympic games. As we have rehearsed, we do not accept that proposal. Capping the share of one contributor would simply increase the amount required from others. That would not be consistent with the pressure that needs to be exerted to keep costs down. Nor does it seem reasonable that council tax payers in west London should not make a contribution to the cost of the games. London as a whole is a major beneficiary of the games, so it is only fair that council tax payers in London as a whole should bear an appropriate share of the costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/10">Hon. Members will know that we are undertaking a review of costs, which includes building inflation. In the light of that review, we shall consider howany additional costs should be met within the terms of the arrangements agreed. The cost review work embraces many strands, including security, venuesand infrastructure, reducing risk, contingencies and taxation. Maximising private investment is also important in the review. Any revised estimates will be reported only when they have been agreed and when the cost review has been completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/11">The staging of the games is the responsibility of LOCOG, whose budget is now &pound;2 billion, which takes into account inflation from 2004 through. The move from &pound;1.4 billion to &pound;2 billion is due to the costs of inflation over the period of the games.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16a.250.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" colnum="250"  time="012:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0035.htm#06051659000307">
	<p pid="a.250.2/1">I will keep the matter under review, and to answer the hon. Gentleman, I shall meet the women's institute shortly to discuss some of those issues. The figures that I have show that women are well represented in the further education sector. We want to maintain that, and we must keep the issue under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/2">My hon. Friend also made important points about the social profile of learners. I take her point that there is concern that the lowest take-up is among the poorest groups. However, we have more information on the social profile of learners than is sometimes suggested. For example, of those doing their first full level 2 qualifications, almost one in four had no qualifications at all, and the remaining 76 per cent. had a qualification below level 2. I cite that example just to suggest that the targeting strategy has an effect and is working. However, I accept her point, and we must keep the matter under review and conduct more research into who benefits. I intend to take that work forward, and I shall keep in contact with her about that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/3">I very much take my hon. Friend's point about family learning and extended schools. She gave as an example local courses where parents have the opportunity to help their children and, at the same time, help themselves through reading. There is no reason why such courses, where they are valued, should be lost. For example, we have specific programmes through the Learning and Skills Council, often run by local authorities and aimed at helping families learn together. The wider family learning programme is worth &pound;12 million a year and helps 50,000 families. The specific programme for family literacy and numeracy is &pound;25 million a year and helps 70,000 families.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/4">In addition, the Government have committed&pound;680 million in start-up funding during 2006 to 2008 to enable schools to provide access to the core offer of extended services. Part of that offer is parenting support, including sessions for parents to read with their children. It is an important initiative, and I am sure it will be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/5">My hon. Friend also talked about short courses and the policy that we are pursuing of moving away from short courses towards longer courses. The issue must be seen in perspective: the majority of short courses are short skills for life programmes and other&mdash;particularly IT&mdash;courses. The short skills for life courses should be part of larger programmes aiming for the achievement of qualifications. Other short courses appear to be of limited benefit to the progression of learners, and we must consider the issue in that context.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/6">My hon. Friend talked about the importance of personal and community development, and as she knows, we have maintained its level of funding. However, we have rightly said that we want LSC partnerships at a local level to determine better the priorities for that expenditure. We do not want it centrally driven to the same extent.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/7">My hon. Friend discussed the union learning fund, and like her I think that it is an unsung success story of this Labour Government. If I may make a political point, it is one of the most effective ways in which the Labour party and the trade unions work together. It has brought real benefits by introducing into the education and training system, through the support of their peers, people who would otherwise not have taken that approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/8">My hon. Friend talked about having a mountain to climb in terms of people who left school or college 20, 30, 40 years ago with no qualifications. It is the most significant challenge that we face. On all the evidence they are the people who miss out on social, economic, health and other advantages. We need to focus on reskilling those adults, and we are doing so through the level 2 &quot;Train to Gain&quot; initiative. It is one of the most radical policies that this Government have pursued: for the first time saying to adults in the workplace who do not have a full level 2 qualification that the state will guarantee that level of education and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/9">The recent change that we made in the further education White Paper to extend the free entitlement up to level 3 and the age of 25 is a significant step forward, as is the foundation learning tier to which I referred earlier. However, all that comes down to priorities, and we are a Government who have significantly increased investment in the further education sector. In that context, we have rightly said that the priorities must be 16 to 19-year-olds, adult basic skills, and the roll out of &quot;Train to Gain&quot;. We want to do more than that, but we cannot say that we have those priorities and then have a whole set of other priorities. I know that that is not what my hon. Friend is saying, and we need to keep the issues under review to monitor their impact. However, if we are saying that those core priorities are genuinely important, we must commit resources to them&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/10">Hywel Williams (in the Chair): Order. We must move to the next debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-16a.253.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" speakername="Michael Weir" colnum="253"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060516/halltext/60516h0036.htm#06051659000317">
	<p pid="a.253.1/1">I am pleased to appear for the first time under your distinguished chairmanship, Mr. Williams, and I am sure that this will be the first of many such occasions. I should say at the outset that the debate is not about the effectiveness or desirability of tax credits but about the way in which the system that is used to calculate and deliver them fails many of my constituents. Although I shall be referring to specific cases, they illustrate a general problem with the tax credits system.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/2">In my first term in Parliament, by far and away the most complaints that I received concerned the Child Support Agency, and no one was at all surprised when the Government effectively threw in the towel, conceded that the agency was unworkable and ordered a redesign. Sadly, over the past two years, the number of complaints about tax credits has risen substantially and now rivals the number of complaints about the CSA. Unless the Government take urgent action to tackle the problems, they will simply multiply, and we will end up in the same situation as we did with the ill-fated Child Support Agency. Several constituents have told me that they are so dispirited and worn down by the problems that they have encountered that they will no longer claim tax credits, even though they are entitled to them. That is a terrible indictment of a system that is supposed to help those who are most in need.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/3">The problems that I shall describe affect constituents across my constituency and, I assume, across much of the rest of the country. The first case that I want to bring to hon. Members' attention is that of Katie Adamson, from Forfar, who first came to my office in December 2005. She applied for child tax credit first as a single claimant and then jointly with Anthony O'Hare. Her problems began with the annual review in September 2005, when she received a letter asking whether there were any changes in her circumstances. There were not, so she phoned the department, and the person she spoke to told her that she could send the form back blank or not send it back, because confirmation that there had been no changes had, in effect, been recorded as a result of her call. Being a cautious and sensible young woman, however, she sent the form back anyway.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/4">Soon afterwards, Katie received a letter from the tax credits office informing her that it had heard nothing further regarding changes in her circumstances, so her tax credits would be stopped. At that point, she contacted the citizens advice bureau. The tax credits office told the bureau that it acknowledged the error and would recommence the payments. It may come as no great surprise, however, to hear that that did not happen, and that brings us to the crux of many of the problems with the system. As MPs, we contact the tax credit hotline or the tax credits office, and those involved acknowledge that a mistake has been made, but they seem incapable of rectifying it, because of the computer system that they operate. In many cases, we seem to have slipped into the &quot;Little Britain&quot; sketch in which the computer says no, and that is it.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/5">To return to the long-suffering Katie, however, nothing happened for 11 weeks, and the arrears accumulated. The computer system was blamed for the problem, although, to be fair, the department agreed to make a manual payment for four weeks. However, Katie had to make a 40-mile round trip to Dundee, at a not inconsiderable cost, to collect it, and she received nothing further after that. After she contacted my office, we contacted the technical department and were assured that the error had been sorted out and that payments would be made to her bank account as normal. Bizarrely, however, she was then told that she would receive the full arrears for 11 weeks, but that she would have to pay back the four weeks that she had received as a manual payment in the interim. Quite how that was a sensible way to deal with the situation escapes me.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/6">Finally, my office managed to secure arrears payments of &pound;224.94 for Katie. Even then, however, we noticed that she was still due &pound;85.96, so we contacted the department again to point that out. It accepted that there was an error and agreed to forward the arrears, but nothing has been received to date. That was bad enough, but at least Katie had got through the maze and got most of the money that she was due. However, nothing about the tax credit system is quite as simple as that. She and her partner Tony then received three award letters on the same day.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/7">The first letter related to Katie's single claim prior to December 2005 and claimed an overpayment of &pound;1,383.12. The tax credits office has since agreed that that was sent in error. The second notice claimed an overpayment of &pound;224.92. Yet that related to the period for which it had already been agreed that a payment of &pound;85.96 remained due to her. That contradicted what she had previously been told. The last letter referred to the new tax year, 2006-07. However, a portion of the overpayment referred to in the previous letter had been deducted wrongly from the award. We are still chasing the office about that. I do not know whether hon. Members can follow those complications, but I am sure that they can begin to appreciate the &quot;Little Britain&quot; sketch.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/8">Worse still, the tax credits office claimed an overpayment of &pound;1,210.20 for the tax year 2004-05. My office raised that several times, until the tax credits office finally responded that there was no record of any overpayments for that year, but repeated the claim that there was an overpayment of &pound;1,383.12 for 2005-06. That was the sum that it had previously agreed in writing was an error. It was going back and claiming something that it had already said was not due.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/9">This is just one case, but it is a complete mess and it illustrates a problem. Both my constituent and my office have been told one thing, only to receive correspondence totally at odds with the verbal advice and sometimes at odds with previous written advice. The computer gets the blame, but is there no point at which human interventions in the system can stop cases spiralling out of control and creating havoc for people like Katie Adamson?</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/10">If the case were an isolated one, I should put it down to bad luck, but it is far too general a problem. Ishall briefly note a few points about other cases. Another Forfar constituent&mdash;Forfar seems particularly unfortunate in experiencing such cases&mdash;faced a claim for more than &pound;10,000. The couple had made an application and received an award. Before it was paid, the husband was paid off, but quickly got another job at a reduced income. They received a letter telling them how much they would be paid, which they queried, saying that they thought it was incorrect; but they were assured that it was correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/11">Eventually, when the inevitable happened and money was reclaimed from them, they were told that the problem was that their two children had been input into the computer system twice. They appealed on that basis, only to discover later that the real reason was that the wrong income had been entered on the computer. Part of the problem appears to have been that the couple never received a formal award notice after the change of job setting out how the amount was calculated, but the tax credits office refuses to accept that.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/12">I can do no better than to quote a paragraph from a letter from my constituent:</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/13" class="indent">&quot;I still get the impression, from the person I spoke to, that the only way they will reconsider the matter is for me to prove that I did not receive a proper award notice, which is impossible. She said that the computer showed an award notice was sent and that would be correct&mdash;she could not answer when I asked whether their computer showing that I worked forty hours a week for nil pounds while claiming for child care would be correct too.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/14">Again, the computer says no. That seems to be the crux of the problem. The department relies on the computer absolutely, but will not consider that it could be wrong. It reminds me of the constituent who repeatedly questioned the amount that was awarded, and was assured that it was right. When, inevitably, a repayment was claimed, she received a letter saying that although she had been assured that it was correct, it was not reasonable for her to accept that. What definition of &quot;reasonable&quot; does the department use?</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/15">Yet another Forfar constituent had been receiving working tax credit since 2003. In October 2005 she was told that she was no longer entitled to it, and a repayment of &pound;1,200 was demanded. That was queried and the office agreed that it was a mistake and that she was still entitled to working tax credit. However, no payments were made in November, which left her very worried. When she contacted my office we contacted the department, which again pleaded computer error and promised manual payments. A manual payment was made in December, but in the same month she received three applications to complete and two demand letters, one for &pound;1,000 and one for &pound;700. She went to the Dundee office and was advised to appeal on both demands. She was then also told that the computer had now ended her claim&mdash;the computer seemed to be dealing with things all by itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/16">My office contacted the tax credits office and received a letter in response that was totally incomprehensible. I am a lawyer, and I could not understand what it said, so we contacted the tax credits office. Surprise surprise, it could not understand the letter either, even though it had sent it out. Perhaps the computer had moved on to composing the letters as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/17">In early March, the department promised to cease sending demand notices and to try to resolve the problem. Thankfully, for once, no more notices have been received but there has been no resolution either. That lady is still not receiving the money to which she is entitled. The case is unacceptable, and it has left this lady in worry. I wrote to one of the Minister's colleagues on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April</phrase>, but I await a response.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/18">It is not just the people who have come to see me in my office who are having problems. After I secured the debate, Arbroath citizen's advice bureau&mdash;we have left Forfar, for a change&mdash;contacted me and brought to my attention a case that it was dealing with. A young couple had received an overpayment demand for more than &pound;19,000 for the period between 2003 and 2005. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-07">7 November 2005</phrase>, the CAB wrote to the Department and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/19" class="indent">&quot;Please treat this case as a matter of urgency as it is having a major impact on the well being of our clients as well as creating a crisis in their ability to manage their finances.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/20">The department asked for a copy of the original application, which had been made online and of which the constituent had no copy, although I appreciate that that system has been changed in the interim. No response was received until April of this year, when the constituent received another demand notice. The CAB wrote again on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April</phrase>, and made a formal complaint. It has now received an acknowledgement and a promise of a full reply, but that came only after a formal complaint was made. It is simply not good enough that it has taken six months from when the original application was made to reach that stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/21">Even this morning, I got yet another letter. A constituent had come to my office who had been chased for a repayment. The tax credits officer said that the payments had been made to their employer, but the employer denies that any such payments have been made. The letter states that due to technical difficulties the office is unable to bring my constituent's records up to date. Again, the computer is unable to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/22">It seems to me that the problem is that the system is too complex and relies on a computer system that is not up to the task. There appears to be no process that allows human intervention to deal with a problem once it occurs. The demands keep coming, irrespective of what is said to me or to anyone else. Even when it is agreed that manual payments will be made and the person goes to collect them, the situation is not resolved, the computer does not deal with it and there seems to be no way to break into the cycle of the computer program. That is exacerbated further by the forms and letters, which are very difficult to understand. As I say, I am a lawyer and I find them difficult. Many of my constituents, who are far from being lawyers, simply cannot follow the information that is given to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/23">The time frame for dealing with cases often means that people are trying to reconstruct information from a number of years with little written information from the applicant, but a mountain of often contradictory information from the department. As I said at the outset, it seems that the complaints about tax credits are now rivalling those about the Child Support Agency. I appeal to the Minister to consider the problem seriously. I am sure that he will tell me that tax credits are a good thing, and are helping a lot of people. I am not here to dispute that or agree with it. I am here to ask about the system, in particular the computer system that seems to have a will of its own in dealing with my constituents. Unless the problem is tackled now, things will continue to deteriorate until, like the CSA, the tax credits system cannot continue. I appeal to the Minister to deal with the matter now, and to tackle that dreadful computer system.</p>

	<p pid="a.257.2/1">I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman did so, because I shall certainly want to take up those cases with officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/2">As the hon. Gentleman anticipated, I want to tell the Chamber that we must not lose sight of what has been achieved through the tax credit system. It has been vital in two important areas. First, it has reduced the extent of child poverty; and, secondly, it has made work pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/3">The system provides financial support, which is worth more than &pound;15 billion this year, to nearly 20 million people. In Scotland, it is worth about &pound;1.5 billion; and in the hon. Gentleman's constituency last month, 7,100 families benefited from tax credits, including 10,900 children. The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the problems faced by some of his constituents, although they form only a small proportion of the 7,100 families who benefit from the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/4">The hon. Gentleman has raised 10 cases this year in which people have had a problem with tax credits, and I readily concede that it would have been much better if he had not had to raise any. My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General and I will be happy to look at the cases that he has referred to today, but I hope that he will acknowledge how much the tax credit system is delivering to a large number of families in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/5">We have set a target&mdash;I am sure that the hon. Gentleman supports it&mdash;to eliminate child poverty within a generation. Tax credits have helped lift some 700,000 children out of relative poverty since 1997, including 80,000 in Scotland, which is broadly in line with the milestone that we set to reduce the number by a quarter by last year. The UNICEF report &quot;Child Poverty in Rich Countries 2005&quot; states:</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/6" class="indent">&quot;The proportion of children living in poverty has risen in a majority of the world's developed economies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/7">However, it says that there are exceptions, and the country achieving the biggest reduction in that proportion has been the UK. It points out:</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/8" class="indent">&quot;Until the late 1990s, the United Kingdom had one of the highest child poverty rates in the OECD.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/9">It then says that</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/10" class="indent">&quot;over the last six years, the UK government has pioneered an approach to the monitoring and reduction of child poverty that seems to be working.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/11">The tax credit system has been key to that success.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.2/12">For a family with two children on half average earnings, the tax credit system provides &pound;4,400 a year. The least well-off can now receive up to &pound;107 a week, compared with just &pound;20 per week in 1997; and the number of people receiving tax credits is seven times higher than the number of those who received family credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.1/1">I am pleased to have been able to secure this important debate. I am aware that there is a great deal of interest in this topic, and I wish to associate myself with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1907" name="Helen Jones">the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/2">I want to draw attention to the problems that are being experienced in adult education in Liverpool and in other large urban areas as the unintended consequence of changes to Government funding for further and adult education. In particular, I want to focus on a highly valued course at risk, &quot;Second Chance to Learn&quot;, in the hope that the course's future can be secured.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/3">There are three key players in this matter: the Government, the Greater Merseyside learning and skills council and Liverpool community college. Government provide major funding and set national priorities, the Greater Merseyside LSC allocates funding based on those priorities, and the college itself makes decisions on specific courses, although that is strongly constrained by the priorities already set and the funding allocated.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/4">The Government, through the Department for Education and Skills, have given priority to securing employable skills and expanding participation among 16 to 18-year-olds. They prioritise level 2 and level 3 qualifications to be funded partly by transferring money from level 1 and courses inauspiciously designated &quot;other&quot;. That is where the problem lies. The transfer of funds threatens the adult skills for life provision and second chance learning, where Liverpool community college has been judged as &quot;outstanding&quot; by Ofsted's adult learning inspectorate in its 2005 inspection.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/5">Greater Merseyside LSC's initial allocation to Liverpool community college reduced its adult further education budget by &pound;2.7 million&mdash;8 per cent. That was in order to transfer money to fund higher priority courses. Following representations, the allocation has been increased by &pound;1.2 million, and I understand that further negotiations are still under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/6">The Government's national priority of improving employability is to be commended, and is highly relevant in Liverpool where, despite the city's growing economic success and a 43 per cent. reduction in unemployment since 1997, high unemployment persists. For example, in the Riverside constituency the unemployment rate is 12 per cent. and male unemployment runs at 18.1 per cent. If we look more closely at local areas, we see that those figures increase. For example, in the Granby ward, the unemployment rate is 26 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/7">It is essential that people are equipped with the skills to take up growing opportunities provided by successful regeneration. The unanticipated consequence of this national policy is, however, to reduce funding for people who either need support to enable them to step on the skills ladder or require education that boosts their confidence as individuals and as active citizens. The courses at risk include those that address that objective. The courses may well become the gateway to further qualifications, but they are valid in their own right.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/8">The courses are highly relevant to Liverpool, where long-term deprivation persists: 46 per cent. of Liverpool's special output areas are in the highest 5 per cent. in England, and 23 per cent. of Liverpool's SOAs are in the 1 per cent. of most deprived areas in the country. According to the Basic Skills Agency, 27.3 per cent. of Liverpool people between the ages of 16 and 60 have poor literacy skills; the corresponding rate for England is 24 per cent. In addition, 32.3 per cent. of Liverpool people in this age group have poor numeracy skills, compared with a figure of 24 per cent. for England. The constituency of Liverpool, Riverside alone has 10,900 people on incapacity benefit&mdash;the highest number for any constituency in the country. For many families with that long-term problem, formal education has not been seen as a high priority and there is a high level of alienation. That is why provision characterised unflatteringly as &quot;other&quot; is so needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/9">Liverpool community college remains the arbiter on the provision of specific courses, although, as I said, its decisions are heavily constrained by funding decisions taken elsewhere. It is an exceptional college, whose skills for life agenda and approach to social inclusion and widening participation were judged by Ofsted to be &quot;outstanding&quot;. The Ofsted inspection also found that there is &quot;consistently good teaching&quot;, &quot;strong strategic leadership&quot; and &quot;strong financial management&quot; at the college. That is praise indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/10">I am concerned that a range of the college's courses is at risk because the national funding priority does not take full account of Liverpool's needs; similar problems are also found in respect of other urban areas. I wish to draw attention to the future of the long-standing course, &quot;Second Chance to Learn&quot;, which is now in jeopardy. That stand-alone course is provided at the college's new city centre, Duke street premises, and attended by 180 students. It has run for 30 years, originally through the Workers' Educational Association and the Liverpool university Institute of Extension Studies. During that time, 3,000 students have participated.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/11">Although there are exceptions, most students are aged over 50, have limited formal educational qualifications&mdash;many have none&mdash;and do not progress to higher education. They do not fit employment-oriented priorities. Yet the course is highly valued. Recently, I met students who attend the course. They described their experience as &quot;life transforming&quot; and explained how it had given them new confidence, encouraging them to be active citizens fully engaged in the regeneration of local communities. They recounted how they had influenced younger members of their families, who otherwise would not have been so influenced, to become interested in education. That demonstrates how second chance learning has helped individual development and community cohesion.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/12">The college, under the pressure of its funding constraints, now proposes to disband that stand-alone course in the city centre. It plans to provide the individual subject options in the course through local drop-in study centres or DISCs. Those would become part of foundation programmes that address basic skills needs and work towards level 2 entitlement. The proposal has been met with consternation. It means the end of the stand-alone &quot;Second Chance to Learn&quot; course, which will no longer remain an entity in its own right and no longer be held in the city centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/13">Students have told me how coming to a stand-alone course has made them feel part of something important and given them a feeling of belonging. They have explained how meeting in the city centre is stimulating and enables them to join students from other parts of the city whom they would not otherwise have met. They talk about how misconceptions have been broken down and how prejudice has been addressed. They talk avidly and enthusiastically about how going to a course in the city centre brings them into contact with younger students. They find that to be part of an important learning process for themselves as individuals. One student who had no formal qualifications told me:</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/14" class="indent">&quot;I have a thirst for knowledge. A light has been switched on; now it is to be switched off.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/15">Another said:</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The course should stay city centre-based so that students like me, who have never wandered out of my own neighbourhood, can meet other students from across the city.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/17">The students on the course are predominantly older people with few formal qualifications, who had a gross lack of self-confidence but found a new sense of well-being and optimism by attending the course. The local newspaper, the <i>Liverpool Echo</i>, has drawn attention to the city centre, stand-alone course. Numerous students, some of whom progressed to employment and others who found a new sense of confidence, praised its worth. They stressed its value in making them more aware and active citizens as an essential part of the widespread regeneration in Liverpool.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/18">I appreciate the context in which the decision is being made. The Government's stress on employability is commendable, and certainly highly relevant to Liverpool, but it has led to a reduction in funds for confidence-building courses that develop and educate individuals, which are also required. Such courses might be the gateway to qualifications, but they are also important in their own right in encouraging active citizenship, awareness and confidence, and are part of urban renewal and local need.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/19">More joined-up thinking at Government level is required. Civic engagement and social cohesion are important parts of the Department for Communities and Local Government's strategy on urban regeneration. Liverpool has benefited greatly from those regeneration strategies, with significant funds coming to the city, particularly into my constituency, to develop local neighbourhoods, improve housing and employment prospects and develop a sense of civic renewal.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/20">In 2001, the Department of Health launched the national service framework for older people. That identified the importance of lifelong learning. The Centre for Educational Research and Innovation atthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development highlights the link between learningand health for older people. It seems perverse to jeopardise courses that have such a positive effect on both of those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/21">The Government's national priority of increasing employability is extremely important to Liverpool, but so is the need to build confidence and develop the individual. The facts that I have recounted today about the long-term deprivation in Liverpool, the need to upgrade basic skills, and the long-seated deprivation that leads to too many people feeling that education is not for them, emphasise the importance of courses that boost self-confidence and self-awareness. Those issues are being addressed successfully by Liverpool community college, which is an outstanding institution, but they are being put at risk by changes in funding priorities decided nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/22">Liverpool community college is renowned for its work with under-achievers. It has already secured, from its initial application, additional funding from Greater Merseyside LSC, which is aware of local needs, but is constrained by national priorities. A significant funding gap remains, and I urge the three players&mdash;the Government, the LSC and Liverpool community college&mdash;to ensure that those important parts of adult education do not fall victim to the schools-based priority. I urge both the Government and the LSC to make funding available so that both local priorities can be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/23">Liverpool's needs require a combination of employment-related courses following the national priority and others that develop citizens as individuals. Those two objectives might well go together, but do not necessarily do so. This is an essential part of adult education in the area of under-achievement. Both aspects are important and a part of regeneration. &quot;Second Chance to Learn&quot; should remain a stand-alone, city centre course, and I call on Liverpool community college to review its proposal. I ask the Government to look again at the implementation of the strategy and to increase flexibility, so that national Government policy can bring the maximum benefit to areas such as Liverpool.</p>
