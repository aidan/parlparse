<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-21a.1.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/halltext/60321h01.htm#60321h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1.3/1">In 1999, I wrote a pamphlet for the Society of Labour Lawyers called &quot;Rape in Court&quot;&mdash;that is a clever double entendre. If anyone wants a copy of the valuable first edition, an odd one is still available. In it I said that, in 1985, 25 per cent. of rape complaints brought a conviction, with no recorded assertion that the conviction rate was unjustly high. By the date of its writing, complaints had risen to an all-time high but the conviction rate for rape was just 9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/2">I set out the need to restrict the rules that allow cross-examination about previous sexual history, to encourage women who are afraid of that kind of cross-examination, and to address the findings of a Canadian researcher called Calton that where jurors hear information about a rape complainant's previous sexual history it leads to a decrease in the perception of the accused's guilt, and that that varies directly with the amount of negative information put before a jury. A defendant was seen as most guilty where nothing was known about her. Calton also found that if all the material alleged against her was denied by the complainant, the perception of the defendant's guilt still decreased&mdash;a recipe, one may think, for unjust acquittals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/3">The change to restrict cross-examination about previous sexual history was brought about in section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, as far as its admissibility to show that she consented was concerned. It is subject to a number of exclusions, but basically it is excluded. However, that has not worked.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/4">In &quot;Rape in Court&quot; I hesitated to recommend that the defence that the defendant believed that the woman was consenting even if she was not should be changed so that only a reasonable belief that she was consenting would do. Rape is having sex when the victim does not consent&mdash;and, in those days, when the attacker did not believe that she consented. I was wrong not to want to change that. A jury is told to decide whether she was consenting first, and simply to end the case if she might have been. Only if it is sure that she was not consenting should it go on to consider whether, even so, the defendant might have believed that she was. At that stage, in the jury's view she has had sex forced on her.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-21a.1.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/halltext/60321h01.htm#60321h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.1.5/1">I agree that those findings were troubling, and one can only say thank goodness for the other two thirds. However, I venture to wonder whether those factors would carry the same force if the same people were not answering a question in a survey, but were in a jury confronted by the deep trauma of a rape complainant. Therefore, I am not totally pessimistic about those outcomes, but they are serious.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2">If, at the stage where the jury is told that it must consider consent, and that only if it is sure that the complainant has not consented should it go on, the jury finds that she has had sex forced upon her, it is told that next it must look into the question whether, even though it is satisfied that she was not consenting, the defendant might have thought that she was. In those days, if he said that that is what he thought, even if she said she was screaming her refusal, for whatever reason&mdash;perhaps because he is a man who thinks that all women who say no mean yes&mdash;the jury had to give him the benefit of the doubt and acquit him. Therefore, somebody who had had sex forced on them while screaming their refusal would get no justice because the man's state of mind carried the day&mdash;and her suffering meant very little. That was changed in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, and that was correct. A belief in her consent does not now count unless it is reasonable, so the jury not only looks at his state of mind, but asks itself that second question, probably testing his honesty through the prism of reasonableness, but also redressing the balance between him and her. Therefore, there have been two important changes in the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/3">There have been many other changes. In 1999, special measures became available to allow a complainant an easier time in court; the public can be excluded, or she can give evidence from behind a screen. In 2002, the joint inspectors of the Crown Prosecution Service and the police found serious failings in investigations and prosecutions. Lobbyists from the women's movement were happy that at last authoritative sources&mdash;as it were&mdash;were supporting them. There was an action plan from the Government, which is being implemented. Consent has been redefined as agreement by choice, a model intended to show the need for active consent, and not to muddle it with passive submission. Where the complainant was unconscious or in a restraint situation there is a presumption that she was not consenting and he did not think so. Judges now have to go on a serious sexual offence training course. Also, sexual assault referral centres offer a very supportive model&mdash;a place of first resort&mdash;for complainants. All those changes have taken place; the Government have made those serious moves, and they are to be applauded for seeing the problem and helping.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/4">However, what are the conviction rates? Seven years after the publication of my pamphlet and all those steps later, they are worse. Instead of the 9 per cent. that prevailed in 1999, 5.3 per cent. is the average nationwide conviction rate. The British crime survey, in which people are asked about their experiences of crime anonymously and for no other purpose but to record them, suggests that 47,000 women were raped in 2004 and that only about 15 per cent. reported that to the authorities. Rape crisis lines suggest that the figure is even higher. There is a myth that there are lots of false allegations of rape. Home Office research that I will refer to shortly found that 6 per cent. of those reported cases were probably false&mdash;that is small in comparison with the acquittal rate of 94.7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/5">Let me explain the point that I am making. Those who talk to the British crime survey will be telling the truth, and those who phone rape report centres are doing so for help and are unlikely to be seeking help for something that did not happen. Therefore, those numbers&mdash;47,000 in a year of whom only 15 per cent. report&mdash;are likely, on first principles, to be accurate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/6">The conviction rate of 5.3 per cent. is 5.3 per cent. of the 15 per cent. who reported, which means a conviction rate in respect of those who suffer rape of less than 1 per cent. Of those acts of rape, 57 per cent. were perpetrated by men who were known to the assailant. All rape is deeply traumatising, but the trauma and long-term effects of being raped by someone that a person knows can be worse than those of being raped by a stranger; it calls into question not just the conduct of the assailant but the woman's judgment for ever being with that individual in the first place. Rape is a deeply traumatic event. The term for the fallout between the number of rapes and the number of convictions is attrition, and that is the subject of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/7">What is happening and what can we do? There is no doubt that over the last decade we have succeeded in increasing the number of complaints&mdash;not necessarily because more rapes are taking place, but because women have been encouraged to come forward&mdash;but the number of convictions has been relatively static. The research&mdash;&quot;A Gap or a Chasm? Attrition in reported rape cases&quot;&mdash;looks at 2004. Although some of the statutory changes that I have talked about were to do with the trial process, the biggest drop-out is right at the beginning of the case. We must look first at the large number who simply decide not to report at all&mdash;about 85 per cent.&mdash;and wonder why they do not report. A number of studies have looked into that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/8">It is true that, curiously, some people do not name the event that has befallen them as rape; they do not think that it is rape. A number of them do not want to report because they are afraid of their family and friends knowing, and feel some shame. However, the bulk of the reasons are to do with not thinking that the police or any other criminal justice agency will define what has happened as rape, fear of being disbelieved by those agencies, fear of being blamed or judged&mdash;in particular if they have a previous sexual history&mdash;by those agencies, distrust of the police, courts and legal process, and fear of further attack or intimidation. In other words, a large proportion of those who do not report have very low faith in the criminal justice system. That is why they do not report.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/9">Attrition point 2, if I may call it that, is due to people who drop out almost straight away or do not get beyond reporting, and do not even give a statement. Some 34 per cent. of cases that are reported are lost at that very early stage. The import of the research is that the agencies were not pleasant and not supportive. Those respondents who did not even make a statement although they had gone with the intention of reporting cited as key factors being disbelieved or discouraged from proceeding by the police and fear of the criminal justice process. The availability of women police officers, women crisis workers and women forensic doctors was very important, and lack of those has also played a major role.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/10">A proportion of women chose not to proceed because they wanted to take back control of the issue, but a lot of those had no contact with the police for some time after their initial report, and no offender had been identified. There is a real suggestion that many felt that they were waiting too long, could not take it any longer and needed to put the event behind them. That amounted to 34 per cent. of the withdrawal rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/11">The third point of attrition is called insufficient evidence, but to that must be added two related categories: cases in which no offender is identified, and cases in which there is no prospect of a conviction. Those are the categories of the documents surveyed, and they account for a further 36 per cent. of all reports. The pro formas that the researchers found related to a failure to trace a named assailant and assessments by the police of weak cases or cases with no prospect of conviction. Some cases in which the assailant was not identified are most interesting. Of 239 cases in which the police could not identify the assailant, they made DNA tests in 19 only. In five cases, samples were sent to, and got hits on, the national DNA database. In 30 cases, the situation was clear: there were no forensic findings at all, so there was no DNA to send. However, in all 190 other cases it is completely unclear why nothing was sent to the DNA database.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.0/1">What the hon. and learned Lady says may be perfectly true&mdash;I have no reason to dispute it&mdash;but does she agree that the attrition of rape cases to which she refers may be equally applicable to other crimes of assault? Does she agree that the police may regard those who hit people in the street as not being guilty of a real assault if both involved were drunk, or something of that kind? I am not trying to diminish her case, but I fear that the police are not as active as they might be in pursuing other crimes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-21a.5.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="5"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/halltext/60321h01.htm#60321h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.5.1/1">The hon. Gentleman may well be right that if two people are drunk, the police do not put much effort into the case; I am not in a position to say. However, there is no doubt that all statistics show that the drop-out or attrition rate for rape is far higher than that for any other assault.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/2">My hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General looks after the CPS rather than the police, and of course the CPS has enormous influence and control over the police. It is clear that the 2002 inspection, just like the research of 2004, shows scepticism about whether rape is a real crime. The attitude is, &quot;Don't send a sample off to see if he's a criminal; it's highly unlikely that he is if he knows her. He's her boyfriend and something's gone wrong.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/3">So, many assailants are not identified in situations where the woman knows who he is but does not know his address or cannot put a proper name to him, because the police do not check that up. In at least eight instances from the sample, the identified defendant absconded. I have here a story in which when a woman complained, the assailant</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/4" class="indent">&quot;contacted the police, and said oh, it was all a big mistake, and could he come and see them? And instead of saying 'No, we'll come and see you,' they said, 'Well come up on Monday' . . . So what did he do? Sunday, he got his brother to go down to London, to collect his car, and he caught the first train, bus, walked, whatever, boat, out of the country. Gone.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/5">I doubt that that would happen with many other kinds of crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/6">In the remaining types of case in the sample&mdash;those in which the assailant was not identified&mdash;police decision making turned on evidential issues, all connected with the complainant. Largely, those were cases in which the woman's account was regarded with suspicion or was not supported by any other evidence; cases in which her credibility was explicitly referred to as questionable simply because there was no support for it; and cases where previous, unsuccessful allegations of rape cast doubt on current complaints. Inconsistencies, perhaps explicable by the trauma, were relied on in 27 cases, and in 26 cases the police and the CPS simply took the view that the sex was consensual, and that was the end of it. In all the cases in that group, about a quarter of which were &quot;no prospect of conviction&quot; cases, the decisions were made or advised by the CPS. Some of those &quot;no prospect of conviction&quot; cases involved women with learning difficulties or mental health problems and people who had made previous allegations.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/7">Two earlier studies have shown the complete failure to make progress on cases involving women with learning difficulties and mental health problems. That is a really difficult problem. How can such a person sustain their account against cross-examination? Specific attention needs to be devoted to developing prosecution strategies that will help those vulnerable victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/8">Having chronicled the rather poor history of the CPS seeking to drive investigation, I want to draw attention to the impact of previous allegations on decision making. Where it is mentioned that the complainant has complained before and been unsuccessful, the cases are dropped. The data on multiple attendees at some sexual assault referral centres suggest that there is a group of women who are subjected to repeated sexual victimisation by different assailants. Currently, that vulnerability functions as a cue to dismiss the allegations, but if one thinks rationally about this, it could be argued that the entire attrition process will produce thousands of complainants each year entering a group that, should they have the misfortune to be assaulted in future, will mean that their complaint will be treated with even greater scepticism. The sheer fact of the attrition rate means that there will be increasing numbers of women who have complained before whose accounts will, consequently, be disregarded on a subsequent occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/9">A perplexing aspect of this category of cases is the number of them in which the police and CPS thought that witnesses proved that the sexual encounter had been consensual. However, in no case was there an eye witness. One of the complainants said that she thought</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/10" class="indent">&quot;they were just going through the motions . . . The forensic stuff was never . . . sent off . . . the investigation consisted of them . . . getting&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/11">the defendants in and</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/12" class="indent">&quot;giving their story, sending off questionnaires to students at the college I was at . . . .And people wrote things like, 'She appeared to be really happy in their company that evening,' which of course I was, because I hadn't just been assaulted by them&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/13">then.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/14" class="indent">&quot;However, that, the officer in the case said, was what would make it quite impossible for there to be a conviction and off it went.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/15">That is a prime example of the woman's case being reasonably clear. However, evidence that truly could not bear comparison with an individual's account was being used, exactly as the researchers' report says, to throw doubt on her account and say, &quot;This is not worth taking forward.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/16">All these examples seem to bear out the fears that characterise the decision of women not to make a report at all: that the matter would not be investigated and taken seriously, and that they would not be believed, but would be doubted if they had any previous sexual history. Such matters seem to show them that they were absolutely right not to take the case forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.1/17">The last attrition point before trial is CPS decision making, which accounts for a relatively small group of cases that drop out at that stage, although it is correct to say that the CPS had offered opinions on large numbers of previous advice files, so it bears responsibility for many of the cases to which I have already referred. The researchers say that there is a shift in the CPS towards engagement with inter-agency processes and recognising the needs of victims. There is also a policy change towards the development of specialisations, which are new and welcome, although their implementation is inconsistent. However, they need to be linked to a focus on building cases, rather than doubting them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-21a.7.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="7"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/halltext/60321h01.htm#60321h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.7.1/1">Most of this sample postdates that change. The researchers complained that the CPS has been involved in advising at an early stage, but it should have been saying to the police, &quot;That is not good enough; you should send the DNA away and try to arrest this person. You shouldn't rely on those questionnaires. Go back and do it properly.&quot; The complaint is that the CPS is not driving the process. The researchers acknowledge readily the change towards a supportive approach from the CPS&mdash;my hon. and learned Friend has a good deal to be proud of&mdash;but, none the less, they make those comments on 2004 material, and it was 2004 when the change came into play, as I recall.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/2">There is a further drop rate at trial. Cases involving people under 16 were twice as likely to result in a finding of guilt as those involving over-16s. The absence of alcohol or drugs was associated with conviction. External injuries, which act as corroboration of oppression or force, meant that there was twice as likely to be a conviction. Those who had been to SARCs held on and gave their evidence better, and there was a higher conviction rate from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/3">I am sure that hon. Members are aware that the report is a decent-sized piece of research, which, although it is not quite as big as &quot;War and Peace&quot;, is a lot bigger than I can fully give an account of here. I shall give a summary of it, which is always subjective. I suggest that the report is read. I hope that I am putting it fairly, but it needs deeper perusal. The researchers conclude:</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The belief amongst some criminal justice . . . professionals that many complaints are false, that victims are to blame for 'risk-taking', places unreasonable requirements on complainants to demonstrate that they are 'real' and deserving victims.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/5">They quote from another piece of research and acknowledge:</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Only a sober young woman, who does not have a bad reputation, who has not behaved . . . provocatively and who has said no in the right way can be raped, and only by a young man who is sober and 'deviant' and with whom she is not in love.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/7">The researchers say:</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/8" class="indent">&quot;It is the awareness of these realities, and the fact that their credibility will be questioned in court (and, potentially, their sexual history raised), that was the most potent reason behind women's decisions to withdraw their complaint. Very early decisions to not complete the initial elements of an investigation are influenced by careless and insensitive treatment by police officers, as well as an existing perception of not being able to face any potential court process. Examples were uncovered of miscommunications, where police officers, in good faith, honestly conveyed the unlikelihood of a conviction and the difficulty of the court experience. These messages, whilst accurate&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/9">were taken as discouragement.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/10">In terms of understanding early withdrawal, victim care and satisfaction are important. The researchers paid great credit to the CPS and the police for increasing and improving the level of victim care and satisfaction enormously, compared with studies conducted even in the 1990s. However, although they say that that has improved, far less attention has been given to improving investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/11">All this is pretty well as it was in 2002 and 1999, when I wrote the famous tome that I have referred to. So, what more can we do? I had the good fortune to have a conversation with a senior, experienced circuit judge, who has requested to remain anonymous, but was good enough to talk to me in my part of the country about how he saw rape, as it were, at the coal face. He said that juries just will not have it unless there is corroboration; they take a moral and, perhaps, practical view that a lot of young women have had far too much to drink and are out for a good time, which might include having sex on the dance floor or somewhere nearby. He said that most acquittals are pretty quick, even after a three or four-day fight. Corroboration, he said, is the most important thing and without it the case is pretty hopeless.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/12">Looking back at all the criticisms of the police, who did not send the DNA and relied on questionnaires and did not investigate people to whom the person had complained&mdash;all those failures of investigation&mdash;the judge put his finger on what rape researchers know. It is an unusual confluence of views from women in the rape lobby and judges that it is failures of policing and the failure of the police to be driven by the CPS into better policing that account for a great deal of this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/13">The judge also told me that the police do not investigate day-to-day matters well at operational level; they throw resources at getting target criminals and when there is a murder, the sky's the limit on the investigation, but they take rape insufficiently seriously. He said, &quot;There is not a keen enough mind at an early enough stage being applied to how corroboration can be obtained in these cases.&quot; He also referred to the admissibility of previous sexual history, which is covered by section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, and said, &quot;It always goes on previous sexual history.&quot; The idea behind section 41 was that the application to put in previous sexual history should be heard in advance of the trial, but he said, &quot;Well, that will never happen. There are so many rapes and judges are shuffled about a lot, so it is simply not practical to do the application ahead of time. The defence would simply retake the point at the beginning of the trial.&quot; However, he also said that the point was not major, because the application is mostly simply not made. But trying to make it ahead of the trial would have a limiting factor; &quot;rightly or wrongly, we would want to hear what the victim said, to form a view of her evidence before deciding whether her previous sexual history was relevant&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/14">An academic called Neil Kibble was commissioned by the Criminal Bar Association to research the operation of section 41, and he concluded that it ought not to have been passed and that there was no point to it. Although it is an arrogant thing to say, I do not agree with his conclusions about his own research. A small number of judges found that the tests that section 41 made them apply to their own thinking made them focus more clearly than otherwise on the relevance of previous sexual history, and led to their excluding such evidence on occasions when they were confident that, but for those tests, they would have put the evidence in.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/15">It is cheering rather than depressing that the section has made some difference. However, the limiting factor on section 41 exclusions is and has always been that it excludes previous sexual history only to cover consent. One could not put in previous sexual history to show that the victim was more likely to have consented because she had sex all over the place. However, such history could go in to show that the defendant believed that she was consenting. That is the second test, and showing such belief has never been, and cannot be, excluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/16">If a defendant says in a trial that the victim was consenting, it is implicit that he is running both defences at once&mdash;first, that she was consenting and secondly that he believed that she was consenting. Whatever the merits of trying to exclude such evidence so that it cannot show consent, in any trial such evidence can come in around the legislation for the purposes of showing belief in consent. That, of course, is a problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.1/1">What my hon. and learned Friend has said is absolutely right, and ties in a little with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> was saying. As such evidence can come from any kind of rumour or gossip, the victim may not expect it, and throwing such things on a person in public has a very powerful effect. It is imperative that the issue should be tried earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/2">The judge whom I mentioned said that it would not be easy if the issue were tried earlier, because a new judge might have a different view from that of his predecessor and it would be open to the defendant to try again at trial. However, the ruling of the first judge could be made binding on the trial judge, so that it would not be possible to reopen the issue. I agree that it is important that the decision should be made early so that the victim knows about it and can decide not to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/3">However, the more important point is that it is easy to get round the whole of section 41, because implicit in saying that the complainant was consenting is the defendant's belief that she was consenting. However tightly we draw the exclusion, if it does not apply to belief and consent, it will not protect her.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/4">The national average conviction rate for rape is 5.3 per cent., but there are amazing differences between different areas of the country. I am poor at geography, but I think that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough comes from somewhere near Northamptonshire, in which case he has cause to be pleased with his neighbours. Northamptonshire had a conviction success rate of 13.8 per cent. in 2004. The county prosecutes 25.25 per cent. of everybody arrested against whom there is a rape complaint, and convicts 53 per cent. of them. Compare and contrast Suffolk, where 11 per cent. of those complained against are prosecuted and only 14.25 per cent. of that 11 per cent. are convicted. Suffolk has a conviction rate of 1.6 per cent. of those complained against&mdash;compare 13.8 per cent. with 1.6 per cent!</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/5">My own police and CPS area of Cleveland prosecutes a fifth of people against whom there is a complaint and convicts 37 per cent. of them&mdash;a 7.76 per cent. conviction rate, higher than the national average, despite the negative views of the judge that I mentioned, who comes from that area. Cleveland has a very good CPS service. Lessons must be disseminated from good areas such as Northampton&mdash;south Wales is almost as good&mdash;to the poor areas that let everyone down.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/6">Finally, great successes are being reported from specialist courts; the ones that we know of, although they are new, are domestic violence specialist courts. Is there a lesson to be learned? In such courts, cases, having been investigated by a specialist prosecutor, are heard on the same day, in the same court, before magistrates who are trained specialists.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/7">All the old-fashioned attitudes that permeated domestic violence&mdash;that it is a private matter, part and parcel of a relationship, and that we should not interfere&mdash;are simply ousted by much exposure and lots of training. Could we oust in the same way the poor attitudes that permeate the investigation and prosecution of rape? Is there scope for specialist sexual violence courts?</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/8">South Africa has specialist sexual violence courts. They are relatively new and I know little about them. As the theme that runs through my pamphlet, the 2002 inspectors' report and this research is that attitudinal difficulties, from the first reporting to the failure in the Crown court, are the problem, is further specialism, including specialism of the fact finders at court, the way forward?</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/9">All these five points should be considered seriously, because unless they are and unless we take more steps, on top of the good ones that have been taken, when, to public acclaim, I write the second edition of &quot;Rape in Court&quot; soon, I shall hardly have to change it at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.0/1">I am always grateful that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> gives us regular opportunities to debate this issue, and it is important that we do so. I pay tribute to her consistent and well-informed work, including the writing of the pamphlet she mentioned, which I had not heard of and had not read. I would be happy to take, borrow or, if she is really desperate, buy a copy of it to put on my shelves.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/2">I also pay tribute to the Solicitor-General. He has taken the issue extremely seriously. I detect a change of heart among Law Officers and the Crown Prosecution Service to try to address the fundamental failure of the criminal justice system in relation to violated and attacked women and to women in general who are victims of any offences of violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/3">I pay a third tribute, to someone who is not present in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the Chamber: my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase>, who, after many years leading on women's issues for our party, has just stepped down to do other things. Just the other day she spoke in a debate to mark international women's day. It is important that there are doughty people in all parties who will ensure that these issues are always on the agenda. Such people, who take up the cudgels, must include men as well as women.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/4">I want to make a few short points, because I do not want to repeat the statistics or the evidence. Depending on the timing of this debate, I may seek Members' indulgence to leave just before the end if the debate runs for the full time allowed, Mr. Olner. I have duties elsewhere but I am keen to hear the responses of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the Solicitor-General and the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/5">First, it was good that four years ago the Government, having consulted all the agencies, came up with the rape action plan. I know that we are nearing the time when the audit of that will be published. I should grateful if the Solicitor-General would tell us when that will be, because the statistics that we have heard, and which I knew, which show the very low average conviction rate need to be evaluated against an objective assessment of what has been done since real effort has been made over the past five years across the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/6">In that context, I welcome the advertising campaign that is starting this month. It seeks to remind women of their rights and of their entitlement to be protected in every respect, unless they consent expressly to any activity. Indeed, by and large, even such consent would not protect somebody from prosecution if they acted illegally and assaulted someone.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/7">I start with a fairly simple view about crime and criminality, which is that, in essence, there are two sorts of crimes: crimes against the person and crimes against property. Crimes against the person are always more serious. I start from the simple presumption that a crime against the person&mdash;a physical attack on somebody else&mdash;should result in the attacker losing their liberty. That should be the expectation. I have a simple view about that and the public expect that to happen as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/8">Although I appreciate that it is early days, I hope that there will be a serious, informed and robust response when the Sentencing Guidelines Council produces its anticipated recommendations, because if the reports are correct, there appears to be a failure to understand that fundamental point, in relation to rape and other offences against women, and in relation to other offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/9">I am not in any way being histrionic. Indeed, in the Chamber the other day I counselled against being histrionic. These things must be taken in a considered way and we have to await the report of that body. It is good that such a body is doing that job. That was the result of debates that we had in Committee and on the Floor of the House. There is now a better system for evaluating sentencing and the types of sentences, which I welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/10">I want to make a point that was raised not so long ago by the hon. and learned Member for Redcar in written questions to the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs. One of the things that will bring confidence into the system&mdash;I appreciate that it is marginal&mdash;will be increasingly to have a gender balance in our magistrates and Crown courts, and in the judiciary as a whole. Of course, one cannot presume that just because a woman is chairing the bench, or because there is a woman district judge or a woman circuit judge, there will be a different attitude, but my perception is that, as yet, the British judicial system does not look like and reflect Britain, and therefore it does not command the confidence that it should. I hope that we continue to make the strides that the Government have been trying to make to broaden the diversity of those who judge these things. The juries are diverse but the judiciary currently is not. That is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/11">My next point was touched on by the hon. and learned Member for Redcar. There is always a dilemma in having a devolved system of justice&mdash;a devolved system of policing and so on; there is a great debate going on about policing&mdash;and complaining that the statistics vary in different parts of the country. However, there are some worrying differences in the statistics. Given all the efforts made to ensure that there are specialist advocates and specialists within the CPS, it would be helpful if the Solicitor-General would say why, in his opinion, such considerable variations exist between different CPS areas and different police areas. That such variations exist is more important in terms of the percentage of the allegations that are taken through to prosecution than in terms of the conviction rate. The conviction rate is obviously less explicable, but that first statistic should not involve such variation. There is a proper question to be asked and answered on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/12">I want to endorse the point about corroboration, which will always be the most important issue. All our experience of criminal matters shows that an unsupported allegation, particularly in a personal relationship context, is far less likely to be believed.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/13">I ask the Minister to examine one central point. I am interested to hear the responses of other colleagues on this matter. Over the years, there have been developments to make it easier, for women in particular, to go and tell somebody about an attack. I have visited the new centre that was set up for victims in the Camberwell magistrates court in my borough. However, it appears from the figures that only four of the 43 police services in England and Wales have specialist rape units. I appreciate that some groups of people who specialise in dealing with allegations of rape might not be called specialist rape units. It troubles me that so few forces appear to have a dedicated group of police officers dealing with such offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/14">More important than having either a victims' suite at court, although that is important, or a specialist rape unit, although that might be important, is the fact that it is still not normally comfortable or convenient for women to report much of the crime against them. I have a strong sense that the reason why most women do not make a complaint is that there is nowhere that they can go, where they will feel confident, before they get there.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/15">It is not easy to go into a police station, because members of the public do not know who they will meet in the porch on the way in and whether they will encounter the right sort of attitude when they speak to people inside. It is not necessarily easy for them to go to Victim Support, because to do so might give them a feeling that they are being stereotyped&mdash;or they might be self-stereotyping&mdash;and they do not want to be seen going in and out of such places.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/16">I have a proposition. I have done a great deal of work with a co-operative police service and co-operative people in the CPS, Her Majesty's Courts Service and the local authority, and I still do not feel that we have received an adequate response in my part of the world, south of the river in London. Without being gimmicky in any way, it might be worth while for each local authority area, town and community to have something that I call, for the purposes of argument, a women's crime centre, where women can go and report a crime, whatever it is, in surroundings in which they feel comfortable.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/17">My important point is that that would not be a place where women go to complain only about sexual offences; they could go there to complain about any crime. It could be a complaint about a handbag being stolen, or a mobile being taken on the bus, or about a parent in the playground. We need to make it much easier for women to go somewhere to make a formal complaint or discuss whether to make one.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/18">A lot of the difficulty lies in the initial threshold of being willing to make the decision, for all the reasons given by the hon. and learned Member for Redcar. Many people do not go from the trauma of an offence such as rape or sexual assault to telling anyone in officialdom because of the fear, the perceptions of their friends and family, and the potential publicity. The Solicitor-General and other hon. Members will understand that as well as I do.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/19">I am very happy to follow up these discussions with the hon. and learned Member for Redcar, colleagues of all parties and Law Officers, but one of the ways that we could pull together a lot of the very good work being done around the country area by area, town by town and city by city, is by having somewhere that is accommodating, accepting and not intimidating and is competent to deal with any matters concerning criminality against women. I am not being tokenist about the matter in any way: I do not suggest that we go down a road where we have six other species of place, such as centres only for black people or for young people. It is a women's issue in particular. They are the majority of the population and we ought to accommodate that.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/20">I shall be very happy to hear an initial, considered response from Ministers as to where that approach might have been tried or piloted elsewhere in the country. I know that it is done in other countries, and there is some evidence of success. It might be that at the beginning of the system we should grant more people a realistic opportunity to make a considered judgment as to whether they want to proceed, and so provide them with the protection that they feel they need in order to go through the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/21">Of course, once we get past that stage there are the other issues that affect what the hon. and learned Lady calls the attrition rate; I understand and endorse those concerns. But I did not want simply to repeat them; I wanted to make a slightly different point. I should be grateful if in due course Ministers could consider&mdash;as could we&mdash;how to make the initial doorway through which people can go to complain of offences against women much easier to access and more likely to lead to a successful outcome. My view is that we could considerably improve the number of successful complaints that are followed through if we start in the right way, and if we do that, the rest of the criminal justice process may well follow.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> on securing the debate and I congratulate her on not being inhibited by a feeling that, as a Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Home Office, she should be silent on issues affecting the criminal justice system. She clearly has a high reputation in relation to this aspect of public policy; she mentioned her own pamphlet from 1999, and why should she not? If one looks through the search engines on the House of Commons website, one will find that she has been a continuous questioner of the Government on such matters since she came to Parliament. It is a matter for some congratulation that she has achieved an hour and a half's debate on the subject today.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/2">During an intervention, I confessed that I have no experience as a member of the Bar in dealing with rape cases as a prosecutor or defence counsel. As a recorder, I am not sufficiently qualified: I have not got, as the jargon has it, my sex ticket to try serious sexual offences, including rape. The fact that I have not suggests to me that the Lord Chancellor's Department, as it used to be called, and those who arrange the way in which criminal judges try cases of this sort, have thought about the matter quite carefully. They require judges&mdash;the hon. and learned Lady implied this even if she did not say so expressly&mdash;to have specialist training in this area of the law before they are allowed to try such cases because they involve huge sensitivities.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/3">By mentioning emotional trauma, I am by no means diminishing the physical injuries and trauma that a complainant will suffer. In parentheses, I add that it is understandable that many women who are attacked in this hideous way are not strong enough or confident enough to report it straight away and sometimes leave it for days, weeks or in some cases, particularly in relation to child abuse, for some years before bringing it to the attention of the authorities or even their parents. The emotional trauma that a complainant has to suffer in bringing a case, from the first reporting of it, is enormous. It affects those women's families and in many ways it wholly ruins their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/4">However, balanced against that, those of us who have the responsibility of making law and those who have the responsibility of applying the law&mdash;judges and others who have the duty of ensuring fairness in such cases&mdash;also have to consider the effect on the accused. Although it is sometimes difficult to believe, and it is not always attractive to say such things, those accused have rights, as complainants do. Although I fully endorse much of what the hon. and learned Member for Redcar had to say on this very difficult subject, we should be mindful when we are discussing changes in the criminal law and procedure not to forget the rights of the defendant, particularly in cases involving sexual assault and rape, because in such cases the defendant's reputation, whether he is acquitted justly or improperly, is likely to be tarnished for ever as a result of being connected with such allegations.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/5">Clearly, all criminal defendants who are justly acquitted have some loss of reputation as a consequence of that process. Public policy says that the acquittal is the immediate answer to that concern. I think it is fair to say that an acquittal in a rape case does not always lead to that remedial effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.1/1">I have no idea why Suffolk managed only a 1.6 per cent. conviction rate compared with the hon. and learned Lady's area of Cleveland, which had a rate of 7.76 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/2">I shall finish with what I hope is not a light-hearted anecdote. It certainly was not a light-hearted moment at the time. It relates to the north-east. In 2000 when I was the shadow Attorney-General, I was able to carry on my private practice, being instructed to appear for a complainant in a defamation action at the Crown court in Newcastle upon Tyne, one river north of Redcar. My client was suing for slander, which was reduced to libel, over an allegation of serious sexual assault in the workplace which, by the time the complaint had been developed through the company's personnel department, had taken written form on the pleadings in the action and had gone to trial, had been magnified from inappropriate sexual conduct in the staff restroom to the most hideous and disgusting rape. I shall not go into details, because it is simply not necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/3">The matter was tried before a jury of eight women and four men, with a male judge, myself a male barrister with a male junior, and a male defence counsel opposing us and acting for the woman who had made the accusation. The trial lasted two weeks, and it is the nearest that I have ever been to a rape trial. The jury, which as I said included eight women, were utterly disbelieving of the woman's account. At times, when I was watching the jury listening to the woman giving evidence, they were mouthing, &quot;This is a pack of lies.&quot; They awarded the complainant in excess of &pound;200,000. He could never recover it, of course, because the defendant did not have that kind of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/4">If we present cases properly, if rape victims are taken through the hideous reporting process right the way to trial in the careful way that the hon. and learned Lady said was necessary to preserve the complaint and reduce the drop-out rate and high attrition rate, if the preparatory stages of the case are properly managed by the prosecuting authorities once the arrest and charge have been made, and if the trial judge is acutely sensitive of the issues&mdash;by and large they are&mdash;we have a greater expectation of achieving justice, not only in the disinterested sense, but in the personal, competition sense and in the necessary personal protection sense that the individuals in the case and the wider public require of our justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/5">That process is not impossible. It is difficult and it requires effort and resources, although it may require not more resources but simply the re-focusing of existing ones. It requires also determination within the prosecuting authorities, particularly within the police, although the modern police have changed considerably from the, &quot;Well, she was wearing a short skirt so she deserved it&quot; caricature, about which we so often hear.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/6">There must be an understanding, which I think is growing, that becoming involved in such police work is not a Cinderella exercise. It is highly important, and it is essential for the civilisation of a country such as ours and for the greater confidence of those who&mdash;for whatever reason&mdash;sadly become involved in rape cases. I shall listen with great interest to what the Solicitor-General has to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.1/1">I was not going to point that out.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/2">The charging change is important. A specialist rape prosecutor who has been specially trained looks at the case and advises the police on how they can ensure that all the evidence is brought forward and that a full file is ready for a judgment to be made on whether there is a realistic prospect of the prosecution securing a conviction. We hope that as a result, cases that are prosecuted will be more likely to succeed. That remains to be seen as the statistics are rolled out during the next couple of years, but we hope that there will be a significant increase in the success rate of prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/3">We need to recognise that there are disparities between various areas. My hon. and learned Friend mentioned Suffolk and Northampton. I hope that those disparities will be addressed to some extent by the standard training given to specialist rape prosecutors who work with the CPS. That will enable them to work to standards that are broadly the same throughout the country, which should enable judgments on whether a case should be prosecuted to be broadly standard and even out some of the discrepancies. However, that does not mean that my hon. and learned Friend is wrong to suggest that there are other areas where we need to improve, particularly the investigation of some rape cases. Some areas are better than others and we need to ensure that we have appropriate standards and best practice in all areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/4">Progress in making some of the changes has been important. There are some key challenges on which we must focus. It is important that the police are adequately resourced and trained, that we have high-quality rape investigation and that barristers work closely with CPS lawyers to ensure that we get convictions. I am pleased to say that the CPS has recently agreed with the Bar Council that all barristers who prosecute rape cases should have special training accredited by the CPS. That is an important change, in that not only will specialist lawyers make the judgment about the initial prosecution&mdash;the charging&mdash;but when the case comes to court the prosecuting barrister will also be specially trained to ensure that they know how a case should be properly handled.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/5">We have reached agreement that barristers, who previously tended not to talk to witnesses and victims before a trial, will now do so in appropriate circumstances to ensure that a judgment can be made about the case and that some of the questions that need to be asked can be answered. I hope that those changes will be useful and important in the coming months and years.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/6">My hon. and learned Friend raised a series of other issues. First, she referred to police attitudes, which are sometimes dismissive. The police have introduced training, some of which was led by the Metropolitan police who have undertaken substantial work on how to ensure that rape cases and sexual offences are better prosecuted. We are now developing a cadre of specialist officers who are better able to deal with such matters. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> said, there are only four units of sexual offence liaison officers, but there are many more sexual offence liaison officers who are not in units. Whether a special unit is established depends to some extent on the number of cases in an area and some forces may not need to establish one because, thankfully, numbers are much lower, but they will still have a sexual offence liaison officer who will be able to deal with cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/7">The key change is the introduction of SARCs; there are now 14 of them. We need to focus our attention on such areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/8">My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar referred to a judge who said that a key issue was to improve the way in which investigations are carried out. I certainly agree with him or her on that. I also agree that corroboration is important, which is why we must ensure that we have adequate forensic facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/9">My hon. and learned Friend also referred to section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 and the fact that there are still too many cases in which previous sexual history is given. I have a great deal of sympathy with her point and will consider the issue further to see whether there is more work that we can do. Changes to rule 36&mdash;giving prior notice&mdash;will improve the situation somewhat, but there are other ways in which we can improve the legislation and I hope that we will be able to look at some of those.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/10">My hon. and learned Friend suggested that we consider domestic violence courts and whether specialist courts might be helpful. We are developing a formulation with specialist police officers, specialist prosecutors and specialist barristers in court and we should see how that approach develops, but I am not dismissing my hon. and learned Friend's suggestion. I had a look at the South African model, which has a lot to recommend it, but I want to see how the data develop before we start to advocate it.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/11">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey raised a number of points. I agree that there should be more women judges and magistrates. The Government are seeking to increase numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/12">There is a two-stage process under way for the audit of the rape action plan. The first stage&mdash;a stocktake of progress and implementation of the rape action plan&mdash;took place in the summer and was based on self-report surveys. We found some excellent good practice, but we need to do more to ensure that that is replicated in all areas and a follow-up thematic inspection will report this summer. We look forward to the recommendations that will inform the new sexual violence action plan. I hope that we shall be able to ensure that we make improvements as a result of that. The hon. Gentleman also asked about variations between different attitudes and statistical differences between areas. To some extent, our standard training for rape prosecutors will address those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.1/13">I want to ensure that we have a better success rate in getting rapists off the street and into prison where they should be. I want to ensure that victims are better treated by the criminal justice system and that the Government's record on tackling these issues is at the top of the agenda.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.3/1">I could not agree more. There have been several isolated outbreaks in this country, in the hon. Gentleman's constituency and in Aberdeenshire, but, more generally, there is a higher incidence in cities such as London. Increased global travel is certainly one of the causes.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/2">People think about whether the issue directly affects them: they are aware that people from the UK travel abroad to the nearer parts of eastern Europe, but large numbers also travel on ever more direct flights to countries with a high HIV incidence. The hon. Gentleman's point is well made.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/3">I was about to touch on an area relatively closer to home: the former Soviet Union has been hit badly by the disease and it has the second-lowest treatment success rate in the world&mdash;only marginally better than that of Africa. The collapse of the Soviet Union left many countries in the region with weak health care systems and particularly poor diagnostic facilities. The real problem is multi-drug-resistant TB, which is more expensive to treat and a particular problem in the Baltic states.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/4">TB does not respect national boundaries or international treaties, and I would like to explain the problem in some detail. TB is the leading form of death from a curable infectious disease. Globally, it is second only to HIV/AIDS as a cause of illness and death, infecting 9 million people every year and killing 2 million. Nearly all those people are in the developing world.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/5">What is more shocking, however, is the fact that the illness is entirely preventable and curable. That is why today's debate is so important. With world TB day on <phrase class="date" code="">24 March</phrase> almost upon us, we must do all we can to highlight the need to get to grips with and eradicate the disease, which continues to claim a life every 15 seconds.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/6">About two weeks ago, I was pleased to host an exhibition in the Upper Waiting Hall in this place. I hope that many Members took the time to look at it. The exhibition comprised a collection of photographs by Gary Hampton, a renowned TB photographer, of TB sufferers throughout the world, including in India, Africa, Europe and South America. The message was simple: TB is current, dangerous and on the increase in many parts of the world, but, despite the scale of the problem, we have the means to cure it completely.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/7">About 80 per cent. of the individuals newly diagnosed with the disease each year live in the 22 most populous countries.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-21a.28.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="28"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/halltext/60321h02.htm#60321h02_spnew12">
	<p pid="a.28.3/1">My hon. Friend is one step ahead of me. I was aware that he was a keynote speaker at the launch of the global plan. Without a doubt, few things are better value for money than $10 that can save a person's life. As he said, one problem is that successful treatment can be started, but if it is not maintained for the full six months of therapy, patients might feel better and stop taking the drugs, which might allow drug-resistant TB to develop.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/2">In certain areas, drugs are not available or people have to pay, and in countries of extreme poverty paying for drugs can often be the barrier between life and death. That is why I am pleased that some of the many projects funded by DFID ensure that drugs are freely available and that cost is not issue. Access and maintaining the course for six months might be issues, but the cost of treatment is not in many countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/3">The global plan for 2002&ndash;15 builds on the partnership's first global plan for 2001&ndash;05. It supports the need for long-term planning and for action at regional and country levels. The plan provides a consensual view of what the Stop TB Partnership can achieve by 2015, provided that we mobilise the resources to implement the stop TB strategy, according to the steps laid out in the global plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/4">The global plan will help to stimulate political commitment, financial support, effective intervention, patients' involvement, community participation, and research and development. All those will be central planks of the overall strategy to tackle TB.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/5">The cost of the global plan is $56 billion, which represents a threefold increase in funding as compared with the first global plan. Although that is a significant increase, any doubts that anyone might have should be dashed when we consider what we get for that $56 billion. The estimated funding gap is $31 billion, which must be met because the rewards are high. Full funding would save 14 million lives at a cost per life saved of $157, which is much less than the average economic productivity per person per year, even for the poorest individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/6">Even under such a crude economic calculation, the economic benefits far outweigh the costs. When we consider the amount of money spent post-9/11, this is a small price to pay. If averaged out, it is $5.6 billion a year, which is what the US spends in Iraq every month. The figure is three days' global military spending and the amount spent each month is estimated at $58 million&mdash;more than the total 10-year cost of the global plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/7">What will be achieved if we implement the global plan? Implementation of the stop TB strategy will expand access for all to quality TB diagnosis and treatment. About 50 million people will be treated under the strategy and 14 million lives will be saved. The first new TB drug for 40 years could be introduced in 2010, with vastly improved diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/8">By 2015, we will have a new, safe, effective and affordable vaccine available if all goes according to plan. Targets could be met, such as the global achievement of the millennium development goal to halt and begin to reverse the incidence of TB, and the TB partnership's 2015 targets to halve prevalence and death rates from 1990 levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/9">What else can we all do, in the House and elsewhere? As I mentioned, the exhibition in the Upper Waiting Hall was one small attempt to raise awareness while today's debate will generate coverage, interest and column inches. Those interested will be able to follow it and know that hon. Members are facing up to the problem. TB is not a disease of the past, and we must remind people of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/10">The decline in the incidence of TB in the developed world has been accompanied by a fall in the commercial incentive to develop and invest in new anti-TB drugs. The DOTS programme has revolutionised the treatment of TB across the world, but it is 50 years since its introduction, and treatment and detection rates have remained constant since 1995&mdash;still far below the rates and targets set out in the MDGs. To contain the disease properly, new drugs and vaccines are needed to tackle multi-drug-resistant TB. Despite the undoubted success of the DOTS expansion, most countries look unlikely to meet the MDGs for TB by 2015. Further innovation is crucial if, ultimately, we are to tackle TB.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/11">The non-profit organisation Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, which is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, has brought badly needed new focus and leadership for drug development. In the short term, six new drug candidates for TB are now undergoing clinical trials. Indeed, Bill Gates has already pledged $900 million over the next 10 years towards tackling the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/12">However, action from above must be matched by renewed and improved action on the ground&mdash;the front line of the battle against TB. The DOTS strategy has helped not only to cure millions of people worldwide, but to strengthen public health care capacities. Indeed, it has been argued that the greatest legacy of DOTS to the overall health of developing countries might be not in control of TB alone, but in helping to build the basic infrastructure of a public health system. For example, in India, where the public health system is weak, more than 422,000 health workers have been trained during the expansion of DOTS. DOTS plus is the first step in moving beyond DOTS.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.3/13">We must also be aware of the problems of HIV that are associated with TB. Although originally they were largely considered separate diseases, co-ordinated planning and implementation of TB and HIV programmes will lead to more effective prevention and treatment of TB among patients infected with HIV/AIDS. In countries with high levels of AIDS, the scale of the challenge posed by TB simply exceeds control capacities. As a result, DOTS, or any other programme focusing on one disease, will always fall short. TB symptoms are often the reason for accessing the health care system.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely strong case for giving the challenge of the global plan up to 2015 a much higher priority. Given that TB killed more people than all the wars, earthquakes, floods, armies, air accidents, terrorist attacks and murders worldwide last year, and following on from his comparison between the money needed for the global plan and military spend, does he believe that Ministers should use that comparison and take a fraction of the defence budget, for example, to fund the global plan? Should we not use such rhetoric to up the ante and get the plan the priority it deserves?</p>

	<p pid="a.36.0/1">I join other hon. Members in paying due tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> on securing this debate on tuberculosis. Given its timing just days before world TB day, he has done the House a particular service. TB places an unnecessary burden on the developing world in particular&mdash;TB causes 2 million deaths a year&mdash;and the House has benefited from the opportunity to discuss these issues again. I should also pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman's continuing advocacy on this topic; he has not come to it fresh today. I know through his work on the Select Committee on International Development and his visits to our programmes in Andhra Pradesh and Kenya that he has followed this issue for some time.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/2">I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> on her elevation to her current position. She is fortunate to have in her constituency arguably the greatest professional rugby club&mdash;London Welsh. That makes her almost, but not quite, as privileged as I am in terms of the constituencies that we represent. She raised a number of issues, as did the hon. Members for Edinburgh, West, for St. Ives (Andrew George) and for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds) and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>. I will try to do justice to their contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/3">As all hon. Members said, there is a huge challenge before us because of the number of people who die or become infected as a result of TB. It is, however, a challenge that the international community, supporting developing countries, could rise to. There is already an internationally agreed strategy for TB control&mdash;directly observed short-course treatment programmes or DOTS&mdash;which we know has considerable impact. I understand that later this week the World Health Organisation will announce that in 2004 DOTS programmes were able to detect 53 per cent. of TB cases worldwide, and to treat successfully 82 per cent. of them. That is encouraging, but those figures also reveal the scale of the challenge that remains. We need to build on that success and do more.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/4">A number of things need to happen if poor people are to get better access to effective TB care. Simply put, they are threefold: there needs to be much greater political commitment to this challenge, more money needs to be allocated, and we need to make better use of the existing money that is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/5">Let me start with that last point. Making better use of the money means working in partnership with developing countries, donor partners, those in research institutions and NGOs that specialise in this field. I join other hon. Members in paying tribute to the campaigning work of Results UK, TB Alert and the African Medical and Research Foundation&mdash;AMREF&mdash;not least for their efforts to enlighten the House further by calling a meeting later this week. The Department for International Development is familiar with all those organisations because of their work in this area. The House owes them a debt of gratitude for their lobbying, campaigning and informative work.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/6">Secondly, we need to ensure that we spend more of the money that is available on research, and make better use of the existing facilities. We also need to ensure that the systems are in place for the money to get down to health care services in the most remote areas and the most marginalised communities. The hon. Member for Richmond Park rightly alluded to that. We need to ensure that people who want to access the drugs are able to do so, wherever they live and whatever their circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/7">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness rightly alluded to the Commission for Africa's underlining how critical TB is to the health and development agenda. He will be aware that a similar message was highlighted by the Gleneagles communiqu&eacute;, the United Nations world summit, and the European strategy on development&mdash;that consensus was agreed towards the end of last year. All of them committed the global community to do more on TB.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/8">All hon. Members have also referred to the excellent global plan to stop TB, which was launched by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with Bill Gates and President Obasanjo of Nigeria. As hon. Members said, that global plan sets out a clear picture of what we need to do to achieve the millennium development goal on communicable disease. That plan makes it clear that it is possible, with greater commitment and more money, and by using money more wisely, to halve deaths from TB by 2015. We now need to move from those commitments in the global plan and the various communiqu&eacute;s of last year to implementation on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/9">Hon. Members who follow the issue will know that last year the Department held a consultation on TB and malaria, in which we reviewed our spend to date and considered whether we needed to increase our spend and how to make better use of the resources available. As a result of that consultation, we doubled funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis&mdash;crucially&mdash;and Malaria for 2006&ndash;07. We increased our funding for country programmes; that is the direct bilateral support to which the hon. Member for Richmond Park alluded. As the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness rightly said, the Chancellor announced funding of just over &pound;41 million for TB drugs in India, through partnership with the World Health Organisation. We also committed some &pound;5 million to the global Stop TB Partnership. Those are examples of our work on TB and Malaria. We intend to continue to expand such support later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/10">All the hon. Members who spoke raised the issue of finance. The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness highlighted the current $31 billion gap in the plan and pointed out that $56 billion would be needed through to 2015. Some $25 billion is already available and, as I said, we must ensure that that is well spent. I accept that there is a major gap in resources, and we cannot pretend that it will be closed if it is a case of business as usual. We need to maximise commitments from developing country Governments and donors, and we need to work on the commitments made last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/11">Crucially, we must explore new sources of finance. Critical to that is ensuring that TB is recognised in developing countries' own health plans&mdash;a point made by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness&mdash;and that Ministries of Health are supported in making the case to Ministries of Finance for more funding for health care in general and TB specifically, so that that money is locked into poverty reduction strategies. Of course, we do advocacy work in areas where our country programmes are strong and where we have identified particular problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/12">The global fund needs to be supported if it is to maintain its share of the growing response to TB. Hon. Members who follow the progress of the global fund will know that in June there is to be a mid-term review of the global fund's performance to date, and of how the replenishment has gone. That will provide an opportunity to encourage new donors, in particular the oil-producing countries and the private sector, to play their part in supporting the effort on all three poverty diseases.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/13">Even with the new resources that have been pledged, that $30 billion gap is a considerable challenge. Hon. Members will know that this year the international finance facility for immunisation began its work. We hope that that does considerable good in its own right, but also serves to encourage other nations to support a full international finance facility, delivering new resources for work on TB&mdash;and health care generally&mdash;more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/14">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, knows that I cannot prejudge what my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will say in the Budget tomorrow, but he will be aware of the commitment made last year by the Chancellor and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to spend 0.7 per cent. of national income on aid by 2013. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will want to praise this Government for trebling spending on international development assistance since we were elected.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/15">The hon. Member for Richmond Park asked for more information on how much we have already spent on tuberculosis. Perhaps it would help if I explained that although we fund TB control directly through a number of specific bilateral projects in the focal countries where we operate, we also increasingly fund broader health sector development plans for developing countries through multilateral agencies, including the World Bank, the European Commission and the Asian Development Bank. It is not always possible to draw out exactly what is spent on TB, because money that goes into health sector budgets helps to fund action on a range of other health conditions, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/16">Let me give some additional examples of the direct, bilateral support that we provide. In Nepal we committed some &pound;5.4 million from 2001 to the end of next year to helping with effective diagnosis and treatment for all TB patients who come to existing primary care facilities. In South Africa we are providing assistance on TB to KwaZulu-Natal, the province with the highest HIV prevalence and the worst treatment outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/17">Hon. Members have referred to the often considerable links between HIV infection and TB infection. In Pakistan, one of the seven national health programmes supported by our sectoral spend of &pound;60 million is a national TB programme. In Uganda we are providing direct support to strengthen the health system and to strengthen our response on implementing the DOTS programme at community level.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/18">One or two hon. Members mentioned Russia. It is worth drawing the House's attention to Russia's hosting of the G8 agenda this year. The Russians have shown an interest in discussing infectious diseases in St. Petersburg later this year. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, rightly said, it is one of the countries with the greatest burden of TB, and it has a particular problem with drug-resistant TB, so we have been pushing for the St. Petersburg summit to endorse support for the global plan. Indeed, when my right hon. Friend the Chancellor launched the global plan, he made specific reference to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/19">I have mentioned the issue of the better use of money. The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness rightly drew attention to the need better to co-ordinate the response to HIV with the response to TB. In some African countries&mdash;Malawi is an example&mdash;70 per cent. of people with TB are infected with HIV, so there is a clear case for bringing responses to the two diseases much more closely together. In some African countries, people still need to go to one clinic to get their TB drugs and another to be tested and get treatment for HIV. Clearly, that is nonsense in the longer term, and we need to support those African countries in bringing those services together.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/20">In 2005, the G8 committed itself to providing universal access to HIV treatment, prevention and care. That commitment was endorsed by the UN world summit. As part of the global steering committee that we co-host with UNAIDS, we have been trying to make a reality of that commitment. We are drawing up plans on how to achieve that, and on how to ensure that TB is seen as a core element of the package of AIDS care.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/21">In an intervention on the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West, my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire rightly alluded to lack of drugs and problems with diagnostics and vaccines for diseases. Those are major problems; those in developed countries have considerable access to those services, and those in developing nations have very poor access to them. We know from international research on the issue that 10 per cent. of global health research and development is directed at diseases of relevance to 90 per cent. of the world's population. That is a huge imbalance and a glaring example of global inequality. That is one reason why we need to accelerate research and development of new technologies; a second reason is to deal with the specific issue of multi-drug-resistant TB. That is one reason why we are supporting the WHO's tropical disease research programme, which includes a major research project in improving TB diagnostics, which the hon. Member for Richmond Park mentioned. If we can get those new diagnostic methods to come on line, it will mean that we can detect TB earlier in primary health services and we shall be able to diagnose it much earlier in people who are also infected with HIV, where diagnosis is often particularly difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/22">We are keen to see new drugs developed, particularly ones that would allow for shorter and simpler courses of treatment that reduce the burden on often fragile health care systems. Ultimately, the goal must be to find a vaccine, if we are genuinely to achieve long-term control.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/23">One key way to try to ensure that new drugs and diagnostics come on line is through public-private partnerships, which are beginning to change the landscape of TB research. The need for public-private partnerships will continue to increase, particularly when embarking on expensive clinical trials. That is why, earlier this month, I was pleased to announce UK funding of some &pound;6.5 million over the next three years to the global alliance for TB drug development. However, that does not preclude the point that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire made, which was that we need to see, and should continue to encourage, the major pharmaceutical companies in their programmes of research into diseases in developing countries. We should try to ensure that they have effective differential pricing regimes in place to charge higher prices in developed nations and recognise the unaffordability of those prices for poorer nations and bring in cheaper prices there. I have already made it clear that this is a particular issue for second-line antiretroviral drugs to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic, but, more generally, it is one that developing countries are facing.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/24">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness also mentioned access to drugs. He will be aware of the flexibilities in the legislation on trade-related aspects of intellectual property&mdash;TRIPs&mdash;which has only just come into force in general terms and is not in force for the least developed and very poorest countries. We are working with a number of developing countries, including Ghana, to ensure that they can take advantage of the flexibilities in the TRIPs regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/25">The hon. Gentleman said that many developing countries impose tariffs on drugs and it is difficult to see the sustainability of such tariffs, given the huge public health burden faced by many of those countries. Nevertheless, he will recognise that Finance and Health Ministers and Parliaments in developing countries must consider that in the round. As I said in answering the point made by the hon. Member for Richmond Park about our spend on TB directly, we put considerable resources into financing health systems to help with the fight against TB and more broadly.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/26">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has, in various speeches to generate debate on our forthcoming White Paper, referred to the need for us to increase access to basic health and education services. It is worth pointing out that the WHO estimates that it would only cost approximately &pound;20 per person to provide an essential package of health services. Many Ministries of Health in low-income countries typically spend less than &pound;5 per person, which indicates the scale of the challenge that we face and just how much of a step change we need to see in funding from domestic budgets in developing countries and from international aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/27">I draw hon. Members' attention to Malawi, where we are providing &pound;100 million of support to its health sector budget, as part of the health sector plan, which is specifically supporting the Government of Malawi to try to double the number of nurses and treble the number of doctors that they recruit over the next six years. That is being done partly by tackling many aspects of the poor conditions in which people in the health service in Malawi have to operate, partly by raising their pay by just over 50 per cent., an increase that only came on line in April. Early indications are that a significant increase in recruitment is beginning to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/28">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness rightly mentioned user fees for health care services. We have made it clear that user fees can deter people from accessing the health care services that are needed, that we support the elimination of health care fees and that we will put resources behind efforts to eliminate such fees. In Zambia, when the Minister of Health recently announced her intention to abolish health fees for those in rural areas, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced additional funding for Zambia to help compensate for the loss of those user fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/29">In conclusion, I congratulate the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West on securing this debate. I hope that world TB day receives considerable media and parliamentary attention; it certainly needs to. We in the Department for International Development intend to continue scaling up our work on health care services in general and, through that, our response to the fight to tackle tuberculosis. I look forward to working with the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members to continue the campaign on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.1/1">This is a fairly sparsely-attended debate, but the issues that it deals with are none the less extremely important. I shall talk a little about the state of education in the East Riding of Yorkshire and the funding of that education system. I shall then specifically address the issue of the F40 model, which is a mechanism by which the Government can better target funding at those most in need and ensure that they receive the correct funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/2">The East Riding of Yorkshire has undergone great improvements in the past few years. In 2004, at key stage 2, 83 per cent. of its pupils achieved level 4 or above in English, which represents a considerable increase on the figure a number of years before. In maths, the relevant figures were 78 per cent. in 2004 and 79 per cent. in 2005. Both are above the national average. At key stage 2, East Riding schools are joint 25th nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/3">Likewise, at key stage 3, there has been a significant improvement and, given the funding, an outstanding performance on the part of staff. By 2004, 77 per cent. of pupils at key stage 3 had reached level 5 or above in English. The figure rose to 79 per cent. in 2005. In maths, the corresponding figure was 79 per cent. in 2004. It dropped slightly to 78 per cent. in 2005. Both results are also above the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/4">East Riding schools were 17th in the national GCSE performance tables in 2005, which was an improvement on 69th in 2004, and 61 per cent. of their students achieved five or more A to C grades. By contrast, the national figure was just 54 per cent. Four East Riding schools have this year been recognised in the national league table for the most improved state secondaries, according to the proportion of pupils gaining five A to C grades.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/5">I want to highlight the performance of Beverley high school, which is the top performing state school in the East Riding at GCSE&mdash;some 80 per cent. of its students achieve five A to C grades. We are talking about a comprehensive school achieving that high level. Indeed, 15 of the East Riding's 18 secondary schools achieved improved GCSE results in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/6">At A-level, East Riding schools were 56th in the national league tables in 2005. The improvement over recent years in the East Riding, despite the lack of funding, has been enormous, and it is gratifying to comment on it. I congratulate the head teachers and staff of the schools in the East Riding on their performance. I also pay tribute to the inspirational leadership in the local authority of John Mager, who is the director of education. I am unsure whether he is leaving the local authority today, but some time soon he will do so. He has done an excellent job. The political leadership of Councillor Penny Peacock has also made a big contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/7">Great improvements have been made, but what could the schools in the East Riding of Yorkshire have achieved if they had received a fairer share? There could have been more teachers, support staff, textbooks and equipment. East Riding schools have consistently received funding that falls behind both the national average and that given to the best-funded authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/8">The Minister will know all about the F40 group of poorly-funded local education authorities, of which the East Riding is a member. Those authorities represent almost 16 million people in more than 200 parliamentary constituencies. Research on the national funding arrangements over the past years reveals some stark facts concerning the funding allocations to the F40 authorities. I hope the Minister will respond on that. Between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06, there has been no real change in the spread among the F40 group of authorities in respect of the difference among that group between the amounts that the highest and lowest-allocated authorities receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/9">As the Minister will be aware, during the past eight years, the cash gap between the best and worst authorities nationally has widened. The figure is &pound;620 per pupil, even though most commentators already felt that the disparity was too great between the best-funded and the worst-funded authorities in this country. And yet, the effect of Government policy and formulation has been to exacerbate that situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/10">Let us consider how schools in neighbouring Hull compare with those in Holderness in my constituency in 2005&ndash;06. Bilton primary school received &pound;2,458 per pupil whereas Wansbeck primary received &pound;2,922 per pupil. Those schools are less than a mile apart. I hope that the Minister will respond favourably on those questions today and suggest that he, at least, shares my ambition, and that of many other MPs who represent F40 authorities, that the gap should be closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/11">Parents and pupils in the East Riding had high hopes for the new funding arrangements for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, but the dedicated schools grant, which comes into effect next month, has not been kind to them. The two-year settlement, beginning in April, has a baseline figure for the East Riding of Yorkshire of &pound;3,117 per pupil. In 2006&ndash;07, the figure will be &pound;3,322, which represents a 6.6 per cent. increase. Some 6.9 per cent. of that figure will be allocated on the basis of deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/12">The East Riding of Yorkshire is the fourth-worst-funded education authority in the country. In 2006&ndash;07, Hull will receive &pound;3,738 per pupil whereas the City of London will receive &pound;6,708 per pupil, which is more than double the East Riding of Yorkshire's allocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/13">The situation is indefensible and should already have been addressed, yet it is getting worse. In 2007&ndash;08, the East Riding will receive &pound;3,535 per pupil, which represents an increase of 6.4 per cent. Such increases are below the national and regional averages. Unbelievably, the national increase in 2006&ndash;07 will be 6.8 per cent., but the East Riding will receive less than that, and in the following year the gap will further widen between the East Riding of Yorkshire and the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/14">The East Riding local education authority has not stood idly by while this has happened. Led by John Mager, it has helped to devise the F40 pupil entitlement model. It is a new funding model for determining the needs of individual education authorities and schools, and it is targeted on the pupil. The calculations are based on needs-based funding&mdash;what it costs to run a school.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/15">I am sure that the Minister and his colleagues know all about the F40 group and the funding model. The group was pleased that civil servants came to examine the model and found that it was not designed primarily to address overall funding. It is not a completely different model of funding across the UK, but it shows that by using index of multiple deprivation data and education data it is possible, within the education management system, to attach a deprivation score to each child using a home postcode.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/16">Using that model, it is possible to pick up in particular the current injustice whereby thousands of pupils leave Hull to come to the East Riding to be educated. Many of them come from some of the most deprived wards in the country. When they come to be educated in the East Riding and East Riding schools seek to provide them with the additional support that they rightly expect, the money does not transfer with them. The F40 model would allow that.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/17">The East Riding spends more on schools than the amount allocated to it by the Government. It is rare among local authorities to have that happen, but, despite low funding overall, such is the commitment of the political leadership of the East Riding that it has found extra money to put into schools and, as I have explained, shown that that extra money converts into improvement and genuine delivery for pupils across the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/18">The East Riding is suffering because multiple aspects of the system put it at a disadvantage. Although it is right that deprivation funding should go to those in the most deprived areas, the truth is that rural areas rarely manage to command the statistical basis for that much support. The allocation of funding according to where pupils live, rather than where they are educated, compounds the injustice. There are 2,665 pupils in residence at schools in the East Riding who live in other local authorities. As John Mager said:</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/19" class="indent">&quot;One secondary school in the East Riding of Yorkshire receives 30 per cent. of its intake from one of the most deprived and disadvantaged estates in Hull. They will be expected to provide the personalised learning which many of these children will require but the proposals for deprivation funding will not provide the East Riding with the funds to support the school.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/20">Funding allocated to the East Riding for deprivation is below the national average. Hull is allocated 14.7 per cent. of funding for deprivation. It has problems with social deprivation and it is right that additional funding is allocated to its schools, but the East Riding has deprivation of its own. The Ofsted report on the local education authority of January 2004 said:</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/21" class="indent">&quot;Pockets of social deprivation, the steadily rising inward migration from neighbouring urban districts, the remoteness of some parts of the region and relatively low funding levels all pose a challenge.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/22">Bridlington South, Bridlington Old Town, Bridlington North, Goole and South-East Holderness are among the 33 per cent. most deprived wards in the country. Household income is below the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/23">Tellingly, a recent survey undertaken for an obesity project in the East Riding revealed that 70 per cent. of children in Withernsea had a low body mass index, indicating under-nourishment. That highlights the unfairness of funding based on a local authority border rather than on the child.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/24">Rural areas are losing out and Government cash has been targeted on cities. John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/25" class="indent">&quot;This Government has put a large amount of additional funding into deprived areas and I give them credit for that. But in the way that grants are distributed, there are inbuilt inefficiencies because they are targeted in big areas, such as Manchester and Birmingham, and not on the individual schools and individual pupils where the need is greatest. There are pupils losing out and this is particularly the case for disadvantaged pupils in rural areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/26">That quotation, which is recent, sums up the injustice of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/27">John Wilson, head teacher of Market Weighton school in the East Riding, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/28" class="indent">&quot;The modest improvements in funding, though welcome, will not allow schools in the East Riding to progress as quickly as they would like. East Riding schools will be forced to make do and mend while schools in better-funded authorities are able to provide a wider range of opportunities for their students. Whether anyone will be looking at their staffing I don't know at the moment. What we would really like is a fairer system of funding.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/29">The East Riding of Yorkshire council has brought significant improvements to its education, thanks to the hard work of many people, the pupils, the support of their parents and all the staff throughout the local authority. None the less, the gap between the East Riding and the best-funded authorities in the country continues to grow. In the F40 entitlement model, even before the reassessment of the overall funding, we have a tool that can allow money to follow the pupil, allow parents to exercise choice and ensure that support is provided to the most deprived in our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/30">I urge the Minister to acknowledge that the East Riding has performed extraordinarily well on limited resources. I also urge him to consider carefully the situation in the East Riding and other poorly-funded local authorities, and to take that on board when reviewing the arrangements that are in place for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 before deciding on a permanent model from 2008 onwards. I hope we get a sympathetic response from him today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-21a.47.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="47"  time="012:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/halltext/60321h03.htm#60321h03_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.47.0/1">Capital spending on school buildings in the county has also increased dramatically from &pound;1.3 million in 1997&ndash;98 to almost &pound;15 million in 2007&ndash;08. That is a more than elevenfold increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/2">I listened carefully to the concerns that the hon. Gentleman raised about funding for the East Riding compared with that for other areas of the country. Whether we wish to agree or disagree about the overall funding of education as between his party and mine, we recognise that there are concerns about the allocation of that funding. Some argue that funding per pupil should be more or less the same across the country, and I got that feeling from the hon. Gentleman's contribution. I want to explain why it is not the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/3">The Government aim to give all pupils an equal opportunity in life. Pupils from more deprived backgrounds are likely to have additional educational needs and to require additional help if they are to have an equal chance to succeed. That is why in the current formula funding system, on top of the basic entitlement, we provide additional funding to authorities with higher numbers of pupils from deprived backgrounds. If I heard the hon. Gentleman right, he said that he understands and supports the principle that those pupils in greatest need should be given the greatest support.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/4">The main reason for the East Riding receiving less funding per pupil than other areas is that it has fewer pupils from deprived backgrounds than many other authorities. The hon. Gentleman referred to Hull, the neighbouring authority to his own. Just below 12 per cent. of pupils in the East Riding come from families on income support. The national average is about 19 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/5">There is also extra funding for authorities in high-cost areas, because schools in those areas find it more difficult to recruit and retain teachers and other school staff. It is worth noting that the teacher vacancy rate in the East Riding is 0.3 per cent. compared with the average of 0.6 per cent. The council's own website says:</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Quality of life in the East Riding is exceptionally high&mdash;housing is plentiful and prices are lower than in many other parts of the country&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/7">That is why the formula works as it does.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/8">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the rural nature of his county and constituency, and the formula funding arrangements give extra funding to sparsely populated authorities such as the East Riding, where there are many small village schools that are more expensive to run. The formula recognises the circumstances that he describes.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/9">That is the situation, but the hon. Gentleman might know that, from the beginning of April, we are making some important changes to the school funding arrangements. They are designed to ensure that the money meant for schools reaches them in every area of the country and gives head teachers and governors funding stability and certainty, so that they can make better plans. Those key benefits will be delivered through multi-year budgets for schools, backed by the dedicated schools grant, or DSG. The DSG is a new ring-fenced grant from the Department for Education and Skills to each local authority, covering funding for schools and other provision for pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/10">In spring last year, we consulted widely on the new school funding arrangements, including our proposals for distributing the DSG between authorities, but schools and authorities in areas that spend more than their formula funding allocation&mdash;a situation the hon. Gentleman described in relation to the East Riding of Yorkshire&mdash;told us of their concerns about our proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/11">Those schools and authorities were worried that, were we to pursue that course of action, over time their relative funding would be reduced. The East Riding is such an area, demonstrating, as the hon. Gentleman said, the priority that the council, as well as the Government, gives to schools in his area.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/12">We listened carefully to those concerns, and during the summer last year we consulted again on a modified DSG distribution method that put stability at the heart of local authority funding allocations. A majority of the people who responded to the new consultation supported the modified method, as did the East Riding of Yorkshire council, I am pleased to say. That is what we will use to distribute the DSG in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/13">I shall describe how the DSG distribution will work for the next two years. We will take each authority's existing spending on the schools budget as the starting point, give every authority an increase of at least 5 per cent. per pupil over the current spending in each year, and then distribute the remaining grant according to the Government's priorities for education.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/14">Those priorities include personalised learning at key stage 3 and in primary schools; the provision of more practical learning options for pupils in key stage 4; the full-year cost of implementing time for PPA&mdash;planning, preparation and assessment&mdash;in primary schools; and the cost of the increased entitlement to free early years provision, from 33 to 38 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/15">I want to stress that, although we have earmarked sums for those priorities within each authority's DSG allocation for each year, decisions about the distribution of funding between schools continue to be for local authorities, in consultation with their school forums.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/16">What does the school funding settlement mean for the schools of the East Riding of Yorkshire? I am pleased to say that the county can expect an increase in DSG over current spending of no less than 6.6 per cent. per pupil in 2006&ndash;07, with a further increase in 2007&ndash;08 of 6.4 per cent. per pupil. Over the two years, that represents an increase of 13.4 per cent. per pupil. The hon. Gentleman described that as modest; I would describe it as generous.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.1/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman's point; he has made it before. All I pointed out to him was the fact that, whatever his views on how much other authorities receive&mdash;I understand his concerns about that&mdash;his authority will receive, over two years, a 13.4 per cent. per pupil increase. As I said, that is hardly modest. It builds on the spectacular increase in revenue and capital investment during the past eight or nine years, which has led to the spectacular results and achievements on which we have remarked in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/2">The settlement is good for East Riding schools and good for schools throughout the country. It combines clarity on the Government's priorities for school funding with flexibility for local authorities and school forums over how they respond to those priorities. Most importantly, however, it means that, for the first time, schools throughout the country will know their budgets for more than one year ahead, enabling them to plan with confidence in support of school improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/3">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the F40 group, which relates to the funding model that the East Riding of Yorkshire council is developing, supported by the wider F40 group of authorities. During recent months, the group has made useful presentations on the model to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools, 14&ndash;19 Learning and officials from my Department. We will continue to listen to the F40 group's views on school funding and we will be interested to see how the F40 funding model develops. Indeed, our joint head of school funding spoke at the F40 group's national conference earlier this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/4">The F40 model is designed in particular to help in the distribution of funding between schools. One issue when considering it is whether it could be successfully adapted for national distribution between local authorities. That is the discussion we will have.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.1/5">We have heard about the record number of teaching and support staff in the East Riding of Yorkshire and about the record investment in education. That has led to record achievement. I repeat my thanks to the hon. Gentleman for raising those issues and congratulate the teachers and pupils in his constituency who are doing so much to improve the quality of life for families and people in his area.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.1/1">First, I thank Mr. Speaker for making this debate available to me at such short notice. I am also grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister and his Department for the communications between us on some of the facts of the case that I am about to present. I am also grateful to the sheriff clerk and the procurator fiscal at Kilmarnock sheriff court.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February 2006</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions gave a statement to the House on the future of the Child Support Agency. I welcomed that announcement to terminate the agency, believing it to run a shambolic system that works only at times in relation to those in pay-as-you-earn schemes and which does not work in relation to many other people, particularly those in business, who seem to employ smart accountants to get out of their parental responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/3">The Secretary of State announced that a new system would be devised by the chief executive of Liverpool city council, Sir David Henshaw, and that the House could expect a further announcement in the latter part of July 2006. My first question to the Minister is, when does he expect that change to be implemented? I believe that it must be done sooner rather than later, given my experiences over the great many years during which I have represented constituents on the issue of the agency. As the Minister will see from the case that I will highlight, the Government need to act now to help individuals who have become trapped by the system and have lost heavily as a result of incompetence in the agency and in the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/4">Dawn Rennie of Prestwick has been fighting for more than 13 years to get her former partner&mdash;Patrick Clancy of Irvine, who also happens to be a constituent of mine&mdash;to pay maintenance for their now 14-year-old son. Throughout that time, Mr. Clancy has managed to build up arrears of nearly &pound;16,000. He has given pocket money to his son of some &pound;20 a week, but he has persistently failed to meet his responsibility and liability to pay his child maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/5">Liability orders were sanctioned by the court in Scotland&mdash;one on <phrase class="date" code="1995-08-14">14 August 1995</phrase> for &pound;4,897.21 plus costs, and a second on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-17">17 October 2002</phrase> for &pound;12,298.15 plus costs&mdash;but little of that money, if any, has been paid. In fact, &pound;15,725.51 is outstanding in respect of those two orders alone. Subsequently, Mr. Clancy offered a mediocre &pound;5,000 payment to cancel out the &pound;16,000 of debt. Dawn Rennie declined that as derisory, and I agree that the offer was derisory.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/6">It took 13 years of persistence by Dawn Rennie before the CSA finally got Mr. Clancy to court, on the ground that if he did not pay what he owed he should be sent to jail. I hold no personal malice towards Mr. Clancy, but I feel strongly that the CSA has been totally hopeless in pursuing the case timeously.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/7">I have to tell the Minister that when the word &quot;timeously&quot; is put through a spell check, it comes out as &quot;timorously&quot;. That may be more appropriate to the CSA than &quot;timeously&quot;. At this time of year, when we have just gone through the Burns period, the word &quot;timorous&quot; has a particular meaning&mdash;I am sure everybody knows about the little mouse.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/8">The trial eventually took place on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase>, when Sheriff Ruth Anderson ruled that Mr. Clancy did not have the money to pay the arrears because of his drink and gambling addictions. It seems almost bizarre that the sheriff would rule in that way, but that is exactly what she did.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.1/1">I think that is a question for the courts. As my hon. Friend says, the Minister needs to answer the point, and I am sure that he will.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/2">As I said, a decision on the case was taken on <phrase class="date" code="">15 December</phrase>, when Sheriff Ruth Anderson ruled that Mr. Clancy did not have the money. Obviously, because of that, the matter was never pursued. Dawn Rennie was neither informed of that hearing nor given any opportunity to stand as what would be described as a prosecution witness. That fundamental flaw in the system must be addressed. She has since been informed that the court's decision is final and that there is no right of appeal&mdash;a decision that I do not accept and which I do not think anyone could accept. I therefore want the Minister to consider overturning the decision. That is the second reason why I want the debate to give me some answers.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/3">To say that I find the position that I have described totally unacceptable would be a major understatement. However, this debate is not in connection with the failure of the justice system, which should perhaps be the subject of a debate on another day. Today, I must place it on the record that, having knowledge of the Clancy family, who are well known in the Irvine area, I am convinced that Patrick Clancy will not be working for the &pound;80 a week he claims to be. Consequently, he is making a complete mockery of the system.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.3/1">I could not agree more. The situation is clear on the basis of my experience and that of my hon. Friend and other hon. Members. I am sure that the Minister is aware of dozens of cases similar to the one that I am describing.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.3/2">Time and again, I have come across similar situations, which is why I made the point about the person on PAYE being caught, quite correctly, although it is almost impossible on occasion for the CSA to do much about the person who is self-employed. I encountered one case of an individual whom I and everyone else knew full well was a second-hand car salesman. He was selling more than 60 cars a week, yet he said that his income was less than &pound;70 a week. That cannot be right, and the problem must be corrected at some point.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.0/1">I want to reinforce what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1867" name="Brian Jenkins">my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins)</phrase> said. The situation that he described has been well known to the CSA for many years. I have raised it on a number of occasions, as have other hon. Members. I sometimes wonder whether those on the Front Bench listen and look into the issues that Back Benchers raise. The phenomenon is not new&mdash;it has been around a long time&mdash;but no one has done anything to tackle it. Now we know why the CSA gets itself into a mess from time to time.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/2">There must be a way to bring to book the people who are dodging the system. On the one hand, someone who works in a factory can get clobbered; on the other, someone who owns their own business can get away with blue murder. It is about time that that loophole was plugged.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.1/1">My hon. Friend is right, and this is why Sir David Henshaw has a job on his hands. He will have to convince me and my hon. Friends, as well as colleagues across the House, that a system will come into being that covers the points made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1867" name="Brian Jenkins">my hon. Friend and by my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins)</phrase>. This issue needs to be looked at and we need some ideas from David Henshaw long before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/2">I welcome the proposal to revisit the legislation and hope to have the opportunity of making some input to it. I am sure that my hon. Friends also want some input. Again, I ask the Minister what consultation is taking place to allow hon. Members with first-hand experience to have some input so that we can have a transparent system, which we must have. The system that operates just now is neither transparent nor fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/3">In the first instance, I am here to seek justice&mdash;that is the only word for it&mdash;for my constituent from a system that has consistently let her down every step of the way. I fully accept that the individual has responsibility, and that is the case that has to be made, but the state equally has responsibility. It must be shown clearly that there is some form of state responsibility. That is the third issue on which I ask for clarification and comment from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/4">While I accept that liability orders were put in place, it took 13 years for the agency finally to take the case to a full court hearing. As I explained, when it came to court, Dawn Rennie was not given the opportunity either to attend or to defend her family. That is plainly wrong, and it must be addressed and resolved by the Minister and the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/5">It must be said&mdash;there is no other way to put it&mdash;that the CSA has been a charter for disaster since its inception. My constituent has received neither a formal apology nor any hint of meaningful compensation. She was offered &pound;150 as a good-will gesture when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1961" name="Sandra Osborne">my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Sandra Osborne)</phrase> took the case up some seven years ago. I hope the Minister can rectify that either today or in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/6">No doubt the Minister has had to face difficulties, but they are minuscule compared with the grief of those caught in the net of a bungling, inept system that has been accepted as such by the Secretary of State himself. The Government must face up to their responsibilities and acknowledge that the system is inept. They must address the problem immediately, not at some time in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/7">The Government have been quick enough to compensate farmers time and again&mdash;the latest occasion was after the foot and mouth outbreak. It seems that people would be better off if they were animals, because compensation is so quickly offered to farmers, but it is not offered, and there is no proposal to do so, for all the mistakes that have been made by this agency over the years. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" name="Brian H Donohoe">my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase> on securing this debate on a subject that is obviously important to his constituent. I appreciate that he feels strongly about the agency, as do other hon. Members who intervened.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/2">I shall speak first about the specific case, on which the agency has fully briefed me. It is a difficult one and I am sure that hon. Members appreciate that I am constrained in the comments that I can make on specific cases. However, I always welcome the opportunity to discuss child support issues and to lay out the steps that the Government are now embarked upon to address in the long term the current performance shortcomings to which my hon. Friend referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/3">The case illustrates the complex and lengthy processes that are often involved in securing maintenance for children. Miss Rennie has been seeking maintenance for her child through the CSA since its inception in the early 1990s. She has experienced a number of problems that have thwarted progress in the agency's attempt to secure maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/4">The complex system for calculating maintenance that was in place when Miss Rennie first made her claim has led to a number of different maintenance assessments. However, the two individuals involved have also played a part. Claims and counterclaims by Miss Rennie and her ex-partner, mainly in relation to his income, also led to a number of revisions of both the weekly assessment and the level of outstanding debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/5">Although I acknowledge that Miss Rennie has not received from the agency the level of service that she had a right to expect, it is clear that the agency has tried a number of different ways to secure the money owed by the non-resident parent. Two liability orders have been obtained in respect of maintenance owed, the first in August 1995 for more than &pound;4,000 and the second in October 2002 for more than &pound;12,000, and a range of enforcement measures have been used or attempted. They include a charge for payment in January 2003, the registration of letters of inhibition in May 2003, an attachment to attempt to seize a vehicle in June 2003, arrestment to freeze a bank account in August 2003 and orders for deduction of earnings in December 1993, in November 1994, which was revised in February 1995, and August 2001. All those attempts took place before the recent sheriff's judgment on further enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/6">Although there have been a few brief periods when maintenance was paid&mdash;mainly in September 1998 and between January and March 2003&mdash;in addition to the informal payment of pocket money to the child, it is clear that overall Miss Rennie has not achieved the outcome that she was looking for. The question is: why has that happened? It is clear to me that the agency could have acted more quickly, but I do not believe that it can be held solely responsible for failure to obtain maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/7">When looking at individual cases, we must first look at whether parents are facing up to their responsibilities. It is not the responsibility of the CSA to provide maintenance to children. That responsibility lies with the non-resident parent. If non-resident parents met all their financial responsibilities, there would be no need for the agency to exist. Too often, debates about child support cases focus on the poor performance of the agency when the underlying issue is whether the non-resident parent is meeting their obligations. In the most recent sheriff court judgment in this case, the sheriff found that Miss Rennie's ex-partner had</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/8" class="indent">&quot;neither wilfully refused nor been culpably negligent in not paying the sum due&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/9">The implication of that is that Miss Rennie's ex-partner has not been avoiding his obligations, but has been unable to meet them due to his financial position.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/10">It is not the normal procedure for the parent with care to be called at the court hearing because the action is taken on behalf of the agency. Information was being gathered continuously from her and the agency case was presented by a specialist solicitor, but the sheriff accepted that the witnesses who spoke on behalf of the non-resident parent in ascertaining his income level were credible. As the judgment stands, the agency is unable to enforce the recovery of the outstanding debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/11">I am sure that Miss Rennie has a view about the sheriff's ruling, as does my hon. Friend. I sense that their dissatisfaction may now be directed more at aspects of the Scottish legal process than at the agency, but I am sure that my hon. Friend will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on that.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.0/1">That is why the agency resorted to going to court in that case. It is not for me to comment on the sheriff's judgment&mdash;that is for others to comment on, and I am aware that they have. The agency can take the action to court, but it cannot determine the conclusion that the sheriff might reach.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/2">The case that my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire raises illustrates one of the many reasons why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State concluded that the present system was not fit for purpose. The CSA was set up to replace a court system that was slow and complex, and which did not deliver for parents caring for children. Unfortunately, most of those complaints have also been levelled at the agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/3">Throughout the agency's history, there has been an endless stream of negative stories and a constant flow of letters and calls from the public to the agency and to MPs pointing out its manifest failings. I have asked my officials to consider whether anything further can be done in this specific case, and I shall write to my hon. Friend when I have had a response.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/4">Turning to the broader issues that my hon. Friend and others have raised, last year we asked the newly appointed chief executive of the agency, Stephen Geraghty, to conduct a root and branch review of the agency's operations. From his findings, we concluded that the current system was incapable of delivering the outcomes that we all desire from a child support agency. The problems are not just in how the agency operates but in the policy and legislative framework that is supposed to support it. We therefore asked Sir David Henshaw to redesign the system. The terms of reference for the redesign have been drawn as widely as possible to allow all options for reform to be considered fully.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/5">My hon. Friend asked about involvement of and consultation with other people. Sir David has already written to all Members of the House asking for their views. If hon. Friends have not received the letter, I encourage them to give their views to Sir David Henshaw if they wish. He has also already formally been in touch with Opposition spokespersons for Department for Work and Pensions matters, and is expected to report to Ministers later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/6">In addition, we recently published an operational improvement plan that sets out how the agency will turn around its performance over the next three years. The &pound;90 million investment will support the recruitment of more staff and the deployment of more staff to processing work, particularly enforcement. We will quadruple the number of staff who are dedicated to enforcement activity from just over 500 to 2,000 by 2009, with an aim to raise compliance from the 65 per cent. that is achieved at present to 80 per cent. by March 2009. We shall also consider the use of data from credit reference agencies and from Revenue and Customs.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/7">A further &pound;30 million will be invested in using private debt collection agencies to recover more than &pound;100 million of historic debt during the three years of the plan. That will also allow us to draw on the expertise of the private sector. Work has already begun on introducing those improvements and will continue while Sir David is producing his redesign of the whole agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/8">In conclusion, I believe that all Members of the House continue to support the original objectives of the CSA. The measures that we have announced are an important step towards improving the present arrangements and, critically, putting in place the foundations for a child support system that will have a better chance of meeting those objectives in the long run.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-21a.61.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development"  colnum="61"  time="013:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/halltext/60321h05.htm#60321h05_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.61.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1987" name="Ann McKechin">my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin)</phrase> on securing the debate and more generally on her work on the International Development Committee and as chair of the all-party group on debt, aid and trade. I share her view that we made substantial progress on debt and aid last year. We saw important progress for the very poorest nations of the world at Hong Kong. However, like her, I hope that we shall see more substantial progress on securing the outcome from the Doha development round of World Trade Organisation talks that we all want.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/2">I have been interested in social transfers ever since I visited the Germiston township just outside Johannesburg to see a project that DFID was funding and which Christian Aid ran. The project supported a number of women in the township and provided support to those living with HIV/AIDS. The scheme helped to ensure that orphans got into school and&mdash;crucial to this debate&mdash;that elders in the community were provided with support to access the pensions that are available in South Africa. Those pensions make a fundamental difference to the lives of elderly people in that community helping to look after those who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/3">My hon. Friend's contribution in this debate is particularly timely, building on the attention generated by the Department's paper on social transfers, which was published in October 2005, and on what was more recently expressed in the UNICEF and DFID-hosted global partners forum on AIDS-affected children, which also considered how social transfers might best help those orphaned by AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/4">As my hon. Friend rightly said, the Department is preparing a new White Paper on international development. We are exploring a range of options and I shall take her comments about meaningful work on economic growth, tax systems and social protection systems as a contribution to the consultation process on that White Paper. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has already made it clear that further work on economic growth will be a key part of DFID's work going forward. I accept my hon. Friend's point about the need to support developing countries to do more work on tax systems&mdash;I would see that as part of the broader work on governance&mdash;and social protection systems. There is a debate going on in the Department, and more generally with NGOs, parliamentarians and so on, about the role that social protection and social transfers can play.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/5">My hon. Friend drew attention to a number of countries where social transfer systems are already in place. Bangladesh and Nepal have social pensions, and Mozambique has had a social transfer programme since the early 1990s. There is no question in my mind or the Department's but that social transfer schemes have a role to play. The idea that poor people cannot be trusted with money, which my hon. Friend described, certainly has no traction in DFID or on the Labour side of the House generally. If there were any doubt, the appetite for micro finance and the success of micro finance institutions around the world should have put that to bed. The success of social transfer programmes also provides powerful evidence of that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/6">There is an issue, however, about the speed at which social transfers are introduced. If it happens too fast, it can overwhelm local capacity and often undermine broader civil service reform initiatives. A gradual expansion, from smaller initiatives and pilot projects, has proved to be effective, not least in Brazil and Mexico, which are two of the examples that I think my hon. Friend mentioned. We see our role as providing finance and helping to build the capacity of the developing country Government to put in place social transfer schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/7">My hon. Friend will be familiar with the Commission for Africa, which recommended in its final document that donors should commit to long-term predictable funding of national social protection strategies with some $2 billion a year immediately, rising to $5 billion to $6 billion by 2015. We are seeking to build a consensus on the adoption of such commitments. As part of our work following last year's publication of the social transfers paper, we are developing a handbook to provide guidance and advice for developing country Governments and for our staff who work on such projects on the setting up of social transfer programmes, drawing on good and bad experiences from around the world. I hope that that will be ready towards the end of May and that my hon. Friend will see it as a tangible demonstration of the fact that the Department wants to take such work forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/8">My hon. Friend is also right to highlight the scale of the challenges that face us in tackling poverty, which is demonstrated by many statistics, not least that half of Africa's children live in absolute poverty. A daily reality for many of the families wherein those children live is the constant worry as to whether the children will go to bed hungry or have to miss school because they cannot afford the user fees, and whether they can afford to go to the clinic and access the necessary medicines when they are ill.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/9">Hundreds of millions of families worldwide live with those uncertainties, and are unable to care properly for their children or plan properly for their future. They cannot access the fundamental human rights to social security and an adequate standard of living. In that context, social transfers have a huge potential role to play in helping to reach poor families with regular and predictable grants of cash or food over a period of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/10">My hon. Friend rightly pointed out that social transfers are not new. In the UK, our poverty rate would probably be three times higher if we did not have a national, tax-funded system of social transfers. In the past 10 to 15 years, middle-income countries such as Brazil, Mexico and South Africa have put in place national social transfer programmes. The most common schemes are non-contributory old-age pensions and programmes that provide cash transfers to support children and their families. In Brazil, the Bolsa Familia cash transfer programme aims to reach a quarter of the population by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/11">Evaluations of existing social transfer programmes suggest that their impact has been pretty impressive to date. They have transformed the lives of millions of households and increased the incomes of poor households&mdash;significantly, in some cases. The evaluations show that in South Africa and Mexico there have been major impacts on early childhood development, with young children being significantly taller than they would have been. Clearly, the health and education of the poorest families has improved as a result of the programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/12">Evaluations of the effects of such programmes in Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa show that people are healthier as a result of their improved nutrition and greater ability to travel to and access health services and buy medicines. School attendance among those who benefit from social transfer programmes has also risen as families use the cash to send their children to school. Given the success of such programmes in middle-income countries, it is clear that well-implemented social transfers have a role to play and could have a similar impact in the world's poorest countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/13">My hon. Friend might know that last October I travelled with the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>, to Zambia and then Malawi. We were in Zambia at the start of a small pilot scheme, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North referred, that provides 1,000 households with up to $8 a month, which is beginning to demonstrate the potential of social transfers in the world's poorest countries. The early results of that scheme show that families are eating more meals, fewer people are dying, health has improved and there has been a significant increase in school attendance.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/14">In Bangladesh, a social transfer programme that we fund has resulted in a 70 per cent. reduction in the number of families without enough to eat.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/15">My hon. Friend talked about children who are affected by AIDS, and the potential for support to carers. Given the severe challenge that HIV/AIDS poses in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of AIDS orphans is projected to rise to 18 million by 2010, we certainly believe that social transfers have a huge potential role to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/16">Let me give a personal example of the difference that social transfers make. In Zambia, a 50-year-old widow called Jesinaya Kambanje, who cares for eight children who have been orphaned as a result of HIV/AIDS, has been able to access the social transfer pilot programme. The children used to go hungry and she was often forced to beg from her neighbours. Now, as a result of the pilot, she can buy maize and vegetables for the children, and when one of them was ill she was able to take her to hospital and buy medicine to support her.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/17">Social transfers can provide millions of children with a future. They are an investment by the state in its poorest citizens. I agree with my hon. Friend's point that by sharing wealth, the state creates wealth. As a result, children can grow up free from hunger, better educated, and healthy enough to become more productive members of society, in turn providing poor countries with more competitive work forces. By directly channelling cash to poor people, the state is recognising that poor people know best how to care for their families. The evidence suggests that they spend that cash well. As my hon. Friend says, they can be trusted to spend money appropriately and in a way that suits their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/18">Supporting human development is not the only way in which social transfers contribute to economic growth. As well as providing poor people with security and the knowledge that they can provide their children with the essentials for life for the foreseeable future, social transfers encourage adults to invest in new business opportunities. In Mexico, beneficiaries of the Progresa programme&mdash;to which my hon. Friend referred&mdash;spend, on average, a quarter of their social transfer payment on investment in micro-enterprises, giving, on the basis of the evaluation that we have seen, high returns up to 50 per cent. In Zambia, Jesinaya used her transfer to buy two chickens to invest in production, and is planning to purchase a pig. My hon. Friend will recognise that there is potential for Jesinaya to make more money as a result of those investments.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/19">The criticism that social transfers create dependency is not a valid argument. In South Africa and Brazil, recipients of social transfers are more likely to be in work than those without a transfer. That might be partly because the extra cash means that poor people are better able to cover the costs of finding work and more likely to keep their jobs due to their improved health. There is also evidence that cash transfers help to stimulate local economic activity by increasing purchasing power, particularly in areas where the economy is weak.</p>
