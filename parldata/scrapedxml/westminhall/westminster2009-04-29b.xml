<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29b.261.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="261"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0002.htm#09042944000467">
	<p pid="b.261.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1924" name="John Penrose">the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose)</phrase> on raising this issue once again. It is important to follow through on achievements and to comment on some of the things that we would like to see happen. The hon. Gentleman he speaks as only a beekeeper can, with knowledge of the organism itself. That is important.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/2">This has been one of the most delightful campaigns in which I have been involved since joining the House. It has been an amazing success that started from rock bottom. I remember a Minister once telling us&mdash;I will not use the exact language&mdash;not to bother, as there was no money in the kitty. Well, &pound;10 million is not bad, and it could be the start of much more funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/3">The campaign has been successful, and congratulations must go to the British Beekeepers' Association and its past presidents: Tim Lovett, Ivor Davies, David Aston and Norman Carrick, who has been a sterling adviser to the association. Tim Lovett was once a student of mine, and on Friday he will be awarded an honorary fellowship from the new vice-chancellor of the university of East Anglia. I promised that I will re-mark his final papers if they are still in existence on a database somewhere, as I do not think that he got the credit due to him. He has been a real success&mdash;it is nice to have a student who makes it, as many have not&mdash;but I congratulate all those individuals on what they have done.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/4">I also thank the Minister and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. My right hon. Friend took this issue seriously when he was approached about it, and has been a sterling supporter throughout the campaign, which has been picked by the media and the public. In many walks of life, we talk about public understanding of this, that and the other, and how that interacts with the media, but there can be no better example than the campaign on bees, which has been handled well. Indeed, there was even a march to Downing street of beekeepers with puffers and white suits, which received a lot of media publicity, and people such as Martha Kearney have made programmes and so on. That puffing display in Whitehall happened on the day that President Obama got elected, so we did not do too badly in getting some media interest at that time.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/5">We must congratulate the campaigners on their cool, quiet approach. The campaign has been effective, not only in this place but elsewhere. It has involved beekeepers right from the beginning, and I am sure that they are pleased to see their hard work recognised. To achieve recognition that this is not only about different types of honey bee, but about the fact that they pollinate crops and are essential to many industries in this country, was put forward as the big plan. I look forward to other campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/6">I see an old foe of mine, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase>, sitting on the other side of the Chamber. We are going to have a real battle over open access for journals, and about bringing this matter into the public sphere so that people can see what is published and what is not published. I hope that he does not rise to the bait&mdash;there will be other occasions when we can enjoy that kind of campaigning.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29b.262.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="262"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0002.htm#09042944000469">
	<p pid="b.262.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend. It is true&mdash;the problems have been much the same across the planet. The value of bees in development and other aspects of agriculture has been recognised in other places. Britain is taking a major lead in trying to find out the causes of the collapse, and that will help other countries to develop their programmes. I know that there is plenty of contact.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/2">The public campaign was not bad. Petitions with 140,000 signatures were presented to Downing street&mdash;suddenly, from nowhere, bees were everywhere. When campaigners hear bees mentioned on &quot;The Archers&quot; they should know that they have arrived. It is the only time that I would listen to &quot;The Archers&quot;. I had better not say what I think about the programme because we are talking about Radio 4. None the less, many people listen to it and say, &quot;We did not know that there was a problem with bees until we listened to 'The Archers'.&quot; After that, the whole campaign took off. The Minister was not the only person to help the campaign. Lurking in the background was a man called Prince Charles, whose science I have argued with for many years. Although his understanding of nanotechnology is nil and of genetic modification is minus 10, he was correct on this issue, which shows that we should not condemn somebody for everything that they think.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/3">In the past month or so there has been a new funding initiative, which is something that many scientists and medics would die for. The National Scientific and Technical Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Scottish Government&mdash;my goodness&mdash;and the Wellcome Trust have come together to put money into that hybrid fund. It is how the money is used that I want to discuss, because we have a once in a lifetime chance to ensure that we do something with it of which we can be proud.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/4">The five funding bodies have different interests, which will make reaching a decision very difficult. It is bad enough when one funding body has to make a decision, but when five of them come together in the same room with different agendas, real skill is required to address the needs of the bee community. The right direction must be chosen; the area of study must be neither too broad nor too narrow. The aim is not to win Nobel prizes in this field, but to resolve a practical problem. The Wellcome Trust itself has an ambition to research pollinators rather than just honey bees, which has already been mentioned. That will have to be addressed in the joint meetings.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/5">The inclination on the side of the funders to be too ambitious has been fanned by the media interest. We must rein back a little and be cool and hard-headed about the decisions we make. Sometimes, scientists get carried away and go down crazy avenues without thinking about the real purpose and effectiveness of a campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/6">As I have mentioned, there are limitations on the &pound;10 million because we want the funding to continue. Understanding bees will be a continuing problem. What we learn from this research will be important in other areas of research as well. We must work out the problem carefully. If public understanding and involving people who know something about the subject are to mean anything, it is essential that research councils stop being hoity-toity and thinking that they know it all just because they have a few greybeards from the science community and fellows of the Royal Society attached. The research councils do not know it all. It is essential that the beekeepers are present, because they have lived with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/7">Engaging with the beekeepers will be a real challenge, but once councils learn how to do that they will be able to apply the skill to the many young people in this country who study high-flying science but never get involved in funding decisions. Such decisions are made by a few men&mdash;I say men because only the odd woman is involved, but the Equality Bill should sort that out. There should be a real change in the way in which research councils operate and engage with people. I am talking about not just getting the money and making decisions, but involving the people who tell them about the problems and how the money can be effectively used.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/8">We are not talking about Nobel prize-winning stuff, although it feels that way because the topic is in the limelight. When an issue gets in the press, some people tend to get carried away and think, &quot;This must all be about molecular biology with a bit of DNA and protein involved. All we need are a few high-fangled pieces of research and that will be all right.&quot; That is not what the bee campaign is about. We will not see much cutting-edge technology because it is risky in this case.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/9">I was very impressed by Professor Ratnieks at Sussex university. He is the first professor of apiculture&mdash;bee culture. Taking on such a subject is a real initiative by the university and should be complimented. Ratnieks has a five-year study in which he wants to look at honey bee research. Four of his projects, which cost &pound;250,000 each, should be supported. He wants to breed disease-resistant &quot;hygienic&quot; honey bees, which remove dead or infected larvae and pupae from their cells, thereby reducing the spread of diseases within a colony and disrupting the breeding cycle of varroa mites, which carry the viruses and activate viruses when they bite. &quot;Hygiene&quot; is a natural genetic trait among bees, meaning that it can be bred from normal and low-cost breeding methods. Once a stock of &quot;hygienic&quot; bees has been bred, they can then be provided to beekeepers and introduced into hives. Such a project will produce practical results that can easily be passed on to beekeepers, and it employs a breeding method that has been tried and tested by Professor Ratnieks. Another project takes advantage of successful research developed in other countries on the control of varroa mites and adapts it to the British climate. Such research has been carried out and was successful in the initial experiments and is a low-cost enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/10">We are in a unique position. We must think practically and logically rather than ambitiously to prevent the decline of the honey bees. We do not need much more media attention&mdash;one can have too much of that, as I keep telling <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase>, whose economics I have engaged with. His economics are not as sound as the press often think. He is rather miserable; I call him &quot;el miserablo&quot; because of the gloom and doom he spreads in this country when he could be talking about some of the good stories in industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/11">The reason I became interested in this issue was not because a student of mine was involved, but because I could see that if we did not look after these creatures, on which we depend for more than just honey on toast, we would lose control over food production and the wild environment. Even this morning, I realised that the almonds and the croissants in Portcullis House depend on bees. It cannot be better than that. The establishment of the research fund is very good news so, let us take the opportunity and ensure that it is used wisely and for practical purposes that benefit agriculture and industry and ensure the survival of the honey bee colonies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29b.271.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1923" speakername="Tim Farron" colnum="271"  time="010:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0003.htm#09042944000475">
	<p pid="b.271.1/1">Indeed. We cannot know the details of an unknowable, and the hon. Gentleman is correct to make that point. That is one of the reasons why we need to be careful about over-emphasising that issue. Having said that, the number of unregistered beekeepers is a blind spot and our ability to deliver information, including information about regulations and correct practices for example, and even treatments depends on our ability to know where the beekeepers are.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/2">We also need to have more comprehensive ways of delivering information and of ensuring helpful and sympathetic inspection. However, there are indicators that that is not currently the case. For example, the recent report by the National Audit Office showed that many beekeepers had not been made aware of many of the regulations on importing honey bees.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/3">There are too many unknowns, as many hon. Members have mentioned today. We talk about the grey squirrel effect, for example. To what extent are we losing bees due to native species being forced out by more aggressive foreign bees? There are other factors. For instance, there is the threat of climate change, including the effect of wet weather on mating patterns and on preventing bees from foraging for enough nectar and pollen to see them through the winter months. All those potential threats need to be understood, and they need to be understood quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/4">There are also many perceived hazards that may affect bee populations. In particular, we have heard about pesticides. However, it is important at this stage that we acknowledge that there is currently no evidence that indicates that pesticides are a factor in colony losses, and we should not allow such issues to divert us from taking urgent action on those factors that are known to cause colony loss. Examining the perceived hazards could be a serious distraction.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/5">Until 2007, the Government dedicated only &pound;200,000 to research into bee health in England and the overwhelming majority of that money was spent on meeting statutory obligations rather than on focusing on the urgent problems faced by beekeepers, such as the varroa parasite. Once again, the NAO concluded that DEFRA's attempts to control varroa have not prevented it from becoming endemic. Only last month, a senior DEFRA civil servant appeared before the Public Accounts Committee and confirmed that bee health had not been a priority for the Department. However, that was an honest admission, and it is impressive that we are now moving forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/6">It is important to welcome the Government's recent announcement of significant funding for research. For some time now, many of us have been backing the BBKA's campaign for increased research funding, and so it is extremely encouraging that it has been granted. However, I want to emphasise a point that others have already made, which is the lack of clarity about where the &pound;10 million of research money will be targeted. After the fanfare that accompanied the announcement of that &pound;10 million, it is now clear that the research that it will fund will investigate the problems faced by all pollinators. We accept that approach, up to a point. However, I understand that there are 2,500 species of pollinating insects in this country, including about 250 species of bee, only one of which is the honey bee. Given that the honey bee is responsible for more than 50 per cent. of the pollination of wild plants, there is real concern about a lack of clarity regarding the research money and specifically about how much will be spent on researching honey bee health. So I just want to ask the Minister to confirm today that the overwhelming majority of that funding will be directed at research into honey bees.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/7">We need an immediate shot in the arm for bee health research, and we need to ensure that any treatments are delivered effectively. My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife pointed out another issue that is holding up effective treatment, which is the fact that bees are classed as livestock. It is often the case that a vet is required to use any treatment. I want the Minister to confirm that she will lobby for a change in the EU regulations, under the veterinary medicines directorate, to allow not only vets but bee experts, including beekeepers, to decide on the use of treatments in order to ensure that we roll out those treatments effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/8">In conclusion, we must also look to the future. Repopulating mainland Britain with wild bees, as well as restoring the strength of farmed bee colonies, must be a medium-term aim. To that end, we should look to use disease-free communities, such as the Isle of Man, as nurseries, to allow healthy bee hives to be brought back to the mainland, so that we can ensure a growth in the populations of both wild and commercial bees.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/9">My final point is simple. This campaign has been going on for some time, and we came up against the issue of credibility, in that it was difficult to be taken seriously by the Government. For all those who have been involved in the campaign at every level, it is immensely encouraging to see that we have achieved such a lot. Consequently, although it is important that we ask the key questions, about how this research money will be delivered and targeted and about many other issues, it is important that we are not churlish and instead give credit to the Government for taking this issue seriously, albeit belatedly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29b.273.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" speakername="Richard Benyon" colnum="273"  time="010:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0003.htm#09042944000476">
	<p pid="b.273.0/1">Like others, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1924" name="John Penrose">the Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose)</phrase> for securing the debate and for showing such a knowledgeable understanding of the problems facing beekeepers and honey bee populations in this country. I particularly welcome the fact that he is setting up an all-party group, which I will certainly follow closely. I hope that the group will track the welcome new funding and that it will be effective. I also pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> for supporting last year's effective lobby and for his unswerving support for beekeepers across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/2">Honey bee health is arguably one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time, and the population of honey bees contributes around &pound;200 million to the UK's agricultural economy. Our bee population is declining at such an alarming rate that the relevant graph shows that it could be effectively wiped out within 10 years. It has never been more urgent that we address the problems facing honey bees in an effective and timely manner.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/3">We have heard eloquent descriptions today of the plethora of threats from diseases such as the varroa mite, foul brood and colony collapse disorder, which is the collective term given to the disappearance of bees. As has been pointed out, bees also face the effects of climate change, habitat loss, intensive farming and insecticides. It is worth contemplating the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>. Speaking as a farmer, I shudder when I think back to the sort of things we were persuaded to use by agronomists in the early 1990s and 1980s to cope with problems such as the orange blossom midge. The insecticide situation is much better now and farmers understand the need to be extremely cautious. In that respect, best practice and regulation have worked, but more needs to be done. I hope that some research will be done into whether systemic pesticides are part of the problem and whether other forms of pesticides, in relation to which the situation is so much better, are a diminishing problem. A great deal of work needs to be done on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/4">Like other hon. Members, I pay tribute to the British Beekeepers Association. It was a great pleasure for me to attend its spring convention at Stoneleigh recently and to see so many thousands of enthusiastic people, who were determined to tackle the problems faced by honey bee populations. It was a pleasure to meet Norman Carreck, who works with Professor Ratnieks in Brighton at Sussex university. I look forward to going down there to see first hand the wonderful work that they are doing. I also pay tribute to the west Berkshire branch of the BBKA. It is a wonderful local organisation and it has guided me in an important part of my brief.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/5">The lobby that took place last year was one of the most effective lobbies of Parliament that I have seen in my short time here, and it was a great tribute to all those involved. I could be churlish and complain and whinge about the lack of funding in the past but, in the spirit of the debate, I pay tribute to those who have campaigned effectively and to those who have listened and enabled increased funding to be secured. It is important to consider the detail of where the funding could go. There are considerable concerns, and I hope that the Minister will tackle those in the time that she has.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/6">Let us consider the funding element. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has marketed new funding for research into bee health, but it is not clear how much will be spent specifically on research into honey bee health. Although up to &pound;10 million of extra funding has been pledged, that money will be spread around research into all pollinators, as we have heard. The figure that I have in my head&mdash;although that figure has been slightly varied by today's contributions&mdash;is that 80 per cent. of the pollination that we require to sustain our ecology and agricultural crops comes from the honey bee population.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/7">Whatever the statistic is, honey bees are by far the most important pollinators, and they are the pollinators that we can most affect by good research. It is vital that the vast majority of the research is directed towards honey bees rather than other types of pollinators. Moths, butterflies, hoverflies and bumblebees are important, but they are a mere sideline when compared with the importance of the honey bee population. Money could effectively be wasted on albeit well intentioned research into pollinators that could turn out to be far less relevant to crop pollination. When the new funding for research projects is allocated, I hope that the Minister will reassure us that honey bees will be given priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/8">The Government's much anticipated &quot;Healthy Bees&quot; strategy, which was published in March this year, outlined the Government's aim</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/9" class="indent">&quot;to achieve a sustainable and healthy population of honey bees for pollination and honey production in England and Wales via strengthened partnerships working between Government and other stakeholders.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/10">I wholeheartedly agree that that should be our aim, but, of course, actions speak louder than words. Despite the Government's claims that they aim to strengthen partnerships between themselves and other stakeholders, the &quot;Healthy Bees&quot; document, which was drastically reduced in size from 45 pages to just 12, was only released for the consideration of stakeholders on the Friday before its Monday launch. That is not a great start. I ask the Minister to take those points on board.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/11">The National Bee Unit will play a key role in the Government's &quot;Healthy Bees&quot; strategy and will receive a significant chunk of the new funding. The unit has been criticised for its failure to share information with stakeholders, and the National Audit Office report on &quot;The Health of Livestock and Honey Bees in England&quot; states that the NBU had</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/12" class="indent">&quot;not given sufficient emphasis to sharing the findings of its research more widely&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/13">The report further recommends that the NBU</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/14" class="indent">&quot;share information with the relevant associations&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/15">A lack of consultation with such key people as our beekeepers at that level does not bode well.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/16">As we have heard in the debate, a large proportion of the funding going to the NBU will be spent on BeeBase, which is a database of beekeepers in the UK. According to the NBU, that database is currently seriously undersubscribed. Knowing where our beekeepers and therefore our honey bee colonies are is, of course, important, particularly for the purposes of disease identification. However, ploughing money into a database seems a somewhat abstract way of tackling honey bee health, particularly when the BBKA already has an impressive database of members with whom they are in regular contact. It is important that the NBU takes steps to try to work with the BBKA and that it pools its resources. According to the BBKA, that has not been happening so far.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/17">If there are beekeepers who have not joined the BBKA as members, what would make them join a central database? It needs to be made clear how the NBU plan to incentivise BeeBase to encourage the remaining few beekeepers to join. I would like to tackle the point about compulsion. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare: compulsion would not be a good move forward. Surely, a far more effective method of making a real difference to honey bee health is to work in partnership with organisations such as the BBKA to reach more beekeepers, harness their knowledge and expertise, and provide better education and training at a local level. Although the Government and the NBU claim that that is their aim, we need to see more action to establish exactly how that will work.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/18">What is next for our bees? Increased standards of bee husbandry are key to tackling the decline in the honey bee population. Research absolutely must be fed down to beekeepers quickly and efficiently for it to make a real difference to honey bee health. Through improving access to education and training on issues such as hive health, feeding and management, we can ensure that bees are given the optimum nutrients and environment that they need to survive.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/19">In the last few minutes of my speech, I shall make an important point about habitat loss. In my part of southern England, agriculture practices have changed in a way that means the Berkshire downs are almost entirely arable. When I was a child, there were almost entirely mixed farming enterprises, which meant that bee colonies did not have to travel as far to find pollen. Periods of pollination are extremely short, so that could well be contributing to the stress from which bee colonies are suffering, and hon. Members have already talked about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/20">We need to consider how we support and incentivise farmers in terms of biodiversity. The loss of set aside will have had a major effect. We should encourage farmers to plant crops such as phacelia&mdash;I plant it at home&mdash;which is a popular plant for bees and other pollinators. Those are the sort of things that can help to reduce stress, increase the amount of pollinators available and help bee colonies in a major way. We also want better summers&mdash;I know that that is not in the gift of the Minister, but I am sure that she can have a word with someone about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.0/21">I finish by paying tribute to Martha Kearney, who produced a very good documentary on the subject for the BBC. She made one vital point, which is a good one on which to finish: honey bees are the environment's canary in the mine, and their decline should be regarded as a potential warning that massive change is taking place within our environment, change that will affect us all.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29b.276.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" speakername="Jane Kennedy" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"  colnum="276"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0004.htm#09042944000477">
	<p pid="b.276.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again, Mr. Benton. Every time I speak in Westminster Hall, I come with a well prepared, thoroughly thought through and balanced response, and on every occasion&mdash;I do not know why I continue to be taken aback&mdash;I have to depart from it because of the well argued and elegant contributions of other Members, such as those we have heard this morning on this important subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/2">I want to mention the contributions made by Members who have since left this Chamber: my hon. Friends the Members for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) and for Stroud (Mr. Drew). Although not all the Members who have taken part in the debate are beekeepers&mdash;I certainly am not&mdash;it seems that there are many more beekeepers in the House of Commons than I would have thought was likely. I hope that I am not breaking a confidence, but I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2019" name="Michael Lord">the hon. Member for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich (Sir Michael Lord)</phrase> used to be a beekeeper.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/3">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1924" name="John Penrose">the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose)</phrase> on securing the debate. I will not be able, in the short time I have to respond, to cover all the points raised, or to give the kind of detail I would like to share with Members on our thinking for the next steps of our programme to understand the issue, work out a plan for tackling problems in bee health and take it forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/4">I will respond quickly to some of the key points that have been made. To all those who have expressed concern about whether we should have a voluntary or compulsory registration scheme for beekeepers, I say that my instinct is always, wherever possible, to encourage co-operation through a voluntary method. If we look at the experience of other countries wrestling with the problem, we will see that there are mixed views on, and experience of, compulsory schemes. Although we may need to keep it under review, I prefer to proceed with a voluntary scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/5">The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare was worried about whether BeeBase will be a development or extension of Big Brother and how we will use the inspectors. I want to respond to the debate and to discuss the increased funding for the National Bee Unit. If he is successful in establishing an all-party group on bees, which I encourage him to do, I will be the first to invite it to visit the NBU at the Food and Environment Research Agency's base in York. I am sure that the unit would be delighted to be visited by interested MPs and that the House would benefit from Members having the opportunity to meet the unit's staff and our inspectors to understand more about their comprehensive programme of work.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/6">I enjoyed the contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>. I did not agree with everything he said, but I was interested to hear some of the comments on how beekeeping used to be taught. Those are all issues we will want to consider carefully, but the increased funding for the NBU is only one part of our programme. I must pay tribute to my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Rooker for laying the foundations of the work, which I was then able to accelerate, in response to what was clearly developing into a pressing problem. We give him full credit and are grateful for that work.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/7">The healthy bee plan has been published. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare quite rightly advised us not to use puns in this debate, and we debated vigorously and humorously what to call our healthy bee plan. The Co-operative beat us to the name, &quot;Plan Bee&quot;, so we decided to go for the much more prosaic and downbeat, &quot;Healthy Bees&quot;. None the less, it is a serious programme of work, and we are absolutely committed to seeing it taken forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/8">Another part of our plan relates to research. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> is a hard man to argue with on the matter, as he knows so much more than I do about it, and I agree in large part with what he said. The research programme will be robust and carefully evaluated. I wish to reassure <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase>, whom I congratulate on his entertaining speech, that we certainly hope to see the first project starting before the end of 2009. The call for proposals is already being made, and we are now in the spring, so I reassure him and encourage those who might be considering putting in bids for research that we are inviting people to make those now.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/9">It is important that I join others in paying tribute to the British Beekeepers Association for its role in raising the profile of the issue. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that its research paper will be considered not only by me and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but by those who will determine the shape of the research as it proceeds, so it will inform decisions on the research.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/10">I have been asked several detailed questions, but if I do not manage to answer them all, I will write as fully as possible to every Member who has participated in the debate. I have been asked how much will be spent on honey bees from the research programme. I want to share with Members the carefully crafted advice that I have received on that:</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/11" class="indent">&quot;I would expect the research allocation to be broadly proportionate to the importance of honey bees, relative to other pollinators.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/12">The fact that we refer to our plan as the honey bee plan indicates how important we accept honey bees to be. They are, as the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare rightly noted, the first pollinators out in spring.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/13">In the short time I have left I wish to pay tribute to Martha Kearney. Watching her documentary was one of the few occasions recently when I have been able to say that the BBC did a really good job. It was an excellent programme. Those who missed it should watch it, because it was balanced and explained carefully the full range of challenges facing bees. [Hon. Members: &quot;The Bee Bee Cee.&quot;] I will not be drawn down that route.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/14">Those responsible for the research funding will seek to ensure a balanced programme. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">The hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase> made a good speech in which he congratulated the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government for their contribution, and I agree with him on that. One of the reasons why we made the announcement on funding after the announcements on the healthy bees plan and on our commitment to the NBU, was that we were working hard to bring together all the partners. As I have said, I will write to Members in greater detail. I am grateful to those who have acknowledged the Government's commitment to the issue. We have a lot of work to do on it, but I can promise all those interested that the Government take the issue extraordinarily seriously. I think that any half-way educated person can appreciate the importance of bees to our environment, our food chain and, therefore, our country.</p>

	<p pid="b.287.1/1">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak about the need for recognition of those British citizens who became heroes of the holocaust. I want to put on the record my thanks&mdash;and I am sure those of many people in the UK including hon. and right hon. Members of the House and Members of the other place&mdash;for all the excellent work done by the Holocaust Educational Trust under the leadership of its chief executive, Karen Pollock. Without its support and guidance, I might not be holding this debate today.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.1/2">With colleagues' permission, I want to say a little about that fine organisation before I move on to the substance of the debate. The Holocaust Educational Trust was founded in 1988 by Lord Janner of Braunstone and the late Lord Merlyn-Rees. It was developed by MPs and peers as a result of significant renewed interest and the need for knowledge about the holocaust during the parliamentary proceedings of the War Crimes Act 1991. The trust aims to raise awareness and understanding about the holocaust and its relevance today in schools and with the wider public. It is vital that the holocaust has a permanent place in our nation's collective memory.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29b.288.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" speakername="Russell Brown" colnum="288"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0005.htm#09042944000490">
	<p pid="b.288.0/1">My hon. Friend raises an important point. There is no doubt that denial of what has happened is very dangerous. A number of weeks ago, the Holocaust Educational Trust held an event in this Palace to look at issues surrounding the current financial difficulties that we all face. Comparisons were made between the current time, and what happened in Europe&mdash;Germany in particular&mdash;in the late '20s and early '30s. It is important to recognise that history is here, and we should learn its lessons. The point made that evening was that what happened then will not necessarily happen again, but there are lessons to be learned and we must all be careful about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/2">The Think Equal programme is delivered in certain London boroughs, and it is anticipated that it will be taken into schools across the country. The Holocaust Educational Trust's Lessons from Auschwitz project for post-16 students and teachers is now in its 10th year. It has taken more than 5,000 students and teachers from across the UK to Auschwitz and Birkenau. Many MPs and other guests have also taken part in those visits, and all of us who have had the opportunity to engage in that project fully recognise its value and the contribution that it makes to the education of young people in our constituencies. In November 2005, many of us were delighted when the Treasury announced funding of &pound;1.5 million for the Lessons from Auschwitz project.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/3">There are recollections and eyewitness accounts from people who remember the holocaust. The Holocaust Educational Trust has produced a BAFTA award-winning DVD-ROM in conjunction with the USC Shoah Foundation Institute. The groundbreaking, interactive teaching resource integrates testimony from 18 eyewitnesses of the holocaust, including Jewish, Roma, Sinti and Jehovah's Witness survivors, as well as that of political prisoners and testimony from survivors of the eugenics programme. Teacher training is delivered to trainee teachers at universities and institutions of higher education and to practising teachers as part of their continuing professional development. An annual teacher training course is also held at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, which is open to both trainee and practising teachers from across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/4">I will now talk about why we are here today. I applied for this debate at the beginning of last week, and yesterday the Prime Minister took the opportunity to visit Auschwitz. Indications appear to suggest that my right hon. Friend the Minister might have something positive to reveal to us today; we wait in anticipation.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/5">We all recognise that the holocaust is one of the darkest episodes in human history, which saw the systematic persecution and murder of approximately 6 million Jews. Other victims included Roma and Sinti Gypsies, the disabled, gay people, trade unionists, the clergy and political opponents of the Nazi regime. Every year in this country we mark Holocaust memorial day, thanks in no small part to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>. At that time, we pause and remember the souls of those who lost their lives&mdash;they are remembered with dignity and with a commitment to fight prejudice wherever it is found.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/6">Like so many of the dark times in history, there are often heroes who come to the fore. All too often, what go untold are the extraordinary acts of bravery and selflessness of those who, at great risk to themselves, saved people from certain death. They are people such as June Ravenhall and Major Frank Foley, who were both mentioned in early-day motion 1175, which now has over 130 signatories. They are Ida and Louise Cook from Wandsworth, and Sofka Skipworth who assisted in smuggling the names of Jewish prisoners in a French internment camp to the British authorities and also helped to smuggle out a newborn Jewish baby in a Red Cross box.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/7">Colleagues may wish to refer to some of those individuals, but I want to talk about Jane Haining, who was born in 1897 in the village of Dunscore, a few miles from the town of Dumfries. Jane's mother passed away when Jane was only five years old, and Jane grew up to be both determined and capable. For a number of years, she worked in a factory in Paisley. After attending a meeting in Glasgow about the Jewish Mission, she became intrigued about the work. In 1932, she got the call to work at a Church of Scotland mission to the Jews in Budapest.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/8">Jane was very popular with the 400 or so children at the school, who came from a mix of Christian and Jewish backgrounds. Many of them were orphans from poverty-stricken or broken homes. Others attended the school because of the quality of the education. It was apparent that Jane loved both her work and the children. In one letter, Jane wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/9" class="indent">&quot;We have one new little six year old, an orphan without a mother or father. She is such a pathetic wee soul to look at and I fear that the poor lamb has not been in too good surroundings before she came to us...She certainly does look as though she needs heaps and heaps of love.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/10">Jane was on leave in Scotland when world war two broke out. She immediately returned to Budapest to help the Jewish children. When the Nazis invaded Hungary in 1944, the missionaries were ordered back to the safety of Scotland. Jane disobeyed the order and remained to take care of the children. She said:</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/11" class="indent">&quot;If these children need me in the days of sunshine, how much more do they need me in the days of darkness?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/12">Her sister later recalled:</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/13" class="indent">&quot;It was no surprise that she refused to come back. She would never have had a moment's happiness if she had come home and left the children.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/14">The children came under increasing threat, and Jane protected them to the best of her ability. She was denounced to the Nazi authorities and, when the SS raided the place in early May, she was arrested and thrown in jail on charges of British espionage and helping Jews. Jane and some of the children were later deported to Auschwitz. Those of us who have visited Auschwitz-Birkenau can only imagine the hell on Earth. The secondary pupils who were with me on the visit left thinking deeply about what man has done to man.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/15">Jane Haining supported the children throughout the short time that she was at Auschwitz. In a period of three months, it is recorded that some 1.3 million people were killed, including Jane Haining. She refused to reject her children. She died for her beliefs and was gassed along with a group of Hungarian women on <phrase class="date" code="1944-08-16">16 August 1944</phrase> at the age of 47. As she was a British citizen and passport holder, the Church of Scotland was sent her death certificate, which indicated that she had been arrested on justified suspicion of espionage against Germany and that she had died in hospital on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-17">17 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/16">Jane Haining, like a number of other British heroes of the holocaust, was recognised in 1997. Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Memorial in Jerusalem, awarded Jane a medal and a place among &quot;the righteous among the nations&quot; for her selfless dedication to the children. She has been remembered in the stained glass windows of Queen's Park church in Glasgow. At the local church in Dunscore, a dedicated group of local people have erected a cairn and a plaque to her memory.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/17">The time is now right officially to recognise such individuals, who risked everything, including their own lives, to assist others during those dark times. In recent years, the Government have shown support for civilians who have given a commitment during the war years by officially recognising them. The Bevin boys, the land army girls and lumber Jills are perfect examples of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/18">At the end of last week, it was reported that Prince Charles was proud of the role that his grandmother, Princess Alice of Greece, played during the second world war, when she hid Jews in the Royal palace in Athens. The indications are that Prince Charles will appear in the film, &quot;The Rescuers: Heroes of the Holocaust&quot;, which tells the stories of 12 individuals who helped to save the lives of tens of thousands of Jews. Individual recognition is needed for the British heroes of the holocaust.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/19">I want to make a further request to my right hon. Friend the Minister&mdash;I assure him that I do not have a shopping list. In this place, in the vicinity of the Admission Order Office, there is a plaque on which it is inscribed:</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/20" class="indent">&quot;In deep gratitude to the people and Parliament of the United Kingdom for saving the lives of 10,000 Jewish and other children who fled to this country from Nazi persecution on the Kindertransport. 1938-1939.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/21">In my contribution&mdash;I am drawing to a close now&mdash;I said that Jane Haining is remembered locally with a small memorial in her home village and a stained glass window in a church in Glasgow. Other British heroes of the holocaust have been recognised in different ways within their communities. A collective contribution of such brave individuals merits a memorial. I recognise that it is not the Government's role to provide memorials&mdash;even if it were, the job would not fall to the Cabinet Office and my right hon. Friend the Minister. I say to him that this matter of recognition of the British heroes of the holocaust will only be completed when our nation has a memorial. I plead with him to consider further co-operation and assistance with the Holocaust Educational Trust and others to ensure that in some shape and form and in some location a memorial is erected? I thank the Minister in advance for what I hope will be some good news for us today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29b.290.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" speakername="Jeremy Wright" colnum="290"  time="014:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0006.htm#09042944000491">
	<p pid="b.290.0/1">It is a great privilege to speak in this debate, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase> on securing it. I was equally privileged to co-sponsor early-day motion 1175, out of which this debate has come. I agree with much of what he has said, as I am sure all hon. Members present do.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/2">We are here to talk about a number of extraordinary individuals and the effect that they have had on all of us today, and will have in future. We are right to look at those individuals in some detail. We have heard already about the hon. Gentleman's constituent. I want to say a word or two about the constituent through whom I have come to this issue. I am grateful in this, as in many other things, to the Holocaust Educational Trust, which has done a great deal to draw attention to these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/3">The trust drew my attention to June Ravenhall. The hon. Gentleman mentioned her and she also appears in the early-day motion. She originally came from Kenilworth and settled in Rugby, thereby neatly encapsulating both parts of my constituency. Her son, Ron, is a councillor in Rugby&mdash;not, I fear to say, for the right party, but one cannot have everything.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/4">Ron has been enthusiastic and dedicated in drawing out the memories of his mother. He talks about her, as well he should, with considerable pride. June Ravenhall was a British woman who moved to Holland during the war and sheltered the young Jew, Louis Velleman, who was sought by the Gestapo. Moreover, he had tuberculosis, putting not only June but her three young children at considerable risk. June continued to shelter him even though she knew that any discovery, or knock on the door, would lead both to her death and considerable peril for her young children. She did all that alone because her husband was in a Nazi concentration camp. We can all agree that sustained and remarkable courage of that nature deserves recognition. I share the hope of the hon. Gentleman that that recognition will begin today with whatever the Minister is able to say that the Government can do.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/5">Interestingly, when Ron Ravenhall wrote a book, which was partly about June's life, he described how Louis Velleman explained how he felt about what June Ravenhall had done for him. I shall quote from the book:</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Louis Velleman, the young Jew she saved, was asked by a Press reporter, some 44 years after the event, how brave he thought June was. Although a famous journalist himself, fluent in at least two languages, Louis could find no word to describe the extent of her sustained bravery. 'The English are not brave, - they are mad.', was his eventual reply.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/7">That may not have been exactly the right word to describe what June Ravenhall did, but we would all be mad were we not to take the opportunity presented to us by the lives and acts of such remarkable people to draw what lessons we can.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/8">The hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway referred to the lessons. Those people were ordinary people doing extraordinary things. I have little doubt that if any of them knew about this debate, they would be amazed and deeply humbled. In my view, that makes them more deserving of any honours we can give them. The lessons we can draw are clear: people may have an ordinary background and they may have unlikely qualifications for heroism, but it lies in the most unlikely places. There were many heroes in that period of our history, but not all wore a uniform. Those people did not wear a uniform and they demonstrated remarkable heroism. They tell us that it is possible, in the face of unimaginable evil, such as we saw in Europe in the 1940s, for relatively ordinary, unexpected heroes to arise and to do remarkable things.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/9">As hon. Members have said, it is right that we recognise that the threat has not gone away. Nazism and anti-Semitism are not dead, nor is hatred of the kind we have been talking about. Sometimes it sleeps, but we must always be prepared for it to reawaken, even within our own communities. June Ravenhall and others who have been mentioned show us that, even if people do not feel that they are cut out for heroism, they can show by their actions that they can stand up against almost impossible threats and demonstrate what individuals can do. That is a lesson that we could learn well in today's society.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/10">We can say, &quot;We can do it too&quot; only if we know of the existence of those people and what they did. It is striking how little is known about them. Perhaps all hon. Members are struck by how little they knew about such people before they were drawn to their attention. It is important that our fellow countrymen and countrywomen know about them and what they did, so that they can believe that even in the face of overwhelming evil, they can play a part and stand up against it. That is why I am proud to support the suggestion of the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway. I am hopeful that the Minister will be able to tell us that it will be taken up, for the benefit of people today and people in future years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29b.298.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" speakername="Jeremy Browne" colnum="298"  time="015:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0007.htm#09042944000495">
	<p pid="b.298.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to make the first of the three concluding speeches to this important debate. Normally when I speak from this position in the Chamber, I am contributing to a discussion on the Budget or the economy. Those are necessarily partisan debates, and rightly so, because it is important that Parliament scrutinises those essential contemporary matters. However&mdash;this point has been made by other hon. Members&mdash;it is also extremely valuable to have opportunities to come together and celebrate achievements of our fellow countrymen and women through the years, and to talk about what binds us together and our common interests. This debate has been distinguished in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/2">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase> for securing the debate and for his excellent opening speech&mdash;to be honest, all the speeches have been of an extremely high standard. It has been informative and moving to hear many of the contributions&mdash;especially, as I suspect others agree, that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase>. However, it was also a great privilege to follow the former Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1996" name="Des Browne">the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne)</phrase>, and hear his perspective.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/3">All war is terrible and leads to lasting consequences, and all war gives people opportunities to do exceptional and heroic deeds. However, the holocaust is a unique&mdash;in the proper sense of that word&mdash;act in the history of mankind. As the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun has reminded us, atrocities are committed across the world every day, but the scale of the holocaust, and the degree to which it was regimented and organised, make it unique. Most people probably accept that the second world war was the biggest distinguishing event in the history of our country&mdash;a moment when we reached a fork in the road and the future of our nation depended on the outcome. We are talking about a unique and central feature of what I argue was the most important act in the history of our country and continent, the second world war. There could not be a matter more worthy of our consideration, or people more worthy of our admiration, than those who are the subject of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/4">I pay tribute, as others have done, to the Holocaust Educational Trust for its tireless work in raising such matters and for making sure that Members of Parliament give them the consideration they surely deserve, as well as for, as its name suggests, educating Members of Parliament and the public in general about the holocaust, the scale of the tragedy and its lasting consequences. I, too, was given an opportunity by the group to visit Auschwitz, as the Prime Minister, I am pleased to say, did yesterday, and like other hon. Members I went with a group of teenagers from my constituency. It was something that I had always wanted to do, and it was an extremely moving and memorable day&mdash;I found it so, and the young people I went with had the same thoughts.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/5">I hope that hon. Members will briefly indulge me as I recall a few features of that day. One thing that struck me as particularly strange&mdash;even eerie&mdash;was that it was a lovely summer day when we visited Auschwitz. The photographs that one sees of it always show bleak midwinter in Poland. To visit a place where the air is heavy with history and to feel that sense of foreboding, but with the leaves rustling in the wind, the sun shining and the birds singing in the trees, is almost more discomfiting, I imagine, than going there in weather conditions that make it more obviously bleak. The contrast between the sense of freedom and gaiety of such weather and the deeds that took place in the camp made the experience all the more poignant and troubling.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/6">I particularly remember two features. One is the railway track. It is a famous image and we are all familiar with it, but to see it with one's own eyes is memorable. Different people may have different memories, but the other one that particularly stands out in my mind is the huge bank of shoes behind a glass screen. There is something extremely human about shoes&mdash;I do not know why that is more the case than with other items of clothing. The fact that each shoe or pair of shoes represented an individual with their own story, life, circumstances and family somehow brought things to life for me more than statistics would, even though the statistics are obviously revealing and deeply upsetting.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/7">For all those reasons I am enthusiastic&mdash;I know that hon. Members in all parties share that enthusiasm&mdash;for some recognition of the bravery that was so evident from our fellow countrymen and women in those uniquely awful circumstances. Everyone has a proprietorial interest in Major Frank Foley, so perhaps as he was born in Somerset, and as I represent a Somerset constituency, I should touch on his achievements. It is worth noting that the only remaining survivor of first world war trench warfare was also born in Somerset, and lives there. Perhaps we are unfairly rewarded with people who, to make a serious point, did not necessarily hold a status or rank that suggested that they would be at the front of the queue for honours, but who have come to symbolise particularly distinguished service to their country. Their ordinariness is, in a way, what makes them particularly notable people. That is probably true of Mr. Harry Patch, who lives in Somerset and who at 110 years old is one of a handful still surviving who served in the first world war&mdash;I understand that he is the only one of them who fought in the trenches. That is true of Major Foley as well; his story has already been recounted by other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/8">I understand that the Government are minded to bring about some recognition, and I admire them for their activism and imagination. The financial cost to us of recognising the contributions of the individuals in question is extremely modest, yet to do so is valuable, partly because it is greatly appreciated by the relatives and surviving associates of the individuals, although they are fairly few. More importantly, perhaps, is the symbolic value. There is, as hon. Members have said, no danger in such recognition; even 64 years since the end of the second world war, there is no downside to reminding us&mdash;adults and perhaps even more importantly children who, as they grow up, are further and further removed from the conflict&mdash;about two things.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/9">The first reminder is of the capacity of mankind to be evil and the requirement on us all to be vigilant and to try to guard against that evil manifesting itself in appalling ways. That point has also been made with regard to contemporary politics, but it is obviously most relevant with regard to that historical event.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/10">The second, symbolic reminder is the ability, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" name="Jeremy Wright">the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright)</phrase> put it, of ordinary people to do extraordinary things, possibly beyond what they regarded themselves as being capable of doing until they were confronted by that challenge, such that they rose to heights that they may not necessarily have ever expected to rise to. So the holocaust is a reminder to us of mankind's ability for greatness, as well as mankind's ability for evil, as I have previously said. Furthermore, these stories are an inspiring example, because they tell everybody that there is capacity within us all to be exceptional, to make history and to do good. It is valuable that we remind ourselves of our ability not only to live on a day-to-day basis and to progress through life, but to leave a mark that can inspire others, because of the sacrifice and risks that we took for a higher purpose than simply our own personal well-being.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/11">For those reasons, a memorial, individual recognition or a combination of the two would be extremely welcome. So, I am delighted&mdash;I speak, as every other hon. Member contributing to this debate will speak, in an entirely non-partisan and non-party political way&mdash;that we have a senior Cabinet Minister here and that the Government themselves have seen the merit and wisdom in making progress. I greatly look forward to hearing further details from the Minister and also to hearing the contribution from the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase>, to what has been an extremely high-quality, rewarding and enlightening debate, both to participate in and to listen to.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29b.301.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" speakername="Nick Hurd" colnum="301"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0007.htm#09042944000496">
	<p pid="b.301.0/1">I start by not only congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase> but thanking him. That is because before this debate I did not know anything about the British heroes of the holocaust and I am embarrassed by that fact. If the Hebrew saying that was quoted by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> is right and he who saves one life, saves the world entire, where does that place Frank Foley, who is reported to have saved 10,000 lives?</p>
	<p pid="b.301.0/2">These are extraordinary stories about really extraordinary people; these people are, if you like, giants of our time. I rather share the sentiment that was expressed by my hon. Friend: as I sit back after reading these stories, I feel very proud to be British. Therefore, I would like to thank the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway, quite genuinely, for his contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.301.0/3">I also congratulate the Holocaust Educational Trust. It does amazing work in my constituency each year, working with the two synagogues in Northwood and with local schools to bring together local children, often as many as 2,500 on a single day, to do something very important. That is not just about throwing a steady light on one of the darkest chapters in our history, although it has never been more important to keep doing that as the survivors of those events get older and die out. In addition, what always impresses me about that day is the ability of the Holocaust Educational Trust to connect that history with the world around those young people today. I find that enormously impressive. The trust also commu nicates a sense of opportunity for everyone&mdash;each individual&mdash;to make a difference. I do not think that there has ever been a more important time to inspire people with that thought, as we worry about civic engagement and the degree to which people are prepared to get involved these days. So I genuinely support the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust in that field.</p>
	<p pid="b.301.0/4">That inspiring message&mdash;the opportunity to make a difference&mdash;underpins the importance of the stories that we have heard today, which are genuinely inspirational. Each contributor to the debate today has spoken powerfully about things that have touched them individually. Again, I rather share the sentiment expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East. The story that I liked most was about the group of 10 prisoners of war, Tommy Noble and his mates, who spent 10 weeks supporting that young girl. That is because acts of individual heroism are enormously impressive, but when there is a group of people prepared to take the same unflinching and enormous risk for that length of time, that is enormously impressive, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.301.0/5">I am probably not the only Member who, while reading these stories, was asking himself or herself, &quot;How would I have reacted in this situation?&quot; The answer is that we do not know, because very few of us have been tested to that limit.</p>
	<p pid="b.301.0/6">Therefore, this has been a journey that leads me to feel strongly that it has been wrong to leave recognition of British heroes of the holocaust until now to the Israeli authorities, including the Israeli Holocaust Memorial Authority, and that it is right now to recognise them through a national memorial of some form. I am delighted to place on record my party's support for the principle of a memorial.</p>
	<p pid="b.301.0/7">Obviously, the nature of such a memorial needs to be thought through carefully. I think that most Members, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1996" name="Des Browne">the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne)</phrase>, the former Secretary of State for Defence, will know that there are sensitivities in relation to using the existing traditional honours system to honour the dead, or to using the existing system of military awards to recognise acts of courage that took place so long ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.301.0/8">Therefore, a memorial is something that needs to be thought through carefully, I hope on a cross-party basis. However, if the Government are thinking of some form of individual award that sits outside the traditional award system, that is clearly an attractive idea as far as we are concerned and it would be of enormous value to the families of the individuals involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.301.0/9">I want to close by expressing a personal view. It is not the view of my party; in fact, I do not know whether it is the view of my party, but I am inspired to place it on record as a personal view. I would be disappointed if such an initiative, such an individual award, were introduced and that was the end of it, however valuable that initiative was to the families concerned. That is because I would hope that we could be inspired to do more.</p>
	<p pid="b.301.0/10">I am attracted to the idea of considering what the Government can do to facilitate a more physical memorial for all heroes, something that is tangible, that people can walk or drive past and that will trigger something in them, reminding them of what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" name="Jeremy Wright">the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright)</phrase> put very well, which is the power of ordinary people to rise up and do remarkable things whatever the scale of the threat facing them.</p>
	<p pid="b.301.0/11">I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. He knows that my party supports the principle of a memorial and we would very much like to be involved in working out the detail. I just urge him not to be short of ambition.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29b.302.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" speakername="Liam Byrne" speakeroffice="The Minister for the Cabinet Office"  colnum="302"  time="015:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0008.htm#09042944000497">
	<p pid="b.302.0/1">I want to start by congratulating all right hon. and hon. Members here this afternoon on what has been an extraordinary debate, which has represented what is best about this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/2">Before I reply to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase>, Mr. Benton, I hope that you will permit me to say a word or two in his praise. Not only has he shown leadership on this subject, but he has shown leadership in a way that has brought it to national attention, including the attention of Ministers, the Government and this House. My hon. Friend has long taken a personal interest in this subject, and we have corresponded on the matter&mdash;sometimes not to his satisfaction&mdash;during the past weeks and months. He is the co-author of early-day motion 1175, and he has also worked enormously effectively with his local media. Better still, he has helped other hon. Members to work with their local media, so that some of these stories come to the attention of a much wider audience. I hope that he will persist with such work.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/3">I pay my own tribute to the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust. The extraordinary work and research that it has done have represented the treasured and sometimes difficult memories of the families involved with enormous dignity. The trust has represented, articulated and celebrated those memories with great effectiveness, and by alighting on the inspirational idea of heroes of the Holocaust, it has done an incredible job of telling people in modern Britain about the relevance of remembering such terrible experiences. The staff and trustees of the trust should be very proud of what they have achieved in Parliament this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/4">What more can I add to what has been said about the holocaust in the debate? Not very much. The population of Jews in pre-war Europe was 9 million and, during the war, 6 million were systematically murdered, along with many others. The Chief Rabbi once said that the deeper one looks into the holocaust, the more one runs the risk of entering a black hole of despair. Yet the holocaust still has much to teach us today in Britain about not just the depths of depravity to which man can sink, but the way in which society, politics, Governments and civil society can miss the warning signs of prejudice and racism. Unfortunately, those lessons are still enormously relevant to Britain today.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/5">Yet when I think about my education, I simply do not believe that the holocaust was a focus and feature of it in the way that it could have been. I remember learning and reading about the holocaust in my brief history lessons, but it was not until I took myself off with a rucksack to the middle east at the age of 19 that my education about the holocaust really began. Like many hon. Members, I can still see the images of what I saw at Yad Vashem in my mind this afternoon, and I can still vividly&mdash;all too vividly&mdash;remember how I felt walking through that avenue, which celebrates the extraordinary courage of many people who did so much to help to rescue Jews during the holocaust.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/6">That is why, during the past 10 or 11 years, it is right that the Government&mdash;and we as a country&mdash;have done more to remember the holocaust and to bring its relevance into the modern currency of politics and civil society. Hon. Members have mentioned that yesterday the Prime Minister was at Auschwitz where he said that the UK will permanently support the maintenance and retention of the memorial there. This year, the Government have granted more than &pound;750,000 to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, which organises a national Holocaust memorial day. The Government have made more than &pound;1.5 million available to the Holocaust Educational Trust to support its work in raising awareness among younger people of the true horrors of the holocaust. One of the most powerful features of this debate is the personal experiences of right hon. and hon. Members, who not only visited Auschwitz, but had the experience of sharing that education with younger constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/7">Why should we go a stage further and honour heroes of the holocaust? The case for that has not been put better than by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> and my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway. Although the holocaust teaches us about the depths to which man can sink, it also contains some of the best stories of the human spirit. In the midst of such a great crime, a small number of very brave people chose not to stand by, but to act, despite the fact that the consequence for sheltering, aiding or helping Jews to escape was severe.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/8">We have heard the extraordinary story of Jane Haining, who was a missionary working in an orphanage in Hungary and who refused to leave the little Jewish children who were in her care. As a result, she was sent to Auschwitz, where she died. We have also heard about the example of June Ravenhall, who was an English woman living in the Netherlands. She hid a Jewish child for, I think, between two and a half and three years. In much of occupied Europe at that time, there was a short supply of food, fuel, and medicines, and the very act of taking somebody in and sheltering them was difficult not just because of the persecution taking place, but because of having to share scarce resources. June Ravenhall took additional risks because I understand that the Jewish child that she sheltered had tuberculosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/9">We could also dwell on the other extraordinary stories that we have heard about from right hon. and hon. Members: for example, the stories of Frank Foley, Albert Bedane, Randolph Churchill, Ida and Louise Cook, Charles Coward, Sofka Skipworth and, of course, Princess Alice of Greece. One of the most extraordinary things about those who survived is that they often returned home to lives and communities from which they received no reward or recognition. Even though their stories are today such an extraordinary source of inspiration to us, many of those people did not consider that they had actually done anything out of the ordinary. Surely, such people should be considered one of the proudest aspects of Britain's war effort during the second world war, and that is why we should be honouring them today.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/10">Another reason for doing so, which was alluded to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase>, is that honouring those people will help us to teach the lessons of the holocaust when, during the next 20 years, it goes from living history to just history. We need to find ways of helping teachers to communicate the sheer power of what those extraordinary people did. Talking about what they did will help teachers to communicate the wider argument and message that we can still distil and learn from the holocaust.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/11">Let me turn directly to the subject of the early-day motion and the debate that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway has initiated this afternoon. We have been following this subject with great attention. The Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and I believe that it is right to recognise the contribution of holocaust heroes. We have had discussions across Government to examine a number of options, and we have concluded that there is a way forward, although I do not think that the precise way that my hon. Friend suggests in his early-day motion is right.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/12">Let me add two points of clarification to explain why. First, if we take the basic principle that an Order of Knighthood relates to a society of people with the sovereign at its head that is bound together by statutes that define people's rights and obligations as well as their relationship to the outside world, we can begin to see how my hon. Friend's suggestion is not precisely the way in which appropriate recognition should be delivered. A dead person can take no place as a member of such a society of the living, and membership of one of the Orders of Chivalry ceases on the death of the appointee. That policy and the associated procedures have been subject to scrutiny several times since what I have outlined was articulated in 1922.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/13">Secondly, it might be helpful if I correct a misapprehension that sometimes creeps into debates on the subject, although I am glad to say that we have not heard it this afternoon. Sometimes the idea of honours and gallantry awards are conflated, but it is important to remember that, as the name implies, gallantry awards recognise individuals who have consciously put their lives at risk for the benefit of others, and that, under current procedures, awards are made within just five years of the event concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/14">Therefore, we need to find a different way to honour the people we have heard so much about this afternoon. I am pleased to announce that the Government agree that it is entirely appropriate that we should have a national recognition of the holocaust heroes. The Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and I can announce that the Government will create an award of recognition for the extraordinary acts of courage shown by a number of British citizens during the second world war in helping many Jews and other persecuted groups to escape from the evils of the holocaust.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/15">I want to discuss the precise dimensions of that award further in meetings with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and other interested parties. I hope to meet the families of the heroes we have discussed, debated and heard so much about this afternoon. I hope that we can proceed in a cross-party way, so I would be grateful for the advice and counsel of Opposition Members and greatly privileged if my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway joined us in those discussions. We have some ideas about what would constitute a fitting award, but we want to hear the views of the families before developing proposals any further. I hope to have the first of those meetings in the next couple of weeks. I hope that all Members will agree that that will mark a clear recognition of those individuals' bravery, courage and self-sacrifice, and celebrate the outstanding contributions that they made for humanity and the finest traditions of this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.0/16">In conclusion, I believe that this has been an extraordinary and, in a way, unique debate. I have not been in this House for long, but in the four and a half years since becoming a Member I have not had the privilege of being involved or associated with so powerful a debate. We have taken a vital step forward in honouring the gifts, guts and sheer goodness of those men and women from whom we draw so much inspiration today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29b.310.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="310"  time="016:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0009.htm#09042944000501">
	<p pid="b.310.0/1">It is a great pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Benton, presiding over us. I always enjoy debates when you are in the Chair. I remember, with affection, the Housing and Regeneration Bill a year or two ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> on securing this important debate on planning policy for tall buildings. The thing that strikes me not only in this debate, but elsewhere, is what a fantastic and assiduous campaigner he is on behalf of his constituents. He has reaped awards during his time in the House and, frankly, his constituents are lucky to have him.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/3">I want to address the concerns raised by my hon. Friend and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> on the framework for decision making about tall buildings, specifically with regard to local planning authorities in London. As the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster has said, Hartlepool is somewhat low rise in its buildings although, I hasten to add, not low rise in its ambitions. I wish to point out what guidance is available to help planners throughout the country. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea drew attention to several planning proposals for tall buildings in his constituency and elsewhere. I know that he understands the position, because he alluded in his contribution to the fact that the Secretary of State's formal role in the planning process means that I cannot possibly comment on specific proposals. However, I hope that my general remarks will be useful.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/4">There is a no legal definition of a tall building. That is not as stupid as it sounds, because a 10-storey building in a mainly two-storey neighbourhood, for example, would clearly be thought of as tall, but in the centre of a large city it may not be. Consideration of tall buildings needs to be made with reference to their location, but I take my hon. Friend's point that many recent proposals have been for very large structures, visible from neighbouring boroughs.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/5">I assure my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman that the Government are very much aware of the risk that poorly sited towers can bring. Existing streets, public spaces and buildings provide an historical and cultural context, nurturing local pride, that important sense of place and, above all, a human scale&mdash;the phrase I think that my hon. Friend used&mdash;as the backdrop to our lives. Townscape can also help people feel a sense of ownership&mdash;of somehow being at home in the places where they live, shop and work. That does not necessarily mean that we should not allow our cities to grow. We must acknowledge that economic prosperity is important. Cities can change, evolve and develop through new development, and, in the right place, that may include tall buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/6">Let me set out the planning framework within which an application for a tall building must be considered. First, at a strategic level, policy on tall buildings, as my hon. Friend has said, is the responsibility of the Mayor of London. The London plan identifies broad locations where tall buildings may be suitable, and it also includes policies on intensity of site use. Policy 3A.3 in the London plan, on &quot;Maximising the potential of sites&quot;, states:</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The Mayor will, and boroughs should, ensure that development proposals&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/8">for each site</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/9" class="indent">&quot;achieve the maximum intensity of use compatible with local context, the design principles in Policy 4B.1 and with public transport capacity. Boroughs should develop residential density policies in their&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/10">development plan documents &quot;in line with&quot; the policy in the London plan and should</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/11" class="indent">&quot;adopt the residential density ranges set out in&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/12">what is known as a density matrix table, which is also included in the London plan. The policy adds, quite firmly&mdash;my hon. Friend has alluded to this&mdash;that the Mayor has the power to</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/13" class="indent">&quot;refuse permission for strategic referrals that, taking into account context and potential transport capacity, under-use the potential of the site.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/14">I now turn to the role of the local planning authority, which is very much in the driving seat in terms of the vision of and ambition for what an area will look like. Boroughs prepare site-specific policies in their development plan documents. It is not expected that rigid height limits for specific locations should be included in local development frameworks. Instead, core strategies should contain broader policy that sets guidance for development in an area. The London plan includes criteria and a set of considerations to help boroughs identify suitable sites for tall buildings and to assess the design and impact of such buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/15">There is no requirement for local policies slavishly to repeat regional ones, such as those in the local plan. Local distinctiveness and variation are to be prized and utilised. However, the borough's development plan must generally conform with the regional plan. Within the framework of criteria in the London plan, each local planning authority can define what a tall building is in that particular local context. For example, it may define suitable heights in relation to surrounding buildings and acceptable impacts on the skyline. However, I do not think that it would be appropriate to take a blanket approach across the whole borough and to seek to impose height restrictions that cannot be justified. Rather, it is right that a borough must set out, as part of its spatial strategy, appropriate locations for tall buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/16">To achieve that, the local planning authority must prepare a core strategy, which might incorporate a working definition of a tall building and indicate which locations could be appropriate in that particular area or what other factors would need to be taken into account, such as access to public transport. There may also be a requirement in terms of the benefits that a tall building should offer, whether regeneration, affordable housing&mdash;a matter of some concern and passion to my hon. Friend&mdash;or some other public good that could be solved by sound design, planning conditions or a section 106 agreement with the developer. If desired, detailed criteria for assessing the design and impact of tall buildings can be incorporated in a local authority's development management document.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/17">Within that broad strategic confine, on every single individual planning application, the views of local people must be invited and given serious consideration. Every site is unique and the planning system requires each case to be assessed on its own merits and on how the particular application is consistent with the borough's core strategy and local development framework. Decision makers may wish to consider whether, in the circumstances of a particular application, it would be reasonable to require planning benefits from a development being proposed.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/18">I have mentioned section 106. Perhaps a section 106 agreement with the developer, or conditions imposed on the permission, could require investment in public transport in the vicinity, or a stipulated proportion of affordable housing to be included in a residential development. Of course, the local planning authority has the power to refuse an application that does not come up to such expectations, provided that its views are robust and backed by evidence, as set out in its core strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/19">I have mentioned the local planning authority, which is in the driving seat when it comes to determining what an area should look like. I have also mentioned local government and the Mayor of London. Let me now turn to the central Government's role. I want to mention two specific areas where I think that the Government can be involved, namely call-in and providing advice and guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/20">In certain circumstances, the Secretary of State has the power to call in individual planning applications for tall buildings&mdash;for her own decision to be made after a public local inquiry. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea has already mentioned called-in decisions made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and he knows&mdash;I reiterate&mdash;that I cannot possibly comment on those. But earlier this month, my Department issued a new circular that sets out the circumstances in which the Secretary of State should be consulted on whether to call in a planning application. It includes new criteria in respect of development that threatens a world heritage site.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/21">Let me turn to the second point, which is guidance. I draw the attention of hon. Members present to several items of guidance that planners should pay heed to when they receive an application to build tall. The first is planning policy statement 1, on delivering sustainable development. The guidance is very firm that any proposal to construct a tall building should be evaluated in the light of the general design and planning principles set out in PPS1. Paragraph 34 of the statement makes it very clear that</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/22" class="indent">&quot;Design which is inappropriate in its context, or which fails to take the opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area and the way it functions, should not be accepted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/23">That key test applies to all development proposals, including tall buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/24">The second item is &quot;Guidance on tall buildings&quot;. The Government strongly endorse the messages in the revised guidance, which the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment and English Heritage issued together in 2007, called &quot;Guidance on tall buildings&quot;. The guidance should be given serious and careful attention by all those designing tall buildings and considering their location. It is a vital complement to national planning guidance, and is likely to be an important&mdash;I stress the word important&mdash;material consideration for local planning authorities or planning inspectors in cases that involve tall buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.310.0/25">My hon. Friend may wish to note that the Secretary of State has always referred to that guidance in determining recent called-in proposals for tall buildings.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-04-29b.315.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" speakername="Andrew Pelling" colnum="315"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090429/halltext/90429h0009.htm#09042944000507">
	<p pid="b.315.1/1">Mr. Benton, this is my first time that I have served under your chairmanship, and a great pleasure it is, too. I thank the Speaker for selecting this subject for debate and the Minister, who has a busy diary, for spending time to come to answer to this Adjournment debate. I intend to draw attention to the need for a fairer share of London's policing resources to be allocated to the London borough command, ahead of the upcoming discussion on the resource allocation formula.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/2">It is of the gravest concern to me, and has been for quite a while, that young men have been killed through knife crime on our streets in Croydon. It is incumbent on me to speak up on that issue. I appreciate that these issues are devolved matters and that there is a great responsibility on the Greater London authority, the Mayor of London, the Metropolitan Police Authority, its finance committee and the chair of that committee, Councillor O'Connell, to secure the appropriate resources in respect of the resource allocation formula, which can be difficult.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/3">When I was a London assembly member, a great deal of progress was made via thorough consultation on the operation of the resource allocation formula, and it looked as though there would be an appropriate allocation. However, following the introduction of significant discretion for the commissioner, it is fair to say that the resource allocation formula could not come into effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/4">In a way, I am appealing to the Minister for advice as to how best Croydon's politicians can go about their business in terms of lobbying effectively on resource allocation. Perhaps politicians in the city of Westminster and the London borough of Wandsworth are more effective in terms of lobbying for resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/5">There is certainly no discrimination of any kind against Croydon&mdash;not in any organised way. However, we see a trend in terms of the funding provided for the council through Government grants. A London government quite reasonably puts an emphasis on resourcing for east London in the context of the Olympics and social deprivation issues. It quite reasonably puts an emphasis on the requirements of central London through the discretionary business rate that will resource Crossrail. In Croydon, our hospital is going through a proposed downgrading, with the acute stroke provision being transferred elsewhere, so it is important for us to be able to lobby effectively for resources in Croydon.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/6">It is important to recognise that, since 1997, and particularly since the introduction of the GLA, there has been a significant investment of resources in policing in London, with a transformation in the number of police officers in the Metropolitan Police Service and on our streets&mdash;I am thinking of the organisation of policing and the operation of police community support officers. In Croydon, we are fortunate to operate under an acting borough commander, Adrian Roberts, who is committed to Croydon as part of his job. He operates in such a way as to make the best use of resources. We also benefit from the fact that the borough commander works well with Croydon council and the three safer transport scheme teams that are now in place. Croydon is one of the first boroughs to roll out diamond districts.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/7">However, there are real difficulties in Croydon. Sometimes, it is important for me as a representative of Croydon to emphasise how much it has changed. I illustrate that change by mentioning the fact that we used to have two very safe Conservative seats in the north of the borough, where Jack Weatherill and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1933" name="Humfrey Malins">the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins)</phrase> were Members. We now have a situation where <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" name="Malcolm Wicks">the right hon. Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase> sits in the safest Labour seat in London. Although I am sure that a great deal of that is down to the excellence of the Member of Parliament for Croydon, North, it is also down, to a certain extent, to demographic change.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/8">There is dynamic demographic change in Croydon and there are real issues as to whether the formulae, with regard both to policing and to Croydon council's financing, take full account of our actual population. Doctors' registrations suggest that our population is 40,000 higher than that recognised within normal granting of moneys to Croydon. Therefore, real stress falls on public services and policing is no exception.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/9">There are also issues to do with the challenge that the police service faces in policing our borough. Peter Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said of Fairfield, the ward which contains Croydon town centre:</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/10" class="indent">&quot;If you look at the information, Fairfield sounds to me that it's not the sort of ward where officers should go out on their own. If I were a local police superintendent I would say that officers should go out in pairs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/11">He added:</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/12" class="indent">&quot;It's the bloke out there on his own going through a rough part of town that is most vulnerable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/13">Croydon, most definitely, has significant challenges. During this Parliament, there have been 10 knife killings in Croydon. I have certainly found it very sad to visit mothers of sons who have died. There was a great deal of publicity about the very sad case of Mr. Abbey, who was knifed to death at a bus stop on the way to Mayday university hospital to see his newborn child for the first time. There was also the very sad case of the son of a Kurdish family, who was murdered over a chocolate wrapper being thrown into a car. Those are all very sad and tragic cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/14">That there is a challenge for Croydon policing can be seen in the fact that, although crime is falling as a whole in the Metropolitan police area, in Croydon, crime has gone up. Overall, there were 18,000 fewer offences in London between 2007 and 2008. However, in Croydon there was a 7.4 per cent. increase in crimes committed, going up from 30,537 to 32,805. Burglary in particular in the last six months has had a sharp upturn, with more than 300 reported offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/15">Only in the last week, I have received correspondence from constituents. As an example of the types of stresses and strains that the police service has to deal with, one Croydon resident wrote to me saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/16" class="indent">&quot;I was attacked by 30 kids in a gang called the DSN on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-04">Saturday 4 April</phrase>.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/17">This was in Wandle park in Croydon, in broad daylight.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/18" class="indent">&quot;I was beaten severely and cut with knives across my arms and back and I have just had the stitches out of my head. Just because I refused to let them ride my bike...Today I thought I would be brave enough to go back there. Only to see a 14 year old getting held up and robbed for his phone by two teenagers again yielding knives.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/19">That is a park that the Greater London authority intends to spend &pound;400,000 upgrading. One of the difficulties&mdash;it is not just about policing by the Metropolitan Police Service; it is also about proper care and attention by Croydon council&mdash;is that over the years we have had far fewer park wardens. In fact, we only have 19 park wardens to police the 124 open spaces that we have. I am grateful to Aline Nassif of the <i>Croydon Advertise</i><i>r </i>for<i></i>revealing that through a freedom of information request with the <i>Croydon Advertiser</i> last week.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/20">I also have correspondence from a constituent, Joanne Bradley, who expressed concern about the amount of time it took for the police service to attend her home after a burglary took place. It essentially took 24 hours. Jenny Winstanley says:</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/21" class="indent">&quot;Without fail every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night after the bars and clubs kick out there is constant shouting, screaming, last night there were three separate fights and then the inevitable making up afterwards!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/22">This happens in the centre of Croydon. She says that, when she has visitors to stay,</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/23" class="indent">&quot;Once they have run the gauntlet of the...drug addicts&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/24">sleeping in the streets near East Croydon station, it is difficult for them to get any sleep when there is so much antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/25">Obviously, these issues are not as important as the killings that have taken place. It is encouraging that, when extra police resources are provided, real progress is made. I am grateful for the way in which resources have been found corporately for Croydon borough command over the past few months in Operation Safe for All. That operation has had a real effect on the amount of crime, with 101 fewer victims of knife crime, 15 fewer victims of youth violence, 28 fewer victims of gun crime and 271 fewer victims of robbery. That is an impressive story of the effectiveness and impact of the police service. However, we have problems in the town that are having a real effect on the economic performance of Croydon.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/26">It is notable that many retailers report to me that the problems have a significant effect on their business. A major retailer tells me that people in the A and B classes&mdash;people with money&mdash;are reluctant to shop at our main department stores. I have heard a report that, after incidents in the centre of Croydon, typically occurring around 3.30 pm or 4 pm, when regular fights between teenagers take place, there is a significant downturn in business. Mr. Ford, who runs a shoe business, says:</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/27" class="indent">&quot;Up until the fight on&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/28">a particular day, he had</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/29" class="indent">&quot;had a really good day&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/30">and had</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/31" class="indent">&quot;probably sold about six or seven pairs of shoes every hour&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/32">but, he says,</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/33" class="indent">&quot;After 3.30pm we sold just one pair.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/34">That is a reflection of how the town has lost many of its shoppers because of the stresses and strains.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/35">We need to see in Croydon not only many more police officers, but many more uniformed people in the town centre. It is not good enough just to have CCTV cameras watching over those who come to enjoy the retail experience in Croydon; we must ensure that we have a mixture of police officers. More officers must be provided in the business improvement district to ensure that the whole of our town centre is within eyesight of officers of one sort or another. I am not saying that all those officers should necessarily be in a police-type uniform. The experience of business improvement districts, particularly in the United States, shows that a non-confrontational style of uniform is often positive in policing younger people.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/36">When I talk at schools, or when students come here to look around the Houses of Parliament and I meet them afterwards, I notice that young people sometimes feel unhappy about the nature of policing. Policing has to be consensual&mdash;there has to be support from young people&mdash;but sometimes they feel victimised and sometimes a good combination of police officers and other types of policing would be more appropriate. I therefore hope that there will be an emphasis on the local authority rebalancing its priorities to secure the resources needed for that type of policing. Only then will people have confidence to return to Croydon town centre. If that happens, we will see a return on the investment on extra policing through an improvement in business for our local retailers.</p>
	<p pid="b.315.1/37">Most important, I earnestly want to emphasise the importance of Croydon securing its fair share of resources. I will be interested to hear the Minister's advice on the best way to lobby for that change.</p>

	<p pid="b.318.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" name="Andrew Pelling">the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling)</phrase> not only on securing the debate, but on the measured way in which he stated his case. I am happy to join him in recognising the excellent work the police do to tackle crime and protect our communities, including his own, often in challenging and difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/2">It is only right that local decisions on police deployment are made locally by the commissioner and the borough commander. The Metropolitan police are relatively well resourced, with 31,109 officers in September 2008, which is 4,432 more than in March 1997. That is an increase of 16.6 per cent., which is significantly higher than the overall increase of 11.7 per cent. for England and Wales. The Metropolitan police are also supported by 4,200 police community support officers and 13,697 police staff, who of course play an important role, often releasing police officers for front-line service.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/3">I know that the hon. Gentleman takes a keen interest in policing and, as one would expect, meets regularly with his borough commander. I know that he sought assurances about the commitment to maximise the police presence on the streets of Croydon. He mentioned the beginning of Operation Safe for All last year in Croydon, where there has been sustained investment in resources in the form of corporate assets from across the Metropolitan Police Service. That has made a major contribution to reductions in knife crime, which I will return to shortly, and youth violence. As he knows, Croydon has also benefited from the addition of three safer transport teams to police the transport hubs. The improvement in resources, which he was gracious enough to recognise, is evident, and I understand from the commissioner that, as of <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>, the Croydon operational command unit has 697 officers, which is 147&mdash;28 per cent.&mdash;more than in March 2001. There are also 176 police community support officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/4">After listening to the hon. Gentleman's speech, I was left with the impression that, although he was speaking in a debate in this place, his voice was reaching out to others beyond this Chamber. I understand why he might do that. He is a long-standing advocate for his constituents on policing matters and he has sought our advice on how he can further his campaign. I am sure that he acknowledges to some extent our limitations, particularly in operational matters. He is very good at mobilising his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/5">We are, of course, removing all the top-down targets for the police service after a request from the service and as a result of a more mature attitude between central Government and police force areas. However, we will leave one target in place: the confidence target, by which the police service is measured by local residents after they engage with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/6">On resources and the outcome of applications for them, I am sure that police forces are keen to ensure that the necessary resources are in place and used&mdash;and, more important, used on the priorities that local residents determine. There is a Metropolitan police allocation formula, which is kept under review by the Metropolitan Police Authority and the commissioner, but as the hon. Gentleman will have expected me to say, the actual resource allocation formula applied to Croydon and other London boroughs is a matter for the commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/7">The Metropolitan police allocation formula is not dissimilar to the overall Home Office police funding formula, but it is subject to allocation depending on the circumstances pertaining to each borough in the Metropolitan police area. It is a matter not merely of counting up the number of officers and staff, important though that is, but of assessing how their time is being used. Good deployment means that officers and staff are in the right place at the right time to deliver help when the public most need it. Moreover, it means that they can deliver the less visible parts of policing that are vital for police protection. There is scope for the police service, including the Metropolitan police, critically to review both the mix and the roles of the work force. I am sure that the commissioner continues to review the work force mix, so that it is best configured to provide the highest quality of service.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/8">I will return later to the hon. Gentleman's points about the business community, which is of particular interest to me. First, let me say that in the current economic climate, there should be a relentless focus on value for money, because it is more important than ever to get good value for money from our public services. I am talking now about sustaining efficiency and productivity improvements that have already been delivered, and ensuring that resources are effectively targeted at improving front-line services and delivering the best possible service to the public. That means even greater scrutiny by the Metropolitan Police Authority in assessing performance and ensuring that the commissioner is making the best possible use of his most valuable resource which, at the end of the day, is his work force.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/9">Let me say something about how the police service needs to operate in Croydon and elsewhere. This Government introduced neighbourhood policing teams, of which there are 25 in the borough of Croydon. That is a permanent and very welcome improvement in the way in which policing is delivered locally, not least because it is designed to ensure that the service is citizen-focused. That means being more responsive and more locally accountable than it has been in the past, and that is a key way of ensuring that public confidence in the police improves. The policing pledge, which will be implemented in all forces in England and Wales, including the Metropolitan police, by the end of 2008 signals our commitment to make further progress in that regard. It requires local forces to arrange regular public meetings at least once a month to agree priorities and ensure that they are then addressed. I am talking about how resources are directed and about ensuring that the necessary resources are there.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/10">The hon. Gentleman referred to crime statistics. I do not particularly want to get into a Dutch auction around statistics, but just in case anyone was left with the impression that crime has continued to rise in Croydon and is now rising irretrievably&mdash; particularly against the backdrop of an economic downturn&mdash;I will say that there is no inevitability about rising crime in an economic downturn, partly because of the changes that we have put in place. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is looking at more recent figures. None the less, my figures show that overall, crime in Croydon has continued to fall. In mentioning burglary, he rightly identified one of the indicators about which we are particularly concerned. When we look at recorded crime statistics in Croydon, we see a slight increase in domestic burglary. I say that because sometimes there is a difference between the British crime survey figures and recorded police crime. However, that is the only indicator that shows an increase from 2006-07 to 2007-08 . That is why the Home Secretary recently announced a burglary initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/11">As part of providing real help in hard times, we want to respond to the concerns of retailers, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. I chair meetings with retailers, and we have recently decided to increase the number of such meetings so that we can focus particularly on their priorities. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point about their concerns. One of the important things we have done is started to improve the links between local businesses and their local crime reduction partnerships. In many cases, businesses do not know what crime reduction partnerships do or how to get in contact with them. Although it is very important that the police service regularly communicates with the community and addresses its concerns, it must acknowledge that the business community is an important part of the wider community. Retailers, who might be most concerned about acquisitive crime such as shoplifting and theft, must be at the forefront of their work, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is a priority for us. We hope to say something shortly about what more we can do to help that sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/12">The hon. Gentleman mentioned knife crime, and I want to say something about that before I conclude my remarks. He will know that, for the past year, we have run the tackling knives action programme, Launched in June 2008, the programme involves tough enforcement action together with support for parents and enhanced partnership working with schools and hospitals. The Metropolitan police service is one of the 14 forces now taking part in the second stage of that programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/13">In Croydon, the programme is showing some signs of success&mdash;I hesitate to use that word, but I am going to anyway. I hesitate, because I hate using such a word when young people are still using knives to stab each other, sometimes fatally. Therefore, saying that there has been &quot;success&quot; might give the wrong impression, but I think that progress is being made in Croydon, with a 17 per cent. reduction in the victims of knife crime in 2008-09. That does not mean that we are complacent in any way, shape or form, which is why the Government have recently announced that the programme will continue for a further year, with an extra &pound;5 million to tackle knife crime and increase targeted police action aimed at the minority of young people who commit serious violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/14">Croydon has seen a significant investment in policing over the past years. As I would expect, the hon. Gentleman makes a strong case for a greater share of funding. That is not within our remit, but I am sure that there are people watching and listening closely to what he has said who will have heard his advocacy on behalf of his constituents. As he accepts, how resources are used is an operational matter for the local police leadership in an area. We are confident that many of the long-term measures in place, including safer neighbourhood teams, police community support officers and many of the other things that I have mentioned, will bear down on crime and on some of the problems that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. We believe that there has been some success, which is linked to increased resources that we do not intend to see diminished overall.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/15">We believe that there is a job still to be done to bear down on crime further, and particularly on that minority of people who might wrongly believe that they are beyond the reach of the law. I assure the hon. Gentleman that both he and I share the view that such people are not beyond the law, and we must work at a local and national level to ensure that we do everything possible to bear down on crime further.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/16" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.318.0/17" class="italic">Sitting adjourned.</p>
