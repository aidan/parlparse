<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-04a.168.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1468" speakername="David Ruffley" colnum="168"  time="015:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100204/halltext/100204h0004.htm#10020467000338">
	<p pid="a.168.0/1">We have already had a forensically interesting debate and I will start my remarks by highlighting, unambiguously, the excellent work that police officers perform week in, week out, month in, month out, policing protests and events of all kinds. Even at the G20 protests, where the news was dominated by some tragic incidents, we should remember that more than 35,000 protesters demonstrated in London, requiring 10,000 police officer shifts. Despite the scale of the disruption, businesses in the City reported minor damage and non-protesters were certainly able to go about their lives with little or no major disruption of any kind. However, the Opposition believe that it is right that when serious public order incidents occur, a thorough investigation should and must be conducted by the Home Office, or in particular by the Independent Police Complaints Commission or Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary. If appropriate, action should be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/2">Following the G20 protests and other high-profile events referred to, such as the protests at Kingsnorth power station, there has been considerable scrutiny of how we go about policing events. Last June, the Select Committee on Home Affairs published its report, &quot;Policing of the G20 Protests&quot;. The Government published their interim response to that report on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-24">24 October</phrase> and their final response on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-15">15 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/3">HMIC conducted its own investigation on the way in which protests are policed. Its interesting report, &quot;Adapting to Protest-Nurturing the British Model of Policing&quot;, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-24">24 November</phrase>. HMIC's review of the policing of protests found that there were an inadequate number of trained public order commanders. Its report found that 16 to 22 per cent. of forces feel unable to provide a minimal ACPO or National Policing Improvement Agency-accredited command structure for policing events.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/4">My understanding is that a normal command structure on average would consist of two advanced public order commanders-gold or silver commanders-and two initial commanders, known as bronze commanders. The report found that there were less than adequately trained public order commanders in charge of operations in major forces, including the Greater Manchester police and the West Midlands police. Can the Minister confirm what her view is on that evidence and what action her Department has undertaken to remedy that alleged shortfall?</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/5">In respect of rank-and-file officers, HMIC found that 22,500 officers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are trained to level 2 out of the three tiers of public order operational effectiveness. Level 2 is the standard level in the use of public order skills, tactics and equipment. The proportion of officers in forces trained to level 2 across England and Wales is, on average, just over 15 per cent., but the figures vary across force areas, from 8.7 per cent. in the South Wales police to 39 per cent. in Northumbria. Obviously, part of that difference reflects the challenges that the different forces face geographically. Some areas, and particularly metropolitan forces, will have more large-scale events and will as a consequence train more officers to deal with them. I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that the Home Office has assessed or will assess the number of officers in each force trained to level 2 for public order policing. If she and her Department are not doing that, what information does she have on it?</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/6">HMIC acknowledged the very significant cost of public order training. No sensible political party could ignore the fact that public order training is important, but a price tag is attached to it. HMIC says that police officers do not need more training, but that the existing training needs to be</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/7" class="indent">&quot;smarter-more directed, more focused and more relevant&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/8">Will the Minister comment on what information she has in that regard?</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/9">One of HMIC's recommendations is for the service to adopt a set of fundamental principles on police officers' use of force that runs through all aspects of policing. Will the Minister elucidate on what she understands is the core set of fundamental principles on police officers' use of force? Is that something that ACPO is advising her on, and implementing and directing? Is it something that the Home Office is doing, or the NPIA, or who?</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/10">The ACPO lead for uniformed operations has already said that he will lead the work to codify public order guidance to ensure that the police</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/11" class="indent">&quot;have very high standards of compliance with the recommendations and to make sure that we embed some of the new thinking about public order and new training programmes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/12">Can the Minister elucidate on what stage that work has reached, what she might be able to publish and what she might be able to explain here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/13">Clearly, it is of the utmost importance that the work is completed as expeditiously as possible to ensure that the changes in guidance and their implementation are embedded. There a simple reason for that: whoever is in government, we have the Olympics coming up in 2012, which will undoubtedly provide a severe, stern and serious test of policing capability in respect of public order offences. It is essential that our officers have had time to take on board any changes that have been suggested, quite properly, in the past 12 months, so that those changes can bed in and so that everyone-public and police, as well as Government-understands exactly what the score is. We also need the necessary resources to ensure that the adequate level of training is achieved. I shall be charitable to the Minister today-we all understand the tight constraints on any public service budget, and the Home Office budget is what it is-but, on training, we need to get more bang for our buck, whoever the Minister happens to be at the time. Clearly, that is not a matter for a Minister in an office in Whitehall to direct for 40-odd forces, but we do need a slightly better understanding than we have at the moment of what the guidance is and who is driving it through and ensuring delivery, with the main thing in mind being the 2012 Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/14">I shall move on briefly to the powers under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The Opposition agree with the part of the report dedicated to the use of section 43, 44 and 45 terrorism powers in policing protests. Those provisions should be there; they do not need to be repealed. Section 43 allows the search of a person whom an officer reasonably suspects to be a terrorist. Section 44 authorises an officer to carry out the search. Section 45 confers on an officer the power to search, whether or not they have grounds for suspecting that a person has articles that could be used in connection with terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/15">In 2008-09, there were 256,026 stops and searches under section 44. That was a 36 per cent. increase on 2008. A further 1,643 stops and searches were carried out by the Metropolitan Police Service in 2008-09 under the powers in section 43. The report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Counter-terrorism powers should never be used against peaceful protestors: the Government's guidance on stop and search powers in Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 should make this clear.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/17">Would the Minister like to add to that proposition, which has already been raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> and which I am raising again now? Court's finding at least a little disturbing? Of the tens-nearly hundreds-of thousands of searches made under section 44, in no case had anyone been arrested for a terrorist offence. Does that not show that the powers are being used not for that purpose but for a whole range of other purposes?</p>
