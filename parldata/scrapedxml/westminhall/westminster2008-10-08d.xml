	<p pid="d.82.0/1">Living with autism is a real struggle for many families, and, for the vast majority of people, it is something that happens to somebody else's family. That is why today's debate is important, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> on keeping it on the Government's agenda.</p>
	<p pid="d.82.0/2">For the people who are directly affected when a diagnosis is made, there is often a lack of information immediately available&mdash;where to go, what to do, who to contact, what help is available to families, what they are entitled to and what battles they will have to fight in the years ahead. If one message has come through loud and clear from parents, it is that in most cases they have to fight a constant battle to get even a fraction of the help, support and the education that their child needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.82.0/3">Yesterday, we heard a very eloquent speech by a 22-year-old with autism who was doing a great job as a trainer of people working with those affected by autism. Unfortunately, her early education consisted of being bullied, spat on, called a freak and leaving her school because it could not cope with her behaviour. Fortunately, she survived and made progress later in life, so we must ensure that what happened to her a decade or so ago is not what children in the education system, either today or in the future, have to experience.</p>
	<p pid="d.82.0/4">The hon. Gentleman eloquently laid out the challenges before us, and as the findings of the Bercow review have done much to frame the issue and bring it to the attention of Parliament, I put on the record my appreciation of the work that he has done in the past, his speech today and the work that he will no doubt do in the future. I would say he never could be described as humble.</p>
	<p pid="d.82.0/5">Many parents of autistic children, desperate for help and support, will be encouraged by today's debate, and we owe it to them to ensure that they are not let down. Although it is vital that we commit more resources to providing better education and more flexible support, that in itself will have a limited impact if parents are not aware of all the help to which they are entitled because, over recent years, much of the talk in education policy has emphasised the need for parental choice. However, owing to the complexity of the system and to a lack of information, it is often very difficult for parents of autistic children to make informed choices, and the Minister's comments on the best way to overcome that information vacuum would be most welcome. Indeed, just yesterday, I was reading about the amount of unclaimed pension credit: it is one thing to provide the help, it is another thing altogether to ensure that the right people receive it.</p>
	<p pid="d.82.0/6">The importance of accurate information extends beyond the help that we provide to parents to experts and policy makers. Research by TreeHouse into the huge number of parliamentary questions about autism which never receive any answer rightly illustrates the huge gaps in our knowledge. Similarly, the information deficit extends to the lack of understanding among teachers, as we have heard, social workers and even medical experts.</p>
	<p pid="d.82.0/7">The other point on which I should appreciate the Minister's comments is support for the transition from childhood to adulthood. The support that young people receive as they leave school is critical to their future success, and for many young people with autism, it is a particularly stressful time as they leave behind the support that they have had through school and move on to a new life. For youngsters with autism, even small changes to their routine can be very difficult, so professionals and services need to plan ahead effectively and consult young people and their families to ensure that the young person is able to move on successfully to opportunities that are appropriate to them. Far too often, it does not happen. Only 15 per cent. of adults with autism are in full-time employment, while more than 40 per cent. still live at home with their parents. Much good work is done during school years, but it can all too easily be undone if young people with autism are abandoned by the system when they reach adulthood.</p>
	<p pid="d.82.0/8">In my constituency, there is a young man with autism called Calum Reavley, whom I recently visited. His parents, grandparents, family and friends, and many more people often work day and night to give Calum the good start in life that he deserves. Life is a constant battle for education, for respite care and for everything else. Surely, we have the resources to provide the education, help and support that people such as Calum deserve. As his family watch billions of pounds being pumped in to save the financial sector today, they will be asking, &quot;Why is it so hard, and why is there so little help available for us?&quot; I look forward to the Minister's answer.</p>

	<p pid="d.84.0/1">I, too, shall be brief, because of the number of Members who want to speak. I shall make just four suggestions, but first, I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> and congratulate him on bringing the issue to us today. I am not sure that he is the man whom I would choose to write a plain English guide, but he is certainly the right man to lead our debate today, and I enjoyed his speech and I agreed with everything that he said.</p>
	<p pid="d.84.0/2">I became interested in the subject when I first became an MP and three constituents, all with autistic children, came to me. They wanted Lovaas technique to help their children, but their local council said that they could not have it, although it could provide an alternative that was just as good. My constituents decided that one of them would take a test case to a special educational needs tribunal. The council was represented by a barrister and won the case, but it then changed its mind, granted Lovaas technique to the two parents who had not gone to the tribunal and said that it was now ultra vires to provide Lovaas technique to the parent who had gone to the tribunal. That struck me as an entirely inappropriate way to deal with education and parents' requirements. As a follow up, the father who did not receive Lovaas technique provided it privately&mdash;at great expense to himself and his family. It put such pressure on the marriage that it broke up, but the child did so well that they were able to go back into mainstream schooling at the secondary stage. That is what can happen if one secures the right support for a child, but it could have been done without all the pressure that was put on that family. Far too many cases go to tribunal, and when one gets there one finds that the council is represented by a barrister, and that, as a parent, it is against the rules to get legal aid for one's representation. My first practical suggestion is therefore that every council should provide an independent and professional friend at its expense to help parents to prepare and present their case. They do not need to be a barrister; they just need to be somebody who knows what they are doing and can help to ensure that the parents' case is properly presented and the playing field levelled up.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-08d.84.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" colnum="84"  time="010:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081008/halltext/81008h0002.htm#08100883000473">
	<p pid="d.84.2/1">I entirely agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman, and that intervention feeds very nicely into my next point. When the Government made it a requirement that a parent could insist on a mainstream school place for a disabled child, the Government did not take away the right to insist on a special school place. One of the problems that we have is that there is the wrong balance in many areas between the number of special places available and the number of parents who want their child to go to those special schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.84.2/2">My second suggestion is that we should undertake a professional and comprehensive needs survey. Let us work out exactly how many people there are with autism who might benefit from mainstream schooling, so that councils can get their provision right, because far too many councils are basing provision on cost rather than on need. May I make another suggestion? As I have already said and as we all know, the earlier that we intervene, recognise that someone has autism and get them the right support that they need, the better they will do. We have a huge opportunity coming up, because the Prime Minister has announced that we will provide a nursery school place for all two-year-olds whose parents want such a place. Why do we not say that everybody who is responsible for looking after a two or three-year-old in nursery education must have autism training, so that they can recognise the signs of a child who has autism and can ensure that that child is referred elsewhere in the education system to get the right sort of help?</p>

	<p pid="d.85.1/1">Absolutely. I would add that, if we can achieve greater awareness of autism in our nursery schools, we should also teach teachers and doctors to listen to mums, because it is usually mums who spot the signs of autism first but they are usually told, &quot;Go away, you're just being a worrying mum&quot;. We should therefore improve the system so that we are actually listening to mums when they raise these concerns.</p>
	<p pid="d.85.1/2">Finally, the Department for Education and Skills, the predecessor of the Department for Children, Schools and Families, published a best practice guide for autism a few years ago. In fact, two guides were produced; one for health and one for education. The one for education is particularly good and it is effectively a checklist to establish whether a local authority is really doing the things it ought to be doing to ensure that the right provision is available and that the right support is provided for parents. A local authority that has followed that best practice guide provides services at an acceptable level, so why do we not make it compulsory for Ofsted to go through that best practice guide at every inspection of a local authority and challenge it to make sure that it is living up to the guide? At the moment, it is effectively left to parents to use that guide to test their local authority, but it should be done by Ofsted, and the local authority should be forced to come up to the mark.</p>

	<p pid="d.85.2/1">I want to reiterate the thanks that all Members have given today to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> for securing this debate. I know that many residents in my constituency will be following it with some interest.</p>
	<p pid="d.85.2/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase> said, the pressure on families with children who have autism can be incredibly intense and it is a tragedy that so many of them suffer family breakdown as a result.</p>
	<p pid="d.85.2/3">I would like to focus my remarks on the importance of specialist training for teaching autistic children. In my constituency of Basingstoke, I am fortunate to have a number of schools that specialise in dealing with autistic children and their particular needs. I would like to refer specifically to Dove House school, which offers secondary education for children in the north Hampshire area. It has been commended by Ofsted for its work in providing outstanding teaching for pupils with autism, thus enabling them to make great progress, by a number of means: the environment it creates for children; the tailored curriculum it creates for them; and the deep understanding that the teachers have of the needs of children with autism. Those factors have enabled the school to secure its high commendation from Ofsted for the outstanding progress that its pupils make. When I visit the school and talk to parents who have children there, I find it is those factors that they understand as really critical in providing an outstanding education for their children.</p>
	<p pid="d.85.2/4">As hon. Members have already mentioned, 70 per cent. of children on the autistic spectrum are educated in mainstream schools. Some parents of autistic children choose for their children to be educated in mainstream schools; some do not, and the hon. Member for South Thanet is absolutely right to say that we need to understand more about the provision of education at local level for children with autism. For some children, it will be better to be in the mainstream sector. However, just because they are in the mainstream sector, it does not mean that the teaching, the sensitivity of the teaching and the school environment and the need to ensure that all those key factors are addressed is any less important.</p>
	<p pid="d.85.2/5">As we know, TreeHouse does a great deal to campaign on behalf of children with autism and their parents. The report that it issued last month underlined the importance of tailoring education to the needs of the child. Quite worryingly, the report identified that there are still significant problems in delivering that tailored programme within the mainstream sector of education. The report identified that successful inclusion involves training staff about autism, so that the staff can then cater for a child's individual needs and ensure that the correct environment exists for that child. Thus we see themes emerging.</p>
	<p pid="d.85.2/6">However, as hon. Members have said, the National Union of Teachers' own research shows that less than a third of teachers feel confident about teaching children who are on the autistic disorder spectrum, that two thirds of teachers want training and that three quarters of teachers have identified the lack of professional development as the main barrier to teaching children with autism.</p>
	<p pid="d.85.2/7">I really welcome the Government's announcement, made during the recess, that additional resources will be made available; I believe that there will be about &pound;10 million more made available for training teachers. Certainly the focus on training SENCOs is absolutely key. It is encouraging that the Government understand the importance of training teachers before they reach the classroom. However, the focus of the Government's announcement was those people undertaking undergraduate training. As the hon. Member for South Thanet will know very well, those people form the minority of teachers who are coming forward and going into our classrooms to teach children on a day-to-day basis.</p>
	<p pid="d.85.2/8">I hope that the Minister will be able to flesh out a little some of the sketchy points that were made in the Government press release issued in the summer and perhaps give more details of the emphasis that will be given at undergraduate level to the training those students receive regarding special educational needs, particularly autism. Furthermore, can he tell us what will be done to ensure that people entering teaching through other routes, such as those taking the postgraduate certificate in education, or PGCE, will be given similar support? I am sure that he shares my concern about the continuing problem of retention in the teaching profession. If we are not ensuring that teachers who come into our classrooms have the tools of the trade to meet the needs of all the children in their classroom, we cannot hope to address the problem of retention.</p>

	<p pid="d.87.2/1">My hon. Friend drew attention to the need for individual education for children&mdash;education tailored to their individual needs. That point highlights the need for the availability of continuing education, because a teacher who has a child in the class with particular needs may well need access to ongoing training, so that they can tailor their teaching specifically to that child. That is particularly important in small schools, where there may not be the other resources available within the school that may well be available in a larger school.</p>

	<p pid="d.87.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a very important point. Given the incidence of special educational needs in general, the need to ensure that continuous professional development is available, to meet the needs of a particular child or a particular teacher in a school, is absolutely vital. I know that my own local authority in Hampshire has a very extensive range of programmes available for teachers to dip into, but across the country there is a great concern that schools can often find it difficult to release teachers for such training. We need to make sure that that is addressed.</p>
	<p pid="d.87.3/2">The outcomes for children are deeply worrying. We hear that exclusions, underachievement and unemployment are the recipe in the current situation. Obviously, some of the moves that the Government have made are to be welcomed, but there is much more to do. All of us are here today because of our interest in and commitment to children and to helping every child to reach their potential, and children with autism especially deserve our help.</p>

	<p pid="d.88.0/3">In 2003, the all-party group published a manifesto that set out a 10-year vision for a society in which autism was fully understood and in which people on the autism spectrum and their families were respected and supported, and provided with the same rights and entitlements as other people. Education is central to the fulfilment of that vision. This debate provides a welcome opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made towards the manifesto's education objectives and the resulting outcomes for young people with autism. We are now five years into the 10-year period of the manifesto, and the all-party group is taking the opportunity at this halfway stage to review progress against the objectives. It will publish a report on it later this month.</p>
	<p pid="d.88.0/4">We have come a long way over the past five years, and much progress has been made. For the first time, we have records of the number of pupils who have significant special educational needs as a result of autism. As others have said, there has been welcome progress recently on improving training for teachers, with the development of modules on special educational needs for initial teacher training, the development of the Autism Education Trust, which brings together autism organisations to improve support for pupils with autism, and the inclusion development programme, which will provide basic training in autism for practising teachers from next year. Again, as other Members have said, the appointment of special educational needs co-ordinators means that the members of staff who advise and lead on SEN in each school will now be required to have qualified teacher status and training in SEN.</p>
	<p pid="d.88.0/5">Nevertheless, the all-party group supports what other Members have said this morning. It believes that the Government should go further and that there should be a mandatory requirement for all teachers to have training in autism to ensure that all children get the support that they need.</p>
	<p pid="d.88.0/6">Despite the advances, children with autism and their families continue to face many difficulties and challenges as they go through the education system. Rates of exclusion and bullying are still far too high. In one terrible example, a child was excluded 77 times in just two years. Some young people with autism are unable to fulfil their potential in exams because the right support is not put in place. Because parents are blamed for their child's behaviour by professionals who fail to understand autism, relationships deteriorate and parents feel increasingly isolated.</p>
	<p pid="d.88.0/7">In some cases, teaching professionals refuse to accept diagnoses given by health professionals. Many children are unable to attend schools that are nearby and have to travel more than 10 miles to get to a school.</p>

	<p pid="d.89.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Caton. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">The hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> described himself as a humble Back Bencher. I believe that many of us felt humbled listening to his introduction to the debate. I would like to reinforce what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> said about the young lady Robin, who spoke at the National Autistic Society's reception yesterday. She overcame many of the education hurdles that we have discussed to become a strong advocate for the rights of those who are diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorders.</p>
	<p pid="d.89.2/2">Time is short. Without straying into devolved territory, I was going to talk about the great progress that has been made in Wales, which is pioneering an ASD strategic action plan. I believe that it is the first such plan anywhere in the world, let alone in this country. It takes a cradle-to-grave approach to work on autism. I would like to highlight the pioneering work that Autism Cymru, a charity based in my constituency, has undertaken in its inclusive schools project, which seeks to promote an autism ambassador in every primary, secondary and specialist school in Wales. It has instigated a huge amount of training for education professionals: 5,000 practitioners since 2002, including school and college staff and learning support assistants.</p>
	<p pid="d.89.2/3">I shall deviate completely from my speech because time is short. I spent 12 years in the classroom. I want to share some of the frustrations that I experienced as a teacher&mdash;frustrations borne, of course, by parents and young people themselves&mdash;with the vagaries and inadequacies of teacher training. I endured a postgraduate certificate in education course at an august institution in the west of England&mdash;I shall not say more than that. The entire special needs provision in that college amounted to four hours one Tuesday morning, during which Asperger's was not even mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="d.89.2/4">I then faced the challenge in an ordinary school in the west of England at that time and, latterly, in Wales, of being summoned by the head teacher, told that a child with &quot;communication difficulties&quot; would be arriving at the school, and then very much left to fend for myself. That was the situation I found myself in, and in which many teachers find themselves. That is why it is important that we acknowledge the evidence that we have heard from the National Union of Teachers, which recognises that there are serious shortfalls in the provision in schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.89.2/5">Parents who come into my constituency surgeries are frustrated. A son has been provided with one-to-one support, a laptop and a sloping board, but he lacks the quiet room that he needs for him to achieve his education opportunities. Many parents have a perception that the educational statements that they fought long and hard for are not being adhered to, and there are concerns about transition, particularly from key stages 2 to 3, all of which were identified in the NAS's report &quot;Make school make sense&quot;. Above all else, many parents have a perception that professionals still lack a basic understanding of ASD. As we have just heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">the hon. Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase>, there is still no mandatory requirement for trainee or practising teachers to undertake specific training in autism, despite the requirement of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 to differentiate.</p>
	<p pid="d.89.2/6">When I was writing my speech, I jotted down the word &quot;problem&quot;, but it is completely inappropriate. Yes, there is a challenge but there is also a huge opportunity. We know that those who function with Asperger's syndrome are high achievers. There is huge untapped potential that we ignore at our peril, and I am alarmed by that. I have been there myself: the child who is not paying attention, who has been distracted, who is sent out of the room&mdash;all those hidden exclusions that we heard about at the start of the debate that are not being dealt with properly.</p>
	<p pid="d.89.2/7">Education must involve a partnership between local education authorities, between LEAs and parents, and between children and teachers. That is central to this debate. The Government have made good progress. The teacher training modules and the advice that is being given are laudable, but they do not go far enough. Listening to earlier speeches, I felt like saying, &quot;Been there, done that.&quot; The reality of doing the postgraduate certificate course is that I was there but I did not get the training or support that I needed to deliver the curriculum across the board to everybody in my class.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-08d.90.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="90"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081008/halltext/81008h0003.htm#08100883000485">
	<p pid="d.90.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>, who has been his usual analytical self. It was pleasing that he drew out strands of optimism, showing that we can, all working together, make progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.0/2">Like other hon. Members, I shall focus on the importance of the individual child. We know that the condition of autism has many different manifestations. We really should not talk about &quot;the autistic child&quot; because there is not a typical condition relating to a particular child, although there are certain common characteristics. It never fails to amaze me, on walking into schools sometimes, to find that teachers do not appreciate that many children with autism do not like the hustle and bustle of the playground. That is so obvious, yet still that knowledge is lacking.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.0/3">I shall make three main points. First, parents are not satisfied. We have heard the statistics this morning: 45 per cent. of parents tell us that it takes more than a year to receive support; 50 per cent. of parents feel that their child is not in the right setting; and one in five children with autism are excluded&mdash;67 per cent. of them more than once. These are alarming statistics and we have to translate the talk and guidance into real action.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.0/4">I am greatly concerned, still, about the information available to parents. In theory, it should be there, but in practice it is not. A recent study by Centre Forum and the Policy Exchange revealed, through a survey of local authority websites, that those authorities were not providing the information that, legally, should be provided. It is very easy to check to ensure that it is there.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.0/5">I am concerned that parents with children with special educational needs do not have choice. In many cases, their choice is restricted. I have recently come across a situation in which parents of a child without any special educational needs in a mainstream school can opt for a school outside the local authority area and pay the travel expenses, if there is a space available. However, I am told that, if parents of a child with special educational needs want a place in a school outside the local authority area and the authority judges that there is an appropriate space within the local authority area, there will be great resistance to that child going to the other school. There are lots of hidden ways in which choices are restricted.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.0/6">The breakdown of inclusion and special schools is much more diverse these days. There are some amazing examples of schools that can partition and separate, providing quiet rooms and integrating all on the same site. There are some exciting models and some ways forward.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.0/7">On exclusions, not only are there alarming stories about the unofficial exclusions on top of the enormously high official exclusion figure, but there is a question about where the children who have been excluded more than once actually end up. Often, pupil referral units have not been staffed or resourced adequately to deal with such a situation. I agree with other hon. Members that early identification, followed by appropriate therapies, is key.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.0/8">Many hon. Members have mentioned the transition period, which has to be of great concern to us. Parents battle on, yet almost as the end of formal schooling is reached, when they perhaps feel that they are nearly there, even more hurdles and difficulties arise. I appreciate that the Government are putting money into this, but it is a huge challenge for all of us.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.0/9">I thank the organisations, including TreeHouse and the National Autistic Society, for providing us with many briefings and studies. I also congratulate the all-party group on autism, which has made a big contribution. It is good to look back over a period of time and see real achievement.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.0/10">Secondly, teachers are clearly not confident. That has come out in many of the speeches made this morning. Some 44 per cent. of teachers are not confident in dealing with autism and 77 per cent. state that a lack of continuous professional development is a real barrier. I am sure that the Minister will tell us about all the progress that is being made in extending teacher training to include more on special educational needs. It is telling that, although we had a mass movement towards inclusion way over 10 years ago, the first teachers coming through their initial teacher training with more modules on special educational needs will not come through until 2011. That is a real gap and a lot of pupils have suffered as a consequence of not matching the teaching with the expectations on teachers.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.0/11">We have great expectations of teachers, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> said. A teacher may have 30 children in the classroom, including one child with special needs, but they do not have the expertise&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Or the support. It is quite a lot to ask of any individual in any work situation. I feel that there should be a teacher entitlement allowing them to be provided with a resource pack, as a minimum, if they have a child with particular needs&mdash;and autism would come into that category. We talk a lot about other entitlements, but there is a need to consider teacher entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="d.90.0/12">I concur that more training across the board is needed, particularly with continuous professional development. It is not enough just to have the courses on offer at local authority level: supply cover has to be available for the teachers to be able to attend. Equally, many other teacher training courses, such as the school-centred initial teacher training, need to include training for autism and general special educational needs.</p>

	<p pid="d.92.3/1">If a SENCO is to be able to pass on and encourage good practices, it is vital that they have a certain status in the school and a position in the pecking order.</p>
	<p pid="d.92.3/2">Thirdly, we talk about one in 100 children having autism, but let us look around and consider who is affected. The parents are affected, as are the grandparents, the wider family and the neighbours: so many people are touched by autism. That brings me to support for the family. The hon. Member for Buckingham made this point well when he asked what happens when a child gets home. That is vital. We talk about the costs of the lack of early intervention, but if we do not put in that support to prevent family breakdown, we have even more tragedies and great costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.92.3/3">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> said, we must also be aware of what happens after school years. My caseload seems to be getting ever bigger in respect of elderly parents with adult offspring with learning disabilities who are finding it so difficult to get enough support. My hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion mentioned the cradle-to-grave approach, which sounds excellent, and the autism ambassador. It sounds as though we have a lot to learn.</p>
	<p pid="d.92.3/4">Finally, we should be celebrating the good practice&mdash;there are some amazing examples around&mdash;but we must have ambitions for every child with autism. Personally, the 2009 review, which will be led by Ofsted, will be crucial. I hope that there will be a big input into the terms of reference, because the Government have delayed taking some actions because of that study. We have to get it right. We need the right people carrying it out and they need the right remit.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-08d.94.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" speakername="Tim Loughton" colnum="94"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081008/halltext/81008h0004.htm#08100883000494">
	<p pid="d.94.3/1">And it is time consuming. Part of the problem is that local authorities have three roles: they assess the child's needs; they are the paymasters for funding what needs to be supplied; and they are often the suppliers of special educational needs provision. The service is made to fit the cash available; it is not tailor-made to fit the child's needs. Parents must be articulate to navigate their way through the system, and it is often the most deprived who miss out. It can be a very lonely time for parents, which is why my party, through the Sir Robert Balchin commission, has come up with proposals, which we are considering, to replace statements with special needs profiles drawn up by profile assessors&mdash;educational psychologists&mdash;who are independent of local authorities and who concentrate on early intervention and regular review. We should have special needs profiles that allocate children not only to one designation, but perhaps to one of a dozen support categories, often because they have complex needs that require multiple application. There should be portable funding to mainstream schools, and the assessors should be independent of local authorities and should be peer reviewed. There should also be a special needs mediation service with tribunals as the last resort, which has also been mentioned today. We want some big changes in the way in which we assess special educational needs, so that the assessments are tailor-made to the children.</p>
	<p pid="d.94.3/2">Many hon. Members have mentioned support groups such as the National Autistic Society and TreeHouse, which do fantastic work. TreeHouse's constructive campaigning parent support project provides vital help to parents, who often feel alienated and isolated. The experience of school is not just about learning in the classroom; it is about the social interaction of children with their peers, which is why it is so important to concentrate on communication skills from an early stage. It was interesting to hear the hon. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, who is so knowledgeable about the subject, speaking about the importance of listening to mums.</p>
	<p pid="d.94.3/3">I have a lot of sympathy with the National Autistic Society's ongoing research and its report, &quot;Make School Make Sense&quot;, which rightly says that we need more research into the nature of exclusions. We need greater availability of expertise in mainstream and specialist schools. That takes up the point in the NUT survey that three quarters of teachers are ill equipped to look after children with autism.</p>
	<p pid="d.94.3/4">As my hon. Friends the Members for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) and for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper) and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase>, who has expertise in education, have mentioned, we must give greater seniority to SENCOs and provide them with more autism training, which must be ongoing, earlier. We must also look at halfway houses, so that we have some specialist units within mainstream schools. It is not a question of going to a specialist school or going to a mainstream school and hopefully receiving some support. There must be as much flexibility in the system as possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.94.3/5">Many parents complain about delays in starting support and are left waiting, often at a crucial time, even when their child's special educational needs have been identified and a support package has supposedly been put in place. There is an impact on the classmates of a child with special educational needs. It is not a one-way-street; it is a learning process for other children and adults in society to discover how best to integrate and relate to people who happen to have a special educational need that is autism. That does not make them a different or lesser person. Support for parents and carers is as vital as special educational needs identification for a child, whatever the educational setting.</p>
	<p pid="d.94.3/6">I was taken by the suggestion from the hon. Member for Ceredigion about the cradle-to-grave pilots in Wales, and the autism ambassadors, which is another way of raising the profile of the issue and its importance in schools. Many hon. Members mentioned the transition points&mdash;20 per cent. of children have special educational needs below the age of 16, but that drops to 7.3 per cent. at the age of 16, and worse at the age of 18. They are dropping out of the system, but their disabilities do not go away because they have dropped off the radar. We need better transitions, and we must boost the Government's transition support programme. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">The right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, who has such expertise in this area, mentioned that.</p>
	<p pid="d.94.3/7">It is complicated, but it is essential to intervene early, and to invest to save so much later. We spend around &pound;2.7 billion on intervention for children with autism, but that rises to &pound;25 billion for adults with autism. It is a no-brainer that we should front-load that investment rather more than we are at the moment to prevent so many more problems in the personal experience of those children as they reach adulthood.</p>

	<p pid="d.97.1/1">I am happy to consider what my hon. Friend has said. I take a consistent interest in matters relating to his city, and I will take his comments on board. In respect of exclusion, it would be remiss of me not to underscore the importance that I place on having an appeal system. For children who have been wrongly excluded because of the much mentioned problems with those in the teaching work force having the confidence to understand the disorders, it is crucial that that appeal right is maintained. I urge the Opposition to take note of that.</p>
	<p pid="d.97.1/2">The hon. Gentleman also discussed bullying. It is a sad and disturbing fact that young people with disabilities can become a target for bullies. Bullying of any kind and of anybody is unacceptable, particularly when it is directed at those who are most vulnerable. Improved communication skills for autistic children will lead to better social interaction with other young people. Of course, that is the case for every child and not just for those who live with a disability. For that reason, an increased emphasis has been put on social issues and skills in the curriculum. The social and emotional aspects of learning programme is helping all pupils relate to one another better, to understand people who are different from us, to manage conflict better and to treat one another with respect. That is becoming much more embedded in primary schools and has been extended to secondary schools. I regret that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1429" name="Nick Gibb">the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)</phrase> described it as ghastly, because it is a really important programme that runs in our schools, particularly because it tackles such bullying. We are grateful to the National Autistic Society for its help in producing our guidance on bullying involving children with SEN and disabilities. We will be working with the Anti-Bullying Alliance to ensure that its principles are embedded.</p>

	<p pid="d.98.2/1">May I simply draw the Minister's attention to Prime Performance Solutions Limited? Julie Inglis and a former respected Member of the House, Kerry Pollard, are representatives of that organisation who came to see me on Monday afternoon. They provide courses for professionals, parents and the voluntary sector and already claim that they are not only helping to foster greater independence in adulthood, but saving &pound;50,000 a year reoccurring to the public and private purse as a result of the excellent training that they provide. Often the best trainers are people who are autistic or Asperger's on the spectrum themselves or who have family members who are. We can learn from that.</p>

	<p pid="d.103.0/1">Does my hon. Friend realise that the county council has already taken a major step in that respect by giving a sizeable grant directly to the Northamptonshire police force in order to fund extra policing? His idea is in keeping with the thrust of that grant.</p>

	<p pid="d.103.1/1">Indeed. I pay tribute to the way in which the county council manages to juggle an almost impossible situation. Farmwatch is a good example. Funding has been granted to that scheme, but because it is not granted to the county council for long periods it cannot always pass it on to local organisations. As a result, Farmwatch is worried that its funding will run out at the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="d.103.1/2">All that is needed to solve the policing problems in Northamptonshire is for the Minister to guarantee three small things: first, fair funding for Northamptonshire police; secondly, immediately providing 400 more officers; and thirdly, providing a sheriff of Northamptonshire. If he guarantees that, then his first week at the Home Office will be well spent.</p>

	<p pid="d.105.1/1">The activities that I was talking about are important for bringing crime down. I am not underplaying antisocial behaviour in any way, shape or form, but I suggest that the hon. Gentleman's constituents want to ensure that crime levels continue to fall. I do not believe that it is an either/or question; I have a theory that other things are in play when there is an increase in antisocial behaviour. I hope to address some of the hon. Gentleman's points on that.</p>
	<p pid="d.105.1/2">I should stress that we know the public want the police to be visible in their local communities and to be responsive to their priorities, as the hon. Member for Wellingborough said. To emphasise the most important elements of the service's relationship with the public, the Green Paper will introduce a new policing pledge, which will set out clear, public-facing, national service standards for the police from first contact to follow-up and which, through the important local element, will give the public a way to hold their neighbourhood policing teams to account for tackling local problems. We are consulting the service and the public about the pledge, but it is likely to contain commitments on how the police will engage with their local communities and respond to calls for services, and the follow-up action that people can expect to receive.</p>
	<p pid="d.105.1/3">To help forces focus yet more on the needs of their communities, the Government are committed to reducing red tape and bureaucracy in the service, and to allowing locally determined priorities to direct day-to-day activities. To that effect, all but one top-down numerical target for police forces will be removed, leaving only a single target set by the Home Office: namely, for each force to improve public confidence. Much of what the hon. Gentleman said was about gaining public confidence and responding to what the public say are their priorities. Furthermore, to strengthen the democratic link between the police and the public, directly elected crime and policing representatives will be introduced to police authorities. Their key role will be to hold the police to account for delivery against those locally determined priorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.105.1/4">The Government remain committed to continuing the improvements in policing in recent years, and Northamptonshire police are no exception. The force has faced significant challenges in recent years, but it has benefited from significantly improved resources that have helped to bring about some of those dramatic improvements in performance. Overall, the police service in England and Wales has benefited from a police grant that has increased by more than 60 per cent., or &pound;3.7 billion, between 1997-98 and 2010-11. Northamptonshire has benefited from an increase in total government grants from &pound;52.7 million in 1997 to &pound;88.3million in 2008, an increase of &pound;35.2million, which is a 67 per cent. increase in cash terms and a 27 per cent. increase in real terms.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-08d.106.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" speakername="Alan Campbell" colnum="106"  time="011:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081008/halltext/81008h0005.htm#08100883000512">
	<p pid="d.106.1/1">I appreciate that the local police authority expected a bigger increase, especially last year, and hon. Members will be aware that only so much money is available through the grant. We must ensure that all authorities have a broad minimum increase to ensure the stability of police funding in England and Wales. Of course, moving towards longer-term grants for authorities will help. The hon. Gentleman mentioned unfunded population increases, and I can tell him that we are working to ensure that the formula does not operate as he says.</p>
	<p pid="d.106.1/2">In the meantime, we are doing other things to address the problems. For example, Northamptonshire police force and police authority may, along with all police service providers nationwide, benefit from new sources of funding, including new migration impact funds, which come from a fund of some tens of millions of pounds to alleviate the short-term transitional pressures of migration. The funds will be available from April 2009 and managed by regional Government offices. A key part of the scheme will be applying local knowledge to funding decisions and ensuring that the funds will be spent not only properly, but quickly.</p>
	<p pid="d.106.1/3">Other sources of funding are available to forces and partners to improve efficiency and to build additional capacity and capability into forces, far beyond a simple interpretation of staff and officer numbers. For example, Northamptonshire police are to benefit, along with the four other forces in the east midlands collaboration, from &pound;8.3 million that has been provided for the purchase of hand-held computers, which could go some way to addressing the form-filling problem that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. That money is being made available as a direct result of the Government's commitment to implement the recommendations made by Sir Ronnie Flanagan in his recent review. Results from similar schemes are encouraging, and reveal the potential for the initiative to contribute to the Government's commitment to cutting unnecessary bureaucracy and to freeing up officer time to focus on front-line policing.</p>
	<p pid="d.106.1/4">The allocation of resources within each force's area is, of course, a matter for the chief constable and the police authority, and maximum flexibility has been afforded to them. However, it is clear that the increase in funding provided by Government and police authorities has facilitated an increase in officer numbers in the past 10 years. At the end of March 2008, Northamptonshire had 1,264 police officers, which is an increase of 87 officers on the previous year, and the force has 159 police community support officers. I heard what the hon. Gentleman said about those officers, but he and I do not agree about their importance. Interestingly, in my constituency, local communities welcome PCSOs when they are introduced&mdash;they want to see someone on the street. The hon. Gentleman spoke in percentage terms or minutes per hour in relation to the amount of time that a police officer spends on patrol, but the job of PCSOs is to be out on patrol in local neighbourhoods, and their time is not reflected in the figures that he used in his parliamentary question. We should appreciate that there is more to it than that simple figure.</p>
	<p pid="d.106.1/5">I accept that the resource situation is more challenging now than it has been, and it is important to note that the recruitment of police staff has a direct impact on the capacity of police officers. Recruitment could free officers from duties that do not require an officer to concentrate on front-line policing. Neighbourhood policing has been successfully implemented in Northamptonshire, which now has 41 full-strength dedicated safer community teams. Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary said in September that the Northamptonshire force has made considerable progress in delivering both effective neighbourhood policing and the wider citizen focus agenda. The force was also graded as excellent by the inspectorate when compared with others after victim's were asked whether they were satisfied with actions taken by the police. The force's dedicated business engineering review team, which has been recognised by the National Policing Improvement Agency as good practice, has concentrated on work force modernisation to ensure that we get the best from officers and staff. The force has been praised for forensic science, which is an important part of tackling crime, for pioneering techniques in using DNA, and a host of other things.</p>
	<p pid="d.106.1/6">The Home Office stands ready to commit extra resources for specific projects, as it did for a police operation to target domestic violence. Additional support is also available for tackling prolific and other priority offenders, about which we talked a great deal yesterday.</p>
	<p pid="d.106.1/7">Those improvements in performance have been&mdash;</p>

I represent Farnborough, in Hampshire, which is the finest executive jet base in Europe, and has received many nominations to that effect.

The airport will incur the cost and angst of having to administer a very complex system in the place of what he rightly says is a simple system.</p>

	<p pid="d.116.1/1">There is no way that the hon. Gentleman is going to draw me into Irish politics, but I agree with him. That is a clear consequence and it might happen.</p>
	<p pid="d.116.1/2">Regional airports such as Manchester are already at a disadvantage when it comes to long-haul route development. They have fewer affluent customers to serve and fewer business headquarters to generate business travel. My colleagues have examined the arguments in fine detail, and some have taken the arguments outside the box.</p>
	<p pid="d.116.1/3">In my final comments, I shall concentrate on another aspect that needs airing: the employees who need to be taken into consideration. We should hear from their representative unions. I am a member of the Unite the Union parliamentary Labour group, having previously been a full-time trade union officer for 20 years, and I am also concerned about the employment impacts of aviation duty.</p>
	<p pid="d.116.1/4">We have heard much in recent weeks about the need to act globally to deal with the worldwide economic collapse of financial institutions. Equally, we must consider carefully the realities of introducing aviation duty in the UK in a competitive international market. I support the arguments put forward from all the sections gathered today about the international implications of this issue.</p>
	<p pid="d.116.1/5">I know that Unite the Union is worried that if freight operators are charged, they will change their routes to avoid the tax. Moving freight by road to a European hub airport could lead to job losses. Although those numbers can be debated, it is quite clear that such a move would lead to job losses at UK distribution centres&mdash;a legitimate concern for existing employees in the UK&mdash;and the loss of capacity to have next-day delivery for documents and packages, except at a premium price. Although aviation duty would affect only aircraft departing the UK, if long-haul routes are slashed by operators this could affect our facility to import food from developing nations.</p>
	<p pid="d.116.1/6">Finally, the Government want airports to collect the new tax. Airports have no systems in place to administer aviation duty. Surely given the recent problems in the delivery of tax credit, child support and the education maintenance allowance, we should be wary of imposing new systems for payments. It seems daft to stick airports in that position when there are existing facilities, skills and experience within the airlines themselves. It is just daft.</p>
	<p pid="d.116.1/7">The Minister has been open to all arguments and has made it clear that she is prepared to consider seriously all sensible suggestions. If we propose anything that the Government regard as sensible, they have said that they will accept it. I would like to compliment the Minister on that openness and to put the same comments to those who have access to the Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="d.116.1/8">In conclusion, I want a much more rigorous assessment of the environmental, economic and employment consequences of the proposed aviation duty and I call for other alternatives to be considered. As a north-west MP, I argue strongly that it should be recognised that Manchester airport is the single most significant economic factor in the north-west, and we must not jeopardise that.</p>

	<p pid="d.117.0/1">I welcome today's debate. Air passenger duty is not a great tax, and it is quite something to invent a scheme that is considerably worse and that will greatly disadvantage our aviation industry which, as we have heard in this debate, is the second largest in the world. It has been a great British success story, but it is a very competitive industry.</p>
	<p pid="d.117.0/2">As we have seen with developments in Schiphol and at Charles de Gaulle, there are great temptations for carriers to move overseas. The problem with the tax is that it is unilateral and will lead to the export of jobs. We have heard the concerns of hon. Members from Northern Ireland. We have also heard about the problems that may lead to foreign road hauliers bringing in goods on our roads. There is a real problem with the concept of it being a unilateral tax. The Government have not said very much about what will happen when the EU comes up with its new trading system. What will happen then? Will our companies effectively be double taxed?</p>
	<p pid="d.117.0/3">We have also heard about the disadvantage for long-haul flights. The duty will greatly add to the red tape at airports. The Manchester Airport Group thinks it might have to collect &pound;400 million from airlines, which is more than its total revenue of &pound;300 million. It is concerned about who is liable for the tax because it will have to chase people and may spend a considerable amount of its revenue having to pay the Treasury for money that it cannot get back from third parties. We have already heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1369" name="Gerald Howarth">the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth)</phrase> about his concern for business aviation. I and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> have a first-rate airport in Christchurch&mdash;Hurn airport&mdash;which does quite a lot of business repairing aircraft. An aircraft that comes in to be repaired by a local engineering company may end up paying a considerable sum of money even before one screw driver has been used. There are real concerns about the perverse impact of this particular charge.</p>

	<p pid="d.119.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> on securing the debate and on making a serious contribution to an important issue. Next Thursday we celebrate the centenary of flight in this country. On <phrase class="date" code="1908-10-16">16 October 1908</phrase>, Samuel Cody became the first man to make a powered flight, flying 1,390 ft from Laffan's plain in Farnborough in my constituency. For 100 years, aviation has been one of Britain's most successful industries; let us ensure that we do not knock it now.</p>
	<p pid="d.119.0/2">I also declare an interest: I am a currently licensed aviator, together with the hon. Members for Edinburgh, South (Nigel Griffiths) and for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik), and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1917" name="Grant Shapps">the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps)</phrase>. We have sought to speak up in this place not so much for the airlines as for general aviation, comprising light aviation, sporting aviation and business aviation, which already contributes &pound;15 million in tax and VAT. We pay and the airlines do not&mdash;Mr. Walsh, please make a note.</p>
	<p pid="d.119.0/3">I have two points to raise. First, general aviation&mdash;below 5,700 kg&mdash;generally uses Avgas, which is a petrol and on which we pay tax, so we are not affected by the measure. However, the industry is affected, because we are increasingly trying to move to diesel engine development, which is far more fuel efficient and reduces emissions. It will be hit very badly, because diesel engines use Avtur Jet A-1, and such development will be seriously affected, meaning bad news for aviation in this country and for the British aviation industry.</p>
	<p pid="d.119.0/4">My second point, which builds on a point that I made earlier, is about the concerns of the British Business and General Aviation Association, which represents the air taxi business, smaller airports, charter businesses and so on. It is very concerned about the impact of the proposals on its members, who are an increasingly vital part of the economy as major airports become congested. Businesses find it hugely convenient to use airfields in all our constituencies to enable them to get from A to B on the continent and to avoid the hubs, which is good for British business and for the local economy. The association told me:</p>
	<p pid="d.119.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Absolutely no detail has been forthcoming from HMT or HMRC&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="d.119.0/6">Her Majesty's Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="d.119.0/7" class="indent">&quot;about the scale of the duty calculation. It would be an absolute disaster if they simply drew a straight line based on MTOW&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="d.119.0/8">maximum take-off weight. The association continued:</p>
	<p pid="d.119.0/9" class="indent">&quot;There has to be some degree of proportionality based on the number of seats to provide a smooth transition from APD to Aviation Duty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.119.0/10">The market is seriously mobile: these people can up sticks and go somewhere else, which would be very bad news not only for the economy but for the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="d.119.0/11">I have discussed the process of collection, which will be much more complicated, and this afternoon I spoke to representatives of Farnborough airport in my constituency about the issue. Why impose another burden on that business? The airport is flourishing, so I hope that the Minister will attend to those concerns and ensure that the business aviation community is told exactly what plans the Government have for the implementation of the tax on a highly successful and enterprising part of the British economy which is vital to British interests. I hope that she will be able to do so in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="d.119.0/12">In the meantime, I hope that everybody will take note of the events next Thursday. I have been asked by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> whether the Vulcan bomber, of which I am a trustee and which I have helped restore to flight, will take part in the flypast. We hope that it will. I shall be in a smaller aeroplane in front of it, and I hope not to get overtaken by it. I hope, too, that the duty will not apply to the Vulcan, because we would just have to raise more funds from charitable sources.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-08d.122.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" speakername="John Leech" colnum="122"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081008/halltext/81008h0008.htm#08100883000552">
	<p pid="d.122.0/1">I add my congratulations to those already given to my fellow Manchester MP, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> on securing this important debate on the future of air passenger duty and its proposed replacement by aviation duty. When I found out this morning that the Treasury was responding to the debate, I thought that I had better check that I had not been transferred from the transport team to the Treasury team. I was relieved to hear that I am still a member of the transport team. However, I have been given the job of responding to this debate.</p>
	<p pid="d.122.0/2">Air passenger duty is unsustainable. It provides no incentive for airlines to invest in more efficient and less environmentally damaging aircraft, nor does it incentivise against the use of half-empty planes. Hon. Members may recall a parliamentary question to the Prime Minister of <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-16">16 July</phrase> in which the Liberal Democrat shadow Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase>, highlighted the scandals of BMI's intention to fly empty planes to keep its slots open and Flybe's hiring of actors to fly between Norwich and Dublin to boost passenger numbers. Such things are clearly not acceptable. The Liberal Democrats therefore welcomed the consultation on aviation duty, and we welcome the principle of replacing air passenger duty with aviation duty as a positive step forward in cutting carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid="d.122.0/3">Since 1990, the proportion of total UK carbon emissions coming from aviation has more than doubled from 2.5 per cent. to 5.8 per cent. Since the Government have given the green light to the expansion of airports in the aviation White Paper, emissions are due to rise by up to 83 per cent. on 2002 levels by 2020. Greenhouse gases from aviation are expected to be responsible for 25 per cent. of the UK's contribution to global warming by 2020. Bold steps must be taken to tackle that problem.</p>
	<p pid="d.122.0/4">Aviation duty is only one part of the issue. We want a cap on airport capacity in the south-east, including no expansion of Heathrow or Stansted; the inclusion of aviation in the UK emissions target in the Climate Change Bill; an additional per passenger climate change charge on domestic, non-lifeline flights in the UK; and the development of an internationally agreed aviation fuel duty. At the same time, we want to encourage domestic passengers away from flights and onto the railways. We support a new high-speed rail link to the north and beyond. I am glad to see that the Conservative party has followed our lead on that.</p>
	<p pid="d.122.0/5">The Liberal Democrats have long argued for a change to a per plane aviation duty, but we support basing that duty on the carbon emissions produced by the aircraft rather than its take-off weight. That would encourage aircraft manufacturers not only to build lighter planes, but to invest in lower-emission engine technology. Will the Minister explain why the Government favours maximum take-off weight when that will not encourage the use of newer, more environmentally friendly engines?</p>
	<p pid="d.122.0/6">Opponents of aviation duty have claimed that although it should in theory incentivise airlines to offset the cost of the tax by carrying as many passengers as possible on each flight, there will be little practical benefit, because over the past 20 years, planes have gone from being two-thirds full to three-quarters full. However, that does not take into account the sharp discrepancy between different flights and airlines, particularly between chartered flights, which are often busy and full, and scheduled services, many of which remain half full or less.</p>
	<p pid="d.122.0/7">Manchester Airport Group has expressed concern that while air passenger duty is a transparent, fixed fee that can be shown clearly on the ticket as a green tax, aviation duty will be based on a number of variables. If it is not transparent, it will be perceived as simply a stealth tax. I have some sympathy with that argument, but it could easily be overcome by ensuring that passengers or freight carriers are made aware of the aviation duty that they are paying within their ticket price.</p>
	<p pid="d.122.0/8">Concern has been expressed about the impact of including freight in aviation duty. Manchester Airport Group has suggested that that could lead to freighters introducing a stop en route from the UK so that they are taxed only for the first leg of the journey or that the UK will be bypassed altogether, with transhipments using mainland European hubs and with freight being brought to the UK by road instead. It is an anomaly that freight-only flights should have been exempt from paying a form of aviation duty, so we therefore support their inclusion. I pay tribute to the hon. Members for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) and for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) for making those arguments and countering those made by opponents of the proposal. It is vital that the air freight industry take into account the carbon cost of transporting goods by air.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-08d.129.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="129"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081008/halltext/81008h0009.htm#08100883000566">
	<p pid="d.129.1/1">The City of Westminster is one of the most complex and diverse districts in the United Kingdom. As the cultural and political hub of our capital city, it attracts a vast number of people each and every day, on top of the residential population, who either come to work in Westminster or to visit its wealth of attractions.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/2">Unsurprisingly, it is also a destination of choice for people arriving in the United Kingdom for the first time. Many plan to work for a short period before returning home, and others hope to make new, permanent lives here, but the true extent of that population is unknown. Hidden from official statistics are the asylum seekers awaiting a decision from the Home Office, countless migrant workers from the European Union who are often willing to sleep in crowded rooms, illegal immigrants working in the black economy, and of course those whose application for leave to remain has been rejected but who are yet to be removed.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/3">At 24 per cent., Westminster has had the greatest proportionate increase in population since 2001&mdash;the time of the last census&mdash;of any local authority in the United Kingdom. That tide of humanity must be catered for, but in this unique area of hyperdiversity and hypermobility it is uniquely difficult to assess its extent. That is a problem because population figures form a key part of the Government's calculations to distribute grants to local councils, as the Minister knows.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/4">Westminster city council has repeatedly warned the Government that current methods of counting migration are simply not keeping pace with modern patterns of population movement. Consequently, the council and many other areas where migration is high are locked into a three-year grant settlement, which leaves Westminster paying &pound;6 million every year for those unaccounted-for people living within its boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/5">No doubt migration will always be a sensitive issue, but the failure of the Office for National Statistics properly to measure its extent will mean London council tax payers shouldering the burden without the benefit. Unless the Government address the problem urgently, they risk losing public good will with serious consequences for the cohesion of our communities.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/6">I should point out at this stage that this is not a narrow, partisan, party political issue. I share representation of the City of Westminster with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> who sits on the Labour Benches, and we work hard together on this and a number of other local issues. It has often been at the hon. Lady's behest that we have had meetings with Ministers in years gone by.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/7">Many of the problems with population figures are attributable to the lack of a single, all-inclusive system to measure the movement of people into and out of the UK, and the absence of such a system to allocate those migrants to the place where they reside. Westminster city council's grave concern is that the population figures used by the ONS in the calculation of Westminster's grant allocation are incorrect and significantly underestimate the area's population. Consequently, the council encounters difficulties in providing the full complement of services for its residents, both permanent and temporary.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/8">No one disputes that Westminster is a particularly attractive place for migrants to work, especially as they can avoid London's travel costs and often find employment easily in the capital's service sector. Research commissioned by Westminster city council found that many choose to live in crowded accommodation, and are often classed as mid-term migrants, staying for between three and 12 months. Yet the methodology adopted by the ONS does not include in its population figures migrants who say that they intend to stay for fewer than 12 months. That omission is significant in an area such as central London, but I appreciate that it applies not only to Westminster but to one or two other local authorities. Independent research has shown that Westminster has more than 13,000 illegal migrants within its boundaries at any one time and, in addition, around 11,000 short-term migrants who are not registered in the official statistics for the reasons that I have set out.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/9">The Government are not unaware of the problem. Westminster city council has campaigned on the issue ever since the ONS was found to have missed more than 22,000 people from the 2001 census count of the borough's population. Westminster's specific case was investigated by the Statistics Commission before the UK Statistics Authority replaced it. Recommendations were made for migrant data to be improved urgently after the quality was found to be &quot;presently wholly inadequate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/10">I am afraid that no action was taken, and in May 2006 the commission had to write again to the Home Office. It concluded:</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Work by the Statistics Commission three years ago indicated that there was very wide agreement across Whitehall that statistics relating to migration, both internationally and within the UK, need urgently to be improved. But thus far we have seen little evidence of real progress being made&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/12">More worryingly, the Commission gave its original warning before the European Union's enlargement in 2004, which took in the A8 accession countries of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. The Government's colossal underestimation of the number of people arriving from those countries has been well documented, and the issue did not affect only Westminster.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/13">Local authorities have borne the brunt of service provision for the countless hundreds of thousands who came to our shores without adequate support as a result of the Government's failure to prepare. Another two countries have since been added to the EU&mdash;the A2 nations of Bulgaria and Romania acceded on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>&mdash;and the House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs acknowledged last year that</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/14" class="indent">&quot;there is currently no satisfactory source which can provide the raw information, at national and local levels, that is required for statistical purposes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/15">The ONS has recognised the difficulty of measuring Westminster's population and has expressly excluded it as a field test authority for the forthcoming 2011 census on the grounds that</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/16" class="indent">&quot;our methods might be sufficiently good enough for more typical cities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/17">The understandable fear, which the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington and I share, is that the council could again face problems at the next census and beyond, given the importance of the census figures for the calculation of grant in the decade to come.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/18">The volatility and confusion in population estimates make it almost impossible for local authorities to plan ahead with certainty. While the Government reap the rewards of migration through increased income tax and value added tax, and the higher productivity of British business, local authorities are trapped with the costs of an increased population without being given a fair share of funding. The impact on services and quality of life in areas of high migration is significant in terms of housing, community protection, schooling and adult services. In 2006-07 alone, the council incurred costs of more than &pound;1 million just for supporting people who do not even have any recourse to public funds. That represented only a fairly small proportion of the migratory flow.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/19">Many A8 migrants choose to live in private sector housing, and that has increased rents, applying further pressure to an already oversubscribed social housing market. Westminster's 2006 housing needs survey identified that increased overcrowding and household size was linked in part to a growth in houses in multiple occupation. That adds further to the acute pressures on affordable housing in an area where 44 per cent. of children already live in overcrowded accommodation. As the local Member of Parliament, I can testify to that.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/20">The two most common issues in my constituency postbag are immigration and housing, and I reckon that I receive between 10 and 20 letters a week from families either struggling to obtain council or housing association property or hoping desperately for a transfer to a larger home. Westminster city council understands their frustration, but in a high-density, urban area the supply of affordable homes simply cannot keep up with the colossal demand. The average wait for a permanent home for someone accepted on to the list today<i></i>is likely to be between four and five years. For a family in a one-bedroom property needing a two-bedroom home, the transfer wait is currently six years, and for a three-bedroom home it is seven years and eight months. For those wanting to trade up to a four-bedroom home the wait is apparently, if academically, 27 years and seven months.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/21">Furthermore, since 2004 London has seen increases in A8 migrants sleeping rough. Westminster city council has worked hard to tackle the needs of new arrivals and has worked with central Government agencies. I do not wish to offer too much criticism, because there have been significant improvements. The situation has ebbed and flowed at various times, and we have been trying to prevent nearly 400 A8 nationals from falling into long-term rough sleeping. I highlighted that work in a speech I made in this Chamber in January last year, when I warned the Government about the increasing pressure on homelessness services following the A2 enlargement of the EU; indeed, where I felt it was appropriate, I also complimented Government action.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/22">Once A2 or A8 nationals have completed 12 months' continuous employment as registered or authorised workers, if they remain in the labour market they have the same access to Jobcentre Plus services as any other citizen. The flip side of that is, of course, that Jobcentre Plus refuses to help A8 nationals to find work if they have not already been employed for that period. Those men and women rely on their local authority for support and advice and can all too often fall into homelessness, addiction and the other problems that arise in those circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/23">The Westminster drugs and alcohol team is under increasing pressure to assist clients from EU accession nations who have fallen into alcohol dependency and drug addiction. Unfortunately, the influx from A10 countries has also had an impact on the council's community protection operations. Strong evidence suggests that pockets of petty theft in the west end and persistent organised begging operations are being initiated by Romanian migrants. In fact, after several constituents complained to me specifically about aggressive begging in shopping districts, I had to raise the issue independently with City of Westminster police. The borough commander Steve Allen informed me that the police have had to put specific operations in place to combat a problem of which they are well aware.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/24">Unfortunately, begging seems to be just one arm of organised crime that originates from eastern Europe. Automated teller machine fraud is another example of such crime, which, anecdotally, the local police have told me is conducted almost exclusively by Romanian gangs. I have tabled various parliamentary questions on that matter and was informed by the Home Office that it had no idea how much crime was being committed by Romanian nationals because country of origin data are not collected or collated in the crime statistics.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/25">On education provision, short-term migration and the large number of migrants who move around the country seeking work cause significant problems in relation to the churn in schools. Such churn can leave teachers coping with a diverse class that has vastly different abilities in numeracy and literacy, and diverse cultural and language needs. Many children arrive mid-term and have no records, which has a significant administrative cost&mdash;about &pound;400 for a primary school child and &pound;800 for a secondary school child. In addition, extra support staff might be required to help migrant children with their learning and to liaise with related services. The council estimates that migrant families will contribute to a 10 per cent. increase in required school places in Westminster in the second half of this decade.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/26">Child protection can be particularly difficult because of language and cross-cultural issues when investigating migrant families. In addition, mobility tends to be high, which makes investigations into problem families both costly and time consuming. With higher than average British birth rates, migrant families will often also have a greater reliance on primary health care facilities. A general confusion over who is entitled to assistance adds to service pressures, and there is increasing concern among local authorities about their legal obligations towards destitute people from abroad who have no recourse to public funds, such as failed asylum seekers or A10 nationals who have not worked for the requisite 12 continuous months. British citizens who have lived abroad for many years may also lose their right to benefits.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/27">The obligation to support such foreign nationals with no recourse to public funds often arises as a direct result of a Home Office policy and practice, whereby support is withdrawn from failed asylum seekers, but they are not removed from the UK when their claim is finally refused. I have seen that phenomenon time and again in my constituency during the seven years I have represented it, and I am no longer surprised to find that a constituent is still writing to me many years after being told that they are to be deported and that they are still homeless, still wanting work and still desperate.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/28">The Home Office has failed to provide local authorities with adequate guidance in such circumstances to the extent that many are concerned that they might be acting ultra vires. If local authorities disregard immigration restrictions on access to public services, they may be acting outside the law; but equally, a failure to provide services where there is an entitlement could result in judicial review and a claim for damages.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/29">For obvious reasons, Westminster City council receives no funding from the Government to assist its work in supporting foreign nationals who have no recourse to public funds. That puts increasing pressure on the council's departments, particularly adult services and health, to deliver services while maintaining strict budgets. Furthermore, regardless of benefits entitlement, all migrants are entitled to use leisure and culture facilities, environmental services, join local authority-funded community groups, and have their children use local schools. Many migrants use the council's libraries and one-stop shops and their visits often take longer because of language and cultural barriers. We all want to live in a civilised society and no one can deny that it is important for such individuals to have the right to play a part in various community services, but that comes at a significant cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/30">Clearly, there needs to be a fundamental and radical reform of population measurement between each census, so that local authorities are funded appropriately for their true populations. The Government have committed extra resources&mdash;some &pound;12 million&mdash;to the improvement of population estimates and have shown an important degree of leadership in taking forward progress via the statistics improvement programme board. However, I fear that those commitments might be insufficient to bring about the reform of the population estimates envisaged by the former Statistics Commission and by some local authority users.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/31">Last September, the Statistics Commission stated in its response to the Lords Economic Affairs Select Committee that</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/32" class="indent">&quot;sample surveys, of the kind typically carried out by statistical offices, are not the answer&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/33">However, much of the work being carried out by the ONS to improve migration estimates seems to be centred on survey improvements, and if the plans to improve migration estimates are not more ambitious the council is concerned that the work being undertaken will simply replace poor data with the like. If that happens, confidence in official statistics could be irreparably damaged.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/34">Widespread concern has been aired that the ONS is simply not being adequately funded to make the improvements necessary to provide confidence in migration estimates. The Bank of England believes the ONS's move to north Wales</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/35" class="indent">&quot;poses a serious risk to the maintenance of the quality of macro-economic data.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/36">It is unfair to ask local authorities and the communities they serve to foot the bill or to suffer adverse effects to services while waiting for migration measurement to improve.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/37">So what needs to be done? In the short term, the Local Government Association wants the Government to make a contingency fund of &pound;250 million available to aid councils where migration estimates fail accurately to reflect the current population. The fund could be distributed via an agreed set of local and national administrative data, such as national insurance numbers and schools' surveys. Going further, until a resolution is found to the wider statistical problem, Westminster would like the Government to introduce specific grants to council areas that face pressures caused by short-term migration. In the longer term, the Government need to invest a significant sum of money in research to ensure that statistics produced on migration are accurate and reflect the true number of both long and short-term migrants living in Westminster and the country as a whole. There needs to be radical changes to the methodology used to estimate and measure migration movements, as migrants who intend to stay for fewer than 12 months are not yet considered in population counts. The ONS needs to be adequately funded so that skilled, experienced staff are not lost.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/38">I note that one of the Government's intentions is to introduce a transitional impacts of migration fund to build capacity in local service provision and support innovative projects from 2009-10. That response has come five years after A8 accession, and councils are still no wiser about how the fund will work and how it will be distributed around the country. The fund is unlikely to be the &pound;250 million called for by the LGA and the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and is, I fear, too little too late.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/39">In an area where there is continuous movement of short-term migrants who are regularly replaced by other short-term residents, the impact on council services is continuous. Westminster is one such area and the borough receives no extra Government funding to meet extra costs. Although that problem was highlighted after the 2001 census, it has, as I have said, been exacerbated. I accept that the issue is not just Westminster-specific, but the problem is particularly extreme in my constituency and borough. In areas across the UK where migration is high, I expect worryingly similar problems have been encountered: difficulties in educating a mobile and diverse population, difficulty in coping with extra demand on housing stock and new problems with community protection.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/40">I accept that migration will always be a contentious issue, despite the clear economic benefits of hard-working migrants coming to our country. Perceived threats to an existing settled community from new arrivals will serve only to increase those tensions. Unfortunately, unless the Government properly fund local authorities, such threats may come to fruition.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/41">I sent my speech to the Minister, so he is well aware of some of these issues. I apologise for taking slightly more than my allotted 15 minutes, but I wanted to put some of the issues on the record. Having had sight of my speech, he will perhaps be able to reply not just in this debate but to Westminster city council at a later stage. With the 2011 census only three years away, I call on the Minister to take urgent action to ensure that the Government get their house in order and reform the collection of vital population data.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-08d.138.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="138"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081008/halltext/81008h0010.htm#08100883000569">
	<p pid="d.138.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this important debate, which follows on from previous debates that the Minister has had with me and many other Members. The issues that I intend to raise today are not necessarily specific to my constituency, although I shall mention some issues that arise there. I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Caton, and to have the opportunity to debate the subject again with the Minister, who has been very generous in offering advice. However, as I shall say in a moment, I hope that he will be less constrained today than he was in yesterday's debate in Westminster Hall, when we debated the regional spatial strategy for the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/2">The subject of affordable housing presents a vast and varied picture, but I want to address to two aspects of it. The first relates very much to yesterday's debate. The canvas on which we paint our response to the need for affordable housing clearly has to be the existing planning and housing strategies. The regional spatial strategy obviously has a significant impact on the ability of local authorities to respond.</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/3">Secondly, I want to reflect on the impact of the present financial crisis, particularly in relation to today's announcement about the bank rescue package, and especially the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable people. In response to interventions during his speech yesterday, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Let me get to the very heart of my response. As the House is aware, owing to the quasi-judicial role of the Secretary of State in this matter, I am very limited in what I can say... there is clear guidance for Ministers, based on advice from the Law Officers and first Treasury counsel. A copy of the guidance can be found&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/5">and so on. The Minister then said:</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The guidance states that Ministers should not enter into discussions with interested parties&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2008-10-07.46"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 7 October 2008; Vol. 480, c. 46WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/7">I checked the guidance myself. There are two versions, but the one to which the Minister referred&mdash;as he properly said in our previous debate, it was produced prior to the Secretary of State's proposed changes to the regional spatial strategy&mdash;clearly constrains Ministers. That is clear as far as those stages of the development of the regional spatial strategy are concerned. However, paragraph 17 of the document on guidance to which he referred states:</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/8" class="indent">&quot;However, such discussions can take place once the Secretary of State has published her proposed changes for consultation, so long as a formal note for the file is kept of any such discussion which is made publicly available.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/9">I should have thought that <i>Hansard</i> was a pretty good note, and it is certainly publicly available.</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/10">I hope that the Minister will feel less constrained today than he did yesterday, in view of my reading of the advice in that guidance. Perhaps we can look a little more carefully at some of the points that I raised in a debate on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-25">25 June</phrase>, and clarify the extent to which the regional spatial strategy is the product of the collective will&mdash;the desire of the population in the Government zones, in this case, of the south-west&mdash;or that of the Government. Does he agree that the lessons of the past, particularly trend-based projections, should inform the production of the strategy? Does he accept that many of the unique challenges faced by the Isles of Scilly that I mentioned in that previous debate are shared in other areas?</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/11">If one wanted to create a new structure of unaccountability, the regional spatial strategy would certainly be a good model on which to base it. First, it is not based on a region that has its own internal integrity or community of interest. It is obviously a bureaucratic construct for bureaucratic convenience, and it is served by an assembly that is not directly or democratically elected. It is a relatively flimsy, remote and permissive body, and it is about to be disbanded. It suffers all the constraints of being an agent of the Government rather than being able to make decisions with the latitude that one would expect of a body that was able to draw up a regional strategy.</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/12">The response from local authorities and others to the process that has led to the current state of affairs shows that, for a number of justifiable reasons, the proposed changes are inappropriate. For instance, they give too much weight to trend-based projections of household growth when compared with other planning considerations such as the impact on settlement character and infrastructure, and the need to balance housing with job growth. They are based on projections and a distribution that lack adequate evidence and justification. They also contradict other Government policies on the environment and climate change that give justifiable protection to other areas under other planning polices.</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/13">As I pointed out in a previous debate, if people wanted a classic example of how trend-based projections do not work but become part of the problem rather than the solution, they should come to Cornwall and see what has happened there over the past 40 years. Our housing stock has more than doubled over that period. Cornwall and its people cannot be criticised for being nimbys. Because of the imposition of trend-based projections and as a result of following them through, we have permitted and even encouraged development; in fact the area has the third-fastest growth in the United Kingdom. However, the housing problems of local people have become significantly worse.</p>
	<p pid="d.138.1/14">One conclusion that we can draw from that example is that growth has been relatively unsustainable. The sheer rate of change has created real problems in many parts of Cornwall, and it has been difficult for the infrastructure of the place to keep pace with the changes. Having allowed it to happen, the real question is whether the building of all those houses has added to the problem. It certainly has not addressed our housing needs. Perhaps we should take a more sophisticated approach. Perhaps local authorities in Cornwall should enter into a dialogue with the Government rather than simply allowing things to carry on.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-10-08d.140.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="140"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081008/halltext/81008h0011.htm#08100883000571">
	<p pid="d.140.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention, and I am aware of the interesting &quot;Home on the Farm&quot; initiative. I hope that he will send a copy of it to the Minister, as it could provide a solution, particularly in remote rural areas</p>
	<p pid="d.140.0/2">Although farmers and landowners in my constituency and in my hon. Friend's constituency are paragons of rectitude and virtue, and one can rely on them without having to surround them with all the covenants and legal restrictions of section 106 obligations to achieve genuine affordable housing in perpetuity for local people on their land, sadly that is probably not the case in the rest of the country. The one thing that we need to do in the proposal is ensure&mdash;this is a belt-and-braces approach&mdash;that public good results from any permission that is granted on those farm buildings. That needs to be enshrined in the proposal, because, as my hon. Friend knows&mdash;it is also true in my constituency&mdash;when redundant farm buildings such as barns become available, planning authorities, applying existing planning law, will allow them to be converted for holiday accommodation, but not to meet local housing need. In fact, there is a way forward. It does not require an Einstein to propose allowing such developments, even if they are not attached to the local community, which is to say within reach of a local shop, bus service or school. Many local families could benefit from the kind of accommodation that my hon. Friend described. I hope that I have endorsed what he said, and that he will continue to pursue the matter.</p>
	<p pid="d.140.0/3">As was mentioned in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-25">25 June</phrase>, the RSS does not apply to the Isles of Scilly in the same way that it does to mainland Cornwall. There is no attempt to apply proportionately the Government's target of 3 million homes by 2026 to the islands. In effect, the RSS says that it is a local-need-only housing development plan for the period. However, I question the justification for giving the islands what is effectively a locals-only development constraint&mdash;although it is right that it does&mdash;when that is not extended to other areas that experience the same problems.</p>
	<p pid="d.140.0/4">I believe that I have demonstrated that the Minister is less constrained than he was in yesterday's debate. Does he accept that it is reasonable to advance the debate about the ownership of the document and the process as I did earlier? Does he agree that the lessons of the past are relevant, especially regarding trend-based projections of population growth and housing need, and that the RSS should be a plan with internal integrity and not simply a hotch-potch or collation of Government-imposed targets? Will he explain why the challenges of meeting affordable housing need on mainland Cornwall do not apply to the Isles of Scilly?</p>
	<p pid="d.140.0/5">In the light of today's announcement of the bank rescue package, what progress have the Government made to provide a rescue package for those at the bottom of the housing ladder, who are suffering most from the impact of the credit crunch and the current financial instability? I ask that question, bearing in mind that just the other day, there were 50 repossessions in court in Penzance, as reported in the papers. Apart from the Bank of England's special liquidity scheme, which was announced in April, the Government have clearly indicated a desire to act. I congratulate them on announcing initiatives, but it is a question of applying them. I am talking about the rent-to-buy pilot, the new shared equity and mortgage rescue schemes, financial advice and assistance, extra money for registered social landlords, purchase schemes of private, developer-led developments that cannot proceed for whatever reason, and the housing private financing initiative.</p>
	<p pid="d.140.0/6">Other organisations have made proposals. The National Housing Federation has proposed that housing associations develop their own mortgage rescue packages to assist those who face difficulties, and the purchase of unstarted, started and complete private developments. Shelter has proposed better information and advice provision for those who are in arrears and face repossession. It also said that the Government and the Financial Services Authority needs to be tougher on irresponsible lenders who are all too ready to take repossession action; needs to regulate private mortgage rescue sale and leaseback schemes; and introduce a pre-action protocol for mortgage arrears in court to ensure that repossession is a measure of last resort; and look again at income support for mortgage interest.</p>
