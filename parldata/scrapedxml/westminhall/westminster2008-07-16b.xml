</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.67.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" speakername="Gordon Prentice" colnum="67"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0001.htm#08071682000410">
	<p pid="b.67.2/1">I welcome the opportunity to debate road safety and young drivers. My friends the Members for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) and for Rossendale and Darwen (Janet Anderson) are expected to attend the debate, and I am sure that we shall be joined later by other colleagues from east Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.2/2">I congratulate the Minister, and the Government, on their record on road safety. We learn from the latest statistics that road deaths have fallen below 3,000 a year for the first time since records began in 1926. What an astonishing achievement. The figures published a few weeks ago show that the number of people killed in road accidents fell by 7 per cent. between 2006 and 2007. The long-term trend shows steadily reducing numbers of people being killed or seriously injured on our roads. Our roads, amazingly, are now eight times safer than in 1966. Road design plays its part, although we all know of killer stretches in our constituencies. Cars are designed much better than they were; universally, they have air bags. We have had Government initiatives over the years on drink-driving and &quot;Clunk-click every trip&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.2/3">Those campaigns have made a real difference. They have made us all more safety-conscious. However, one group stands out as an exception: young drivers. A fifth of all new drivers have an accident within six months of passing their test, and a staggering 70 per cent. report near misses in the same period. I am stating the obvious, but most new drivers are young. About three quarters of all new drivers are under 25. Young drivers are rarely out of the news. Only last week we saw on television the news of the tragic deaths of six young people in Leicestershire after their car ploughed into a 38-tonne lorry on a notoriously dangerous stretch of road near Melton Mowbray.</p>

	<p pid="b.67.3/1">The accident was in north-east Leicestershire, and I represent North-West Leicestershire, not far away. I am sure that my hon. Friend will be careful to say that we do not yet know, in relation to the inquest, whether the lorry ploughed into the car or the car ploughed into the lorry. It is an indicative circumstance that the accident happened in the small hours of the morning. A factor that we need to take into account, whether or not it was relevant to the accident in question, or whether there were other factors, is that although only 6 per cent. of licence-holders are under the age of 25, they account for almost a third of relevant deaths and serious injuries&mdash;albeit that the figure for those has now fallen below 3,000 a year. We need to do something. The Government have a good track record and the Minister has an excellent one, but more is needed, urgently. The carnage among young people, particularly young male drivers, is appalling.</p>

	<p pid="b.68.3/1">I do not know the circumstances and will not venture into speculation about what happened in Leicestershire.

	<p pid="b.68.4/1">The hon. Gentleman will be aware that tragically, about 14 young people are killed on our roads every week, and that young people between 17 and 20 years old are 10 times more likely to have a serious injury or be involved in an accident that results in death than him or me. Does he think that the Government should now act, in the way the Select Committee on Transport suggested, to restrict the ability of young drivers in that age group to carry other young passengers at certain times of day? Would not that save many lives each year?</p>

	<p pid="b.68.5/1">Yes; I am coming on to that. It is true that young people feature disproportionately in accidents. The Transport Committee got it right when it recommended in July last year that there should be a graduated licence scheme. I am pleased to see in the Chamber the new Chair of the Transport Committee, my friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" name="Louise Ellman">the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)</phrase>, who succeeded our illustrious friend the late Gwyneth Dunwoody.</p>

	<p pid="b.68.6/1">Is the hon. Gentleman aware that for the period 1981 to 2004, the most common cause of death in Britain for people aged between five and 35 was motor vehicle accidents, whereas for people dying after the age of 35 it was heart attack and chronic heart disease? Does he agree that road safety should be treated as a health issue as well as a transport issue?</p>

	<p pid="b.68.7/1">Mr. Hancock, my script has been stolen&mdash;I must not give way again&mdash;but I am coming to that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.7/2">I have mentioned the accidents that happen in our constituencies, and it certainly has a resonance for me when I drive around my constituency of Pendle&mdash;a large one as constituencies go&mdash;and pass roadside shrines with flowers and cards, or sometimes a football strip pinned to a tree. Even when the flowers have gone and the cards have blown away I still remember what happened. The stories that appeared in local papers are fixed in my head when I drive past the tree stump or the fence that is leaning at an angle of 30&deg;. I remember what happened there in the place where young people died.</p>

	<p pid="b.68.8/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. Does he agree with the general conclusions of the Transport Committee on this matter: we are dealing with unnecessary carnage and tragedy, and the solution is a combination of methods, including attitude changing, skills acquisition and possible restrictions on where and how young new drivers can drive their vehicles?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.69.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" speakername="Gordon Prentice" colnum="69"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0001.htm#08071682000421">
	<p pid="b.69.0/1">Yes, I agree with the Chair of the Transport Committee. Unfortunately the Government are not prepared to countenance restrictions, and I think that that is a major problem. I am gratified that they have published what is in effect a consultation&mdash;and I hope that the contributions made in this debate will form part of the listening exercise that will inform their conclusions&mdash;but the decision was a big mistake. It is not as if the Government did not see it coming, because the Transport Committee made it very clear in its excellent report on novice drivers in July 2007 that that was what it wanted.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/2">Road accidents, to deal with the point made a few moments ago, are, as we know, the biggest killer of 15 to 24-year-olds, and more than 14 drivers and their passengers are killed on our roads every week. The Transport Committee put it starkly:</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/3" class="indent">&quot;young male drivers are now the biggest killer of young women in this country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/4">Young men&mdash;I should say &quot;some young men&quot;&mdash;behind the wheel are a menace to themselves and others.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/5">I congratulate the Library on the excellent paper that it produced for this debate, but that paper told us only what we already suspected: young drivers have a high number of crashes when driving at night and on weekends, and when carrying young passengers. We know that as a fact. The early hours of the morning are the worst. I am sorry to bombard colleagues with statistics, but the statistics make the case. Male drivers aged between 17 and 20 have 17 times more risk of having an accident between 2 o'clock and 5 o'clock in the morning than all male drivers. Half of all accidents involving young people happen at night. I am listening to myself speak, and it sounds as though I am demonising young people. I am not; I am drawing attention to the facts of driving life as they affect young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/6">Young people aged between 17 and 20 are more likely to be in a crash where only their vehicle is involved. Here is a fascinating statistic: the probability that a young driver will have an accident is 39 per cent. higher if there is another young person in the car with them. The probability is 85 per cent. higher if there are two or more young passengers, and 182 per cent. higher if there are three or more, geeing on the driver. I do not know what it is&mdash;a rush of adrenalin or a macho thing&mdash;but the drivers lose control.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.69.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" speakername="Paul Flynn" colnum="69"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0001.htm#08071682000422">
	<p pid="b.69.1/1">It is not demons; it is adolescence and testosterone that lead to accidents. Thirty years ago, when I became the chairman of the Transport Committee, I discovered to my astonishment that there were more fatal accidents on one relatively quiet road between Newport and Usk than on all the other roads in the county, because of a popular club on that road. The combination of Saturday night, young men and alcohol has been killing our young people for a long time. I warmly congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate about the most obvious cause of avoidable road accidents. We need radical reforms.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.70.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" speakername="Gordon Prentice" colnum="70"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0001.htm#08071682000423">
	<p pid="b.70.0/1">I am in total agreement with my friend. Road safety is rarely out of the news, as he will know. Only yesterday, the chief medical officer said, acknowledging that it was controversial, that there should effectively be a zero drink limit for young drivers. We know that 35 per cent. of drink-drivers involved in accidents in 2005 were aged between 17 and 25. That is more than a third of all those involved in drink-drive accidents.</p>

	<p pid="b.70.4/1">I do not want to demonise young people, but I dare say that it is a question not just of drink but of drugs as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.4/2">Material published recently by Brake, the road safety charity, tells me that one in three young drivers admits to overtaking when they cannot see what is coming. That slapped me in the face and made me think. I thought about what Gwyneth Dunwoody said in this very place in February this year. She said that young drivers&mdash;she meant young male drivers&mdash;think that they are invincible. They may think that they are invincible, but they are not.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.4/3">The Government produced a consultation paper in 2001 that discussed driver attitudes, to which my friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside alluded. The consultation paper said:</p>
	<p pid="b.70.4/4" class="indent">&quot;The frequency with which novice drivers report...exceeding the speed limit, driving through a red or amber traffic light, and driving too close to the vehicle in front...strongly predicts the accident liability for both male and female drivers. These drivers tend to be young, male and high mileage drivers. They consider themselves better drivers than others and believe that bad consequences are less likely to result from their actions, and that they will be less serious if they do.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.70.4/5">That is the mindset: &quot;It's not going to happen to me, and if it does, it'll just be a little scrape.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.70.4/6">There is a problem. The question is: what are we going to do about it? The Government have published a consultation paper, &quot;Learning to Drive&quot;, which I have in front of me. It was published in May, and it is out for consultation until <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-08">8 September</phrase>. When it was published, the Minister told me of the Government's general line. He said that the Government's</p>
	<p pid="b.70.4/7" class="indent">&quot;proposed approach is one based on education and incentivisation, rather than restriction...We believe the evidence supports this approach&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.4/8">I am not entirely sure that it does. I reread the Transport Committee's report on novice drivers. The evidence submitted by the Department for Transport to the Committee said:</p>
	<p pid="b.70.4/9" class="indent">&quot;There is little research evidence that increased formal driver training improves safety.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.70.4/10">Obviously, formal training makes a difference&mdash;I am not suggesting that it does not&mdash;but it must be part of a basket of measures if we are to bring down the terrible toll of carnage on our roads.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.0/1">My hon. Friend is correct in pointing to a section of the Committee's report that referred to a particular type of training, but the Committee also recommended that there should be a change in how the driving test is conducted, and that it should be possible to pass the test only if the driver has experience of driving in a wide range of conditions. That was an important part of our report.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.71.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" speakername="Gordon Prentice" colnum="71"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0001.htm#08071682000429">
	<p pid="b.71.1/1">Indeed. The Government have listened to much of what the Transport Committee said, and I do not want to suggest otherwise. What is my position? I want conditional or graduated driving licences that prohibit night-time driving, driving with passengers or driving on the motorway until competence is built up over time.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.1/2">I am a bit of a hard-liner in my views on this issue, unlike other issues. I want the effective driving age to be raised to 18. I am not alone in thinking that. The British School of Motoring, which was very interested in speaking to me yesterday when it found out that I had secured this debate, calls for a graduated licensing scheme, with &quot;P&quot; licence plates displayed on the vehicle during the probationary period.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.2/1">If the Government are not keen on graduated driving licences, could the insurance industry take a lead? There was a pilot for &quot;pay as you drive&quot; insurance discouraging evening driving by young people and allowing them to have lower premiums. Young people are often discouraged from driving by high premiums because they are such a high risk. If the insurance companies were to introduce &quot;pay as you drive&quot; insurance to restrict evening and night driving, and driving with passengers at night, they could reduce premiums and the number of accidents.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.3/1">Indeed, but it raises the question: how would that be enforced to prevent people from driving without insurance and so on and so forth? The Government propose publishing another consultation document shortly on the enforcement of driving regulations. However, it is true that the industry is looking very closely at the hon. Gentleman's main suggestion, and I think that it will tailor its premiums to advantage those categories of drivers less likely to have an accident. I think the consultation paper picks up on that, and I know the Government are working closely with the insurance industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.3/2">I do not know how young people afford some of these premiums&mdash;of &pound;1,000 and &pound;1,200.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.5/1">Indeed. I just do not know how they afford it. But they do&mdash;they get the money from somewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.5/2">Before the Member intervened on me I was talking about graduated licensing, which is not unheard of. Some states in the US have such licences, as too do Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Finland, France and even Northern Ireland. There is a template, and we can see how it works overseas. It does not need to be piloted. We know that it works to bring down road deaths.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.5/3">I mentioned Gwyneth Dunwoody earlier, who spoke in this Chamber on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-07">7 February</phrase> about her report on novice drivers. Her Committee called for some restrictions on new drivers, but unfortunately those recommendations were rejected by the Government. Her Committee also wanted restrictions on novice drivers carrying passengers aged between 10 and 20 between 11 o'clock at night and 5 o'clock in the morning, which sounds draconian, but as we know from the facts that is when many accidents take place.</p>

	<p pid="b.72.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate on an important issue in our part of east Lancashire, as we know from the <i>Lancashire Telegraph </i>campaign. He is now moving on to other types of restrictions, but can he confirm that as well as the graduated licences, some of those restrictions are in place in other countries?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.72.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" speakername="Gordon Prentice" colnum="72"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0001.htm#08071682000435">
	<p pid="b.72.1/1">Indeed. I was making the point that we can look to sister democracies&mdash;Canada is a very good example&mdash;to see what was advocated by the Transport Committee actually working.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/2">The Committee called for the minimum age for holding a full driving licence to be raised to 18, with which I agree. When Gwyneth was here, she said that if people flouted the rules, which they do, there should be harsh penalties including forfeiture&mdash;the car being taken away. If I had my way, it would be squashed to the size of 1 sq m and handed back to the person. There must be a real deterrent.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/3">I shall finish with a few words about what is happening in east Lancashire, where the Transport Committee's recommendations were very widely welcomed, most notably by the major regional daily, the <i>Lancashire Telegraph, </i>which covers a sub-region of 500,000. When it speaks, people listen&mdash;I am not saying that because there is a reporter from the <i>Telegraph </i>behind me. Even the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor listens. The wasted lives campaign was launched in April 2007 and has been going ever since. I put a question to my Friend the Minister about fatalities in east Lancashire, the statistics for which are probably as bad as, and perhaps even worse than, elsewhere in the country. He told me that, between 2000 and 2006, there were 22 male fatalities and three female fatalities resulting from accidents involving a young male driver&mdash;21 years old or under. However, where the car was driven by a young woman, there were no male fatalities and only one female fatality. That underlines the difference that gender makes. The problem is not with young women, but almost exclusively with young men.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/4">The <i>Lancashire Telegraph </i>called for a new approach, and its campaign was supported by all my colleagues from east Lancashire&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase>, who could not be here this morning, and my Friends the Members for Hyndburn, for Rossendale and Darwen, for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) and the Justice Secretary. I hope that I have not missed anyone out. The Justice Secretary is an influential man in the Government, and I want him to press the case with the Transport Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/5">A couple of months ago I had lunch with the editor of the <i>Lancashire Telegraph</i>, and I asked him how the wasted lives campaign began. He said that&mdash;these are my words, not his&mdash;he just got sickened and appalled, and dreaded going into the office on a Monday morning knowing that the paper would have to report some terrible carnage that had occurred on the roads in east Lancashire. It was his and his colleagues' job to write them up. These are the kind of headlines that he was talking about: &quot;Man, 24, dies in crash: garage worker battled to save trapped driver&quot;, &quot;Another Friday night, another senseless car crash&quot;, &quot;Not Again&quot;, &quot;It ruins lives&quot;&mdash;so it goes on. It is an endless stream of horror stories.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/6">The six MPs in east Lancashire are all signed up to the <i>Lancashire Telegraph </i>campaign, and have been reported and quoted in the paper as saying so. We, the <i>Telegraph </i>and the people of east Lancashire want graduated licences in two parts. Part one could be granted at age 17, but with restrictions, so that a 17-year-old could not drive on a motorway without an instructor, would have to adhere to a 50 mph maximum on all other roads, and could only drive cars limited to 80 bhp&mdash;brake horsepower&mdash;which I am told is something like a Ford Focus. Furthermore, crucially, these young people could not drive with passengers aged between 10 and 25 until they passed part two, which would be taken a year later at age 18. We think that the effective age at which a full driving licence can be held should be 18.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/7">Under our proposals, drivers aged under 25 would not be able to drive between 10 pm and 6 am until they had passed the two parts of that test, unless they were supervised by a driver aged over 25. Furthermore, the probationary plates that I mentioned earlier would be mandatory. After passing part two, drivers would be restricted to a Ford Focus equivalent car and would not be allowed to carry passengers between 10 pm and 6 am for another two years. That might sound draconian, but tragedy has touched so many families in east Lancashire that we need such measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/8">I conclude with this thought&mdash;never a day goes by without something happening in the road safety sphere. We found out yesterday that new sentencing guidelines are to be issued and that there will be two new offences: causing death by careless driving and causing death by driving while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured. Those offences are long overdue, and I hope that the Government bring them in soon. We have to get real about dangerous driving and careless driving, and I very much hope that the Government will think again.</p>

	<p pid="b.73.1/1">It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to contribute to today's debate with you in the Chair, Mr. Hancock. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> on securing the debate. As he has said, road safety, particularly in relation to young drivers, is especially important. We have already heard many relevant statistics, but I am afraid that I shall mention a few of them again, because as the hon. Gentleman said, they bear repetition and make one think about the scale of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/2">According to the Department for Transport, in 2006&mdash;the last year for which figures are available&mdash;2,943 people were killed on Britain's roads, 27,777 were seriously injured and 217,060 were slightly injured. Although I am extremely pleased that road deaths have fallen below 3,000 for the first time since 1926, there is no room for complacency. Members on both sides of the House will agree that there is still much to be done. In the last year for which statistics are available, almost 250,000 people, including more than 3,000 children, were killed or were seriously injured and had to face the trauma and consequences of road accidents.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/3">The comments that we have heard so far show that this is not a simple issue. We do not want to demonise all young people, and they are not all the same, just as all middle-aged people are not the same&mdash;as this House can testify. The latest consultation appears to give us a way forward that is, broadly speaking, worthy of support, but there is no simple, magic solution or one, central way forward to these problems. We have to accept that some people will always drive recklessly, whatever the Government try to do, and that there will always be people who simply do not think or care about the lives of others around them. It is important to acknowledge that accidents just happen sometimes, but we live in a society in which, increasingly, someone always has to be to blame for a problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/4">None of that detracts from the fact that more can and should be done to tackle this problem. The statistics that we have heard so much about show that young drivers are involved in more accidents than any other group of driver. One in eight car drivers is under 25, but one in four drivers who died on the roads in 2006 was under 25. So, although road deaths and injuries have fallen by a third since the mid-'90s, casualty rates for young drivers, particularly young male drivers, have not changed at all in that period. The numbers are not small. One in five car deaths on British roads involves newly qualified drivers and their passengers. I do not think that it has been acknowledged yet that newly qualified drivers are not always young drivers. In the spirit of not wanting to demonise all young people, let me point out that that statistic, which equates to more than 300 deaths a year, concerns all newly qualified drivers and their passengers.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/5">There is no doubt that inexperience at any age is a big factor. According to DFT figures, 20 per cent. of all new drivers have an accident within six months of passing their driving test, but that is not to say&mdash;it is important to restate this&mdash;that all novice or young drivers are poor drivers. On the contrary, we are talking about the minority, and possibly a small minority, of young, novice drivers who take unnecessary risks.</p>

	<p pid="b.74.0/1">We might, as the hon. Gentleman says, be talking about a minority of drivers, but the statistics show that there is a very high incidence of deaths of young male drivers&mdash;and, often, their passengers&mdash;against a background of generally falling accidents. Does not he accept the need to single out that particular phenomenon for special attention?</p>

	<p pid="b.74.1/1">I certainly do not demur from what the hon. Lady says, and that point will be brought out in my comments. Part of the influence behind my comments today is the fact that, like many of us, I speak as a parent. I have a 19-year old boy who has not yet passed his test and a 21-year-old girl who has. These issues can be of great personal concern to hon. Members, as well to society as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="b.75.0/1">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> made a magnificent 30-minute speech, but was unable to include the potential for pass plus, the agency's suggestion for newly qualified drivers, and the possibility of using probationary or &quot;P&quot; plates to indicate to other road users a recently gained driving licence. Does the hon. Gentleman think that those ideas have any significant potential, or will they work only if made mandatory?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.75.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" speakername="Mark Hunter" colnum="75"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0002.htm#08071682000441">
	<p pid="b.75.1/1">Like the hon. Member for Pendle, I am beginning to think that my speech must have been stolen in advance. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, and I shall come to that point shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/2">As I was saying before the hon. Lady's intervention, this issue concerns a small minority of young and novice drivers who take unnecessary risks. We should recognise that the majority of such drivers want to abide by the rules, drive safely and enjoy the freedom that comes with driving. The problem that faces young drivers is that they are often hampered by a lack of adequate training and by their own inexperience. The driving test&mdash;and, indeed, driving lessons&mdash;focuses too much on controlling and manoeuvring the vehicle, whatever it might be, and not enough on driving independently and in different hazardous conditions. We need to ensure that young drivers are taught properly and gain the experience that will allow them to enjoy the independence that driving brings. We need to help them to drive consistently and safely in all conditions&mdash;particularly, as has been discussed, at night, when driving conditions can be very different.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/3">An overhaul of the driving test and learning system is long overdue, and the proposals in the Government's learning to drive consultation, which aims to change the way in which young people learn and are tested, is a good start. Let me say that very clearly: it is a firm step in the right direction, but my concern is that it is does not yet go far enough. I certainly welcome the Government's proposal to include a broader syllabus for the driving test, including a section on independent driving, but I remain concerned that, while the new syllabus includes driving at night and in unpleasant weather conditions, the consultation does not mention whether those skills will be tested in the new exam. It would be useful if the Minister clarified that point later.</p>

	<p pid="b.75.2/1">The Transport Committee's report concluded that improving skills would not result in any necessary improvement, because, often, the drivers are more skilled and their reactions are swifter than those of an older age. The heart of the problem lies in the characteristics of being an adolescent, having an audience in the car and alcohol. Improvement of skills, on which I am sure the organisations that train young drivers are very keen, does not result in reduced accidents.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.75.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" speakername="Mark Hunter" colnum="75"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0002.htm#08071682000443">
	<p pid="b.75.3/1">I am grateful for the intervention and I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but whatever the subject that we might discuss, and on this subject, whatever stage one is at individually, one can always improve one's skills, and I do not see why that should apply any less to younger people than it might to people of our age group. When we get to a point in life at which we think that we can no longer improve, whether on our reaction times or on our skills in any sense, that is a pretty poor lookout. We should still aim to improve our skills. It is not the key to, or the only part of, the problem, but it plays a part and it is worthy of attention.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.76.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" speakername="Paul Flynn" colnum="76"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0002.htm#08071682000444">
	<p pid="b.76.0/1">It is important that we nail that particular blind alley, because it is not a solution. The Transport Committee said that</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/2" class="indent">&quot;a reformed education and training framework will instil a more responsible approach to driving&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/3">but,</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/4" class="indent">&quot;there exists little evidence that this will be adequate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/5">It is not the way ahead. We need some of what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> called reforms, which we have been crying out for over many years, not improved training, which will have very little effect.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.76.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" speakername="Mark Hunter" colnum="76"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0002.htm#08071682000445">
	<p pid="b.76.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his second intervention. I did hear the point the first time. For the Minister's benefit, I simply repeat my point that the new syllabus, which the consultation sets out, includes driving at night and in poor weather conditions, and my question to him was about whether there are proposals to incorporate those in the driving test.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/2">Another proposed change that the consultation has not yet touched on is the student workbook, which is intended to track the progress of new drivers. It seems a good idea in theory, but the proposal is to make it entirely voluntary, so I wonder whether the Government have estimated the likelihood of students completing the book if it is introduced as a voluntary measure. If the idea is worth doing at all, we should probably regulate it and make it a compulsory part of the scheme, and again, if the Minister could refer to that in his response, I would be very interested in his answer. The workbook is a good idea. Students will have to complete certain tasks under supervision, including driving at night&mdash;a problem to which we have already referred. But should the workbook be entirely voluntary, and do we think that there will be sufficient take-up?</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/3">The available figures&mdash;many of which we have already heard about&mdash;prove that allowing drivers on the road with little or no experience of driving at night or in adverse weather conditions can be a fatal mistake, so I agree with the Transport Committee's report, which says that for all age groups, we need a much more carefully regulated and better organised system for learning to drive. The Government should look again at introducing a minimum learning period and a minimum number of lessons with a qualified instructor, including some lessons that would take place after the driving test had been passed.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/4">The debate has highlighted across the piece that we are striving to reach a fine balance between ensuring that young adults, specifically, young males, can drive safely and that the costs, not just financially but generally, are not too onerous. On the financial considerations, young drivers can currently spend anything up to &pound;1,500 to obtain a full driving licence. I should put that into context by pointing out, with some feeling, that if that person is a university student, the figure represents almost half the cost of one year's tuition. We must recognise that, for many people, the figure is prohibitively expensive, and we need to look for other ways of helping to ensure that young drivers have good driving tuition.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/5">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire mentioned the pass plus scheme, which I understand local authorities in Wales and Scotland subsidise, so will the Minister say whether there have been any discussions about extending it and encouraging local authorities in England to do the same? It would be a useful step forward in trying to combat the problem.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.77.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="77"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0002.htm#08071682000446">
	<p pid="b.77.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way and for raising the point that I put to him a moment ago. When the Minister replies about the possibility of English local authorities acting similarly to those in Wales and Scotland, does the hon. Gentleman hope that the Minister will mention what the statistics suggest both about the scheme's success, and about the accident rates that are associated with the young drivers who undertake the pass plus training that the hon. Gentleman and I both think is very helpful?</p>

	<p pid="b.77.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his further intervention. I agree absolutely and encourage the Minister to spell out more precisely the Government's attitude. There is consensus, it is a very worthwhile scheme and there is a genuine point of interest about whether it can be extended throughout England, given its success in Scotland and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.1/2">I agree with many comments today in favour of the graduated licence. Although I acknowledge that there are some concerns that it might create a punitive system for all young drivers, we must face the facts that the system would protect all drivers, including young and novice drivers. In particular, I support the Transport Committee's recommendation that novice drivers be classed as such, and the proposal that they indicate their status on their vehicle seems sensible. We already have a voluntary system, and giving surrounding drivers warning that a novice is driving the vehicle in front or behind would be helpful to everybody on the road. Have the advantages been considered of making the P-plate scheme compulsory for one year after a driving test? It is currently optional, but there is a lot of support for compulsion, and it would be a small step in the right direction, making other drivers aware that they were driving in proximity to a new or probationary driver.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.1/3">We have heard that drink-driving is still a massive problem on Britain's roads, with the latest figures showing that 17 per cent. of all road deaths occur when someone has been driving under the influence of alcohol. We all know that it is a particular problem among young drivers, and the Department for Transport says that drivers aged 17 to 19 years old are 10 times as likely to have a drink-drive crash as all other ages, but I must say&mdash;this will not go down well with every Member who has contributed to the debate&mdash;that I am not yet convinced that it means that we should lower the alcohol limit to zero for young and novice drivers.</p>

	<p pid="b.77.3/1">If the hon. Gentleman will just let me make my point, I will allow him to intervene. Although I appreciate the motivation behind that suggestion, it seems to me that there is a danger that we could criminalise young people who might have consumed just a little alcohol, perhaps with a meal, and it would be wrong for them to be criminalised or stigmatised, just as it would be wrong to criminalise or stigmatise anybody else for doing the same thing.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.3/2">Our view would be that a better idea is to call for a reduction in the drink-drive limit for all drivers, to bring it into line with most of the rest of Europe. That would be a reduction from 80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood to 50 mg.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.3/3">On that point, I will give way to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.78.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="78"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0002.htm#08071682000450">
	<p pid="b.78.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, and I agree most strongly with his point that we should not make an exception for young people in relation to alcohol limits for driving, because the statistics indicate, and my own experience bears them out, that younger drivers in a generality are more likely to take a very strict attitude to alcohol before they drive; they are much more likely to do so than some males in older age groups. So we must be careful on this issue.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.78.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" speakername="Mark Hunter" colnum="78"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0002.htm#08071682000451">
	<p pid="b.78.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention; I am pleased to see that we are at one on that particular point.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/2">My suggestion to reduce the drink-drive limit for everyone from 80 mg to 50 mg is backed up by independently collected statistics. Hon. Members may be aware that University college in London has done some detailed research on this issue and it estimates that the proposed reduction could prevent up to 65 deaths and 230 injuries each year. So I think that the facts speak for themselves in support of that reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/3">Finally, we should not forget the very important role that the insurance companies can play in incentivising and encouraging young drivers to get as much training and experience as possible, and rewarding them for doing so. It seems to me that, at the moment, the insurance companies charge young people, especially young male drivers, very substantial premiums; I speak with some knowledge on this subject. I would welcome details about the Government's work, which I know is going on, to encourage insurance companies to reduce premiums for those drivers who can demonstrate that they have had more training and more development. Again, I invite the Minister to comment further on how far the Government's discussions with insurance companies are progressing and to say when we might be likely to see such incentives come into place.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/4">So I believe that the problem of young and novice drivers, particularly young male drivers, is a serious issue and it needs a serious solution. The consultation paper proposed by the Government is useful; it is certainly a step in the right direction and it will undoubtedly help. However, I am not entirely convinced that it goes far enough quickly enough. Frankly, we need action on this issue now, not in another five years' time.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.2/1">Mr. Hunter, it is just as well that we did not have other hon. Members who wanted to speak, but it is always a pleasure to have the time filled with useful comments.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.3/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> on securing this debate. It is the second time that we have debated this particular issue in Westminster Hall this year, which indicates the importance that our constituents attach to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.3/2">I join the hon. Gentleman in congratulating the Minister and the Government on the part that they have played in reducing the grim statistics on road deaths. We have come a long way, but there is still further distance to go, as I am sure we all agree. Furthermore, people expect us to work together as Members of Parliament to try to address this particular problem; it is not an issue for party political bickering.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.3/3">Last Tuesday, the sixth form of Malton comprehensive school in Scarborough closed for the day. The reason was that all the sixth formers were attending the funeral of Tom Warrington, who was 18 and had been a pupil at the school. At 7.40 am on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-29">Sunday 29 June</phrase>, on the road between Goathland and Beck Hole in my constituency, his red Renault Clio left the road and hit a tree. He was killed and his passenger, another young man, was airlifted to James Cook university hospital in Teesside after sustaining serious injuries.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.3/4">Tom used to live in my village. He was always known as a daredevil on his bicycle. My wife told me this morning that she could remember him cycling off the roof of the village hall in our village. He knew no fear. He was just starting out on life's big adventure, only to have his young life snuffed out. My son attended Tom's funeral, along with many friends, and I think it brought home to them in a unique way just what the risks are of driving when speed is perhaps excessive or perhaps the road conditions are unexpected, or when something else has gone wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.3/5">Only the other month, my next door neighbour's daughter wrote off her car; she is a young driver learning to drive. Another friend of Tom's who attended the funeral, and had previously bragged about rolling his Vauxhall Corsa, suddenly realised that it could have been him in the coffin. When we educate our children about the dangers on the road, we need to bring home to them this message&mdash;they need to be aware that a car is a very dangerous piece of equipment.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.3/6">Tom Warrington was just one statistic among many. We have heard other statistics from east Lancashire. We have heard about the accident near Melton Mowbray, on the A607, when six young people were killed at 2 o'clock in the morning. After that accident, the father of the driver was quoted on the BBC as saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.78.3/7" class="indent">&quot;Kids of today like a bit of fun and excitement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.78.3/8">Fun and excitement can often turn to tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.3/9">It is no consolation to know that we have some of the safest roads in Europe and that several factors have contributed to reducing the death toll on our roads. For example, car design is better, but of course young people tend to be in older cars that may not have air bags, or in smaller cars. I would certainly be reluctant to limit the size of car that young people can drive. I did not have my own car until I was 21. I drove our family car, a Land Rover, which had an engine larger than the size proposed by the hon. Member for Pendle as a limit for young people. If I could not have driven our Land Rover, I would have needed a car of my own and I would have done a lot more driving, including a lot more driving at night. We need to be careful in that regard. Furthermore, we need to bear in mind that there are many people whose work requires the use of a car, and if it is agricultural work, the vehicle needs to be a 4x4 and not a Ford Fiesta, which might have some trouble getting to the ewe lambing at the far end of the field.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.3/10">We have done a lot in terms of road design and road improvements, and I know that the Government are tackling both congestion and accident black spots. We are also looking at how driver training can be improved. I welcome the Government's consultation on that matter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.80.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" speakername="Paul Flynn" colnum="80"  time="010:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0003.htm#08071682000454">
	<p pid="b.80.0/1">The hon. Gentleman would probably agree that the two great improvements in road safety in recent years have been the courageous introduction of compulsory seat belts and the introduction of the breathalyser, both in the teeth of public opposition. What bold plans on road safety does his party have?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.80.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1804" speakername="Robert Goodwill" colnum="80"  time="010:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0003.htm#08071682000455">
	<p pid="b.80.1/1">Those initiatives may have been seen as bold plans when they were introduced, but they are seen as plain common sense nowadays. The use of motorcycle helmets is another example; that is something else that people see as just plain common sense.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/2">We certainly want to address the issue of driver safety and to look at how we can change the attitudes of drivers, because driver safety is not just about drivers' skills. In fact, some of the evidence that I have seen shows that the young men who fly through their driving test with flying colours are the drivers killed in accidents, not the drivers who have difficulty passing their tests, possibly including the nervous girls who fail their test because they are an absolute bundle of nerves. If we make the test harder, we need to be very careful that we do not prevent those types of people from passing it; they may ultimately be the girlfriend driving the car rather than the boyfriend who has passed his test with flying colours and who, judging by the statistics that I have seen, would be more likely to be a dangerous driver.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/3">We also need to address the drink-drive limit, and my party is looking closely at the evidence on that issue. I certainly do not support those who advocate a zero alcohol limit; there are all sorts of issues about that proposal, particularly in respect of people driving the morning after they have been drinking. Certainly, people should be aware that if they have had a drink the night before they may be over the limit the morning after, but there needs to be some degree of balance in setting the alcohol limit.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/4">It is also very important indeed that, unlike other European Union countries that have lower alcohol limits, we do not have a lower penalty. In many EU countries, getting caught at the lower alcohol limit is equivalent to being caught speeding in the UK; drivers get points on their licence and are fined. The evidence from our country shows that the threat of points and a fine does not stop people speeding; record numbers of people are being caught speeding. We need to look at whether we can fine-tune the drink-drive limit to target people who are not only learning to drive and getting experience of driving but also learning to use alcohol responsibly.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/5">Many young men see themselves as good drivers, and it is difficult for various reasons to get it through to them that, in fact, nobody is a perfect driver&mdash;that anyone could be a statistic. I am rather nervous about saying this, but I am critical of some of the media; for example, people such as Jeremy Clarkson, who glorify speed and danger. Many of his road tests take place on airfields and off the public roads, but there is no doubt that many young men see him as a role model and may indulge in reckless behaviour that they would not otherwise indulge in. In many cases, those young men's perception of their abilities exceeds their abilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/6">Another way to move forward is to improve people's awareness of hazards. I have accepted an invitation from the British School of Motoring to try one of its hazard awareness simulators next week. In many cases, such training tends to involve town driving, but we must not forget that many fatal accidents do not happen in towns, on roads with speed cameras or on motorways, which are our safest roads; they happen on country roads where a tree on a corner can cause disaster.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/7">Should we make the driving test harder? We need to be careful about that. We must ensure that we test not just basic skills but the attitudes that often lead to disaster. I hope that the consultation comes up with suggestions that we can support. We are dubious about the 12-month learning period, which, in effect, would make the driving age 18. Many young people&mdash;certainly those in rural areas&mdash;rely on a car to get to school or work. Any policies that the Government introduce must be rural-proofed, because not everybody lives on a bus route. Not everybody can access their work or education using public transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/8">It is important that people have experience of various driving conditions, but we must bear in mind that while some young learners will have access to a family car and will be able to get experience in that way, others get driving experience only with a qualified driving instructor. We must ensure that the cost of getting experience is not so prohibitive that it prevents them from learning to drive.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/9">We can learn lessons from other countries. Sweden, for example, has an enviable road safety record. It uses a matrix to outline driving tasks and correlate them with driving skills and competencies. The aim is to</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/10" class="indent">&quot;make learner drivers realise their own limitations and thus counteract overestimation of own ability and skill. A second aspect is to become aware of the influence of personal preconditions, social norms and motivational factors on driving behaviour and risk. Yet another aspect is the concept of risk perception and risk awareness&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/11">Those are all important matters to bear in mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/12">An issue that has not been raised today is motorcycling, which comes under driving. If we make it harder for people to learn to drive and make it more expensive to use cars, people will often revert to using motorcycles or mopeds to get to work. As we all know, motorcyclists make up 1 per cent. of road traffic but 19 per cent. of fatalities. Motorcyclists are vulnerable, so I would be concerned if anything that we did forced more young people to use motorcycles rather than cars for journeys that may be dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/13">It is not just the born-again bikers we read about in the papers&mdash;the 40 and 50-year-olds who buy a 750 cc bike and go back to motorcycling&mdash;but the many young people who rely on motorcycles to get to work. If I have one criticism of the Government, it is the way that the new motorcycle driving test will be administered after <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-28">28 September</phrase>, and the long distances that people will be expected to travel to take the test&mdash;and not only to take the test: it is human nature to want to practise in the town where they will take the test and to get used to the routes, particularly if, as the Minister has suggested, they will be told to &quot;Go to the station&quot; rather than simply &quot;Turn left at the next junction&quot;. If I had never been to Hull before, I would be petrified if the examiner said, &quot;Go to the station,&quot; because I would not have a clue where it was. I have heard what the Minister has said on previous occasions about not testing people's ability to drive around a driving course, but people will want to take their lessons in the place where the test will be given. In my constituency, for example, a 50-mile trip to Hull&mdash;or even farther to Darlington&mdash;may discourage many young people from taking the test and lessons, particularly in bad weather conditions and they are on a small moped and do not fancy driving along a main road with lorries thundering past.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/14">I hope that such things will not be borne out by the statistics in the autumn, but I predict that many young people will not take the driving test or the instruction that they need. They will take the compulsory basic training and drive on L-plates for two years. At the end of that time, if they still want to ride a motorcycle, they will take the compulsory basic training again. I hope that I am wrong, but I expect that after September there will be a dramatic decline in the number of young people taking driving tests, and thus fewer well-qualified and well-trained people on our roads.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/15">We are told that because the Department missed the fact that 50 kph is over 30 mph, the driving test could no longer be carried out on public roads. The majority of roads around driving test centres are in built-up areas with a speed limit. It is unrealistic to expect people to make long journeys to the new test centres. For example, there will not be a test centre on the Isle of Wight, which means that a ferry journey will be required.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/16">As I said before, we are considering whether there is a case for lower alcohol limits for young drivers, and we are determined that the punishment for drink driving should continue to be a ban. We should not water down the approach to drink driving&mdash;drivers might think that it had been demoted to speeding.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/17">I hope that we will be able to engage constructively with the Government. We welcome the consultation, and we think that there are some good ideas; for example, the driver's logbook, and allowing drivers to experience night driving and driving in the rain and so on. However, we should be aware of the risk of taking a something-must-be-done attitude and doing something that looks as though it should work but may not work in practice. That has happened too often. I hope that the consultation will not fall into that trap, and that the Government will introduce evidence-based proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/18">I also hope that the insurance industry will play its part. Many young people take the pass plus test not because they want to be better drivers but because they want lower premiums, and pay-as-you-drive schemes make it prohibitively expensive for young people to drive at night.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/19">I welcome this opportunity to discuss the issue, and I hope that the proposals that emerge from the consultation on driver testing will be constructive and that we will be able to support many of them.</p>

	<p pid="b.83.0/1">It is a pleasure to see you presiding over this debate, Mr. Hancock.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> on raising this important issue. I wish to join him in congratulating all those associated with the falling casualty figures on their hard work: officials in the Department, the police and other emergency services, the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, local authorities, the drivers themselves, and others, including the Transport Committee, several of whose distinguished members have contributed to this debate . The Transport Committee has kindly invited me to its meeting this afternoon to discuss the new statistics, and I am looking forward to doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/3">I endorse the comment by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1804" name="Robert Goodwill">the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill)</phrase> that this issue is, and should be, above party politics. I am reassured that hon. Members from all parties are exercised by the dreadful statistics and are interested in improving road safety. We have had two debates on this important subject in this Session. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase> raised it last October, and the late Gwyneth Dunwoody prompted a further debate in March. The Government share the concerns expressed in this and earlier debates, and by the Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/4">As my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle said, we announced last month that provisional figures show that road fatalities fell below 3,000 for the first time last year. That is progress, but it is still a terrible toll. We are working on a new strategy designed to drive fatalities down much further in the coming years, and it must include new measures for young people. Provisional 2007 casualty figures are the best for young drivers in at least 10 years. Fatalities in accidents involving at least one driver aged 17 to 24 are down by 8 per cent. in 2007, and fatalities for drivers in that age group are down by 12 per cent. The figures are still dreadful, but I hope that we can build on that welcome improvement. We commonly speak about accidents&mdash;I used to do so before becoming road safety Minister&mdash;but, personally, I talk about crashes now.</p>

	<p pid="b.83.1/1">In her final remarks to the Transport Committee, Gwyneth Dunwoody mentioned the urgency of the matter to the Minister. I still say we are asking for urgency, a timetable, a result and a response. Will he tell us today&mdash;I am sure he will repeat many of the things said in previous debates about current plans&mdash;that the Government will take a bold decision on this matter and, taking on the possible outcry, introduce reforms that will, for the first time ever, reduce the entirely avoidable scourge of young deaths on the road?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.83.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="83"  time="010:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0003.htm#08071682000458">
	<p pid="b.83.2/1">I hope that we will be able to achieve the objective that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> mentions of saving more young lives. The previous Chair of the Transport Committee exhorted us to take into account the urgency of the situation. The proposals we published in our &quot;Learning to Drive&quot; document were awaited by people for some time, which held up progress to this kind of discussion. However, we published that document within weeks of the debate in the Transport Committee. It is in the public domain and it will clearly allow us to arrive at conclusions. Whether we grasp the nettle to which my hon. Friend alluded&mdash;I shall come to some of the points he made in a moment&mdash;the objective is to improve the situation still further.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.2/2">As I said, before becoming Minister for road safety I used to talk about accidents, but now I talk about crashes. Too many people who become casualties have not followed basic rules. For example, my hon. Friends the Members for Pendle and for Newport, West, mentioned seat belts. Research suggests that road fatalities have been cut by about 1,000 every year by the requirement for wearing a seat belt, but a quarter of vehicle occupants involved in fatalities did not use seat belts. Research demonstrates that up to two-thirds of those people might otherwise survive. Car loads of young people are among those with especially low belt-wearing rates: too many pay a tragic price for neglecting to do so, and we plan a new campaign in October to address that challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.2/3">Turning to our reforms, there is a strong case for overhauling the way in which people learn to drive and the way in which we test their skills. We must ensure that new drivers can deal with the challenge of driving alone. We know, from talking to young people, that the vast majority want to be safe and responsible, but we do not give them the tools to do so. Too many of them overestimate their abilities. They are impatient to strike out on their own, but that does not mean that they intend to be reckless or unsafe&mdash;far from it; the vast majority of young drivers are safe and responsible.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.2/4">The present driving test is too narrowly focused: the fundamentals go back to the 1930s. The mechanics of manoeuvring a car are important, but there is a lot more to driving on crowded modern roads. We plan a new approach based on improved education, better testing and real incentives to continue learning after the test. We want to change the driving test to base it on a new, comprehensive guide to what makes drivers safe. We want to update the theory test and the hazard perception test to encourage broader learning and test understanding of safe driving. We want the practical test to be better at assessing whether people are ready to drive unsupervised. We are considering splitting the theory and practical tests into modules, to enable learners to pass elements of the test as they learn. We want to provide people with better feedback throughout the testing process. Young people have told us that they want to learn about driving and using the road before they get behind the wheel, so we are developing a foundation course in safe road use, aimed at young people still in school.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.2/5">On average, learners spend about &pound;1,500 learning to drive, which is a big outlay for young people, who are keen to get better value. Young people complain that learners do not have sufficient information to plan their training properly or to choose the best driving instructor available. We will give learners a better idea of what is required through a new syllabus, which will also help instructors and others who are helping learners to practise, and a workbook to give them a much better understanding of what they need to learn and why. We want to encourage people to demonstrate that they have driven in a wide range of conditions such as at night or in bad weather. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase> raised both those points, and I will return to them when I respond, at the end of my speech, to comments made in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.2/6">I commend the pre-pass support scheme developed by Lancashire county council, which is just the sort of positive measure we seek to help learners and the family members who are helping them with driving practice. We want to give learners better information about driving instructors through a star rating system, so that they do not have to rely on family and friends for recommendations. We are reviewing the way in which instructors are trained and tested, before they qualify and after they are registered, to help them all to offer the best tuition possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.2/7">The practical test is seen as the end of formal learning, and learners are not encouraged to continue developing their skills. We want to create incentives to learn in new ways, both pre- and post-test, to gain bankable additional qualifications. We want to develop additional qualifications to supplement the driving licence, working with employers and insurers. Our consultation document explains why we are not proposing restrictions on newly qualified drivers. Briefly, if we have to impose restrictions on people after they have passed their driving test, we have failed to train and test them properly. I recognise that newly qualified drivers have too many accidents.</p>

	<p pid="b.85.0/1">The British School of Motoring, which knows about these things, tells us that the most sensible way to reduce accidents in the newly qualified driver group would be to have a graduated licence scheme. That is what the instructors are saying. Why does my hon. Friend the Minister repudiate that advice?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.85.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="85"  time="010:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0004.htm#08071682000460">
	<p pid="b.85.1/1">My hon. Friend mentions that driving organisation; he also described measures in other countries. The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby spoke about the provisions in Sweden. Some countries that my hon. Friend mentioned do not have graduated licences and those that do, which we have looked at&mdash;the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand&mdash;have graduated driving systems. However, those countries have not cracked the challenge of young drivers and, although they have introduced those systems, their statistics are not going in the direction in which ours are going. We are open to argument during the consultation, but, despite the BSM's opinion, we are not convinced that the evidence from other countries that have the types of schemes that my hon. Friend mentioned and which the Transport Committee has proposed, shows that they work in practice. That is where we are at the moment with the consultation scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/2">Our consultation document explains why we are not proposing restrictions on newly qualified drivers. I recognise that such drivers have too many accidents, but many of those are down to inexperience and ineffective learning. That is best addressed by changing the way in which we train and test people. It is unfair to penalise all young people, most of whom want to be&mdash;and are&mdash;safe and responsible drivers, with measures aimed at a minority who flout the basic rules that are already in place. I accept that there is a minority who drive badly&mdash;speeding, drink-driving and driving unlicensed and uninsured. We hope to educate young people about the risks of such behaviour. However, we will not tolerate the dangerous behaviour of those who do not listen to that advice. We are talking to the police and other partners who deliver road safety about how we can tackle that minority more effectively, without imposing unfair and disproportionate penalties on everybody.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/3">We are making the consultation exercise as inclusive as possible, and it is open for responses until <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-08">8 September</phrase>. We are running a series of open meetings, and we plan other events to gather the views of young people and other interested parties. Whatever the conclusion, the Driving Standards Agency is preparing plans to implement both the proposals that we decide to pursue and the way forward. That major programme of change will take several years to complete. As I said in the previous debate, young people value being able to drive and they deserve a fit-for-purpose driver training and assessment system, so that they can enjoy that important freedom safely. The hon. Member for Cheadle asked about people being tested in all conditions.</p>

	<p pid="b.86.0/1">The Minister has just said that that will take several years to complete. I think that that chilled the blood of many hon. Members in the Chamber, because we are calling for a measure that will come into force quickly. I think that the evidence is there. However, I do not see the evidence for improving skills that will reduce these accidents. We know that there is a particular problem involving young men drinking alcohol at weekends. That has to be tackled with the courage of previous holders of the Minister's post, who introduced measures such as the breath test and compulsory seat belting. If we go on consulting, tragedies will keep on occurring and we will read about them in our newspapers every Monday. Is it not time for a courageous decision by Government?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.86.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="86"  time="010:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0004.htm#08071682000462">
	<p pid="b.86.1/1">A moment ago, I said to my hon. Friend that we are persuaded that introducing such restrictions at a stroke will not have the effect that he suggests. The measures that we propose in our consultation document include the educational qualification, changing the way in which people are trained, the star-rating system, the professional career development scheme for approved driving instructors and examining people in a different way, all of which will take time to roll out and have to be piloted. That does not mean for a second that we are wasting any time in our efforts to push these statistics down further. The fact that the figures have been moving in the right direction for the past 12 months is encouraging, but no more than that, because for several years they hit a plateau.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/2">We know that we have some of the safest roads in the world. After last year's statistics, we are back in second place in Europe, after Sweden. We are in contact with other European partners&mdash;particularly Sweden, the Netherlands and Norway&mdash;which have good safety records to ensure that we share best practice and information and that we use that intelligence and develop it. We are about to launch our consultation on the post-2010 strategy. Our 10-year strategy from 2000 to 2010 was to reduce by 40 per cent. the number of adults killed or seriously injured on the roads, and to reduce by 50 per cent. the number of children killed or seriously injured. We have achieved the reduction in child deaths and serious injuries. We are on track to achieve the reduction in adult deaths and serious injuries.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/3">We will consult on the next strategy and consider whether we should adopt the Swedish model of zero tolerance to road deaths. However, such a policy runs counter to British philosophy, which says that there is no point in setting a zero target because we know that we will not achieve it. Perhaps we should be more pragmatic. Let us set a target similar to that in Holland, which focuses on sustainable safety. We should consider whether we have a 10-year or a five-year strategy, and whether we separate deaths from serious injuries. The rates for serious injuries have been falling quite quickly, unlike those for deaths.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.1/4">The Road Safety Foundation raised a number of questions on the matter last week. The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby and I attended a launch, with other hon. Members, which focused on road safety design and engineering particularly on rural roads, on which so many crashes are taking place, including the crash that my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West mentioned at the beginning of his speech. Road safety engineering is a method of bringing such figures down more quickly.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.0/1">I think that my friend is in danger of overcomplicating things. The fact is, there is a downward trend in accidents, deaths and injuries. We accept that and we have said that. The exception is young people, specifically young men. I am not asking the Minister to reveal the secret inner working of government, but has he had a conversation with the Secretary of State for Justice, my friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" name="Jack Straw">the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase>, about his proposals, and if he has, is the Secretary of State on board regarding his proposals?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.87.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="87"  time="010:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0004.htm#08071682000464">
	<p pid="b.87.1/1">I personally have not had a discussion with our right hon. Friend. However, the consultation document has been cleared across government. It is a Government consultation document, so the Department would have been cited. Certainly the Secretary of State for Transport, meets our right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary on at least a weekly basis in Cabinet and they have direct discussions on matters of mutual interest. I know that at departmental level, official level, and at a level above my pay grade, such meetings are taking place, but I cannot say that I personally have met the Secretary of State for Justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/2">To return to the point made by the hon. Member for Cheadle, who asked about testing in all conditions, we are considering how wider knowledge and skills can be tested, not just in the practical road test but in a modern computer-based test as well. We cannot run all driving tests at night or wait for rain and snow. However, any question about breaking up the tests is a matter for consultation. The hon. Gentleman also asked about research on the scope and status of the proposed workbook. Young people tell us that they welcome the means to structure their learning up to and after the test. That is how they learn other vocational skills, so we are considering how best to deal with that.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> and the hon. Member for Cheadle both asked about pass plus. We recognise the need to review and reform pass plus, as the scheme does not demonstrate any benefit to road safety. There were some initial gains, but insurance companies are cooling towards it, because it does not provide the benefits that they expected. With regard to reduced premiums for young drivers, the insurance companies say that they are interested in the &quot;Learning to Drive&quot; consultation paper because if it produces safer drivers, it will allow them to reduce premiums, which are high because they have to pay out so much money as a result of crashes. That is led by the evidence to a certain extent, but insurers are fully involved and interested in the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/4">The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby raised the issue of motorcyclists. I may be wrong, but, from memory, I think that 599 were killed in 2006, and 588 in 2007. We have taken some very positive steps. We set up a national advisory board, which meets on a quarterly basis. Last month, we launched a new safety rating for helmets, which will prevent about 50 deaths a year. We advise motorists on the safest helmet for their particular needs. I heard what the hon. Gentleman says about his concern about travel distances, and we will watch that. He acknowledges that what we are trying to do in the more rigorous and robust tests is to make motorcyclists safer, just as we are doing for all drivers. However, I acknowledge that most motorcyclists are victims of road crashes, not the cause.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/5">In conclusion, I return to the main issue. Hon. Members have said that we should single out young male drivers for special attention. That is not what the restrictions will do; they will restrict all young drivers, including young women. I have stressed that we are still consulting on the matter and we have outlined our recommendations. However, we are listening. This is a life-and-death issue, and I can assure hon. Members that we will continue to work across the House, within the Department and with all the agencies as hard as possible to push the horrendous figures down further. I will take the opportunity to say that we are about to consult on our post-2010 road safety strategy and would welcome any contribution from right hon. and hon. Members.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.89.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" speakername="David Anderson" colnum="89"  time="010:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0004.htm#08071682000466">
	<p pid="b.89.1/1">When I applied for this debate, which was only publicised last week, I did so as the chair of the all-party group on muscular dystrophy. Despite that, I was inundated by children's campaigners from Mencap, Whizz-Kidz, epilepsy support groups and Every Disabled Child Matters. They all wanted me to raise their issues here today. I explained that because of the time constraints, that was not possible. However, the needs that I will raise today are linked, and may be addressed by some of the issues that we will discuss today. The fact that I do not go into any detail about the diseases does not mean that those campaigners do not have a genuine case that should be listened to by Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/2">Within the all-party group on muscular dystrophy, we have worked very hard. I became a chair of the organisation three years ago. We have done a lot of good work with Government and have persuaded them to give us money for research to try to find a cure. In particular, we have discussed the lack of support across the country. In certain areas of excellence, particularly Newcastle and London, people who suffer from these problems get a much better deal than those in the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/3">I shall consider the issue of the quality of life for people who suffer from these diseases and also how we can give our young people the best possible opportunity to make their way in life. I shall also consider how they can be given access to as normal a life as possible because quite clearly the young people who are affected by these diseases cannot live the normal life that most people in this room have. It is our responsibility to go as far as we can to make sure that their life is as good as possible and of the best quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/4">What are we talking about? What is the scale of muscular disease in this country? There are more than 60 different types of muscular dystrophy and related neuromuscular conditions in the UK. It is estimated that for every 1 million of the population, more than 1,000 children and adults are affected by muscle-wasting diseases in the UK. Those disorders can be genetic or acquired. A number of the conditions, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hit young boys very hard and are particularly aggressive. They cause progressive muscle wasting, weakness, orthopaedic deformity, cardiac and respiratory compromise, and result in premature death. Many young boys in this country&mdash;two a week&mdash;are dying before they get beyond their teens. That is quite simply unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/5">Other types of the disease cause long-term and lifelong disability for many people. Some disorders can present in childhood or in young adult life; others have late onset conditions in adulthood. However, the sad reality for those suffering from all these diseases is that there is no cure, which is even more reason for us to do everything that we can to make life as good as possible for such people.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/6">It has been shown that a lack of specialist diagnosis, treatment and care for these conditions, particularly for people with life-limiting conditions, can negatively affect their life expectancy. On the other hand, where neuromuscular specialist services are available, they have a real impact on quality of life&mdash;even if they do not necessarily improve life expectancy. Another common factor associated with the disease is that patients almost always have heart-related problems. Muscle weakness is also often associated with poor ventilatory ability and respiratory failure, which is often overlooked by professionals, who are unfamiliar with the conditions. I do not wish to criticise those professionals; that is just the reality of what we are dealing with. Pain management is a common feature of the daily life of those suffering from such conditions and can cause nerve deterioration.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/7">Despite the above points, neuromuscular services are not yet recognised as specialist services by the Department of Health. That is one of the things that we in the all-party group on muscular dystrophy are strongly arguing and campaigning for. In September last year, the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign published findings taken from interviews with young adults living with these conditions. Those findings resulted in the launch of a new campaign called &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot;, which aims to improve the transition into adulthood for young people and ensure that it is as smooth as possible, particularly for those suffering from these diseases and neuromuscular conditions. We, as a society, need to do all we can to ensure that the young people inflicted with these conditions are provided with the best possible access to appropriate work experience, proper training, higher and further education and good quality employment. Those for whom paid work is not an option should be given valued activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/8">Sharp research&mdash;an independent research agency&mdash;interviewed 20 young people with the condition about their university plans and the experiences they have had. The list is in the report, but I shall mention some of the findings. Students found it difficult to find employment during university holidays. Some social services departments had little idea about how to implement feasible care packages for disabled students going away to university. Students who remained at home because of that felt that they had missed out on key parts of university life. The short time between A-levels and the start of a term sometimes caused delays because universities only started to make adjustments once they knew disabled students would definitely be attending that place of learning. Many universities reported that there was a huge amount to organise and their No. 1 plea is, &quot;Help us to plan early for others coming along.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/9">Following the success of last year's campaign, the charity was awarded &pound;250,000 by V&mdash;the youth volunteering charity&mdash;to set up a young network of campaigners across Britain. Yesterday, the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign launched the new campaigners' network, Trailblazers, at the annual general meeting of the all-party group on muscular dystrophy. Trailblazers aims to be part of the antidote to the problems identified in &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot; interviews by providing a real voice to young people with neuromuscular conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/10">The Trailblazers network has 12 regional campaign groups that are led and run by young people with these conditions and other disabilities. The groups will identify, research, report and campaign on issues that are important to them in their region. Our vision is to ensure that all young people with these conditions can access work experience, training, higher and further education, and quality employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/11">The challenge facing the Government and us as a society is huge. Those people involved with the issue are very aware of the skills gap in this country. The reality is that by 2020 few people who do not have sills will be able to get into work. It is estimated that by 2020, 40 per cent. of jobs will require people to have at least a level 5 qualification before they can get a foot through the door. As of last year, 40 per cent. of disabled people had no qualifications at all. That is the size of the problem we face. Out of all the people not in work, 40 per cent. have a disability or a long-term health condition. The number of disabled adults of working age living in relative poverty has increased during the past decade. More than one third of all people in this country with no formal qualifications are disabled. In fact, figures from the Minister's own Department show that the current employment rate of disabled people is only 50 per cent. compared with 74 per cent. for non-disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/12">For disabled people with a higher education qualification, the &quot;lacking but wanting work&quot; rate of 14 per cent. is actually higher that that of non-disabled people with no qualifications at all. We must be concerned about the lack of employment opportunities for people with neuromuscular conditions. Not all disability employment advisers at job centres have adequate knowledge of these conditions&mdash;again, that is not a criticism of them personally, but of the system that they work in. There is a need to develop a small specialist team of disability employment advisers who have the knowledge and can go out and give specialist advice and support to staff in local offices.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/13">We have to face up to the fact that, as a Government, our economic ambitions for ending child poverty and giving young people the best start in life will not be achieved without much more innovation and investment to raise the skill level of disabled people. Increasing the number of disabled people in mainstream employment will also help to achieve equality for disabled people in society overall, which is, after all, one of the ambitions of my Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/14">Skills are critical to people getting on at work&mdash;as well to people getting into work and, critically, staying in work. Disabled young people want and need a highly personalised package of education, training and support that meets their individual needs. What does that mean in the real world? Judith Merry, who is 19 years old and whom I met yesterday for the first time, is in attendance today. This is what she has to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/15" class="indent">&quot;I have congenital muscular dystrophy which means that I use an electric wheelchair to get around. I am fully mobile and can think and speak for myself. I have been through both mainstream primary and secondary school successfully completed my A levels and am now at Keele University studying American Studies and International Relations. I believe that I am qualified to get a good job. From my own personal experiences I have found finding employment difficult. This is not from a lack of trying; I have applied in my local area to the supermarkets and didn't get a job with them. I found one interview experience quite off putting; the supermarket was warned about a wheel-chair user coming to the interview and to have the lift ready. I ended up having my interview in their back freezer because the lift was broken which they hadn't bothered to check. The whole experience was embarrassing and quite an ordeal, not only for me but for my sister who has the same condition as me. I didn't get the job after all the fuss I went through and neither did she. I also applied to job agencies but they weren't successful either.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/16" class="indent">I have eventually found a job, but as a volunteer. This is of course not a paid job, which was what I was initially looking for. I should be able to gain equal access to employment like everyone else and not have to face any obstacles.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/17">That is absolutely true. The process should be absolutely fair.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/18">I shall ask the Minister four questions about the way forward. Will she agree to meet me and representatives of the campaign and the Trailblazers network to discuss the evidence uncovered in the interviews for the &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot; campaign? Will she do all she can to ensure that disability employment advisers build links with local schools and colleges to provide general employment advice to facilitate work experience for young people in the situation that I have described? Will she ensure that disability employment advisers use their relationship with employers actively to market the &quot;Access to Work&quot; scheme to ensure increased awareness of it? What will she do to ensure that the best possible support is provided to students with disabilities, so that they can study the subjects that they want to at the higher education facilities of their choice, which will give them a better chance of entering mainstream employment on gaining their qualifications?</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/19">Thank you, Mr. Hancock, for allowing me to make this speech. I hope that the Minister will answer my questions and that we can make progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.92.0/1">It is a pleasure to speak in Westminster Hall under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock. This is probably the first time that we have met in such circumstances, and I look forward to the experience.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> on securing this important debate. Not only here this morning but over many years he has shown significant commitment in raising awareness of the rights and needs of people living with muscular dystrophy. As he clearly identified, some of the issues cut across the concerns raised by many young people with different conditions or disabilities. The fact that my hon. Friend concentrated on issues relating to muscular dystrophy does not take away from the power of his case.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/3">I am aware from the first part of my hon. Friend's contribution this morning that there is a great deal of work still to be done on specialist services, particularly specialist medical services, and that the lack of those services can have a serious impact on the lives of people with muscular dystrophy and similar conditions. I am aware that my hon. Friend met the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" name="Ann Keen">the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen)</phrase>, on Monday to discuss research and specialist services. I understand that another meeting has been arranged to examine those issues again and perhaps to resolve some of the concerns that my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon has raised. I give a commitment that I will pass on the comments that have been made in this debate to ensure that that Minister is aware of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/4">The Government are proud of their record on extending rights and opportunities for disabled people, and I welcome the opportunity provided by this debate to highlight some of the progress that we have made and are making towards achieving equality for young disabled people and to reflect on some of the challenges. In the short time available, I will try to pick up on the specific points that my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/5">My hon. Friend gave powerful illustrations of the situation that faces many young disabled people. They still feel themselves discriminated against. They feel that their talents, experience and educational qualifications are not recognised as they should be. Indeed, at a very basic level, the need for access to an interview is not even considered to be part of the way in which an employer should treat a prospective employee who is skilled and has the relevant qualifications. Obviously, it causes me, as Minister with responsibility for disabled people, grave concern that such a situation still exists, despite the fact that we have had the Disability Discrimination Act since 1995. We have strengthened that Act over the past 11 years while we have been in government, yet young people going for their first job and full of expectation are still treated in the way that my hon. Friend highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/6">It is fair to say, however, that despite that reservation, the UK has become a world leader on disability rights. We have legislated to provide protection against discrimination at work, while offering new support and incentives to work. We are consulting on improving our specialist disability employment services. With those measures and others that I hope to highlight in the next few minutes, we have come a long way but, as my hon. Friend's speech clearly showed, major challenges still have to be tackled.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/7">I place on record my support for Trailblazers, the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign's new network of young campaigners, which was eloquently championed by my hon. Friend. I would be happy to meet him and representatives of the network. I am keen to ensure that our policies and services are informed by the knowledge and experience of disabled people. That is why, as my hon. Friend may be aware, we established Equality 2025, which is a network of disabled people to advise the Government on policies affecting disabled people. Trailblazers can play an important role, not only in articulating the views of young disabled people but in enabling young people to develop vital skills through their involvement with the network. My hon. Friend will be similar to me in some aspects of his background. We picked up the skills of negotiation, debate and conflict resolution through our experiences in either the Labour or the trade union movement, or through involvement with other political groups and residents networks. I would be delighted to meet him and representatives of the Trailblazers network.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/8">The Government acknowledged the specific challenges faced by disabled children and young people in our 2005 report entitled &quot;Improving the life chances of disabled people&quot;. We are committed to breaking down those barriers to enable disabled children and young people to achieve their full potential. The report focused on four key aspects of a disabled person's life chances: independent living; early years and family support; transition to adulthood; and employment. My hon. Friend emphasised the latter two this morning. The report made a number of practical recommendations, which we continue to drive forward to deliver on our commitment of equality for disabled people by 2025. Indeed, before coming to Westminster Hall this morning, I was chairing a meeting of Ministers who are part of our life chances group.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/9">We are making significant progress against the recommendations in the report. We have introduced many initiatives and programmes, which are having a significant impact on the life chances of disabled children and young people. They are too numerous to list now, but I will provide a few examples of the achievements so far.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/10">We have transformed the civil rights of disabled people. We have improved the benefits system and continue to seek ways to do so. We have improved support for families with disabled children in line with the children's national service framework. We have introduced direct payments for families with disabled children and disabled young people, which increase choice and control and empower those families. We are investing an extra &pound;340 million over three years to transform services for disabled children and their parents, as set out in our &quot;Aiming high for disabled children&quot; programme. We have extended opportunities for education and employment, which I shall now talk about in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/11">We are strongly committed to ensuring that our education system fosters the ambitions and aspirations of young disabled people. Since September 2002, schools and local authorities have been under a duty not to treat disabled pupils or students less favourably than those who are not disabled. We have made it perfectly clear that when parents want a mainstream place for their child, everything possible should be done to provide that. I note that the two individuals to whom my hon. Friend referred in his illustration have been through mainstream education at both primary and secondary level.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/12">We have significantly increased funding for the Learning and Skills Council to support disabled learners through further education, specialist providers, work-based learning, school sixth forms and personal development and community learning. We recently launched &quot;Progression through Partnership&quot;, which sets out a vision for how Departments across Whitehall, such as the Department for Children, Schools and Families, the Department of Health, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions, which is my Department, will work together to deliver high quality support and incentives for disabled young people and adults in further education and training. It sets out a joint programme for change over five years and requires that the principal delivery agents and local delivery partners, including the Learning and Skills Council, local government's adults and children's social services and Jobcentre Plus, mirror that approach in delivering sustainable, positive changes for disabled learners.</p>

	<p pid="b.94.0/1">I thank the Minister for the kind words that she has said so far. The cross-departmental group that she mentioned seems to be exactly the sort of thing we need, but was any of the work behind that driven by people such as those who are with us today and who live with those experiences? We might think that we know what those people are going through, but the truth is that we do not.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.94.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2013" speakername="Anne McGuire" colnum="94"  time="011:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0005.htm#08071682000469">
	<p pid="b.94.1/1">I hope to give my hon. Friend and the colleagues with whom he works through Trailblazers some confidence that we work closely with disabled people to ensure that the policies and initiatives that we are developing not only are thought about in an office in Whitehall or even by politicians, but reflect the real life experiences of young disabled people. Many of the members of Equality 2025 are young disabled people in their late teens and early 20s who have recent experience of being part of an educational system and are looking to achieve their life ambitions. We take seriously not only the consultation with disabled people, but their involvement at all points in developing these proposals and monitoring how well we are implementing them. It is one thing to consult at the beginning, but we need to test ourselves all the way through the programmes. We always seek to do that, and to improve when we do not do it well.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.1/2">We are also providing increased funding through the Higher Education Funding Council to institutions to help them support disabled students as well as providing disabled students' allowances directly to students. That support helps to remove the obstacles that prevent disabled students from entering and completing higher education courses of their choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.1/3">My hon. Friend mentioned employment, and we continue to open up opportunities for disabled people to move into work. We have significantly expanded the range of specialist disability employment services, such as Workstep and the Access to Work programme, which I shall talk more about shortly. Those programmes have opened up work options for many thousands of disabled people across the country. My hon. Friend might be aware that we recently completed a review of those services to ensure a higher and more consistent quality of service to ensure a clearer focus on the individual needs of every disabled person we support, so it is not a template approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.1/4">In response to my hon. Friend's question about the Access to Work programme, information on that is already readily available to employers through their relationships with Disability Employment Advisers and through Jobcentre Plus. We have increased the budget for the Access to Work programme year on year&mdash;from &pound;15 million in 1997 to &pound;69 million this year. We will continue to work with employers to raise awareness of their responsibilities under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005. We are also always looking for different and better ways for publicising that flagship policy, which supports so many in employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.1/5">My. hon. Friend mentioned the necessary support for the transition from education to employment, which is crucial for many young people and their parents or guardians. For many young disabled people the transition into adulthood is not only about leaving school, often takes place over a longer period of time and involves many more aspects of a young person's life than it would for a non-disabled young person. So crucial do the Government think that that transition is, my hon. Friend will be interested to note that Ministers have made transition to adulthood a standing item on their agenda at their quarterly meetings of the life chances group. We listen to young disabled people when they say that transition planning and service provision do not work for them, which is often the case, and we are certainly taking action to improve the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.1/6">I have already mentioned our &quot;Aiming High for Disabled Children&quot; programme, which commits &pound;19 million to a co-ordinated transition programme due to begin in September. Our five-year independent living strategy, which we published in March 2008, commits the Government and all of our agencies to ensuring a seamless transition into adulthood for young disabled people, including those with complex health needs. That will cover all aspects of their lives, including transition between children's and adult services, housing, transport, employment, education and training. That will bring together those commitments across a number of Government Departments. Over the five years of the strategy, we expect to see significant improvements in the number of young disabled people who have transition plans and who have access to a person-centred planning and advocacy service. It is allright having the plans in place, but we need to ensure that they are fulfilled. We are also committed to reducing the proportion of young people aged between 16 and 18 who are not in education, employment or training, and that also covers disabled young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.1/7">In response to my hon. Friend's points on the links between the disability employment advisers and schools, those links already exist and undoubtedly add value, but I am looking for ways in which that engagement between education and our disability employment advisers at local level can be improved. He also highlighted the issue of accessible housing. The Government have substantially increased funding for the disabled facilities grant programme, from &pound;57 million in 1997 to &pound;146 million in 2008-09. That grant now helps around 35,000 disabled people by providing assistance with major housing adaptations, which enable them to remain living independent lives in their own homes, which is crucial for the individual's stability and development. Our independent living strategy has also commissioned further research.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.1/8">Many of the initiatives and programmes that I have outlined today will take time to have an impact, but I echo my hon. Friend's comments that it is only by listening to the views of disabled people, and young disabled people in particular, through networks such as Trailblazers, that we will achieve our vision of equality for all disabled people by 2025.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on Belarus ahead of the important parliamentary elections there in September.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.2/2">I should first like to condemn the recent spate of bomb attacks in Minsk. Whether they were motivated by extreme hooliganism, terrorism or other factors, they are to be condemned, and our thoughts and prayers go out to the 50 or so people who were injured, many seriously. I hope not only that the perpetrators will soon be brought before the courts and the necessary justice dispensed, but that the police investigation will not be used as a pretext for curbing the freedoms of civic society and those religious, political and media organisations that espouse only peace.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.2/3">Belarus stands at an important juncture in its history. The choice could not be more stark: the parliamentary elections in September will either provide a continuance of the status quo or an opportunity for a new dawn in which all the people of Belarus will be able to realise their full potential, and fulfil their dreams and those of their families.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.2/4">For too long, political discussions inside and outside Belarus have been unhelpfully trapped in silos, too often accompanied by the outdated rhetoric of yesterday rather than the lexicon of the future and the language of hope. It is a false dichotomy to talk of Belarus choosing between east and west, for Belarus is strategically and geographically positioned to take advantage of both relationships, as it should&mdash;it is in its national interest to do so. One relationship does not have to suffer because of the desire to deepen ties with other partners. Belarus can be politically polygamous.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.2/5">Although it may be convenient for some to talk in immediate, post-Soviet language, such language may rally to history, but it does not champion the future. Belarus can never cast aside its close ties with Russia&mdash;the Slavic and Russian influences on it remain strong&mdash;but no one is calling for that. Indeed, I believe that the Belarusian people would not countenance such a mistaken proposition. However, the European characteristic of Belarus is equally unmistakable and evident, and is a proud element within the make-up of Belarus, which is a fine, cultured country of brave people. Recently, a marker was placed in Polotsk to denote the geographical centre of Europe. Of course, it is not the only candidate&mdash;there are several rival claims&mdash;but it is another indicator that Belarus is part of the family of European nations. That is why I hope the country will move towards realising its true and full European potential, with the many benefits that closer co-operation will bring, not least in these difficult economic times. Belarus, like all nations, needs to minimise its risk to the vagaries of the global economy, and part of that process means seeking out new markets and opportunities, be they for large companies or small and medium-sized business. For the impressive Belarusian entrepreneurs, of which I know there are plenty, the future holds many opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.2/6">What about UK-Belarusian relations? We enjoy good relations with Belarus&mdash;I would even say very good relations&mdash;in combating organised crime. Trade and investment are growing all the time, although the pace of growth is slow and could increase much further, given the right conditions. That is why Belarus's international reputation is important. I know of several UK companies that would like to expand into Minsk and other Belarusian cities, but they are worried that their reputations could be damaged in the process. Those justified, multi-million pound concerns should be taken seriously. They are a huge missed opportunity for the Belarus economy, but I do not believe that such opportunities are lost for ever. That is a matter for the Government of Belarus. Although Belarus might seek to improve its own image, the reality rather than the perception of progress matters.</p>

	<p pid="b.98.0/1">When Belarus looks westward, who does my hon. Friend think will have more influence over the future direction of the country: the United States or the European Union?</p>

	<p pid="b.98.1/1">My hon. Friend, as always, asks a pertinent and relevant question. Belarus's relationship with the United States is a matter for the Belarus Government, and I am talking today predominantly about the Belarus-UK relationship and its relationship with the European Union. As I set out briefly already&mdash;I hope to set it out in more detail&mdash;there are a great many opportunities for Belarus to engage at all sorts of levels with the European Union. The difference between the types of discourse that the Belarusians could have with the Americans and the EU is not an issue, because Europe and the UK agree on the things that America is concerned about.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.1/2">To reiterate, although Belarus might seek to improve its image, the reality rather than the perception of progress matters. A decision for progress will capture the imagination of international investors and increase foreign direct investment. The City of London is waiting to increase business with Belarus when conditions are right.</p>

	<p pid="b.98.2/1">My hon. Friend is a great champion for the City of London and an assiduous constituency MP, and I am delighted that he has brought this important issue to the House before the recess. Does he think that non-governmental organisations such as Amnesty International also have a part to play in developing the international community's perception of Belarus's performance on human rights reforms and the development of democratic institutions? I think it is genuinely trying to do those things, and it needs encouragement to make progress.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.98.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" speakername="Mark Pritchard" colnum="98"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0005.htm#08071682000474">
	<p pid="b.98.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I mentioned civic society in my introduction, and I shall refer specifically to NGOs later in my speech. I am grateful for that intervention and look forward to responding to that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/2">The process of parliamentary elections in September 2008 is important. The word &quot;process&quot; is significant, because the process rather than the outcome matters to the international community. The EU and hundreds of businesses within it, including in the UK, as I said, are eagerly awaiting a democratic nod from Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/3">I welcome the recent invitation from the Belarus Government to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe to observe the elections. I hope that the OSCE will be given unfettered access to as many polling districts as it requests, that sufficient numbers of observers will be granted visas, and that they will be issued in plenty of time for the OSCE advance teams to prepare and set up. The invitation to OSCE is a positive first step on a multi-step stairway&mdash;a &quot;process&quot;. The Government of President Lukashenko probably have more to gain from free and fair elections than possibly anyone else who would hold office or seek to be seated in Parliament. The European Commission's European neighbourhood policy shadow action plan is just one manifestation of the potential benefits of closer ties with the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/4">Democratic elections are not about discrediting Governments, they are about legitimising them. Differences of opinion should not be used as some form of diplomatic brinkmanship but seen for what they are&mdash;differences of opinion. That is why Minsk, London, Bonn, Vienna and Brussels should enter into dialogue, recognising each other's sovereignty, and undertake discussions with mutual respect. Then, I hope, they will move towards mutually beneficial co-operation. At the same time, commentators on Belarus need to understand that there are no shortcuts to democracy and that tokenism can never replace proper accountability and representative democracy. The parliamentary elections must be free and fair.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/5">I do not wish to spend the whole debate on the parliamentary elections alone, although they are important. I wish to touch on media freedoms, which are linked to the elections. It is disappointing for all Belarus-watchers, and a retrograde step, that the Belarus Government recently tightened media freedoms, including the use of the internet, by introducing a new law on the mass media.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/6">It is not acceptable that journalists and internet editors are being fined and harassed and having their technical equipment confiscated. Internet sites such as charter97.org are not enemies of the Belarusian state&mdash;that is a laughable idea. That site is run by Belarusians for Belarusians, and all love their country to a man and woman. I do not subscribe to the view expressed by some that parts of Belarus lack self-confidence or aspiration. Those attributes are imbued in the Belarusian psyche. Freedom of the press is not an optional democratic bolt-on but a key and fundamental freedom.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/7">Whatever the outcome of the elections, and whoever is in outright control in a future Parliament, or perhaps in coalition, it is important that Belarus improves its human rights record. It is an international embarrassment that Belarus, at the heart of Europe, is still holding political prisoners in its jails. Those prisoners need to be released.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/8">I recognise that there has been some progress on political prisoners. This February, five internationally recognised prisoners were released from prison, and the court case against the Belarusian Helsinki Committee was rightly suspended. Those were positive steps and could lead the way to the normalisation of EU-Belarus relations, but more needs to be done. I hope that all remaining political prisoners will be released before the September elections.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/9">The strength of a nation is not counted by the number of political prisoners whom it detains. Belarus must recognise the fundamental freedoms that are enshrined not only in British and European laws and Parliaments but in the hearts of men and women around the world. Those universal freedoms are the desire of all men and women, wherever they live&mdash;the freedom to choose their own Government and express their voice in an unencumbered way, the freedom of religion and expression, and the freedom to have members of Parliament chosen by the people, for the people, not by diktat. Those are not just western freedoms, they are Belarusian freedoms as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/10">Freedom is not a sign of weakness but, I submit, a sign of strength. Belarus knows a lot about freedom and its high cost. Many will know of the Bielski brothers, the brave partisans who fought the German army victoriously. They started off with just three or four people and escaped to the woods, then formed a large group of more than 1,000 partisans, who did a great deal of damage to the Nazis. There is a forthcoming film about the Bielski brothers, called &quot;Defiance&quot;, starring Daniel Craig as Tuvia Bielski. I hope that it will shed some light on the suffering of not just the Jewish population, which suffered greatly, but Belarus as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/11">When I last visited Belarus, the whole nation was celebrating the defeat of the Nazis, who wreaked widespread havoc, pain and destruction, destroying two thirds of Minsk and other parts of the country. The people of Belarus never gave up. They continued to believe in a day when people would be able to speak openly and freely without fear of being rounded up, detained and thrown into prison. They rightly dreamed of a day when they would be able to express themselves freely and openly. The story of the Jerusalem in the forest is a remarkable and exceptional one of human triumph over great suffering.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/12">Similarly, I hope that the persecution of faith groups in Belarus, particularly the Christian Church, will end. Most people thought that the persecution of religious groups had been left behind in the 1930s and 1940s, and it is perhaps one of the worst excesses of overly sensitive Governments around the world. The Orthodox and Catholic Churches need to ensure that when they witness or hear of the persecution of other faith groups, or of smaller Christian denominations and Churches, they do not walk by on the other side. They must make formal protests and speak out for the persecuted and imprisoned and those who have trumped-up charges brought against them and are prosecuted falsely. Non-governmental organisations should also be free to go about their important work.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/13">I know that the Government of President Lukashenko are aware of their responsibilities under the international covenant on civil and political rights, and I look forward to hearing that progress has been made on the issues that I have mentioned in the weeks leading up to the elections. I hope that those elections are free and fair and not characterised by intimidation and fraud; that in the weeks leading up to September, there will not be a crackdown on civil society, NGOs and religious groups; that there will not be registration problems for other candidates and parties; that opposition parties will be able to print campaign materials and campaign openly; and that political websites will not be closed down.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/14">I have a question for President Lukashenko. Does he want history to remember him as the leader who brought Belarus into a new era of economic prosperity and self-confidence, or does he want to be consigned to the long list of history's leaders who have put self before country? I believe that he knows history and the importance of legacy, and therefore I, like many others, am waiting to see whether he will do what we all hope&mdash;lead Belarus into a bright future.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.3/15">As I said earlier, the elections in Belarus are about process, not outcome. I hope that that process will not be rigged and that it will be free and fair. Within 12 weeks, we will all find out whether that has been the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> on securing and introducing the debate. I know that he has raised the matter in business questions, but it is important for us to discuss it before the recess in the light of recent and forthcoming events in Belarus. The hon. Gentleman takes a keen interest in political affairs in eastern Europe and Russia, and I commend him on his work as chairman of the all-party group on Russia; he introduced me to the Russian ambassador last month, which was a very interesting meeting.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/2">I share the hon. Gentleman's condemnation of the recent distressing bomb attacks in Minsk. The reasons behind them have not been discovered. I share his fear and trepidation about the way in which the Belarusian authorities might go about conducting investigations and what the results might be, given their appalling human rights record in dealing with law and order.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/3">In the 18 years that Alexander Lukashenko has been in power in Belarus, it has become clear that the country is the last place in Europe ruled by a dictator. The US has described it as an &quot;outpost of tyranny&quot;. Belarus was relatively prosperous when it was part of the USSR. Unfortunately, it has been in steep decline since the end of the Soviet Union. It is important for us to remember that the Belarusian people have been the victims of the tyranny of Lukashenko's regime, which has cracked down on dissidents and managed the country in an incredibly poor way. The economy is crumbling. As has been said, Belarus is looking towards the past rather than the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/4">The regime has been characterised by many human rights abuses, particularly with regard to the treatment of political opposition and dissidents. All the institutions have been subverted to the will of the President. Worryingly, over the past couple of months, even more rigid legislation has been passed to put a muzzle on the country's independent media. That is a hallmark of a state that wants to oppress its people. As a result of its human rights abuses, Belarus finds itself increasingly isolated in the international community and increasingly dependent on its relations with Russia. We must make the point that it is vital that relations with the EU are put on a better footing. I will ask the Minister about the twin-track strategy later.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/5">I will focus on three main areas: democracy and human rights in Belarus, its relations with the EU and its relations with Russia. Before I move on to those topics, I will share a related point. Belarus is not very familiar to people in the UK. However, there are more links than are obvious at first glance. When I mentioned to my PA, Julie, that I would be speaking in a debate on Belarus, she told me that when she was growing up, two sisters had stayed with her family for six months under one of the many programmes that encourage children from Belarus to come to the UK to improve their health, which was affected by the Chernobyl disaster. Such programmes have been run by a variety of charities such as Chernobyl Children's Lifeline and Chernobyl Children's Project UK. About 4,000 children come to the UK each year for recuperative holidays, which have been proven to have a huge positive impact on their health. It is estimated that a stay of just a few weeks can extend life expectancy by as much as two years. There are, therefore, more links than are obvious.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/6">In an Adjournment debate secured by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase> in February, he raised the problems faced by such children in getting visas to come to this country as a result of the introduction of biometric passports. Some people had to make a 10-hour round trip to Minsk to obtain their visas. For children in a very ill state, that was a great barrier to being able to go on a holiday that would improve their health. The Minister for Europe, said on that occasion:</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/7" class="indent">&quot;I will take personal responsibility for undertaking further inquiries and then meet him&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-02-25.880"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 February 2008; Vol. 472, c. 880</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/8">The Minister has done that and is to be commended, but I urge the Minister for the Middle East to raise the issue with the Minister for Europe because not all the problems that were identified have yet been resolved. It would be useful if the matter could be pursued.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/9">The catalogue of human rights abuses in Belarus is well documented, as I have said. The political oppression and the treatment of the media are abhorrent to free and democratic societies such as ours. The Government are right to express their disgust at the human rights abuses through various EU and UN channels. I urge them to put further pressure on the regime in Belarus where possible, which I know they are keen to do. That must involve pressure to release political prisoners, to investigate the disappearance of political opponents and to hold free and fair elections. Restrictions on the country's media must be lifted. I welcome the Government's statements and actions on these matters to date, but I press the Minister to say what further action the Government will consider to get the message through to Belarus. What further pressure can we bring to bear so that the regime will understand that its abuses of human rights are unacceptable?</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/10">It would be interesting to know how many political opponents of the Belarusian regime have been given asylum in the UK over recent years and if any have applied for asylum and been refused. If the Minister does not have the figures here, perhaps he could write to hon. Members present.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/11">The hon. Member for The Wrekin mentioned the forthcoming elections. There was no international monitoring of last year's local elections. If we are to have confidence that the elections are free and fair, it is vital that international monitors are granted access. Does the Minister expect there to be monitoring of the forthcoming elections or are there still significant obstacles to that?</p>

	<p pid="b.103.1/1">That is welcome news indeed. Perhaps it is another sign of the slight thawing of relations that has been noticed recently between Belarus and EU countries. I hope it will provide a glimmer of hope for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.1/2">On the media, it filled me with dismay to read that in 2005 the state-owned monopoly printers terminated the contract of the last remaining independent newspaper, and that just last month new laws were introduced requiring all websites in Belarus to be registered with the Government. Journalists can be subject to tough penalties, such as being put in prison for two years, if they reproduce foreign media reports that discredit Belarus. That is unacceptable, as is the persecution of religious groups that we have heard about, particularly the appalling treatment of Christians. Those things must be roundly condemned.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2031" name="Bob Spink">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> made a useful intervention to point out the important role of organisations such as Amnesty International. I declare an interest as a member of that group. That such organisations can get into countries such as Belarus and report accurately on what is happening is vital for those of us in the international community who want to put pressure on such regimes. I commend and applaud the work of such organisations. I urge hon. Members from all parties to take an interest in the reports that they produce.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.1/4">The EU has adopted a twin-track approach in its relations with Belarus. High-level contact has been suspended, but the door has been left open so that if reforms take place there can be greater co-operation. Sanctions have been imposed, lifted, and imposed again. With the recent crackdown on political opponents and the introduction of restrictive legislation, it is right that sanctions have been put in place. Does the Minister think that the current strategy is working or are there alternative strategies that could be used? How effective does he think the sanctions are? I note that the answer to a parliamentary question tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1965" name="Michael Moore">the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore)</phrase> in November 2007 stated that no Belarusian assets were frozen in the UK in line with the EU sanctions. Has the position changed since then or is it still the case that no such assets fall into that category?</p>
	<p pid="b.103.1/5">I am particularly interested in the perceived thawing of relations signalled by the setting up of a European Commission office in Minsk and the acceptance of election monitors for the forthcoming elections. Is there hope that this warming of relations could become more permanent? What should Europe's response be to ensure that happens as we walk the line between wanting to encourage reform while not condoning the human rights abuses in Belarus?</p>
	<p pid="b.103.1/6">I turn to relations between Belarus and Russia. Lukashenko's primary foreign policy objective has been good relations with Russia, but clearly they came under considerable stress during the Putin presidency, particularly owing to the many disputes over gas and oil supplies and their impact on the Belarusian economy. Will the Minister tell us what talks the UK or EU are having with Belarus to avoid future disruption to energy supplies owing to pipeline disputes? Obviously, with the increasing dependence on other parts of the world for energy supplies, Belarus and Ukraine are in pivotal positions as major transit routes for oil and gas supplies. Does he think that a greater number of pipeline routes would decrease the likelihood and seriousness of any future disputes, and will the Government actively pursue alternative supply routes? Can he provide us with further information about the Government's actions in that area?</p>
	<p pid="b.103.1/7">Interest in the thawing relations with the EU is counterbalanced by a look through the history of Russian relations. At one point Russia said that Belarus should be part of the Russian Federation, but at other times suggested that the two countries could be joined together in a united state. At what stage is that proposal, and does the Minister believe that the warmer overtures to the EU represent a policy shift by Lukashenko and a move away from the idea floated of a united Belarusian and Russian state?</p>
	<p pid="b.103.1/8">On that note, we are fortunate enough to have more time than usual for the Minister to reply to the debate, following the contribution from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1772" name="Mark Francois">the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois)</phrase>, and I look forward to his response.</p>

	<p pid="b.104.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> on securing this important debate and on enriching it with some of his own personal experiences in dealing with this important European country.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/2">As we have heard, Belarus's history reflects much of that of central and eastern Europe, as it has variously been part of the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Russian and Soviet empires, before eventually attaining independence in 1991. As we also heard, it did not escape the ravages of the 20th century, having been fought over by Poland, the Soviets and Nazi Germany. In fact it has the dubious distinction in the second world war of being attacked by both the Soviets, under Stalin's agreement with Hitler to divide Poland, and then by Hitler's Nazis, so Belarus was fought over more than once during that great world conflagration. The appalling destruction and murder that resulted meant that the country lost more than a quarter of its population, including many members of its Polish and Jewish minorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/3">Unfortunately, the end of the second world war was not the end of the suffering of the Belarusian people. Stalin launched a period of Russification, and then Sovietisation, of which Nikita Khrushchev declared:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The sooner we all start speaking Russian, the faster we shall build communism&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/5">As well as the inefficiencies of the Soviet economy, one of the last legacies that the Soviet Union bequeathed to Belarus was the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, which affects much of the southern part of the country to this day. Given its 20th century history, it was hoped that Belarus could enjoy the outbreak of freedom and prosperity enjoyed by so much of central and eastern Europe following the fall of the Berlin wall. However, Belarus, under President Lukashenko, seems to swim stubbornly against the tide of history, and has been described by President George W. Bush's Administration as the &quot;last dictatorship in Europe&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/6">President Lukashenko, who has been President of Belarus for most of its history since independence, is an autocrat presiding over one of the only countries in Europe that the non-governmental organisation, Freedom House, still categorises as &quot;not free&quot;. The last presidential election, in 2006, was described by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe as having</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/7" class="indent">&quot;failed to meet OSCE commitments for democratic elections&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/8">With regards to elections, the media and human rights, Belarus unfortunately shows many of the hallmarks of a dictatorship. I am sure that the Minister will agree that Belarus's behaviour is even more surprising, given that many of its neighbours have had immense success modernising their economies and political systems, with Lithuania, Latvia and Poland becoming relatively prosperous members of the EU, and Ukraine progressing to becoming a partner country and, in time, a full member.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/9">Something that clearly marks Belarus out as a dictatorship is its treatment of the media. President Lukashenko has even boasted that his Government use &quot;serious pressure&quot; to control the media and that he is in charge of this process. Unfortunately, such media control has continued in the run-up to the parliamentary elections which, as my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin pointed out, are scheduled for September 2008. He also mentioned that the Belarusian Government recently introduced a new media law that will restrict the internet and foreign broadcasters and further cut Belarus off from the outside world and objective news. In the absence of an impartial media, Lukashenko has tended to shore up his internal position by focusing on &quot;the enemy abroad&quot;. He complains about Polish and Lithuanian NATO bases near the Belarusian borders, and publicly urges his army to step up preparations for potential conflict. He has even raised the spectre of the Russian mafia to scare people domestically into supporting a strong state. As a result, Belarus has been listed by the Committee to Protect Journalists as one of the 10 worst countries in which to be a journalist.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/10">It is unfortunate, too, that over the years, a number of Opposition leaders have been imprisoned or have simply disappeared. The most high-profile leader is Alexander Kozulin, who is serving a five-year jail sentence for taking part in a pro-democracy demonstration after the most recent elections. Consequently, the recent explosion on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-04">4 July</phrase> at a celebration of Belarusian independence, at which President Lukashenko was present, could be an ominous development. The first signs are not encouraging: Radio Free Europe was reporting only yesterday that the Belarusian authorities were using the attack as a pretext to detain pro-democracy protesters and that a demonstration in Minsk asking for their release was broken up by police after violent scenes.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/11">What should be our response to Belarus? It is undoubtedly in our interests to try to foster a more open and democratic Belarus, but that leaves a classic dilemma, with which the Minister will be familiar from his dealings in the middle east, of whether it is better to engage further with Belarus in the hope that by doing so we will produce an environment where Belarus can see the benefits that would flow from a normalisation of relations, although we risk sending a signal to the Belarusian regime that we approve of its behaviour. Alternatively, we could introduce increased measures, sending a clear message to the regime, but at the cost of making the people of Belarus pay for their Government's actions.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/12">The pragmatic solution to that dilemma is to implement actions that specifically target the regime, rather than the ordinary populace. That should take the form of travel bans and asset freezes for members of the regime, as well as giving moral and material support to the political opposition, who are trying to promote democracy in the country. To this end, we support the EU's action, agreed in 2005, to target an extra 31 members of the Lukashenko regime identified as responsible for the flawed elections with asset freezes and travel bans. We also support the continued freeze on the implementation of the partnership and co-operation agreements between the EU and Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/13">We believe that targeted action should be continued in the run-up to the next elections, to send a message to President Lukashenko that relations can improve only if elections are free and fair. My hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin stressed the need for free and fair elections, and we concur with that view. I would be interested to know whether Ministers have any further proposals for additional action that could be taken in an attempt to send that message to President Lukashenko in a way that he might understand. Because of the Belarusian Government's behaviour, the political opposition are at a severe disadvantage. To support the political process in Belarus it is desirable to give support to political parties and civil society, such as those, for instance, who are grouped under the heading of the united democratic forces, to encourage them to continue to argue for the development of democracy and true plurality in their country.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/14">Another method by which we can encourage Belarus to engage with the outside world is to set out the benefits of such engagement. An open and democratic Belarus already has the assurance of a better relationship with the European Union, based on the European neighbourhood policy, which is intended to promote further economic integration to improve the lot of countries bordering the EU. Belarus borders three EU states, and Ukraine has already applied to join the EU. Belarusians have seen the economic progress of the Baltic states, made possible, for instance, by access to the single market. A democratic and open Belarus would be likely to have the support of its neighbouring states for beginning a process of further integration into the European Union, which would arguably benefit Belarus as a whole. The EU could also help Belarus in the provision and sharing of technology to improve the environment. That would be particularly relevant, given the large-scale environmental degradation in the south resulting from Chernobyl fallout.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/15">To conclude, Belarus suffered enormously in the 20th century. While many of its neighbours took advantage of their independence to build up their economies and political institutions, Belarus stubbornly remained a dictatorship, starved of freedom and investment. Belarus has a clear choice. It can move towards engagement with the outside world, attract investment and improve the lot of its people, or it can remain an isolated outpost of authoritarian rule. We in the UK, with our partners in the EU, need to help the Belarusian people by targeting sanctions on the Belarusian regime, and supporting the development of civil society in that country. To that end, we support the measures that are already in place under the auspices of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.1/16">If Belarusians were given the opportunity to engage with the outside world, the benefits for them would be huge. They could have greater access to EU markets and easier travel, and they could begin a process that could, in time, lead to eventual EU membership. We need to help the Belarusian people to make a genuine choice. I look forward to hearing from the Minister what help, if any, we are giving to Belarusian civil society in the run-up to the elections, and what measures we are targeting on the regime to make it clear that failure to move towards an open and democratic society carries penalties, whereas reform brings with it signal advantages that would be in the interest of all the people of Belarus.</p>

	<p pid="b.107.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> for securing the debate and giving us the opportunity to examine a country that is deeply troubled but which lies, as he pointed out, close to the geographical heart of Europe, on the threshold of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/2">I want to express support and sympathy to those Belarusians who were injured in the explosion at the independence day concert in Minsk on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-03">3 July</phrase>, or perhaps, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1772" name="Mark Francois">the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois)</phrase> said, it was on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-04">4 July</phrase>. I am not quite sure which day it happened. The actions of the terrorists who planted a bomb and destroyed what was supposed to be a celebration are murderous and deplorable. I urge the Belarusian Government not to use the investigation as a political tool. We know, for example, that 16 members of opposition parties have already been detained. Interrogations and the searching of apartments of democratic activists go on, and that is extremely worrying.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/3">I assure the hon. Member for The Wrekin that Her Majesty's Government desire a constructive relationship with Belarus, as we do, of course, with other countries on the borders of the EU. If I have just one message, it is to encourage Belarus to see the September parliamentary elections as a good opportunity to rebuild that relationship, by demonstrating the ability to address important human rights concerns. A better relationship with the EU would bring easier travel, economic opportunities and the chance to contribute to discussions on issues that affect us all, such as the environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/4">After all, as hon. Members reminded us during the debate, Belarus is very much a European country, but Europe has a very restricted relationship with Belarus. Belarus currently does not live up to the principles that Europe stands for: freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. As the hon. Member for The Wrekin reminded us, 20 years ago, countries that are now respected members of the EU faced a choice between retreating into Soviet-style authoritarianism and welcoming freedom and democracy. Most chose the latter. Belarus did not, but the option remains open.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/5">The hon. Member for The Wrekin reminded us that the country occupies a strategic position. When I looked it up on a map this morning, I saw that almost all the main roads from Poland, and therefore from western Europe, to Moscow pass through Belarus. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> asked about gas supplies through pipelines running through Belarus into western Europe. That is an important and worrying consideration on which, I suppose, we could have a separate debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/6">One of the things that concerns us is that not only does Russia provide Belarus with cheap gas&mdash;it is extremely cheap, in comparative terms, at present, and the Belarusian economy is doing well on the back of that&mdash;but Russian hydrocarbon money is buying up Belarusian industry. We shall come on to that, because the point about the opportunities that should exist in Belarus for greater diversification of ownership, particularly of new industries and development industries, is an important one.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.108.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" speakername="Mark Pritchard" colnum="108"  time="015:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0007.htm#08071682000481">
	<p pid="b.108.0/1">The Minister has half answered my question before I have asked it, but I am happy to give him the opportunity to provide the other half of a reply. All countries should diversify risk in their economies. The issue is not between Russia or the European Union. If the conditions are right, both could provide huge opportunities for the Government and the people of Belarus, as the Minister says.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.108.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" speakername="Kim Howells" colnum="108"  time="015:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0007.htm#08071682000482">
	<p pid="b.108.1/1">Yes, I could not agree more. The question posed by the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire about what to do about the predominance of Russian gas flowing into central Europe and topping up the gas supplies that are distributed around mainland Europe is a serious one, and not just in relation to Belarus's position as a country of passage. It could do very well out of that role if proper tolls and fees were paid. Part of its wealth in the past came from it, when cargoes of all sorts passed back and forth across that great region.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/2">What we should do about the Russian domination of gas supplies to the European Union is a serious question. The plans to build a submerged pipeline under the Baltic sea, bypassing Poland, throw up all kinds of political issues that we could debate at another time. I hope that we will.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/3">The hon. Member for Rayleigh reminded us that Belarus has been occupied by invading armies on a number of occasions and has liberated itself, sometimes with help. I think he was making the point that its liberty has been hard won many times. I am convinced that the will to confirm independence, sovereignty and democracy is very much alive in Belarus, and that the Belarusians draw strength from the fact that they can look across their northern and western frontiers to countries where those values flourish. That is important.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/4">Two years ago, the European Union published a document with the wonderful EU title, &quot;What the European Union could bring to Belarus&quot;. I do not know who dreamed up that title. It was probably some kind of a consultancy to which we paid a lot of money. I shall not get <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2031" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> going on that, but I am sure he would agree. The paper contains examples of how the people of Belarus could benefit from a renewed dialogue with the EU, and says what the Belarusian Government need to do to achieve that. If Belarus takes steps towards achieving internationally recognised standards of democracy, the EU is ready to offer it a strong co-operative relationship based on mutual respect. I shall try to answer some of the hon. Lady's questions on this aspect of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/5">As the hon. Member for The Wrekin said, a good relationship with the EU would give foreign investors more confidence in Belarus. Belarusian products would get greater access to the EU market and Belarusian people would find it easier to travel to the EU for business, education or holidays. When I asked departmental officials how much trade and investment there is between our countries, I was quite shocked by the answer. Belarus has a population of nearly 10 million, but trade between our countries is tiny. The latest figures that I have are for 2005, when UK exports to Belarus totalled &pound;7 million&mdash;that is nothing&mdash;and consisted mainly of chemicals, textiles and machinery.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/6">Imports from Belarus, however, totalled &pound;276 million, so we are an important market for that country. It sent us mostly oil and oil products. To reinforce the hon. Gentleman's point, that is a bad sign. I am sure that that money is very useful to Belarus&mdash;&pound;276 million in hard currency is not to be sniffed at&mdash;but it would be wonderful if it came from other products. It is a sign that there is great potential in Belarus to produce other things and diversify, but that is not happening. That is why the hon. Gentleman's comments on diversification and investment were so important.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/7">The established collective position of the EU is that Belarus should begin to make demonstrable and irreversible progress on certain issues that are listed in the document, &quot;What the European Union could bring to Belarus&quot;. Those issues include free and fair elections, freedom of the media, and non-governmental organisations being allowed to work without restrictions. Other issues are the release of political prisoners, an independent judicial system, the end of arbitrary detention and arrest, and respect for the rights of minorities. Belarus would also be expected to allow people to join trade unions, allow people to run their own businesses, abolish the death penalty and accept the support and advice of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/8">We want to have the kind of relationship with Belarus that we have with other eastern neighbours, such as Ukraine and Moldova, which have taken significant steps towards democracy in the past few years. One of the EU's great achievements is the impact that it is able to have on its neighbours in that respect. Only last week, a delegation from the EU visited Belarus to discuss the forthcoming elections, and I was pleased to hear that the Belarusian authorities were ready to talk to the delegation. That is a good sign, and I very much hope that dialogue will continue. We will try to ensure that it does. The authorities can be in no doubt that the EU has much to offer Belarus, and it is their choice whether to accept that help.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/9">All hon. Members who have spoken discussed human rights. To become a respected member of the international community, the Belarusian Government must respect the human rights of their people. Life in Belarus can be difficult for people who speak out against the authorities and for human rights. Their possessions could be confiscated or their businesses closed down. They face arrest, detention, interrogation and even physical abuse. We want Belarus to be a close friend and a good neighbour to the EU, but that cannot happen while those who are brave enough to question the Belarusian Government face such severe treatment for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/10">I take this opportunity to offer our support to Belarus's three current political prisoners, Alexander Kozulin, Andrei Kim and Sergei Parsyukevich, and I call for their immediate release. I am sure all hon. Members who have taken part in the debate would echo those sentiments.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/11">The UK is using bilateral programme funds to support civil society, particularly in the fields of human rights and independent media. Freedom of expression&mdash;through the media, for example&mdash;is fundamentally important to any democratic society. We hope that the new mass media law that the Government passed in June will not be used as a tool to oppress non-state media and foreign journalists. We welcome the progressive aspects of the law, which simplifies the registration process and takes international practice into account, but the law contains several worrying new provisions, including one that bans the financing of a mass media outlet from abroad or from any other so-called anonymous source. That is a potential threat to the development of independent journalists in Belarus.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/12">Let me address the hon. Lady's point about visas and children from Chernobyl. My hon. Friend the Minister for Europe has taken a special interest in the Belarusian children who have been affected by the Chernobyl fallout and who come to the UK and other countries for the respite care that is arranged by numerous charities. The distribution of their visas is a huge operation. To give an idea of the scale involved, in 2007, the British embassy in Minsk issued about 3,600 free visas to children who were sponsored by Chernobyl charities. I am proud that the UK is able to help, and that when those children return to Belarus, they take back happy memories of their time here.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/13">When we introduced biometric visas for Belarus, we planned to open a seasonal collection facility in Gomel Oblast specifically for children who were coming to the UK for respite care. I looked on a map to find it, and I can show hon. Members &mdash;I am never quite sure how one uses visual aids in a debate, Mr. Hancock&mdash;where Chernobyl is. The wind was blown from the south-west and covered an area including towns and villages close to Gomel. We wanted to set up a biometric centre there specifically for those children, but the Belarusian Government blocked that proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/14">In response, we developed a bespoke mobile project, which is unique in the world, and the embassy and UK Border Agency devoted considerable resources to its planning and implementation. We send a team with a mobile biometric data collection machine to the cities of Mogilev and Gomel in the areas of Belarus from where 85 per cent. of the children outside Minsk come. The project seems to have been a great success. So far 843 children have given their details, with more to come. At the end of the peak season for applications, we will review the project and see whether we need to make any changes for next year. I hope that will ease any concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/15">As the hon. Member for The Wrekin reminded us, the debate comes at an important time, as Belarus prepares for parliamentary elections in September. Belarus does not have a strong democratic tradition. It has a tradition of fighting for freedom and democracy, but that has been stifled for many years by repressive regimes. The OSCE described the 2006 presidential elections as</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/16" class="indent">&quot;severely flawed due to the arbitrary use of state power and restrictions on basic rights&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/17">The EU said of local elections in 2007 that</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/18" class="indent">&quot;rights to freedom of opinion, of association and of assembly, as well as the rights of the opposition, were seriously impaired&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/19">We have been encouraged by statements from Belarus that the elections will be democratic. President Lukashenko himself said:</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/20" class="indent">&quot;The election campaign should be as open and democratic as possible and absolutely transparent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/21">From this place, I call on him to uphold those declarations. I am pleased that Belarus has invited election observers from the OSCE to monitor the elections. That is a good sign, but we have also seen worrying signs. We are concerned about the pressure that the authorities are putting on the opposition. The regime is using administrative powers to discourage opposition members from standing in the elections, and some opposition members have lost their jobs because of their decision. Others have found their tax records scrutinised to find errors that disbar them from standing. There are restrictions on meetings, demonstrations and assemblies, and people have been arrested for distributing leaflets. Opposition organisations have been refused permission to register with the authorities, and those activities do not live up to the &quot;open and democratic&quot; promise made by President Lukashenko.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/22">The Belarusian economy has been performing relatively well. According to the World Bank, average income per head last year was about $4,000. The country has a highly skilled and capable work force; Belarus does not need aid, it needs foreign investment, as the hon. Member for The Wrekin told us. If Belarus is to maintain its economic independence, it needs to take steps to liberalise its economy and open up to European and wider international investment. The EU is Belarus's second largest trading partner after Russia, although trade has declined since the EU withdrew the generalised system of preferences in 2007 because of the mistreatment of workers. Again, the EU stands ready to help Belarus, including through a re-energised programme under the European neighbourhood policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/23">I shall finish by describing what the United Kingdom intends to do in Belarus as the elections approach. We will provide election observers, at the request of the OSCE. We will watch the election process carefully, making sure that the authorities treat opposition parties fairly. We will continue our long-standing support of democratic organisations, we will support efforts in the EU to promote democracy in Belarus, and we will ensure that the EU is ready to react to the elections in September.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/24">I know that the hon. Gentleman will follow our activity closely over the next six months, and I hope that in the autumn we will be able to talk about Belarus again and congratulate it on a well-run election. I encourage the Belarusian authorities to live up to the spirit of the public statements that they have made about the election, and to take the advice of the OSCE mission. If, and only if, that happens, can the EU engage with Belarus as a fellow European country.</p>

	Local Housing Allowance (Highlands)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.113.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="113"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0008.htm#08071682000484">
	<p pid="b.113.2/1">I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for allowing this short debate, and I am pleased to see the Minister in his place. In my past role of shadowing his Department I had the privilege on a number of occasions of debating a number of issues with him, including local housing allowance. I look forward to discussing the matter in the spirit of combative co-operation that characterised past debates.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/2">I shall say a few words to put the debate into context. The Minister knows&mdash;I have mentioned this before when debating local housing allowance in Committee and so on&mdash;that there are particular problems in the highlands with the availability of affordable housing and social housing. The Highland council area has a housing waiting list of at least 10,000, and the shortage of housing that local people on low wages and benefits can afford is probably the major social problem afflicting the area. That may surprise some people, but I am sure that the problem is equally considerable in the Minister's constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/3">In the city of Inverness, as well as in rural towns and villages, people's ability to live in the communities where they were born and grew up, even when they have access to employment, is constrained in the social housing sector by the low rates of pay in the highlands, so the role of housing benefit in providing support for people on low incomes who want to live in the private rented sector is particularly important to make such housing tenure more affordable. I am sure that the Minister is also aware of the report by the Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland, which shows that in the current financial year the Scottish Government are planning a 25 per cent. cut in funding for affordable housing in the highlands. That is not the direction in which policy should be going.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/4">On local housing allowance, the Minister knows that I have always taken the view that in principle the reforms to the housing benefit system that led to local housing allowance are good in principle, and a number of its features offer advantages over the previous housing benefit system. One, which the Minister has talked about, is what is known as the shopping-around benefit. The rate is set and if people can find a cheaper property, they can keep some of the difference. That is an incentive, partly to keep rents down and partly for people to shop around. The other side of the equation means that people whose rent is higher must pay the difference. The LHA system makes that clear, and I have no problem with the way in which it is made clear. The purpose of this debate is not to challenge the basis of the system, but to draw to the Minister's attention some questions about how it operates in the highland context.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/5">The first issue that I want to draw to the Minister's attention concerns the shopping-around benefit. I know that there are plans to introduce a further welfare reform Bill and I understand that details will be announced in a couple of weeks. This area is one that may be considered again, and I hope that it will be useful if I inject a couple of ideas for the Minister's consideration at this late stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/6">I want to draw hon. Members' attention to two issues that are causing problems in the highlands. One problem is the absolute level of local housing allowance payable in the highland area; the second is the constraints of the local housing allowance in terms of incentives to work, which, in fairness, is in common with the problems of the previous housing benefit system. Both issues have been drawn to my attention by individual constituents affected by them, and by the local authority and other organisations that work in the area and support people&mdash;particularly the homeless&mdash;during their transition into work.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/7">First, on the absolute level of LHA that is payable, the Minister will know that the Highland council is treated as one broad rental market area for the purposes of setting housing benefit rates. Certainly, from the local authority's point of view, there is no problem with having a single rental area. The question is what assessment has been made of the appropriate level of rent to be paid within that area and the effect it is having, particularly in the city of Inverness. The Minister will know that, for example, the LHA rate in the highland area for one-bedroom accommodation with shared facilities is &pound;69.09 a week and that that increases to &pound;170.53 a week for a four-bedroom property. Obviously, there are a range of options in between.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/8">I want to draw the Minister's attention to the significant shortfalls in the rental market in Inverness. In the context of people who are on low incomes, the significant rises that have recently taken place in rent levels in the private sector in Inverness have meant that, depending on the size of the property, there are shortfalls ranging from about &pound;50 to &pound;100 during the course of a month. Of course, that adds up to a significant amount of money during a year&mdash;perhaps &pound;600 to &pound;1,200. For those who are entitled to the maximum LHA, having to find that money on top of the benefit that they receive is a significant problem. However, a taper to the benefit means that the benefit is withdrawn at a sharp rate when someone's income rises&mdash;I think 65p in the pound is the figure, but the Minister will correct me if that is wrong. In particular, those in low-income jobs are experiencing a dramatic shortfall.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/9">The purpose of the taper is to ensure that people who are in work make a contribution to their rent, and, of course, that is right. However, the point I am making is that particularly in Inverness there is a significant shortfall in the availability of accommodation in the private rental sector. From the research I have done and the comments made to me by constituents, the maximum LHA appears to be lower that the average rental level. When we debated this in the Committee on the Welfare Reform Bill, I understood that the intention was to try to find an average level, so that there would be some levels above and some below. I think the word &quot;median&quot; was used by Ministers in the Bill Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/10">Particularly in Inverness, it seems that the rental market is significantly below that level. In principle, from the Government's point of view, that has one cost: the shopping-around benefit is not as freely available as Ministers intended it to be when we started dealing with the matter. Secondly, from my constituents' point of view, a large number of people are facing shortfalls, even when they are on the maximum level of local housing allowance. That is causing serious financial hardship at a time when, as hon. Members know, people are under a huge range of other financial pressures in their lives&mdash;for example, rising energy bills and so on. We do not need to go into the detail of that, but it does provide an important element of backdrop and context to the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/11">During the past year or so, we have seen&mdash;and I am sure we will continue to see as the effect of the credit crunch begins to bite&mdash;significant rises in rental levels. There are also constraints on supply in the private rental sector. I would be interested to hear from the Minister how the rate is set and how often the rent officers responsible for establishing the rate in the highlands, who are based in Dundee&mdash;<i>[</i><i>Interruption</i>.<i>]</i> I have nothing against Dundee; I say that because I see that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1974" name="James McGovern">the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. McGovern)</phrase> is here. I am delighted to see him. I would be interested to know how often rent officers travel to Inverness to spend time in the city and look at rent levels to ensure that the local housing allowance is consistent with the objectives of Government policy. At the moment, the rate paid in the highlands is not meeting the objectives that the Minister has set out. In the context of rising levels of rents in the private sector, what instructions has he given to rent officers about the frequency with which local housing allowance rates should be updated?</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/12">Of course, there are also questions about the nature of the broad rental market area itself in the highlands. Any broad market area should be appropriate and a judgment has been made by the Government&mdash;and the council agree with this&mdash;that the highland area should be treated as one broad rental market area. I do not wish to challenge that decision, but I want to say to the Minister that the highlands is a large area that has a significant city&mdash;Inverness&mdash;and lots of rural areas. The local allowance level within such a diverse broad rental market area has to be set at a level that is fair throughout&mdash;it has to be fair to the city and to the rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/13">The Minister will know that in addition to Inverness there are a number of areas outside Inverness where significant pressures on the private rental sector have pushed rents up&mdash;I draw his attention to some of the towns in Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey in my constituency. I know other MPs in the region have similar experiences in other places where the housing market is under particular pressure. The anecdotal evidence I have had from constituents is that the problems of shortfalls in local housing allowance that I am describing also apply in those places.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/14">The issue of work incentives has, again, been drawn to my attention by constituents who feel that the tapering of withdrawal rates of the local housing allowance acts as a disincentive to work. A particular problem for some of the most vulnerable people in our society has been drawn to my attention by those working in the homeless sector. People with serious drug or alcohol problems who are in the initial phase of recovery base themselves in a hostel or other supported environments where the amount of state supported rent payable is particularly high. Examples have been drawn to my attention where getting back into work would be of significant benefit to individuals; yet, the way in which the system is set up and the speed with which benefit is withdrawn once an individual starts work disincentivises at least some of those people to the point that they decide not to take appropriate work.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/15">I will not give the names of people involved in cases, but a case has been drawn to my attention of two twins who were recently started on methadone as a way of recovering from their drug addictions. They were told by advisers at Job Centre Plus that it would be better if they stayed on income support and housing benefit because it would not be financially viable for them to start work while they are in temporary bed- and-breakfast accommodation. Both were well enough trained to get a job and, in the opinion of the people who were advising and supporting them to get into work, doing so would be of significant benefit to them. There are a number of other similar examples.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/16">Of course, that is a problem in the highlands and other areas where there is an accommodation shortage. People tend to spend more time in expensive bed-and-breakfast accommodation and the steepness of the taper means that people who get into work have to rapidly spend a large sum of money to meet the cost of accommodation or be homeless. Alternatively, the choice is not to go into work and face that dilemma.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/17">When thinking through his plans for the next phase of welfare reform, will the Minister give particular consideration to the needs of people who are vulnerable? Both he and Liberal Democrat Members want to see such people get back into work. Will he particularly consider the incentives that the housing benefits system offers to people in that category and whether the costs of temporary accommodation mean that the disincentive to work is very strong indeed? The shortage of housing means that people spend a much longer period in temporary accommodation than they would normally be expected to. The current system might harm someone's ability to recover from their condition and get their life back on track, which is an objective that we all share.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/18">I look forward to hearing the Minister's response and I hope my comments will be useful to him in planning the next phase of welfare reform. In particular, I hope that he will encourage the rent service to take another look at the way in which LHA levels are set in the highlands and that he will ensure that the level is appropriate for all parts of such a large area.</p>

	<p pid="b.116.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase>&mdash;on this occasion, I have listed all the places that he represents, because it is appropriate to do so&mdash;for raising an important issue, and I congratulate him on the way in which he presented his case. I know how closely involved he is with the wider welfare reform agenda. As he said, he and I have debated it before, and I am pleased that we can continue to do so. I welcome his statement on the record, again supporting the broad principles of the reform relating to local housing allowance. I am grateful to him for making clear his position on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/2">It may be helpful if I set out some of the background to the locality reviews that have taken place as part of the introduction of the measure. First and foremost, I want it to be clear that keeping localities under review has always been the responsibility of rent officers. There is nothing new in making changes to boundaries. I welcome what the hon. Gentleman said in support of the new boundaries in his area. Those decisions are considered independently by professional rent officers in the three national services. However, it is true that a fundamental review of localities was undertaken partly in anticipation of the introduction of LHA. It was essential that we delivered on the key aims of LHA, which I know the hon. Gentleman supports. Those aims were to provide greater simplicity in the system and to give customers more choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/3">The localities, or broad rental market areas, on which LHA rates are based need to be large enough to reflect the generality of the local housing market. There is no point in telling our customers that they can make choices about their accommodation, and then restricting localities to areas consisting of just a small neighbourhood or even a few streets. I recognise that there has been a significant reduction in the total number of localities, but that simply reflects the changes in the way in which people access health, education and recreational services.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/4">It is just three months since LHA began to be applied nationally. So far, all reports that we are receiving indicate that the allowance is working well and that its introduction is going smoothly. That is a triumph for closer working between central and local government. The substantial levels of financial and practical support that the Department for Work and Pensions provided in the run-up to the introduction of the allowance have gone hand in hand with the drive and determination of our local authority colleagues to implement the new allowance at local level.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/5">We recognise that the introduction of the allowance is a big change for tenants, local authorities and landlords alike. That was a key part of our decision to introduce it on the basis of new claims and changes of address only. I am grateful to the nine original pathfinder authorities and the second wave group of local authorities which worked so hard to test the LHA scheme for us, through both the formal evaluation process and the work that they have done subsequently to support the introduction of the allowance. LHA was perhaps the most comprehensively evaluated reform ever introduced in respect of housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/6">The advantage is not only that LHA will make demonstrable improvements to the housing benefit system. There is also the contribution that I am convinced it will make to our wider objectives for welfare reform, about which the hon. Gentleman spoke. Central to that is the role that LHA will play in promoting personal responsibility. Five years ago, when we first promoted the idea of direct payments to customers, there was a stack of concerns from many of our stakeholders, but the financial inclusion agenda has moved on since then, and there is no logical or any other argument that should prevent housing benefit tenants from taking responsibility for paying their own rent. On the contrary, the evaluation evidence from the pathfinders clearly shows that the vast majority of our customers can and do make paying their rent their utmost priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/7">We have also given a clear message that we want the housing benefit system to do more to help to support incentives to work. Improving the speed at which housing benefit claims are assessed should help to give people the security that they need and reassure them that their benefit claim will be assessed quickly when they take a job. It is worth reiterating that housing benefit is also an in-work benefit. That point is often not understood, but the benefit can carry on providing support to someone when they move from unemployment into work, notwithstanding the taper point as income levels rise. Furthermore, LHA can play an important role in encouraging people to use bank accounts and become financially independent. I am delighted with the positive feedback that we have had so far from many local authorities on the work that they have been doing with local banks to promote the use of accounts and direct payment.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/8">I come now to the points raised about the highlands area and especially the changes to locality boundaries. As with all the locality reviews, rent officers consulted at local level on the proposed changes. In this case, as the hon. Gentleman said, all five local authorities affected agreed to the proposal in advance. I recognise that the locality that we are discussing covers a large geographical area, but that merely reflects the rural nature of the highlands area and, in particular, the fact that the majority of services that people take advantage of in that area are centred on Inverness.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/9">From a practical perspective, we anticipate that virtually every customer in the highlands area will see no change or will gain when their cases are reviewed by rent officers after 52 weeks. Specifically, the indicative figures that we have available suggest that in relation to the five local authorities, we can anticipate the following impact. The largest local authority caseload is that of the highlands. There, 87 per cent. of people are likely to see virtually no change in their entitlement, and the remainder, 13 per cent., are expected to gain from the change.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/10">The second largest caseload is that of Moray. There, no one should lose out at all and about 11 per cent. should be gainers. In the Shetlands, about one third of customers could gain and the rest will see no change. In Orkney, about 18 per cent. should gain and no one should lose. In Eilean Siar, 6 per cent. may gain and less than 1 per cent. could lose out if they are still claiming after 52 weeks. We believe that, collectively, well over 99 per cent. of existing customers within the locality will see either an increase or no change in their housing benefit as a result of the locality review.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/11">I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman makes about the shortfall that may exist between the level of the allowance and the rents that people face, but that was true also under housing benefit. It is important to stress that the move to LHA will not, with the exception of a very small number of customers, make that situation worse for any of his constituents. For a significant number, it will make the situation better. It will narrow the shortfall, because they will gain under LHA as opposed to what they receive under housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/12">A key advantage of the transparency of LHA is that customers who make a new claim or change their address in the private rented sector now know in advance how much benefit they will receive. That is a marked improvement on the old arrangements under housing benefit. It will enable them to make the right accommodation choices for themselves and their families.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.118.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="118"  time="016:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0009.htm#08071682000486">
	<p pid="b.118.0/1">The Minister makes the point that shortfalls occurred under the old system, too, and he is right about that. What assessment has he made of the numbers of people&mdash;I am particularly interested in the Highland council area, but perhaps he has considered a wider area&mdash;who will make gains on the basis of the shopping around benefit, which was another of the Government's selling points in relation to personal responsibility, under the new system?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.119.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" speakername="James Plaskitt" colnum="119"  time="016:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0009.htm#08071682000487">
	<p pid="b.119.0/1">That is down to choices that people will make as individuals. It is difficult for me to anticipate that. The hon. Gentleman is asking me to anticipate circumstances in which families or individuals seek to move, and then to second-guess what choice they might make about the accommodation that they go to. The whole point of LHA is to hand that choice back to individuals and to give them the foreknowledge of how much support they can receive under LHA for whatever type of accommodation they are considering, in order to enable them to make the choice themselves. It is not possible to guess what they will do. Giving people the freedom to choose is exactly that.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/2">Another important point is that we have, quite rightly, reflected the market definitions in the way in which LHA rates are set. I am referring to their being based on the number of bedrooms in a property, rather than the number of habitable rooms. That is an important part of promoting the transparency of the scheme, for the customers and other stakeholders. After all, no one would advertise a property, for example, as a five-room house. It would be advertised as a three or four-bedroom house. It is essential to note that, as a result of the important change that we have made, local rent review and local housing allowance rates cannot be directly compared in the way that some have suggested.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/3">More importantly, however, I stress that we have never said that we intend to move existing customers from the present scheme to the new LHA rules. Those concerns are unfounded, and we have undertaken to review the first two years of the scheme before making decisions on whether, and if so how, we might migrate existing customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/4">I appreciate that there are concerns about the availability of rented housing in the Highlands area&mdash;and in my constituency, too&mdash;but given the current position, I do not accept that the introduction of LHA will adversely impact on a customer's ability to find suitable accommodation. Indeed, for a significant number it will help.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/5">There is no doubt that housing benefit plays a vital role in supporting people on low incomes. In many cases, those customers would simply have nowhere to live without such support. It is therefore imperative not only to provide an excellent service to our customers, but to continue to put housing benefit at the heart of the social security reform agenda. We know that housing benefit can play a key role in helping people back into work, in securing decent accommodation and in keeping pensioners out of poverty.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.120.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" speakername="Jim Devine" colnum="120"  time="016:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0009.htm#08071682000488">
	<p pid="b.120.1/1">Three months ago, I stood here and made some serious allegations about the world's largest health care regulator&mdash;the Nursing and Midwifery Council. I claimed that the NMC was a fundamentally dysfunctional organisation, with poor governance, a lack of transparency and a culture of bullying and racism. The NMC strenuously denied those accusations, claiming that it did not recognise the organisation that I had described. The NMC might not have recognised that description, but others certainly did, and they came forward to the inquiry ordered by the Minister in response to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.1/2">That inquiry, conducted by the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, confirmed those serious allegations, yet the NMC continued almost to be in denial. The CHRE's damning report was given to the council on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-06">6 June</phrase>, nearly six weeks ago, yet it has taken it until today to hold an urgent meeting to discuss the report's findings. However, other things occurred during those six weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.1/3">Of particular concern to me is what has happened to my constituent, Moi Ali. She was vice-president of the Nursing and Midwifery Council, a role that she took very seriously. She had longstanding concerns about the NMC, and she and others continually raised those matters internally. However, she was rendered powerless; she believed that the president, the chief executive and others had excluded her and subjected her to a prolonged campaign of harassment and bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.1/4">The things that happened to her are frankly disgraceful. I am therefore pleased to report that, having found a prima facie case of racism, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission is providing Moi Ali with legal support in her case against the NMC. The full details of her treatment will be heard at a tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.1/5">Ms Ali came to see me just before Christmas to tell me of her serious concerns. She gave me hard evidence to back up each and every one of her allegations. She told me that she was not alone in being worried about the NMC's ability to protect the public. She showed me a letter that she and seven other members of the NMC&mdash;a third of the council&mdash;had sent in June last year to Lord Hunt, then Health Minister, pleading for help while there was still time to get the NMC back on course. Sadly, he declined to reply. A civil servant wrote to them stating that the NMC's problems should be resolved from within, despite those council members' well-founded belief that the NMC was incapable of doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.1/6">Astonishingly, the Department of Health told the NMC about the confidential whistleblowing letter to Lord Hunt. What was the NMC response? Did it ask Moi Ali, who openly admitted signing the letter, for a copy? No. It secretly spent thousands of pounds, money that was intended for public protection, on lawyers in a bid to obtain the letter from the Department. Did it ask Moi Ali about her governance concerns? No. Instead, it mounted a witch hunt to unmask the other signatories, who were understandably too afraid to step forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.1/2">My hon. Friend will, I am sure, be shocked to hear what happened to Jenny Traves of Birchgrove in my constituency in her dealings with the Nursing and Midwifery Council. She heard about a professional misconduct hearing against her independent midwife only through the local press, even though she was the patient involved. She went to the hearing in order to praise the midwife for her care and sensitivity following the stillbirth of a daughter. However, her truthfulness was questioned and her evidence dismissed. Her hospital notes were used at the hearing without her consent. She was asked to leave the hearing when her baby started gurgling, but was not allowed in again, even though the baby was by then asleep. To cap it all, one panel member fell asleep; and the panel had obviously been given no training. Does my hon. Friend not agree that that is a poor way to carry out such proceedings?</p>

	<p pid="b.121.2/1">Order. Before the hon. Gentleman replies, I urge Members to be extremely careful. If that case is the subject of a tribunal hearing, it might be prejudicial to the person's case if too much of it is discussed here. Although the case might not be sub judice, what is said might be prejudicial to the outcome of the tribunal. I would hate it if we had put someone in a disadvantageous position because what had been said here.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.3/1">I am grateful, Mr. Hancock, for that advice. I was very aware of the problem when preparing my speech. I have received a document from the Independent Midwives Association, and since I first raised the question in March, I have been inundated with complaints similar to that mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1481" name="Julie Morgan">the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/2">The NMC spent tens of thousands of pounds on pursuing a formal investigation. The letter to Lord Hunt was sent more than a year ago and the CHRE report clearly vindicates the actions of the signatories, yet the disciplinary investigation continues. Those council members have been subjected to a year of considerable stress merely for doing the right thing in seeking Government help for the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.3/3">When the CHRE report was published, Ms Ali and the other whistleblowers breathed a sigh of relief, as their concerns and actions were completely vindicated. However, that sense of relief was short-lived. Civil servants&mdash;those who had refused to help&mdash;pressured my constituent into resigning. She refused. From her perspective, she was the good guy. She had helped to expose the wrongdoing, having first tried to address it internally. She was the victim of bullying, so why should she resign? The civil servants said that as she was part of the leadership, she had to go. The fact that she had been actively and deliberately excluded from any leadership role was totally ignored.</p>

	<p pid="b.122.0/1">I followed the previous debate, and I am following today's. The House has passed legislation on the protection of whistleblowers. Has my hon. Friend's constituent been able to make use of that? My hon. Friend also mentioned money; how many thousands of pounds will be needed to stifle this discussion?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.122.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" speakername="Jim Devine" colnum="122"  time="016:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0009.htm#08071682000495">
	<p pid="b.122.1/1">I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. I shall deal later with the fact that whistle-blowing has excluded people such as Moi Ali. As for the money, I understand that nearly &pound;400,000 has been spent.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.1/2">In the House of Commons, the Minister publicly called for the resignation of my constituent, and in the same breath congratulated the president and the chief executive for showing leadership by resigning. My constituent maintains that those people were part of the problem, yet they got pats on the back, whereas she was forced out. The people in charge of the mess have supposedly resigned, yet they continue to lead the organisation. The president will demit office, but not until next month, more than two months after receiving the report. Perversely, she intends to remain an NMC member and is claiming not to have known about the problems despite being on the council for years. Amazingly, the chief executive has given no indication when she will go. The immediate past president, Sandra Arthur, who is widely acknowledged to have played a principal role in this terrible mess, has made no statement about her position and appears to have no intention of resigning from the council.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.1/3">If we have any doubt about the incompetence of the organisation, we need only look at the contents of a report that has been produced by NHS London about a man called David Britten, a nurse who had sexual relations with 23 different women patients. The NHS London report states:</p>
	<p pid="b.122.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We were concerned at the lack of cooperation we received from the Nursing and Midwifery Council during this investigation&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.122.1/5">and goes on to detail that the organisation actually blocked the investigation. NHS London was not given access to files on the man. He was sacked by the health authority in 2002, yet continued to practise till 2004 and was not removed. This man was a beast and should not have been anywhere near patients, but because of the prevailing problems within the NMC, his behaviour was allowed to continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.1/6">May I give some detail of what was going on? One of the 23 patients was treated as an out-patient from late 2000 until early 2001. The sexual relationship continued during that time. When she went to the clinic, they would engage in heavy petting and oral sex in his office. David Britten continued to telephone her after his suspension. Today, Professor Morris-Thompson, the senior nurse in London, said that the NMC was very unhelpful during the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.1/7">As a trade union official who has worked in the health service I have read many such reports, but I can say that this case is appalling. The Minister will be as embarrassed as I am about the details of it and the NMC's behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.0/1">I could not claim to be totally familiar with the case to which my hon. Friend is referring, but I am aware&mdash;I do not think he has mentioned this&mdash;that the 23 patients who were manipulated into sexual relationships were extremely vulnerable. They were not what we would regard as normal patients, but people in a very vulnerable condition.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that clarification. That is exactly right. The man was in charge of an eating disorder clinic, and my hon. Friend is right that the patients were vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/2">Those are exactly the issues that Moi Ali raised both internally and with the Minister last year. Moi Ali is a fairly well-known author; she has her own public relations company and is without any doubt a leader in her field, and she has been a member of other public bodies. As a consequence of resigning, she was forced to resign from NHS Lothian, for which she was an independent board member who sought to serve the interests of the people in my constituency. Why? She was forced to resign because the chairman of the health board did not wish to be associated with anyone who had a leadership role in the NMC, despite the fact that she was denied such a role and was the victim of bullying, not the perpetrator.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/3">Where do we go from here? I am sure that the Minister will talk about the report and the fact that the NMC behaved in such an appalling manner to the inquiry that was set up in 2006. The NMC is there to protect the public from individuals such as David Britten, but instead of co-operating fully, as the report says, the NMC was not helpful.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.1/4">The chief executive of the NMC must leave immediately, making way for an interim troubleshooter who can restore sound management to the organisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.2/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that although it is appropriate for Members of Parliament to defend their constituents, it is incumbent on them to be circumspect under parliamentary privilege about people who are not able to defend themselves in this Chamber.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.3/1">I totally agree and accept what the hon. Gentleman says, but I have been told, informally, about problems within the NMC for the last three or four years, even before I was in this place, and nothing was done. I have files about three inches thick with complaints of the type that we have heard. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has not had a chance to read the report, but when he does, he will recognise my concerns, and that the solutions that I am offering are valid.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/2">The president also needs to go. It is gross hypocrisy for either official to spend one more day in office. The past president should also resign from the council. Those people have no credibility and the report shows that they put public protection anywhere but first. It is a nonsense that individuals who have been found wanting by an independent review are still in charge of the world's biggest regulator&mdash;it governs the actions of about a third of the NHS regulated work force, 700,000 nurses, throughout the UK. That is a scandal, and while the situation continues, no one&mdash;nurses, midwives and the public&mdash;can have any faith in the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/3">The vice-president should receive public acknowledgment from Government for the positive role that she played to help bring such matters into the public domain. The whistleblowers who tipped the Government off about problems at the NMC should have the ludicrous disciplinary procedures that have been brought against them dropped immediately. They have done nothing wrong, and it is a waste of hard-up nurses' and midwives' registration fees to pursue them when the money should be spent on public protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/4">Many mistakes have been made in this saga, and many questions need to be answered. As the problems at the NMC are long-standing, will the Minister explain how previous CHRE annual reviews provided the organisation with a clean bill of health? Did the NMC systematically provide false and misleading information in previous years to receive favourable reviews from the CHRE? In light of the CHRE report and today's report, will the Minister call in the Charity Commission and the Privy Council to investigate the NMC root and branch? Will the Minister confirm that trustees who are whistleblowers will be given the same legislative protection as employees? If not, will the Minister extend the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 to cover them, so that it will be unlawful for public-spirited whistleblowers to suffer personal detriment as a result of their actions?</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/5">The Minister has some questions to answer and I hope that he does not attempt to distance either the Government or himself from the debacle. Members of Parliament and members of trade unions have been formally and informally advising Ministers of the problem for well over a year. Will the Minister place on record when he was first advised of the matter and what action he took? On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-17">17 June</phrase>, prior to Health questions, he advised me that the trade unions, including Unison, and the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives were demanding that Moi Ali go. They will feel that they were on the wrong side of the debate when they read today's report. How was contact with those organisations made? How can we ensure, given that there is an all-appointed committee, that we can resolve problems with leadership?</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/6">This has been a sorry saga, and hopefully we are coming to the end of it. Nothing short of righting the wrongs will begin to restore public trust and confidence in this most important organisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.124.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase> on once again raising this important issue and thank him for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/2">It is important to make it clear from the outset that the NMC is an independent professional regulatory body, and one that has been in trouble for some time. The locus for ministerial or any other outside interference in such a body is limited. As my hon. Friend will know, having followed the matter closely, one of the main challenges facing the council has been a complete breakdown of relations among its leadership and on the council. Quite rightly, he has concerned himself with the case of one of the individuals concerned, the outgoing vice-president, who is his constituent. However, he will be aware that other members of the NMC's leadership have taken a different view from hers. Indeed, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> intervened on behalf of his constituent, the outgoing chief executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.0/3">It is not the Government's job to take sides in a dispute such as this, nor should it be. Given the length, depth and rancour of the disagreements that have plagued the NMC's leadership, that would be impossible.</p>

	<p pid="b.125.0/1">I hear what the Minister says about not intervening, but he will be aware of the correspondence that he has signed off to the chief executive, the president and the vice-president, which is a clear and forceful Government intervention in the matter.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-16b.125.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="125"  time="016:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/halltext/80716h0010.htm#08071682000502">
	<p pid="b.125.1/1">Yes, and of course I will come to that in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/2">We have not passed judgment on the performance of any of the individuals concerned, and we will not do so. When my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston and others initially raised their concerns, we urged the NMC to try to address them. However, by the time he secured his previous Adjournment debate on the subject, in March, it was clear to both him and me that the NMC was not capable of resolving its difficulties itself. In light of that, I asked the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence&mdash;the regulator of regulators&mdash;to expedite its routine annual report on the NMC and to address specifically whether the NMC was performing its statutory functions. We also alerted the Charity Commission to our concerns about the NMC. At the time, my hon. Friend welcomed those courses of action.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/3">The CHRE subsequently spent considerable time and resources looking into the NMC. Its work was led by its highly respected chief executive, Harry Cayton, who has had a long and distinguished career in the public service and representing patients' interests. At the end of that process, the CHRE published its report on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-16">16 June</phrase>. It was devastating. Without seeking to apportion blame to any particular individual, it stated that the leadership of the NMC had failed to carry out its statutory duties to the standard that the public had a right to expect and that it had lost the confidence of some of its stakeholders. It further stated that there was little evidence that the council had the leadership to extract itself from its current difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/4">After I had discussed the investigation and the report with the chief executive and chair of the CHRE, the chief nursing officer, Unison, the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwifery, it was clear to me that the NMC would not be in a position to recover unless its chief executive, president and vice-president all stepped down. That is the background to the letters I sent to those three people. I made it clear that we did not have the power to remove them or force their resignation, but that we believed that it would be in the best interests of both the NMC and themselves if they stepped down from their positions. I said that if Ministers were questioned on the matter in Parliament, we would have to answer accordingly. We welcome the leadership shown by all three in deciding to step down.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.1/5">As for the NMC itself, it will now be important for it to demonstrate how it plans to address the recommendations made in the CHRE report. For its part, my Department considers that the NMC should put in place an action plan to implement all the recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="b.126.1/1">The vice-president has gone, although there was no requirement on her to leave the council altogether, and the president has indicated that she will depart her position in August. The chief executive has also indicated her intention to resign, but I imagine that as an employee, she will have some contractual arrangements to discuss.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/2">The NMC might wish to consider seeking independent support to help it look afresh at its fitness-to-practise procedures. I note that today, the RCM, RCN, Unison and Unite have jointly offered to help the NMC and urged it to give serious consideration to making an external appointment. They also made a number of other sensible recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/3">The Government believe that the existing system, whereby professional members are elected to the council, has contributed to the difficulties faced by the NMC. We are changing its governance, and that of all the other health care regulatory bodies, so that in future all members will be appointed. We believe that should help to resolve the council's underlying problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/4">As a result of the CHRE report, we are also accelerating the planned reforms to the governance of the NMC. The Nursing and Midwifery (Amendment) Order 2008 has now received Royal Assent, and we are already consulting on a new constitution order for the NMC. We intend that the new council will be appointed through the Appointments Commission against set criteria of skills and competencies, which will ensure that all members of the council are competent board members. We propose to include in the constitution order provisions to allow both council members and employees to notify the Privy Council if they have concerns about a council member and consider that the member should be removed. We are on track to have a new, wholly appointed council in place by 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/5">I turn to the specific points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-24">24 June</phrase>, the trade unions made a clear statement. The RCN, Unison and the RCM stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The CHRE report makes it clear that these problems are of long standing and have not been addressed with the speed that they should have been...We commend the actions of the President and Chief Executive in putting the interests of the organisation first and we would urge the vice president to do so also.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/7">My hon. Friend asked me when I first heard of the problems to which he has referred. It was when he intervened during the Report stage of the Health and Social Care Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-18">18 February</phrase>. After that, we agreed to have a private meeting. He then secured his Adjournment debate, which took over from that private meeting. Ever since then, we have been in close contact, as I have been with other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/8">My hon. Friend asked about the allegation that the CHRE report findings contradict its own performance assessment made in March. Of course, that is a matter for the CHRE, and I understand that it has said that that is not the case. He is welcome to take the matter up with the CHRE, and I understand that he has had a number of conversations with its chief executive in recent weeks. I am sure that the chief executive will be happy to speak to him about the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/9">Many difficult issues have been raised in the debate. However, we believe that it is important that the Government remain focused on what matters most, which is ensuring public and patient safety. That requires a robust system of professional regulation, with adequate checks to monitor the performance of regulatory bodies and detect problems before patient safety is compromised.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/10">My hon. Friend asked about the David Britten case. The CHRE's performance review of the NMC, although it covered a period later than that of the David Britten case, raised significant concerns about the NMC's fitness-to-practise procedures and highlighted delays in investigating cases on occasion. As I have said, it is important for the NMC to put in place plans to address the concerns raised in both the CHRE report and the report on the David Britten case.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/11">There will always be a balance to strike to ensure that the bodies regulating health professionals are independent of Government as well as of the professions that they regulate. The performance review process undertaken by the CHRE is an important component of the regulatory system and helps to ensure that the right checks and balances are in place. This is clearly a difficult time for the NMC, and I am sure that everyone in the Chamber supports the council in addressing the issues raised in the report. I hope that it will soon be in a position to provide reassurance about how it plans to proceed, and that we will then be able to draw a line under what has happened and look to the future and a fresh start for the NMC.</p>
