	<p pid="a.73.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and I shall say more about that later. He has no need to apologise for being part of this debate, although he has a land-locked constituency, because the pattern of sea use these days is no longer confined to coastal and island communities, as would have been the case in previous generations. The sea is increasingly used for leisure, for example, by people who go from land-locked or inland communities to the coast for a day, a week or for weekends, or whatever. That has been a growing sector in sea use recent years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-21a.74.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" speakername="Alistair Carmichael" colnum="74"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080521/halltext/80521h0001.htm#08052164000448">
	<p pid="a.74.0/1">My right hon. and learned Friend makes a good point. Leisure users of the sea can choose to go to sea, whether coastguard cover is withdrawn or reduced. However, fishermen, especially inshore fishermen, who work within exceptionally tight margins cannot choose because the financial imperative will force them to go out to sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/2">I suspect that after this debate there might be a queue of senior civil servants wanting to take my right hon. and learned Friend to the Fifeness station but, if there is not, if I were him I would probably just go anyway.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/3">I am concerned that, if we move to two, three or four-day strikes, the contingency planning will be stretched beyond credibility. The contingency planning for a one-day strike has been described to me by a coastguard manager as relying on string and sticky tape. I say to the Minister that string and sticky tape will not last more than 24 hours. I hope that he will be honest and realistic with the House and the general public about what contingency planning arrangements can seriously and properly be made before a longer strike. I hope that such a prospect will prompt the Government to act before the contingency planning is necessary. There can be no doubt, because it is now on the record, that if something goes wrong in the event of a longer strike as a result of insufficient contingency planning and there is loss of life or environmental damage, nobody can say, &quot;We didn't know. We weren't warned,&quot; because they have been warned here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/4">It is worth reflecting on how we got into this position. There has been a history of low pay in the coastguard. If we go back far enough, historically, people were coming to the coastguard from the Royal Navy after retirement and, as a result of the substantial pension they brought with them, did not need the same level of pay. However, that is no longer the case and has not been so for many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/5">Our coastguard performs a highly technical and highly responsible operation. If right hon. and hon. Members have not been in a coastguard operations room I would encourage them to do so at the first available opportunity. In many ways it is a bit like being on the deck of the starship Enterprise. The coastguard is a highly technical, skilled operation, the development of which has been a deliberate policy on the part of the Government, although we have not always found that easy. The closure of Pentland and Oban coastguard stations was part of a rationalisation process that relied heavily on that technical development. However, we must have people who are well-motivated and resourced to make the technology work.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/6">The situation rumbled on, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> mentioned, until about 2006, at which point there was a comparability study instituted by the management of the MCA, which instructed KIS Solutions Ltd. That study was never published and its contents and its analysis of the situation are known only to those who were party to the pay negotiations at the time. However, it demonstrated a gap between the coastguards and those working in comparable emergency services. That study was declared by the management at the time as being of no value, but no further specification of that was given and, as a result of that declaration, a below-inflation pay increase was imposed and the longer term issues were not addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/7">In 2007, a new chief executive was appointed. Many of us hoped that that appointment would mark a new beginning in the negotiations and, for some time, it appeared that that would be so. At the instigation of the chief executive a pay benchmarking analysis was undertaken that was finally agreed on in October 2007. That analysis concluded that a coastguard watch assistant was up to &pound;4,500 per annum behind where they ought to be. No figure was agreed for the coastguard watch officers, because the evidence was, in the management's view&mdash;to use their terms&mdash;less compelling. Of course, it could be less compelling given the position with regard to the watch assistants. However, there is still plenty of scope for a fairly compelling case to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/8">It is worth putting on the record the figures that we are talking about. A coastguard watch assistant earns between &pound;12,509 and &pound;14,384 a year; a watch officer earns between &pound;14,742 and &pound;18,717 a year; and a coastguard watch manager earns between &pound;19,744 and &pound;25,702 per week&mdash;if only! I should, of course, have said &quot;per year&quot;. A watch officer and a watch manager routinely take control of major search and rescue co-ordinations. They also make the decision that the time has come to give up the search, which involves saying to the family of the person who is missing, &quot;We are not going to find your loved one. We are giving up the search.&quot; Right hon. and hon. Members might ask themselves whether they would be prepared to say that to a grieving family who do not know where their loved one is. Would they be prepared to do that for less than &pound;15,000 a year?</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/9">We talk about comparability with the fire, police and ambulance services, but the comparability is not exact; in fact, the situation is even more acute for the coastguard. In respect of fire, ambulance or police operations on the ground, that is the point at which the control room gives up. It is different for the coastguard, where the operations room retains control of what is going on on the ground from beginning to end.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.0/10">I hope that my framing the subject for debate quite widely is not lost on the Minister. I do not want this debate to be just about the dispute: it has to be about how we have got to this situation and what we are going to do in future, once we have got past the dispute.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.1/1">I have no doubt that the resolution to this dispute will ultimately come from the Treasury. Equally, I have no doubt that the Minister has the key role in making the case. The benefit of this debate is that he can go to the Treasury and say that the issue is heating up politically and will not go away, so a solution must be found. In the present set-up, morale is on a downward spiral, and a large element of false economy is entering the equation. We are investing in training for watch officers particularly, only to see them take the training and then take their skills elsewhere where they can obtain much better remuneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/2">In his answer to my recent parliamentary question the Minister said that the cost of staff advertising and recruitment had risen from &pound;59,000 in 1998-99 to &pound;252,000 in the year just ended. I have outstanding questions to the Minister about staff retention, but management has told the unions that between 2003 and 2007, 105 coastguard watch assistants left the agency and 51 of them had less than two years' experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/3">We must look ahead, and at why operational staff in the agency feel so demoralised and undervalued. The Minister may wish to reflect on the message that is sent to operational coastguard staff when the board of the agency does not include a single person with operational experience as a coastguard. When we have got through the present difficult period, we must take a long hard look at the coastguard, and why we have got where we are. I welcome this debate as the first step in that process.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-21a.81.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" speakername="John Leech" colnum="81"  time="010:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080521/halltext/80521h0002.htm#08052164000465">
	<p pid="a.81.1/1">I add my congratulations to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> on securing this very important debate. I confess that it feels a bit strange to be responding from the Front Bench to my hon. Friend, who used to be my boss in the transport team and probably knows considerably more about all things watery than I do. I pay tribute to the work he has done to try to force the Government into action to deal with the ongoing dispute. As well as securing this debate, he has questioned the Prime Minister, called for a parliamentary statement from the Secretary of State and tabled early-day motion 1188 on Maritime and Coastguard Agency strike action, which has been backed by 68 right hon. and hon. Members from no fewer than six political parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/2">I also pay tribute to the work done by MCA staff, who save lives daily. I express my appreciation to Paul Smith, the MCA section secretary for the Public and Commercial Services Union for taking the time to discuss the union's concerns with me and providing us all with a briefing for the debate. I record my interest as an active member of the PCS all-party group.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/3">I shall touch on a number of issues, many of which have been mentioned. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the contingency arrangements for the strikes that have taken place and what action is planned to deal with any escalation of strike action. There has clearly been some difference of opinion between management and the PCS about the MCA's ability to cope with the strikes.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/4">In a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland regarding contingency arrangements, the Minister referred to the redeployment of &quot;experienced managers&quot;. I would like to hear whether those experienced managers were experienced in the operational duties to which they were redeployed during the strikes. Does the Minister accept that the agency muddled through the one-day strikes, and that staff in Shetland did not strike because they were concerned about the safety implications of staff being away from work?</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/5">In the same written answer, the Minister confirmed that the agency would approach contingency planning for any future strike action in the same way. Given that strike action is likely to escalate into a 48-hour strike, I strongly urge him to review that decision, because from the perspective of the PCS, although the agency may have been able to muddle through during a 24-hour strike, it will simply not be able to cope with a 48-hour walkout.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland referred to recruitment and retention in the MCA. When it was first established, the coastguard was a very different organisation. It tended to recruit staff who were just finishing a career at sea in either the merchant navy or the Royal Navy. They came ashore with a pension and saw an opportunity to remain in the industry by taking a job with the coastguard. For many, it was a way of supplementing their pension. Since then, the job has changed out of all recognition, but the pay structure remains stuck in the 1970s. As a result, the MCA has a real problem with recruitment and retention. Yes, people are still coming into the service, but many leave within the first couple of years, fully trained and often going to better-paid jobs in which their experience is better remunerated. Between 2003 and 2007, of 175 new recruits, 41 left within two years and, as my hon. Friend said, of all staff leaving the service between 2003 and 2007, almost 50 per cent. left with less than two years of service.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/7">In answer to another written question from my hon. Friend, the Minister confirmed that more than &pound;1.1 million was spent on recruitment between 2003 and 2007. Some of that money would have been better spent trying to retain fully trained staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/8">In the summer of 2006, management and the trade unions agreed during their pay negotiations that management would undertake a comparability study, examining pay levels in the agency and those of other emergency services and similar staff. It was understood that the work would delay the 2006 pay discussions, but it was thought essential by unions and management and therefore worth while. The work was undertaken by KIS-Solutions Ltd.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/9">The report was produced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-06">6 December 2006</phrase>. However, it was not published or made available except to those involved in the pay negotiations. Its analysis demonstrated that although a range of salary levels is paid to ambulance, fire service and police control room staff, who enjoy varying conditions of service, they have a consistent pay lead over MCA staff who work in operation rooms. In addition, levels of responsibility and accountability vary considerably, with MCA staff having the most involvement in ongoing operations. Management's response was to dismiss the report, declaring that it was of no value. It proposed a below-inflation pay offer that did not maintain cost of living increases or address the long-standing problem of pay comparability.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/10">Following the appointment of Peter Cardy as the MCA's chief executive in June 2007, agreement was reached on carrying out a further comparability study. The final draft was broadly agreed by the PCS in September 2007 but it was rejected by Prospect, the other union involved. Joint work highlighted a shortfall in salary for a watch assistant, estimated to be in the region of up to &pound;4,500, as has been mentioned by a number of hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/11">PCS has always been ready to accept benchmarking against the other emergency services, despite the fact that MCA staff maintain control of operations until their completion, quite unlike the police, the fire service and ambulance services. It is true that MCA staff do not handle as many calls as the other emergency services, but they have to make tough decisions about when to call off a search. Such decisions cannot be taken lightly. The agency accepts that pay levels need addressing, but it has failed to come up with a solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/12">In December 2007, the unions were informed that management wished to make a pay offer that would cover a four-year period&mdash;one that would</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/13" class="indent">&quot;go a long way to addressing concerns over pay levels&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/14">However, it was never made because permission to make the offer was withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/15">The real sticking point is the Government's current drive to keep down public sector pay awards. In January Peter Cardy said:</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/16" class="indent">&quot;Anything that we might want to do is constrained by public sector pay policy. So even if we had the money...We would not be in a position to pay more than the Treasury will allow us to pay.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/17">That merely confirmed what the Minister said in a letter to Paul Smith of PCS in November:</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/18" class="indent">&quot;You are aware of the Prime Minister's and the Chancellor's position on public sector pay, which applies as much to the MCA as it does to the rest of the Department and the Civil Service more generally. It is clear that the MCA will need to operate within the context of that wider pay policy and the need to control public spending.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/19">That is a smokescreen. The dispute is not about an annual pay award, although public sector workers are understandably concerned at receiving pay increases much lower than the increased cost of living. No; it is about long-standing pay levels that fall significantly behind comparable workers in the other emergency services.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/20">I suspect that most people would be shocked to hear that some workers will get a pay rise in October simply to avoid falling below the new minimum wage. That is not acceptable. The Minister is a reasonable man. We need to hear from him that the Government accept that the dispute is not about this year's pay award. It is about fairness, and ensuring that staff are paid a salary that reflects their high level of responsibility and is comparable to workers in other emergency services. We would like the Government to commit themselves to resolving the dispute. We would like the Minister to agree to a binding, independent review of pay for staff in the MCA.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> on calling this debate. The topic is important and, as a number of hon. Members have said, proper discussion of it by the House is long overdue.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">Before getting down to the serious matter of pay, I wish to pick out three points that featured in the hon. Gentleman's speech. The first is that the Government have been warned about contingency planning and the problems that may arise if things go wrong during a two-day or three-day strike. Secondly, because of the MCA's structure, those in its top tier are, in a sense, professionally divorced. I do not attack any individual, but the top tier managers come from a different pool from those who work at the sharp end. That is a point for further thinking. Thirdly, I was pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman say that we must not lose sight of the position of the many thousands of volunteers in the MCA, of which he said his father was a distinguished member. I shall return to that subject later.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">The coastguards have become the forgotten emergency service. Although 95 per cent. of all goods by weight imported into this country come by sea, few of us make more than a short ferry trip in a vessel. I bow to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2004" name="Angus MacNeil">the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr. MacNeil)</phrase> and his fishing experience. I have in my constituency a small group of fishermen who play an important part in the community. Day by day and week by week, we all see the activities of the police, the fire brigade and the ambulance service, but it is all too easy to forget the essential work of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4">Almost everything that arrives in our shops or appears on our plates that has been imported has come by sea. The MCA is the glue that holds whole thing together in the United Kingdom. It regulates our position as a flag state and as a port state; it inspects all British ships and keeps an eye on foreign-flagged ships entering UK harbours. However, our debate has focused on its most vital work, which is co-ordinating rescues. The 1,250 staff of the MCA answered more than 21,000 distress calls last year, with almost 50,000 seafarers potentially at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/5">When I visited my local coastguard headquarters in Dover&mdash;the visit was kindly facilitated by the Minister, who took some trouble to overcome the various complications mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1984" name="Menzies Campbell">the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase>&mdash;I was struck by one image: a photograph of a group of volunteers, led by a full-time coastguard professional, abseiling down a cliff to rescue a young woman who had fallen over the edge. Normally, those who fall over the cliff do not survive. Miraculously, her fall was broken at 120 ft by a fridge that had been illegally dumped. If the House will forgive my levity on such a serious subject, it gives a new meaning to recycling! That case reminds us, of course, that MCA staff do not save only people out at sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/6">The storms earlier this year, in which we saw three large ships founder, should help to focus all our minds on the dangers still inherent in the seafarer's life. According to the MCA's report, of the more than 1,400 ships registered in the UK, an average of 150 are involved in a maritime incident of some kind each year. To add a footnote to that, the bishop who is the head of the Apostleship of the Sea, in a moving speech in the Speaker's apartments two or three years ago, reminded us that although a spillage of oil invariably gets national and international headlines for days on end, the deaths of mariners at sea frequently only make the smallest entry in the media. The coastguard is of course involved in both situations.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/7">Coastguards must co-ordinate a bewildering number of different bodies when they answer a call, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, military search and rescue teams&mdash;there are plans for all rather than some of the helicopters involved to be operated by MCA by 2012&mdash;mountain and cave rescue teams for incidents on cliffs, and ambulance and fire crews. Kent Fire and Rescue Service is often involved in offshore work. In addition, coastguards have their own search and rescue teams on the coastline. The men and women of the MCA deserve our praise and admiration.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/8">When visiting the Dover headquarters, I was mightily impressed with the way in which the people there, who are experts on the sea, used every kind of modern technology. The dual-tracking system, based on satellite tracking and radar, puts the lie to idea of the old sea dog gazing through a telescope, although they also had a nice pair of high-powered binoculars&mdash;the mark 1 eyeball is always there as a back-up. We must accept that those people have been treated shabbily.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has put a point of considerable significance on the record. I shall not comment further because he made it so well.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/2">Two groups of strikes&mdash;three days of professional action and a single volunteer strike&mdash;have taken place in a sector that has never before taken industrial action, which is an indictment of the Government's approach to the coastguards. We know what has caused the problem: it is not the lack of an energetic Minister in post&mdash;the Minister knows that I have the highest personal admiration for him&mdash;but that the public finances are in a terrible mess. The official excuse used by the Government to justify the situation is that they need to keep pay increases down generally to fight inflation. However, inflation is running at 4 per cent. on the retail prices index, so offering only a 2.5 per increase means that the salaries of those men and women is reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/3">The sad truth is that we cannot make reasonable pay increases in some parts of the public sector because there is not enough money in the kitty. Borrowing figures for this year have risen exponentially. In March 2006, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer predicted that Government borrowing would be &pound;25 billion in 2008-09, but within a year it had almost doubled to &pound;40 billion. When the current Chancellor introduced his first Budget, borrowing was &pound;43 billion, and by the second, emergency Budget, it had crossed the &pound;45 billion mark.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/4">The Government have run out of money and any incoming Government would be in the same situation&mdash;neck deep in debt. Because of the deteriorating state of the public finances, nobody is in a position to make a firm promise at the next election to raise coastguards' salaries to a given figure. However, I can tell the House that I have had a fruitful discussion, given the extreme circumstances, with the Conservative's Treasury team, and I have their approval to say that if our party is elected, we will review the MCA's position in the context of comparison with the other emergency services.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to ask that question. By agreeing to a review in the context of the other public emergency services, and knowing that the MCA's position is different, the Treasury team have made a considerable concession. Clearly, no party or Government would give a blank cheque to a review and guarantee that any proposals will be implemented in full; they must first see what comes up in the review. Not because the sums involved are large&mdash;the hon. Gentleman and others have pointed that they are small&mdash;but because of the precedent that any measure could set for other sectors, the transport and Treasury teams have agreed to hold a review in the context of the other emergency services.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/2">That Her Majesty's coastguards, both professional and volunteer, have felt compelled to go out on strike should be a source of considerable shame for the Government. The Minister knows that I do not blame him personally&mdash;the blame for our disintegrating economy lies a lot further up the ministerial pay scale&mdash;but he should apologise to the brave men and women who guard our coasts and take the responsibility of co-ordinating not only rescue operations, but the routine work beforehand. They deserve our gratitude, so it is sad to see them voting with their feet.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I will return to the way forward later. If he will let me, however, I first want to lay out the position.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/2">Under the 2007 pay deal, which was imposed in March 2008, MCA staff received an average increase of 3.8 per cent., with some individuals receiving just over 7 per cent. In addition, some staff received a non-consolidated pay bonus, while most staff received an element of performance-related pay. At the current rates of pay, as colleagues have said, a coastguard watch assistant&mdash;the most junior grade in the coastguard&mdash;who works only day shifts will earn between &pound;12,509 and &pound;14,384. However, most CWAs work a range of shifts and are therefore also entitled to a 25 per cent. shift allowance. Typically, staff at that level who work a range of shifts earn about &pound;16,500 per annum, which rises to a maximum of almost &pound;18,000. A coastguard watch officer with a couple of years' experience who works a range of shifts will earn between &pound;20,000 and &pound;23,400. Of course, there are other benefits, including membership of the principal civil service pension scheme, with its range of guaranteed benefits for individual members and their dependents, as well as six weeks' annual leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/3">Much has been made of the comparison between the pay of MCA staff and staff in other organisations, but such comparisons are largely unhelpful because, in many ways, the MCA is a unique organisation. On closer examination, there are often significant differences between the roles and responsibilities of staff holding similar positions in apparently comparable organisations. One example is the number of emergency calls received.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.1/4">Several hon. Members have suggested that contingency planning was put together with string and sticky tape, to quote the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, but I can assure him that the arrangements have worked well. If there are longer disruptions, appropriate contingency arrangements will obviously have to be put in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman. He is not a local man, but they have cars in Orkney and Shetland, I suppose.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/2">I look to the Minister for an old-fashioned common-sense approach&mdash;a commodity too often in short supply here in Westminster, I am sorry to say. This is not merely the story of one little driving test centre fighting for its own survival. In Somerset alone, the axe is poised to fall on several centres. The Minister has the demeanour of somebody who thinks that he knows the argument pretty well by now, as he has been wheeled out so many times recently to bat for the defence. As he dons his pads and oils his willow again today, I urge him to pause and put a substantial cricket box down his trousers too. I shall be bowling, I hope, with a sure eye and a lot of speed, but I guarantee no spin. I always leave that to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/3">If the Minister asked his official driver nicely, I have no doubt that he could be whisked down to the bracing seaside town of Minehead, but he should be warned that it is a grunting pig of a journey once one leaves the motorway. Our so-called A road is, unfortunately, much closer to a Z road. The British economy may be going to pot, but Somerset's roads have long since gone to potholes. The Australian outback and the dirt tracks of downtrodden Delhi offer safer driving conditions. Bumping and bending one's way from Taunton or Bridgwater towards Minehead is like riding the wall of death on a unicycle. It is not funny; there have been endless fatal accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/4">On the A358 from Williton to Taunton, there have been an average of three deaths a month over the past five years, as well as 161 other casualties. The Liberal Democrats in county hall are Scrooge-like when it comes to running repairs. Her Majesty's Government have not held them to account, and have looked the other way when we have asked them to make the council spend more money on the roads. As a result, the main road in question is becoming more like a human abattoir. That is not my phrase; it was coined by one of the many highly experienced driving instructors who dread the closure of the Minehead driving test centre. They know the score&mdash;they have counted the carnage among their pupils. I have been arguing the case for 10 years against what seems like a blind Government juggernaut: the Driving Standards Agency&mdash;the self-contained quango monster that seeks to do to driving tests what McDonald's has done to gourmet cooking. If the DSA has any DNA, I can readily detect some of its genetic faults. It loves to move things around and sometimes, I suspect&mdash;I am sorry to say this, but it is common in other Departments&mdash;it does so just for the sake of the move.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/5">When Minehead's test centre was first threatened with closure in 1998, the DSA was based in Newcastle upon Tyne&mdash;a fine city from which I hail&mdash;but today the DSA is in Cardiff, so look out, boyos. Heaven knows what it cost to move that entire bureaucracy. The DSA's blinkered ethos has not changed at all. It still has a &quot;let's offer less and call it more&quot; mentality. It wants to cut radically the number of driving test centres throughout the United Kingdom and replace them with brand spanking new ones, but far fewer of them. That is being done partly in the name of efficiency and partly because the Government have agreed to sign up to new European driving standards, which will mean harder written tests and a more taxing time for motorcycle riders, who are far more vulnerable as road users.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/6">I have no problem with making the tests more stringent, but I protest strongly about using the stiff new motorcycle tests as one of the key reasons for shutting my local driving test centre. We do not test motorcyclists in Minehead, and we never have, but of course it must seem so much easier to lump everybody together in one place and pretend that money is being saved. The brave new world of multi-purpose driving centres sounds so mouth-watering.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/7">Here are some of the super, soar-away, sexy details about the DSA's plans, taken this morning from its website:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/8" class="indent">&quot;All customers will receive information on important road safety messages via LCD screens fitted in the waiting areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/9">Hurray, just what we always wanted. Here we are wetting ourselves in case we run over the white lines or an old lady, and the DSA wants us to watch grisly road safety films first. The website also says:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/10" class="indent">&quot;Discussions are taking place around using the new centres to engage the local community in 'safe driving for life' initiatives.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/11">Oh yeah? I have not heard of any such discussions. That sounds like politically correct garbage. I have yet to meet a driving test candidate who ever went back to the driving test centre, except to take the test again. The website continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/12" class="indent">&quot;It is intended that most car test customers will not have to travel more than our current travel distance criteria&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/13">That is bad grammar. It is also total bunk, because of the appalling state of the roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/14" class="indent">&quot;Most motorcycle test customers should be able to reach their nearest test centre within 45 minutes, travelling no more than 20 miles&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/15">That is completely irrelevant, as I have said.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/16">According to the website, there will be</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/17" class="indent">&quot;Off-road parking for customers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/18">That is not actually a problem in Minehead. We have quite a lot of parking. There will also be posh new loos and showers for the staff. As any Blackpool landlady would say&mdash;the Minister and I have suffered it&mdash;&quot;Shower, lad? You should have had a shower before you came.&quot; We have all been there. The next one takes the biscuit:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/19" class="indent">&quot;New furniture and fittings will enhance the customer experience&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/20">What are they talking about? When I took my driving test, I was far too worried about mucking up the three-point turn to notice the colour-co-ordinated fabric on the chairs in the waiting room, although it is a while ago now. Given the nervous state of most driving test candidates, cheap wipe-down surfaces might make more sense&mdash;stand by with the Dettol.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/21">Unfortunately, the situation is serious. It has been 10 ridiculous years in the making, involving an ever-changing list of excuses for closing a perfectly good and popular local test centre. I ask the House to think back to 1998, when the famous song &quot;Things Can Only Get Better&quot; was still ringing in our ears. I am sure that we all remember it, although perhaps not in Crewe and Nantwich. The sight of Peter Mandelson humming along still gives us all the shivers, I suspect, but never mind. In 1998, Cherie Blair had not yet been on an overnight trip to Balmoral, and the Minister had no wrinkles at all, and perhaps even no grey hairs. With your permission, Mr. Benton, I quote the Driving Standards Agency's excuse of the year 1998 for wanting to shut the Minehead test centre:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/22" class="indent">&quot;Test routes are not considered representative of modern day driving conditions because they lack dual carriageways and roads with speed limits above 50 mph&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/23">Ten years later, we still have no dual carriageways, and 50 mph is the average speed between Minehead and Taunton and Bridgwater. That is what the signs say.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/24">We also have incredibly dangerous roads. If we seriously intend to teach people to drive safely on such roads, surely the best and only way is to teach and test in the area itself, but the DSA wants to shut the Minehead centre and move everything to Taunton, to one of the flash new centres with road safety films and cloth seats. How are poor young drivers going to get to the test centre? Down the killer roads, of course, but when they take off for the test centre, they will not have a driving instructor next to them with dual controls in case something goes wrong. If the DSA gets its way, test candidates will be accidents waiting to happen on their way along some of Britain's most dangerous roads. I am not talking through my hat&mdash;that is what the police and the most experienced driving instructors say.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/25">I am afraid that one size does not fit all if one lives in west Somerset, and I would suggest that one size should not be made to fit all when flesh and blood are at stake. The DSA is putting itself at risk of causing people serious harm, or perhaps worse. We need to keep our test centre because&mdash;I am going to be crude&mdash;we need to keep death off our roads. Driving is not a luxury in my neck of the woods, but an expensive day-to-day necessity. The roads are in a poor state of repair, but it requires infinite patience to take a bus, because the county council has cut bus subsidies as well as been incredibly mean with fresh tarmac. If the test centre is shifted to the county town, the driving instructors will have to go too, and so will their customers. They will have to go to Taunton to take meaningful lessons, but it costs a lot of money to get to Taunton&mdash;more money. I am genuinely concerned about the possibility of some young people simply shrugging their shoulders and breaking the law instead. The whole country has a problem with unlicensed driving&mdash;that is not news. However, by moving the centre to Taunton we might be encouraging even more lawlessness, which nobody wants.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/26">I am also disturbed by the way in which the DSA has ignored so many good, solid and constructive efforts in Minehead to keep the test centre in place. At one time, it appeared that the test centre would have to find new premises because its landlords&mdash;the local council&mdash;had other plans for the building. That might have been the DSA's excuse for saying, &quot;Okay folks, it's time to go to Taunton,&quot; but instead it paid lip service to the efforts made by the council&mdash;I praise councillor Keith Ross and West Somerset district council for trying to sort this out&mdash;the driving instructors and many others, including Minehead town council, to find alternative premises. The DSA did not attempt to discourage the search for new sites, but actively encouraged and urged us to look. Thus, it wasted everyone's time, while pretending that it wanted to listen. With the help of West Somerset district council, no fewer than half a dozen workable sites were found and investigated, but the DSA said no to all of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/27">For a whole decade, this blessed body, the DSA, has used a raft of different excuses to shut our test centre. There was the faint possibility of new European regulations, so we had a period of so-called consultation where all the arguments were advanced and the DSA ignored them. It tried to use the new motorbike tests as an excuse, but Minehead does not test motorbikes, and never has, as I said before. Now the DSA is relying on winning friends and influencing people with showers for the staff, and comfy chairs for the candidates. It stinks!</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/28">One other rather important point has been roundly ignored. The Minister's driver is probably sitting at the wheel of his environmentally friendly Toyota right now. We all care about our carbon footprint, more so in the countryside, but this time the DSA has put its oversize carbon boots right in the deep doo-doo. The journey from Minehead to Taunton might look like a quick hop on a map, especially if one is sitting in the DSA's Cardiff office, but in fact it is a gas-guzzling, stop-start trek from start to finish. I honestly suggest that the Minister tries it. It is dangerous, costly and a carbon nightmare.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.3/29">I read the Minister's speech on this subject after <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> asked about the situation in his area. I do not envy the Minister his task of finding something sensible to say about a very unpopular and senseless decision. To many of my constituents, the loss of the Minehead test centre could be a tragedy. It is not necessary; I promise the Minister that it has nothing to do with EU legislation; it could cause accidents; it may lead to lawlessness, and it could be the very opposite of going green. In fact, the only things in its favour are those wretched new comfy chairs. To many of my constituents, the DSA's initials now stand for: dreadful, senseless and arrogant.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.1/1">I cannot answer the question exactly, but the virus would have been around prior to 1989. It was detected in 1989 and researched, and we are where we are today. I do not think that it has been around for a very long time. We are still discovering new hepatitis viruses, and they have been given letters of the alphabet from A to E. We may be up to G now.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/2">HCV is an enveloped ribonucleic acid of the flaviviride family and is incredibly difficult to destroy. It is capable of surviving in dried blood for up to three months&mdash;much longer than HBV. It has a high mutation rate, and it is thought that six strains, each with 40 sub-strains, currently exist, which are capable of spontaneous mutation. That is the problem. For that reason, it has not been possible to develop a vaccine for preventive treatment of HCV.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/3">The Hepatitis C Trust believes that as many as 500,000 people may be infected with HCV in the UK, with 90 per cent.&mdash;certainly 80 to 90 per cent.&mdash;of them being completely unaware that they are carrying the virus. An estimated 130 million people are affected by HCV worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/4">The earlier a person is diagnosed with HCV, the easier it is to treat them. Treatments are more limited for HCV than they are for HBV. Treatment for HCV is carried out through combination therapy. The complete treatment programme, which combines a daily tablet of ribavarin with a weekly injection of alpha interferon, costs an amazing &pound;15,000, and not everybody is cured. About 55 per cent. of the people who undergo the combination therapy will be cured. The rest will not, and they may or may not live longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/5">People tell me that the combination therapy is not very nice. I have spoken to several people who have undergone it. It lasts between six months and a year, and most people cannot work while they are undergoing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/6">The cost is &pound;15,000 per year, but I put it to my hon. Friend the Minister that the cost of a liver transplant, even if a liver were available to transplant into the patient, costs considerably more than preventing people from getting HCV in the first place or treating them when they have been infected by it.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.1/1">I know about of the tragic loss of my hon. Friend's second husband from liver cancer. Although as a chemist I have limited knowledge of medicine, I am in favour of opting out of organ donation, rather than opting into it. That is a controversial topic in this place. I have carried an organ donation card for decades and renewed it recently to ensure that my name is still on the list, although I am afraid that I am almost 68 and my organs are a bit knackered compared with those of a younger person, so they may not be useful any more.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/2">In March 2001, the Department of Health commissioned a hepatitis C strategy for England, which was released for discussion in August 2002. I am pleased that the hepatitis C action plan for England was published in July 2004. The all-party group on hepatology, which was formed only in 2003&mdash;in the presence of the late George Best, who was one of our original patrons&mdash;and the Hepatitis C Trust became concerned about the implementation of the Government's plans, so we jointly published &quot;The Hepatitis C Scandal&quot; in March 2005 to voice our concerns about that area of clinical practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May 2006</phrase>, we published the results of a survey of primary care trusts and NHS hospital trusts. Questionnaires were sent to all of them, and as we received the answers we marked the implementation of the plan on a scale ranging from one to 10&mdash;one being poor and 10 being the best. About 63 per cent. of PCTs responded, but only 8 per cent. of them demonstrated effective implementation of the hepatitis C action plan laid down by the Government, with a further 56 per cent. demonstrating that they had taken some action and the remainder&mdash;36 per cent.&mdash;demonstrating only minimal implementation of the plan in 2006. Where a patient lived at that time very much determined whether they received a diagnosis or, having received a diagnosis, treatment for hepatitis C virus infection. Indeed, our report was titled &quot;A Matter of Chance&quot;. In 2006, 65 per cent. of NHS hospital trusts responded, and 39 of the 85 hospital trusts reported significant delays for treatment. Waiting times varied from one week to one year, which is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/4">Jointly, with the Hepatitis C Trust, our all-party group has just repeated that survey. Our current report, &quot;Location, Location, Location&quot;, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-14">14 February</phrase> this year. About 84 per cent. of PCTs responded on this occasion. There has been a significant improvement since the last survey, but still only 36 per cent. of PCTs are implementing the hepatitis C action plan for England effectively this year. I am pleased to say that Bolton PCT&mdash;my own PCT&mdash;is one of the best, scoring nine out of 10 points. Unacceptably, 15 per cent. of the responding PCTs have demonstrated minimal or no implementation at all, while 49 per cent. demonstrated that they have taken some action. Mid Essex PCT scored no points, Dudley PCT and South West Essex PCT each scored one point, while Lincolnshire NHS Teaching PCT, Western Cheshire PCT and Newcastle PCT scored only three points. Those were the worst responders among the primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/5">Some 59 per cent.&mdash;37 of the 63&mdash;of the NHS hospital trusts that responded reported that some of their patients had to wait more than three months for their first consultation at the hospital. In addition, they said that referral waiting times to see a consultant varied from three to 20 weeks and that patients waited a further two to 24 weeks for treatment to commence. Adding those figures together gives an unacceptably long period, which we need to reduce. Less than two thirds&mdash;62 per cent.&mdash;of responding NHS hospital trusts are confident that they will have the necessary infrastructure in place to ensure that all hepatitis C positive patients can start treatment within 18 weeks, which is the target for December 2008 set by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/6">The Government's action plan was launched more than three years ago and its limited implementation is putting a lot of people's lives at risk, so we are calling for action now from the Secretary of State for Health in four ways. First, we want the introduction of a world-class commissioning pilot in the treatment of those diagnosed positive for HCV. Secondly, we want a good practice model developed for service organisation and delivery as part of a wider reform strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of HCV carriers. Thirdly, we want the Secretary of State to incentivise general practitioner HCV case-finding by inclusion in a quality and outcomes framework. Fourthly, we want the Government to conduct a national audit of GP practice for HCV, based on the model being piloted for cancer referral and diagnosis. Those campaigning on behalf of patients with hepatitis B virus want similar progress made by the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/7">Consultants report that immigration brings in both HBV and HCV&mdash;their words, not mine&mdash;and they believe that we should be screening new arrivals who will be settling in Britain, not tourists I hasten to add, for both viruses, if not all the hepatitic viruses. Hepatitis B and C are ticking time bombs for the NHS, and in light of the evidence I have presented today, I think my hon. Friend the Minister will agree that we need to review both the diagnosis and treatment of those who could be carrying those viruses. They are readily transmitted, blood-borne viruses, so the more people who carry HCV and HBV, the greater the risk of further transmission, with the inevitable consequences for the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.107.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for raising that matter. It is a sensitive subject. I, too, have a large Muslim population in my constituency, as she knows. I have not personally discussed the matter with my Muslim constituents, but as it has been mentioned in the debate, I promise my hon. Friend that I will have such discussions. I am sure that the Minister and his officials have listened to what my hon. Friend has said. I hope that, in relation to what I have said already about organ donation, we can extend that conversation to the whole Muslim population throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.1/2">The prevalence of HBV and HCV and the mortality rate they both cause is now on the same scale as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria worldwide, yet there is nowhere near the same level of awareness of viral hepatitis as of those other diseases. Additionally, there does not seem to be the political will to tackle it. A recent survey of Members of Parliament showed that one third of them think that there is a vaccine for hepatitis C when there is not, 44 per cent. do not know that hepatitis C can lead to cancer&mdash;yet it can&mdash;and half of them have been contacted by a constituent about hepatitis C. I am not blaming or criticising my right hon. or hon. Friends, but if that is the case among Members of Parliament, how can we expect our constituents to be aware of these dreadful diseases? I have also heard that many general practitioners are not fully educated in the facts I have presented to the House today.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.1/3">In May 2004, a number of organisations associated with liver disease, including the British Liver Trust&mdash;a charity&mdash;and the British Association for the Study of the Liver published the &quot;National Plan for Liver Services UK&quot;, which I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister or other Ministers in his Department have seen. They published the document in an attempt to persuade the Government to develop a national service framework for this major area of clinical practice. What consideration, if any, has the Minister's Department given to that plan?</p>
	<p pid="a.107.1/4">In conclusion, I hope that I have demonstrated to right hon. and hon. Members today and to people outside Parliament, including those in the medical profession, that tackling these diseases&mdash;liver diseases in general, but particularly the hepatitis diseases I have mentioned&mdash;needs to be done much more ferociously, otherwise the ticking time bomb that I have mentioned will explode upon us.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase> on speaking in such a reflective and sensible way. He has highlighted an issue that frankly needs far more oxygen in order to have an impact on many families and individuals. I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1532" name="Bob Laxton">the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Laxton)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his work as chairman of the all-party group on hepatology over a significant period.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/2">It is always good to see my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>. He has unique expertise on many of the issues that he brings to the House, particularly from a scientific point of view. The notion of needing to move the health service from a sickness system to a well-being system is at the heart of our vision for a world-class health service. It has been mentioned by the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and Lord Darzi. When we publish the next stage review and the NHS constitution, we need to move from the rhetoric of moving from sickness to well-being and make it a reality. That must happen not only through our national policies but through the decisions, particularly commissioning decisions, made in every local health economy in every part of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East referred to David Fielding. It is appropriate to remember that these issues involve human beings&mdash;we are talking about people's families and their life expectancy&mdash;and it is important that we hear stories of hope such as that of David Fielding. Many listening to our debate may be extremely anxious about their future because they have HCV, so it was important to hear about the David Fielding case. It was also right to pay tribute to the courage of the late Anita Roddick. HCV carries a significant stigma, and the fact that a prominent and successful member of society was willing to talk about it was itself a significant contribution. Her family's ongoing commitment to help with the issue is greatly appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> made a sensible contribution. She spoke about the Government's commitment, and that of international institutions, to the notion of a world hepatitis day. If such a proposal comes before a future world health assembly, we will consider it. I raise only a slight caution; I think that all hon. Members are aware of it. With so many days and weeks now focusing on a variety of specific issues, the danger is that the notion will become devalued. We need to think carefully about the idea, but in principle I think that it makes some sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> made a non-party-political, helpful and constructive contribution to the debate. I hope that he does not mind my saying so, but I wonder about the parenting skills involved in lecturing one's daughter about her behaviour during a Westminster Hall debate. None the less, the hon. Gentleman made a serious point about teenagers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-21a.122.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1698" speakername="Margaret Moran" colnum="122"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080521/halltext/80521h0008.htm#08052164000536">
	<p pid="a.122.1/1">I am here to talk about the National Air Traffic Services proposals and plans for the airspace over Luton. It is a supreme irony that we are discussing the proposals just after an announcement by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, relayed on our local radio, about noise maps for Luton. The noise maps form part of the national ambient noise strategy, which has an EU basis and whose purpose is to consider ways to manage noise issues and effects, including road, rail and air traffic noise, and to make noise reduction proposals as necessary. That is some timing: my constituents are being asked how their lives could be made more tranquil when we are in the middle of the biggest&mdash;and, I hope, the noisiest&mdash;row about noise and environmental impact that Luton has ever seen.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/2">National Air Traffic Services proposes to change the flight paths over my constituency and swathes of Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. According to NATS's own estimate, the number of households adversely affected will increase by 111 per cent. under the plans. Let me make it clear that we are not discussing proposals from London Luton airport. I support the airport: it is our major employer, and it brings direct and indirect economic benefits to our town and the region. Like the rest of us, the airport authorities are consultees to the plans. I hope that as good neighbours, they, like my constituents and many colleagues and fellow MPs, will reject the plans. To do otherwise would alienate the local community, which broadly supports the airport, and scupper any good will for growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/3">The NATS plans came as a surprise to many. Looking at the proposals, many of my constituents asked how NATS could possibly be mandated to create a detrimental environmental impact on Luton and the surrounding areas. NATS's stated objective is airspace safety, but it also has a requirement to minimise impact on residential areas. NATS itself says:</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/4" class="indent">&quot;NATS has aimed to position routes to minimise the noise experienced by people and in particular to avoid centring routes over more densely populated areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/5">An innocent reading of the NATS leaflet on the Chilterns and Luton suggests that the good folk of my constituency and the surrounding areas will sleep soundly in their beds, in more ways than one. Many in Luton have not been able to lay hands on that leaflet, but it says that the noise preferential routes for Luton</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/6" class="indent">&quot;would be changed to minimise the population overflown, reduce future delay&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/7">and so on. Nevertheless, buried in its documentation, NATS itself says that the Luton airspace area will be worse off&mdash;indeed, it will be one of the areas worst affected by the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/8">Many of my constituents feel that we have been duped and dumped on, and we demand an alternative. We have been duped because the press releases and leaflets that NATS has issued have been wholly misleading about the impact on my constituents. When NATS launched the proposals in February, it claimed that the new routes would reduce the number of people overflown by 20 per cent. That is not the case. The real impact is a massive shift of aircraft noise from some areas to Luton and the surrounding areas.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-21a.123.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1698" speakername="Margaret Moran" colnum="123"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080521/halltext/80521h0009.htm#08052164000538">
	<p pid="a.123.1/1">Indeed, I intend to do so when I explain the problems and the solutions. To say that my constituents have been duped by a sham consultation is an understatement. Meetings have been held with NATS&mdash;I am told that it consulted various local authorities, including Luton, in 2000 and 2006&mdash;at which the proposals were so unclear that no real response could be given. NATS has proposed no viable option, although, as the hon. Gentleman said, we believe that there is one. No alternatives at all have been proposed for our area, unlike other areas affected by NATS's proposals. There is no mitigation for Luton, even though, according to NATS's own documentation, the proposals are clearly worse for Luton than for any other area in the airspace review.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/2">I was astounded to hear from NATS&mdash;a private company&mdash;that it does not believe that it needs to consult with those directly affected, namely local residents. It consults only with its key stakeholders, relying on councils to do the other consultation for it. Why should the poor council tax payer take on that burden? Some councils have done so, some have not, and some do not have the capacity. As a result of that and the misleading leaflets, my constituents, particularly in Luton itself, have been blissfully unaware of the potentially devastating impact on their lives. They could be sleepwalking into a nightmare.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/3">The consultation has been misleading. It has signally failed to inform residents and thus to encourage responses from them. If they did not receive this hefty tome&mdash;none of my local residents did&mdash;or if they could not translate it, as it was so complex that even London Luton airport had to get an expert consultant to decipher it, the only way that they could possibly know about the impact of the proposals is by scouring the NATS website, assuming they have a computer. My hard-working constituents do not spend their days scouring the NATS website. We have not been properly consulted.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/4">Even an especially keen constituent who got through all that and asked for the sound exposure levels would have to ask for that document separately. It says that the noise levels over the centre of Luton will be more than 80 dB. I am told that that is as high as in a noisy factory, where an employer would be legally required to provide hearing safety equipment. The areas in Luton nearest to departure and landing areas will be overflown at 90 to 1,000 dB, which is so loud that it is off even the scale that NATS uses in its document. By its own admission, NATS's proposals disadvantage Luton and the surrounding areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/5">It has not escaped our attention that the proposals look dangerously familiar. They are very similar to those put forward a few years ago, which would have taken much of the air traffic over the Harpenden and St. Albans area and routed it across Luton and the surrounding areas. We successfully fought off those proposals, but when I questioned NATS representatives about the consultation, they told me proudly, &quot;Oh yes, we pre-consulted with certain councils, and as a result of that consultation&quot;&mdash;pointing to the map&mdash;&quot;we amended our proposals to take traffic away from St. Albans, Harpenden and Wheathampstead and move it over to Luton.&quot; They pointed out the difference between what they had proposed to consult on and what they have proposed to us today. That is the nub of the issue. We are being dumped on by our neighbours. As a result of the pre-consultation, NATS has listened to some areas and not others.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/6">In my constituency, the villages of Caddington, Slip End, Woodside and Aley Green will bear the brunt of increased aircraft noise if the changes are approved, and large swathes of the top, south and centre of Luton will be hugely affected. Some 70 per cent. of all the flights from the western end of the runway will be diverted over the rooftops of south Luton and closer to those villages.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/7">The number of people suffering high noise levels around the airport will increase from 3,000 in 2006 to 10,000 when the new routes are introduced. As NATS itself agreed, none of that takes any account of further airport expansions in any of our surrounding areas. All of the assumptions are untested; the impact could be even more detrimental, because by its own account NATS has used a set of assumptions to change flight paths that cannot be assessed properly until after any airspace changes have been implemented. An addendum to the main document shows that 18,000 people will continue to be overflown by departures from Luton, to whom will be added a further 50,000. The day noise contour is about 57 dB, but no night flight noise contours have been given, although NATS has confirmed that there will be an increase in night flights.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/8">All of that poses one question, to which I received no serious answer in the meeting that I held with NATS, which many of my fellow MPs from Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire attended. How, with these proposals, is NATS meeting its requirement to minimise the impact on residential areas, when it is shifting the impact, especially on the westerly departure route, from non-residential to residential areas? How is it meeting the Government's requirements under the Transport Act 2000 to minimise the impact on residential areas? Clearly, there is no point in NATS telling me, as it did, that it will consider the overall regional impact but cannot provide a proper assessment for Luton and the surrounding areas, which are so densely populated. We are talking not just about decibels, but about people's lives being turned upside down.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/9">We need answers to some key questions: what is the point of making the changes now, when new runways at Stansted and Heathrow are currently under consideration, which means that the proposals will have to be changed again? If Brookmans Park is the bottleneck, which NATS says it is, why not just change flight paths affecting that location? If new routes are required to show the environmental benefits resulting from the change, why is the replacement westerly departure route to be implemented, when it is actually far worse than the existing route that it will replace? If the proposals go ahead, does NATS realise that Luton airport will be under significant pressure to close at night, which would reduce capacity by 10 per cent., thus negating the main aim of the changes, which is to increase capacity?</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/10">In my constituency, at least seven schools will be affected by the proposals, including our new academy, which is currently under the flight path and will be rebuilt as a brand new facility even further under it. Children at schools in the Farley and South area will have their learning affected by high decibel levels, with all the implications for their education.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/11">Although it is argued that the proposed routes will create no additional air pollution&mdash;even though some of the new flight paths are significantly longer than the existing ones&mdash;the proposed routes will move pollution over people who do not suffer from it at the moment. Why?</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/12">Furthermore, having identified a problem at Luton, why did NATS not investigate the consequences of its proposals on night sleep disturbance? It could have done so. The sound exposure level contours were provided after the main consultation, and the populations under them could have been calculated, but NATS chose not to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/13">Let us consider the wider implications. The World Health Organisation has recommended a 60 dB external maximum noise level to avoid sleep disturbance. The 80 dB contour area, proposed here for the noisiest aircraft at Luton, is huge, and the approximately 70 dB contour is itself 10 dB noisier than the recommended level and twice as loud as the world health limit. As the WHO said, the health of populations cannot be guaranteed when noise exceeds 55 dB. And this in an area that already has some of the worst health deprivation, certainly regionally, if not in the UK. How can NATS and the Civil Aviation Authority justify the proposals, if the plans, as we have identified, are likely to affect 30,000 people in Luton and the surrounding areas at night?</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/14">We are one of the Government's growth areas, so the proposals will impact on Government policy on development. We are regenerating Luton: the massive public and private sector regeneration in the town is estimated to exceed &pound;10 billion by 2030. Frankly, Luton, which is a good place to live and work&mdash;that is how we try to promote it&mdash;will be blighted by the proposals, as people in our town centre, university and major companies will all find that the quality of their life and work is adversely affected. Of course, none of that was taken into account by NATS.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/15">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> indicated, however, there is an alternative&mdash;it is a modest ask&mdash;that NATS itself says is viable. However, it was not included in its consultation document. That compromise will allow the retention of the existing westerly departure route, which will mean that the impact will be broadly the same as before the proposals, and less damaging to my constituents in the surrounding areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/16">We are told that the main constraint to the proposals is that the new technology&mdash;P-RNAV&mdash;does not allow any turns to be made until the craft is at least one mile from the end of the runway, which means that P-RNAV cannot be used on the existing route immediately west of the airport. However, NATS representatives confirmed, both at the meeting to which the hon. Gentleman referred and subsequently, that it is possible to design a hybrid situation under which P-RNAV comes into operation two to three miles from the airport, thus allowing the existing system and noise preferential route to be followed for departures and arrivals.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/17">There is no doubt that the current dispersal of aircraft within the current NPR is better for the local residents most affected than a concentration along the proposed new route would be. The highest concentration of residential properties is within the first mile at Luton, which should represent sufficient grounds for NATS to reconsider its proposals. NATS said that it would discuss that alternative with the CAA, but in case the latter needs reminding, it too has strong environmental requirements laid on them by Government under section 70 of the Transport Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/18">I believe that my constituents, and many others in the surrounding areas, have been duped by the proposals and dumped on. We are now demanding that the CAA accepts the alternative, viable proposal, which will do what both NATS and the CAA are charged with doing by the Government and what the present plans patently do not do&mdash;namely, minimise the impact on Luton and the surrounding areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.126.0/1">I begin by apologising for the absence of the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>, but important ministerial business has kept him away from the Chamber today. If, because I do not possess his level of expertise in this area, I cannot answer any of the points raised by my hon. Friend Member for Luton, South (Margaret Moran), I assure that they will be answered in due course in correspondence. I hope that she accepts that.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/2">As well as congratulating my hon. Friend on securing this debate, I compliment her on the way in which she made her case. Clearly she feels extremely strongly about this issue. If she makes her arguments as eloquently and passionately in her response to the consultation exercise launched by NATS, it will be difficult for NATS not to take into account her reservations and the points that she rightly makes.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/3">Before responding to my hon. Friend's specific points, I shall begin by restating that the Government's commitment to sustaining economic growth and protecting the environment is at the heart of the Department for Transport's aviation policy-making process, but a balance needs to be struck. As she rightly said, we need to tackle the environmental challenges, recognise the value of aviation in enabling people to take advantage of business and leisure opportunities and allow the industry to compete internationally. The role of any decision maker on airspace changes is to find the right balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/4">I turn now to NATS' terminal control north airspace change proposal. I must make it clear from the outset that that proposal is still subject to consultation under the CAA's independent airspace change process. I understand my hon. Friend's anger and that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase>. My hon. Friend feels that she has been duped. She also asked if it was a case of whether NATS goes ahead with the proposals. She was right to ask that question, because a consultation exercise is under way and no final decisions have been made. I therefore do not believe that she is justified in feeling duped. The consultation exercise has been extended to <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-19">19 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/5">My hon. Friend how the CAA can justify the proposals, but the CAA is not expected to justify the proposals, because the consultation is still going on.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.1/1">I am pleased that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">the hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase> will respond to this debate because he understands railways very well; he is enthusiastic about them and has been in his post longer than most of his predecessors.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/2">There was an age of the anorak when bewhiskered men met over pints of mild in pubs to discuss schemes for reinvigorating the railways to pre-Beeching days, while comparing timetables with one another. Many schemes were thought up, many were impractical and some were doable, but in those days there was widespread frank indifference and scepticism at the Department for Transport. At the time, there were severe problems with the railways. Network Rail&mdash;Railtrack as it then was&mdash;had substantial financial problems and was more concerned with managing its property portfolio than the railways, which led to its ultimate demise.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/3">I was a member of the Select Committee on Transport and I remember how preoccupied we were in those days with the problem of financial overshoots and the difficulties surrounding the railways as they were, without considering how they might be or how we could progress. To be fair, the Government were coming to terms with the after-effects of railway privatisation&mdash;the fragmentation of the system, running franchises, ensuring that the public interest was protected and so on. They were genuinely worried, as was the Treasury, about financial overshoots in the industry&mdash;in those days they were an horrific and appreciable headache. When the current Chancellor was Secretary of State for Transport, he talked about cutting down the railways and not transporting fresh air around the country. The perspective taken on the railways in those days&mdash;the age of the anorak&mdash;was negative.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/4">That was replaced by what I can only describe as an age of relative optimism. When I first came into Parliament, I had many conversations with Network Rail, which told me insistently that its sole job was to run the railways as they stood, according to the Government's specifications. Subsequently, the organisation started to be more positive, and to talk about growth fund, expansion and increased capacity. It started to talk proactively about what the railways might be, rather than what they were at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/5">That was against a background of capacity problems. It was obvious that having been a financial black hole, the railways were becoming a significant success, but capacity problems arose because, whether due to the difficulty of getting around in cars or whatever, it was clear that more people wanted to use the railways and the infrastructure and stock were not coping well, so overcrowding became an issue. At the same time, it was evident that profitability was up, along with ridership. Crucially, confidence was also up; there was substantial confidence in the railway system and what it could be compared with what it had been.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/6">At around the same time, I remember attending meetings in this place and elsewhere when people talked in heady ways about what could be done to increase capacity in the railway system. I attended a conference with the Minister where Christian Woolmer and the usual folk from <i>Transpor</i><i>t Times</i> made bullish and positive noises about what could and should happen. Clearly, there was and still is a degree of private financial interest in the railways. Firms such as the Kilbride Group and so on sensed that the railways could be a financial winner rather than a financial loser, and both the Government and the private sector started to look forward rather than backwards, or simply at maintaining the existing infrastructure and railway system.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/7">A number of positive ideas came from that. Some were relatively modest&mdash;for example, ways of increasing capacity without involving major new investment. There was talk about increasing capacity by doing simple things such as lengthening platforms and having better interchanges so that people would find the railways genuinely more useful, particularly if they also used other modes of transport. There was also talk about increasing rolling stock, having new and longer trains, and so on. Quite simple things were thought to be a way of dealing with capacity without great financial significance; for example, better timetabling so that trains would be more convenient and the timetables for various franchises would dovetail beneficially.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/8">I have heard, but not seen, that the devolved Administration in Scotland is planning to build new lines or to reopen old lines that have lain fallow. Rail schemes have started to appear in regional transport plans. When regional transport forums were set up, it was uncertain whether transport plans involving rail were within their remit, but some introduced them and were not discouraged by the Department for Transport. Merseyside in Lancashire, where I live, was delighted that schemes such as the Olive Mount Cord were reinstated, because it was long overdue. Quite ambitious projects, such as Crossrail&mdash;I suffered it in the sense of having been on the Committee for longer than I can account for&mdash;went ahead, which was a good sign of confidence and optimism, although we have yet to see Crossrail. At the same time, rail utilisation strategies emerged. They are an invitation for Network Rail and its partners to take a long view of the railways and to think about how we can use them better and make them genuinely more useful for the travelling public.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/9">However, in reality and despite all the optimism, adjustments, variations and minor developments, many good schemes are stuck in the sidings, and there has been little real progress in extending the network. Some schemes have a sound commercial basis, indicating that we can add substantially to network functionality and give people additional reasons for using the railways. I have thought long and hard about why that is so. Part of my explanation, but perhaps not the complete explanation, is that there is no method for progressing good schemes that would enlarge and extend the railway network.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/10">I was a member of the Standing Committee that considered the Railways Act 2005, when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" name="Tony McNulty">the right hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty)</phrase>, now the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, made two comments that have stuck in my mind to this day. He said&mdash;although I have never had any further intimation of this&mdash;that the Department for Transport was investigating small-scale railway schemes that might or might not be of use to the railway network as a whole, but that had been cashiered by Beeching and afterwards. He said that research was being conducted, but I do not know whether it has seen the light of day, and I have certainly not seen it. That was intriguing, because I was interested in one such scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/11">Another point made by the right hon. Gentleman stuck in my mind because it seemed so counter-intuitive. We were dealing with a number of clauses covering the closure of railway lines. There were at least 20 clauses on how to do that, and on the procedures that had to be followed. In my innocence, I asked why there were no clauses about how to reopen a railway line, which must be equally problematic. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman was just being sardonic, as he is often inclined to be, or just saying what he thought, but he answered, &quot;Well, the reason why we don't have such a clause is because everybody knows how to do it. It is all very straightforward.&quot; I think that <i>Hansard </i>will verify that he said something very like that.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/12">I thought to myself that that had not been my experience. It appeared to me that a new railway scheme designed to extend existing services, rather than merely complement them, needed the compliance and support of a number of crucial partners. For example, it needs a fair wind from the local councils. It must fit in with their strategic plans and transport interests. It needs the co-operation, endorsement, imprimatur and research capacity of Network Rail, which is the only body that can say how much the scheme will cost. It needs a compliant and helpful set of signals&mdash;not railway signals&mdash;from the operator of the franchise in the area in question, which has to say that there is a solid and decent commercial case for the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/13">Such a scheme needs to be embedded somewhere in regional transport plans. We all know that these days if something is not in a strategic plan, it generally does not happen. Regional transport forums progress schemes at an almost glacial pace, but if we want a scheme to succeed it is better in the plan than not.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/14">A scheme needs the co-operation of local transport authorities, which sometimes have cross-boundary disputes. A relatively ambitious scheme might cross the boundaries of more than one local transport authority, and they have to be singing from the same song sheet. The scheme that I shall briefly mention later needs the co-operation of both Lancashire and Merseyside.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/15">A scheme needs the carriage providers&mdash;the rolling stock leasing companies&mdash;to provide the assurance that stock of the right kind can be provided without appreciable additional running costs. Above all, it needs the support and endorsement of the Department, which is sometimes lacking. I once described the process as being like knitting fog, and I do not renege on that. A scheme needs, and in many cases fundamentally lacks, a leader and driver of change. For something new to be established, there has to be somebody with a direct interest in pushing it forward and uniting the disparate partners who need to co-operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/16">I can illustrate that point with reference to my pet scheme. I am sure that many Members have pet schemes, and I suppose that if this were a one-and-a-half-hour debate, they would be here to speak up for them. Mine is called the Burscough curves, and is outside my constituency but has an impact on it. As far as I can see, it is self-evidently doable. It has been discussed with about 20 Transport Ministers over the years, but I and most people in the area still believe that it is deliverable.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/17">In essence, the scheme involves uniting two stations that are in the same town and separated by about a quarter of a mile. The town is growing and becoming more prosperous, and it is an important part of both the Merseyside and Preston commuter belts. The scheme would join the Lancashire and Merseyside rail systems. Putting the curves in would have the real benefit not just of establishing better communication between two stations in one town but of joining two networks that are otherwise severed. There would be a link from one of the stations in Burscough to Southport, joining up the disparate spokes of the Merseyside electrical system, which is quite distinctive, being a third-rail system.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/18">It is not my finding but that of Network Rail in its rail utilisation strategy that the scheme would dramatically increase the utility and use of the Preston-Ormskirk line, which is not overused. My constituency interest is that it would support access to Southport, because transport links are crucial to the prosperity of the Southport economy. It would reduce commuter flow to Liverpool by car and resolve the demonstrably poor linkage between the Preston and Liverpool city regions. Everyone agrees that there are a lot of good things about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/19">In its rail utilisation strategy, Network Rail identified a clear gap in provision from Southport to Preston and to Ormskirk. In the local transport plan, Merseytravel has identified the need to link Liverpool, particularly its northern suburbs, with Preston and the central Lancashire city region. The Lancashire local transport plan identifies the need for a direct link from Preston to Southport, and in a recent consultation Sefton council identified those links as critical to the future of Southport as a retail, tourist and service centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/20">However, the scheme is not happening. That cannot just be because of the cost, which would be &pound;12 million at most. By the calculation of many people, not just of the anorak persuasion but those with hard commercial heads, there would be a 10 per cent. return on investment, which is well within the Department's accepted figure. It cannot be lack of research, because plenty is being done. It might be because of cross-boundary issues and the lack of a single champion, or it might be because of other schemes that Merseytravel has cooking at the moment, such as the Kirkby to Headbolt lane and the Bidston to Wrexham connections. Those schemes are turning out to be more costly than we thought.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/21">However, the reason why the scheme is not happening might be that the Department&mdash;not the Minister&mdash;needs to take a degree of ownership of such schemes and promote and encourage them. I am well aware that the unseen hand of the Department reaches over railway affairs on quite a local basis. I know that at times it appears to be hands-off, but its grip on the west coast main line, including in the reordering of stock, is well testified to, as I hear from the operating companies. Its involvement in the northern franchise, which comes from my constituency, is also a known fact. We were expecting new carriages rather earlier than we shall get them, which I understand is because the Department intervened to suggest that the new stock would be better sent elsewhere. I do not want to make any enemies, but the Department's influence may be more pervasive than it might own up to.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/22">I understand the Department's anxieties and the squeeze on Government capital, and I understand such things as the high cost of signalling and the fear of cost overruns, although I point out that the Public Accounts Committee recently established that cost overruns are not unique to the railway sphere. They are just as evident in relation to roads. However, like other schemes, the one that I mentioned has a business case, the support of all the relevant partners and the prospect of increased functionality, more passengers, environmental gains and so on. If it still does not happen, something is going wrong and I would like to know what.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/23">I know that we have community rail partnerships, with stations being prettied up, smiling volunteers and nice brochures. I am glad to see those brochures; I read them and enjoy them. However, the acid test of the new optimism, if it is still about, is that we get new or reinstated track, increased utility and more cars left at home. With all due respect to the Minister and the Department, we cannot point to that at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.1/1">That is a valid point. I know that there is a lack of clarity, and a lack of confidence among many sponsoring authorities about what they actually need to produce in a business case. Let me make this offer: officials in the Department are willing to offer advice to any sponsors who need essential information about what needs to be included in a business case.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/2">I reject the accusation that we have not grown the railway. More people are using the railway today than at any point in the history of the railway, outside war time. That is a huge achievement of this Government&mdash;</p>
