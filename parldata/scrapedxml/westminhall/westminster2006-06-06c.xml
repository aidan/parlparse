	<p pid="c.1.2/1">I am pleased to welcome so many interested colleagues to the debate. The fact that it is taking place on the eve of the World cup is pure coincidence. For the record I shall support any British team in the championship. [Hon Members: &quot;Shame!&quot;] It is a no-win situation, but I shall genuinely support England. The timing of the debate is fortuitous, given that there would be no major world-class events such as the World cup if communities throughout the world did not nurture, encourage, coach and promote football in schools and communities, from the minute that a child can kick a ball. The future of all sport lies at the grass roots. Years ago, our greatest players played football morning, noon and night; they lived, breathed and ate the game. To play for their school team was every player's dream; those who were good enough or were spotted by a scout could rise up the ranks, but often just getting a game was all important.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/2">I am secretary of the all-party group on Scottish football. When Walter Smith came to speak to us recently, he said that the problem facing us nowadays in encouraging youngsters to play the game and gain the attendant health benefits comes from Nintendo, PlayStation, computers and new technology, in which children seem much more interested, whereas previously, whenever it was light, they had the ball at their feet and were out playing. We need to encourage youngsters to play healthy sports.</p>
	<p pid="c.1.2/3">There lies my concern. There are 164 junior football clubs registered in Scotland, but most are or will shortly be facing a financial crisis, which could lead to the clubs folding. That has arisen as a consequence of a tax burden being placed on the clubs by the Inland Revenue&mdash;one that they have never before had to deal with. From the mid-1960s until the 2003-04 season there was an exemption for such clubs, thanks largely to Tam Dalyell, who fought for it.</p>

	<p pid="c.1.3/1">Tam Dalyell, as my hon. Friend knows, was one of my predecessors. When, in about 1966, he introduced that change, there were junior clubs in Bathgate, Broxburn, Fauldhouse, Pumpherston, West Calder, Blackburn, Winchburgh, Armadale, Linlithgow and Stoneyburn, and it is to his credit that in this very season Bathgate Thistle Juniors got to the Scottish junior cup final, and Broxburn won the east of Scotland league. It was Tam's initiative that kept those clubs going very successfully.</p>

	<p pid="c.2.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. Before she moves on from talking about Scotland's national coach, Walter Smith, I remind her that at that same meeting he made it clear that although professional football in Scotland should be allowed to stand on its own two feet, the junior and amateur games need help from Government sources. He suggested that investment was needed in the lower-level football leagues, if we were to have a successful national side, as England has.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.2.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" speakername="Anne Moffat" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0118.htm#06060647000016">
	<p pid="c.2.1/1">That is a key point. This debate is about the fact that resources are being taken from clubs, when what is needed is far more investment. I agree with my hon. Friend and Walter Smith.</p>
	<p pid="c.2.1/2">The Inland Revenue operated a concession that allowed junior football clubs to submit retrospectively informal returns detailing payments to players and coaching staff, giving their national insurance numbers. Clubs understood that any tax due to the Inland Revenue was then the responsibility of the players themselves. However, from the 2003-04 season, junior football clubs have had dealings with the Inland Revenue over the introduction of direct taxation for all payments to players and coaching staff. The Inland Revenue has determined that junior clubs are employers and, as such, are responsible for operating a pay-as-you-earn scheme. That is the crux of the matter. No one disputes that players should pay tax on what they earn, but we should not make clubs enforce the pay-as-you-earn scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.2.1/3">Since that time, to make matters even worse, the Inland Revenue has written to some junior clubs in Scotland seeking back-dated revenue, in some cases up to several thousand pounds. With the best will in the world, I would have to say that the measures have tackitty bits written all over them. The junior football clubs rely heavily on local fundraising initiatives such as running totes or selling scratchcards simply to stay afloat. Unlike senior football clubs, the small junior clubs do not generate significant income from home games&mdash;for example, in my constituency, Musselburgh Athletic averages about 80 spectators to a home game. None the less, that is a big part of the community. Everyone loves the team. It is no great shakes&mdash;it is not your Ibrox, your Hamden or even your Parkhead&mdash;but it is an important part of the community. When 80 people go to watch a game and there are 22 players at the park, those people are not doing some of the other things that youngsters do. They are not engaging in antisocial behaviour or hanging around on street corners. It is clubs like those that are being hit for money and, without wishing to sound melodramatic, that will put them under a serious threat.</p>
	<p pid="c.2.1/4">At a recent meeting in my constituency, which has four registered junior teams&mdash; Dunbar United, Tranent Juniors, Musselburgh Athletic, which I have mentioned, and Haddington Athletic&mdash;people were up in arms about what they saw as the decimation of junior football clubs by the heavy-boot tactics of the Inland Revenue. To illustrate how ludicrous the situation is, Tranent Juniors is struggling even to find pitches to play on. It is trying to find out whether it can use school pitches, even though it is a successful junior football team, which could be the future of Scottish football&mdash;and we certainly need a future for Scottish football. Representatives of teams in my constituency, as well as neighb<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2001" name="David Hamilton">ouring Midlothian&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton)</phrase>, who could not be here today, would want to express the same concerns as I have&mdash;fear that the demands being made on their clubs will cause them to fold.</p>
	<p pid="c.2.1/5">The clubs are run by local individuals who volunteer to give up their time and effort to provide a valuable resource to their communities. My fear is that many of those unpaid volunteers, who are now expected to sort out their players' tax affairs and become financial experts and form-filling anoraks with a nearly degree-level understanding of PAYE, will walk away. Who could blame them? They are ordinary folk, some of whom are retired, who give of themselves, not for thanks and accolades, but certainly not for worry and the sleepless nights that the new burdens will place on them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.3.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" speakername="Jim Devine" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0118.htm#06060647000021">
	<p pid="c.3.0/1">I met representatives of Pumpherston junior football club, which is run much as my hon. Friend has described. The club secretary made exactly that point: if he must now administer the taxation system he will walk away. If that happens, the club will fold.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.3.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" speakername="Anne Moffat" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0118.htm#06060647000022">
	<p pid="c.3.1/1">That is another helpful intervention. My hon. Friend is correct. I do not exaggerate when I say that in my meeting with representatives of some of the small junior clubs I heard scary stories such as they, as trustees of the clubs, being liable if the money could not be paid. Their wives&mdash;it is normally men who do the volunteer jobs in question&mdash;ask, &quot;What is going to happen? They are not going to come and take things from our house. Are we going to be liable?&quot; I hope to goodness that the position is not so serious, but those are the rumblings of concern that are being heard. Why should such people burden themselves in that way when all that they are doing is voluntary work to keep football going in their communities, out of a love for the game?</p>
	<p pid="c.3.1/2">Clubs are even being penalised for incorrectly or incompletely filling out returns. How many of us have had people come to our surgeries complaining about not being able to fill in forms? How many of us have had problems doing so? It is not the easiest thing in the world. Those people are volunteers and are not trained in administering such schemes. Yet their clubs are penalised if they do it incompletely or incorrectly.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.1/3">Everyone understands that people who earn enough should pay tax, and I do not dispute that, as I said earlier. However, I do dispute that we should be trying to class as employers non-profit-making clubs and those who represent them&mdash;the officials, committee members or whatever we might call them. As recently as last week, the Scottish Junior Football Association expressed concerns and said that it could determine from its annual returns that it was losing a significant number of treasurers and secretaries from its clubs. Another of its concerns is that clubs will be expected, as employers, to pay players the national minimum wage. If clubs are forced down that route, they will incur wage bills averaging &pound;1,000 a week as a result of players training two nights a week and playing one game on a Saturday. That is what will happen if we go down that ridiculous route.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.1/4">As we all know, players in junior clubs are not in it to earn money. That might be true at some of the big clubs, of which there are a few in Scotland, where the bigger, better players get more money. In the main, however, we are talking about people who earn only the amount that it costs them to get to the ground. In my constituency, for example, Dunbar United pays travelling expenses of &pound;3 per session and a win bonus of &pound;6 per game. That is the level that we are talking about&mdash;it is hardly the thousands of pounds paid out by the big teams such as Chelsea and Rangers. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I nearly said, &quot;and Celtic.&quot; Like the volunteers who run the clubs, the players give up time with their families to train a few nights a week and they give up their Saturday afternoons. They play for the love of the game and because they enjoy the opportunity to stay fit and active. All that they expect, unless they can command the big bucks, is that they should not be out of pocket as a result of travelling to and from training and games.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.1/5">If clubs are liable for PAYE and national insurance contributions and are potentially required to pay the national minimum wage, many of them will close. The clubs provide a valued community resource and generate pride in the communities that they represent. At a time when we are encouraging healthy lifestyles and tackling antisocial behaviour, and when this country will host the Olympic games and Glasgow will, I hope, host the Commonwealth games, it is ludicrous that we should be trying to cripple the very heart of our football potential.</p>
	<p pid="c.3.1/6">I have had messages of support from the Professional Footballers Association, which is as appalled as I am about the threat to our junior football teams. I have been contacted by Tony Higgins, Jackie McNamara and Fraser Wishart, as well by Tom Johnston from the Scottish Junior Football Association.</p>

	<p pid="c.4.0/1">Has my hon. Friend investigated the equivalents in England? I have always wondered how academies in some of the clubs fiddle things, because they give payments to some of the parents of the young people who play for them, but are not subjected to the same tax vigilance as clubs in Scotland. Is there an equivalent to junior football in England?</p>

	<p pid="c.4.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that unhelpful contribution. Of course I agree that we should clamp down where we can determine that there is fiddling, that backhanders are being given and that players are being paid over-the-top sums. These scams go on in all walks of life&mdash;they certainly go on in junior football and, as my hon. Friend said, in England&mdash;and we should clamp down on them because they do not help the future of Scottish junior football clubs. However, we should not launch a carpet attack on all clubs.</p>

	<p pid="c.4.4/1">I can certainly help my hon. Friend on the point about England, Wales and Northern Ireland. We are talking about amateur and semi-professional clubs, not youth clubs or juniors. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, clubs operate PAYE when they start paying their players profits and substantial amounts. They have never had the concession that applies in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="c.5.4/1">The Scottish Junior Football Association website says:</p>
	<p pid="c.5.4/2" class="indent">&quot;'Junior football' in Scotland does not refer to youth matches. There are no age restrictions in junior football and the term probably originated as a reference to the grade of the clubs, rather than the players.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.5.6/1">There seems to be some confusion. Junior football in Scotland is not senior football. Senior football is professional and people get paid, but many of the players in junior football &mdash;I would say more than 50 per cent. of them&mdash;do not get paid at all. However, it is not the payment that is causing the problem; it is the tax burden and the administration involved.</p>

	<p pid="c.5.7/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that, because I want to return to a point that I have perhaps not made as effectively as I should have. If players earn enough, they should pay tax&mdash;nobody is arguing about that. However, we do not want to charge volunteers&mdash;ordinary members of the community who enjoy the game and run the clubs&mdash;with the onerous tax of implementing a pay-as-you-earn-scheme when they do not have the expertise to do that. If enough money is being earned, people should be hit, and rightly so, but there is a vast difference between junior football in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and in Scotland. In Scotland, it is non-profit-making and amateur.</p>

	<p pid="c.6.1/1">It is a great privilege to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase>, who is a good and long-standing friend.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.1/2">If Martians decide to invade this world in the near future, they will wonder where we all are. Most of us will be sitting watching television, and a lucky few will be over in Germany, being looked after by McDonald's, although I will not be one of them, thank God. Things have not always been this way, and mass coverage on television and the influence of big money and Russian billionaires have obviously raised the profile of football.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.1/3">The other day, I was thinking about what things were like when I was younger. The last time the World cup was held in Germany was during England's sabbatical from the competition, and the British Isles representative was the country of my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian and most of the hon. Members here today. There were some real stars in that squad, such as Jim Stewart, Donald Ford and Tommy Allan. Who can forget them? Who can remember them? Of course, there was also Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain and Jim Holton&mdash;six foot two, eyes of blue. There was Billy Bremner, the man we all love to hate, and Jimmy Johnstone, the man we all love to love. Sadly, as well as being great footballers, the last three have one thing common&mdash;they are no longer with us, which is sad for us.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.1/4">In 1974, I was not the man you see before you now, Mr. Chope. I was 20&mdash;that was my age, not my weight&mdash;and I was playing local football, as were hundreds of thousands of other people, just as they are now. Then, as now, the world of football seen on our screens is not the real world of football. Then, that was merely pub and club football and some school football. Today's world is different and the situation is different.</p>

	<p pid="c.6.5/1">I was not aware of that, but I am not surprised, because that is the culture in Scotland, and where I come from: that is how we attracted people. Football in the British isles is suffering today because of the demise of that and because big money is bringing in players from abroad and not encouraging junior footballers to come through. That is a big mistake for us all.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.5/2">In my part of the world, we have junior football&mdash;it is junior in the sense of age groups&mdash;and it is booming. In Blaydon, we have a football team that attracts 270 players&mdash;boys and girls. People there are even in the process of setting up a disabled team, which is something that we would never even have thought about 30 years ago. The team operates out of a portakabin, and while the children are training and playing football, their grandmothers take it over and it becomes a social centre for them. People who do not know each other and would never have met but for their children's interest in football get together. It is part of the community, and that is what it is all about. It becomes a social event.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.5/3">We have campaigns going from that football club. We are running a big campaign to try to get the Health Department to pay for people who need to wear glasses when they take part in sport. We should surely encourage that. A local amateur football team in our area, Whickham FC, recently won the Durham senior challenge cup&mdash;their first win for 25 years, since they won the FA vase. They were the first second division team to win the cup, and they beat first division opponents to do it. They are an integral part of the community, and good news for the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.5/4">Another team, Birtley Town juniors, have just been awarded a charter standard by the FA and quite a lot of money from both the FA and the local council, because they want the team to develop and go forward. They realise the integral part that football plays in our communities, much more than in the past when we had a more cohesive society. That is particularly true in the area where I come from, where there were miners' welfares and people grew up, played, lived and worked together. A lot of that has been changed, but the football clubs have been maintained and are a key part of our society. We should do everything possible to keep them going. The development in football in the past few years is good news for the whole community.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.5/5">We have to ask where the joined-up thinking is in the proposal, given that we want to encourage people to engage in sport. We know that 30 years ago people went to play football and then got drunk. That was part and parcel of the situation: it was a man's thing. Football is no longer like that: it is a community event that involves people in a very different way.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.5/6">My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian said that if children are involved in sport they probably will not be involved in antisocial behaviour, or if they are, it will be for a much more limited time. That is a crucial part of why the police in our area are involved in encouraging sport. Something else that happens now, which would never have happened when I was a young man, is that boys and girls play football together. We now have people from different racial groups coming together, and there is interaction with people with disabilities. We talk and talk in this House about encouraging people to involve themselves in diversity. This is real diversity: it is real people getting together, doing real things together and realising that they are living on the same planet.</p>
	<p pid="c.6.5/7">When I played football, the engagement that we had with the local council was to ask how much rent we had to pay for a football field, and that was the end of it. Now there is real involvement with the development of community leisure facilities, environmental discussions and development as a whole. There is a plan to take over school fields in the area where I live, which has been strongly resisted by local people because it is all about building houses. The school fields should be maintained, used and developed for sporting facilities. The football clubs are right in there arguing that case and using links with organisations such as Sport England to ensure that their voices are listened to. To promote interest in sport, we should be talking about tax breaks, not tax burdens. We should be looking for incentives, not disincentives, and we should be finding support, not putting obstacles in the way. I understand the reality that PAYE must be paid, but I urge it on the Minister that if there is any way of relieving the burden on these clubs, it can only be for the good of the community.</p>

	<p pid="c.8.0/1">I fear that with such a specific topic up for debate today, you may hear the same speech, or variations on it, several times, Mr. Chope. I apologise in advance if that is the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.8.0/2">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase> on securing this debate. I know that she takes an active local interest in this issue. She should be praised for the hard work she has done locally, and the fine way in which she laid out the arguments to start the debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.8.0/3">As a comparatively newly elected MP, I imagine that I come fairly late to the issue. My colleagues from around Scotland, notably <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" name="Brian H Donohoe">my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase>, who unfortunately is not here today, have been campaigning on this issue since the Revenue announced its intention to change the rules for Scottish junior football about four years ago.</p>
	<p pid="c.8.0/4">Despite this being a relatively long-standing issue, the debate is especially important and comes at an appropriate time. Junior football clubs across Scotland have just hung up their boots for the summer. The close season provides the opportunity for many of the unpaid volunteers who do such good work in those clubs to find the time and expertise to operate a PAYE system while trying to find ways to keep their clubs running with the extra burden that has been placed on them. The debate comes only a couple of months after tranche 2 of the Revenue's programme to get PAYE established throughout Scottish junior Football.</p>
	<p pid="c.8.0/5">My constituency has five junior football clubs, all of which are part of a proud tradition within Dundee. Despite being the new kids on the block, Downfield FC are celebrating their centenary this year. Dundee Violet were formed in 1883, and are therefore the oldest club, closely followed by what must be the most successful club in the region Lochee United, who managed to win 17 honours between 1977 and 1987. That feat has not been repeated in recent years, but it will not be easily forgotten. Indeed, last year Lochee managed to resurrect some of that fighting spirit and reached the final of the Scottish cup. My favourite team in Dundee, West&mdash;Lochee Harp&mdash;were formed in 1904, and Dundee North End make up Dundee, West's complement.</p>
	<p pid="c.8.0/6">In Perthshire, there are teams such as Jeanfield Swifts, Bankfoot, Kinnoull. Up in Angus, there are clubs such as Forfar Albion, Forfar West End, Brechin Vics, Arbroath Vics. Coming back down into Dundee, East, Carnoustie have been one of the most successful clubs in recent years, and were Scottish cup finalists a couple of years ago. Coming back into Dundee, there are Broughty Athletic and East Craigie. Unfortunately, my favourite team from Dundee, East&mdash;St. Joseph's&mdash;went defunct a few years ago because of financial considerations. Moving across the Tay bridge into Fife and the constituency of the leader of the Liberal Democrats, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1984" name="Menzies Campbell">the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase>, teams include Tayport, who are probably the most successful team in Scotland in recent years at junior level. I think they have won the Scottish cup three times in the past five seasons. Moving through Fife into the Chancellor's constituency, there are clubs such as Lochgelly Albert, Lochore Welfare and Kelty Hearts.</p>
	<p pid="c.8.0/7">Throughout the Tayside and Fife area, junior football clubs are at the heart of every community.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.9.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" speakername="Jim Devine" colnum="9"  time="009:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0118.htm#06060647000065">
	<p pid="c.9.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. The Chancellor was heavily involved in saving the Raith Rovers senior team, which he strongly supports, organising financial assistance and suchlike. It would be a bit silly and contradictory for him to save the senior team but let the junior teams go under.</p>

	<p pid="c.9.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. He makes a valid point. It would indeed be sad if the junior teams in the Chancellor's constituency were to go to the wall because of tax considerations.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.1/2">I could go on with my geographical tour of Scotland, but suffice it to say that across the Forth bridge there are more junior clubs in the constituencies of my right hon. and hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the Deputy Leader of the House, the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and for Transport, and the Secretary of State for Defence. Junior football clubs are at the heart of the community throughout Scotland, and play a vital part in those communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.1/3">The clubs in Dundee, West boast crowds of somewhere between 50 and 100 for their home games, but beyond that they play a vital role in the communities in which they are based. Many of those clubs run youth teams. In Dundee, I can certainly attest to the contribution that they make to the fabric of the communities in which they are based. They have been there for over 100 years, and have overcome many adversities, but the new tax regime slowly being implemented seems to be posing one of the biggest threats yet. It would be a real shame if that threat finally became insurmountable for some of them.</p>
	<p pid="c.9.1/4">There are many competing views as to why the Revenue started its actions back in 2002. Some believe that a hotshot taxman was reading the newspapers and noticed big sponsorships that had been achieved by a couple of teams, and figured that they deserved attention. Other people suspect that the Revenue was getting upset about the failure of some clubs to send in their informal tax returns and that it was therefore about time to revisit the whole system.</p>

	<p pid="c.10.0/1">My hon. Friend touches on an interesting correlation between the success of Scots politicians in the English Parliament in reaching high places and the preponderance of junior clubs in their areas. Does he think that if the junior clubs were to disappear there would be fewer Scots in high places in the English Government?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.10.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1974" speakername="James McGovern" colnum="10"  time="009:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0118.htm#06060647000071">
	<p pid="c.10.1/1">I could not possibly comment on that. This is the British Parliament and every MP is allowed to vote on every issue regardless of their constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.1/2">As I suggested, this issue stems from the decision of one player on a fairly large retainer from a bigger club who claimed that he did not have to sort out his tax receipts as his club should do it for him. Whatever the reason, it seems that big assumptions have been made on the experience of a very limited set of teams, which has led to a regrettable situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.1/3">The new PAYE system, which many clubs are expected to introduce, replaces the informal returns system negotiated for junior football in the 1960s by Tam Dalyell, the former Member of Parliament for Linlithgow. That system allowed clubs simply to submit an informal return to the Inland Revenue each year, on which would be a full list of all the moneys that had been paid to players over the past year, allowing the Revenue to ensure that the players' tax returns were correct and thus ensure that it collected all the tax that was due to it. It should be emphasised that the aim of the informal agreement was not for the clubs to avoid tax altogether, but to ease the burden on the junior football clubs and to place it on the individual players and the Revenue. I like to think that that was partially in recognition of the unique role that junior football plays in Scotland and the desire in the 1960s to help maintain it.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.1/4">Phase one of the PAYE introduction tended to affect clubs that had social clubs attached to them and were more or less of a size that they could handle a PAYE system without its destroying the club. After all, some of the social clubs already employed staff and therefore applied PAYE to them. It caused some problems, although not as many as have been caused by the second tranche of the reforms.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.1/5">I want to discuss three key areas. First, I should like to emphasise my belief that junior football clubs are not &quot;employers&quot; as any reasonable person would understand the term, and should not be treated as such. Secondly, where the tax regulations have been introduced, it has been done in a manner that has promoted rather than reduced confusion, and they have often been perceived as incredibly unfair. Thirdly, I should like to address the effect that the new tax regime is having on the volunteers, who are crucial to the running of the clubs.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.1/6">The first problem is simply the mistaken belief that the clubs are employers. Under the strict letter of the law&mdash;I am talking about the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&mdash;it is entirely possible that junior football clubs that pay their staff &quot;emoluments&quot;, which to most of us means bonuses, should operate a PAYE system in the payment of them. I can therefore see why, under the strict letter of the law, the Revenue has decided to take the position it is taking. However, it has a long history of working out special exemptions for certain areas in order to make an inflexible tax system just a little more flexible&mdash;in fact, that is exactly how the original arrangement came about. These exemptions and arrangements are designed to promote fairness in the tax system and to ensure that the burden of taxation and PAYE does not fall disproportionately on some people.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.1/7">The clubs do not operate as normal employers would and therefore should not be treated as employers by the tax system. I cannot think of another &quot;employer&quot; in which the entire board running the company&mdash;if we are to call clubs that now&mdash;get paid nothing at all and give up all their time for free. That does not sound like an employer to me. In fact, the more we examine the clubs and how they operate, the more they sound like exactly what they are: a collection of people who care about their local community and their local football team enough to give up many hours to support the clubs and their community. We are talking about a bunch of dedicated people who do not gain financially from their enterprise and who are not necessarily cut out to be finance directors or managing directors.</p>
	<p pid="c.10.1/8">Recently, I received an email from a secretary at one of the junior football clubs in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2001" name="David Hamilton">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton)</phrase>&mdash;unfortunately, he cannot be here today&mdash;who summed things up well. He said:</p>
	<p pid="c.10.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Most of the guys who involve themselves in junior football clubs do it for the love of their local team. They are not rocket scientists but what they lack in brains they more than make up for with enthusiasm and the ability to gather funds locally.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.10.1/10">In addition to that, we need to be honest when we consider the sort of wages that are paid to the players at junior football clubs. I spoke to different clubs, and I was constantly struck by the low level of the payments that were causing all this trouble. Admittedly some players were given signing-on fees ranging from &pound;250 to &pound;1,000, but that aside, the so-called &quot;wages&quot; were small sums such as &pound;5 or &pound;10 for training sessions and away games. Again, it does not sound as if we are talking about the sort of employer that the Revenue would usually go after; in fact, it does not sound to me like an employer at all.</p>

	<p pid="c.11.0/1">As my hon. Friend will know from his background as a trade union official, employers will sometimes be involved in cases where people are made compulsorily redundant or are unfairly dismissed. Has he known of a case of a junior football player going to a tribunal for unfair dismissal?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="c.11.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I am unaware of any player going to a tribunal but I am sure that a few would regard themselves as being unfairly dismissed; in football terms, that is called a &quot;free transfer&quot;. [Hon. Members: &quot;On your bike&quot;] Yes.</p>
	<p pid="c.11.1/2">The decision to classify the teams as employers has other knock-on effects that are proving even more worrying for the game: For example, some clubs are being told that as they are now classified as employers they might have to start paying the minimum wage to their players. That, of course, stretches the law to whole new limits of absurdity. For example, I spoke to one club that was drawn in a Scottish junior cup game at the other end of the country. Such a journey could be from Ayrshire to Inverness and might take nearly five hours by bus. Another four hours at the stadium for the match and another five hours getting back home might be involved. If the club paid every player the minimum wage, the players would need to be paid more than &pound;75, as opposed to the &pound;5 or &pound;10 that most players get for an away game.</p>
	<p pid="c.11.1/3">If that were to happen, in the words of Tom Johnston, Secretary of the Scottish Junior Football Association:</p>
	<p pid="c.11.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We might as well shut up shop tomorrow, junior football would be finished.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.11.1/5">I know that that is not the Government's aim and I hope that they will be able to use good judgment to prevent such unintended consequences.</p>

	<p pid="c.12.1/1">I understand that it would: it would include the national minimum wage, PAYE and national insurance contributions. I think that that is why Tom Johnston says that it would drive an awful lot of clubs to the wall. I do not believe that the clubs are &quot;employers&quot; in the common-sense definition of the word and therefore I simply do not believe that they should be treated as such.</p>
	<p pid="c.12.1/2">The second issue that I want to raise is the implementation of the new rules. I did some calling round and sent out speculative emails to clubs about the problems that they had been facing in dealing with the new tax rules. The clubs had been given a vast array of recommendations, many of which did not correspond with what had been told to other clubs or even to other players at the same club. Some clubs had been told that they could provide each individual player with a &pound;500 tax allowance, because the players provided their own boots and shin pads and washed their own shirts at home. However, even within one of the clubs where that happened some players had their application for that dispensation rejected by the Revenue, which left the club and the players rather confused.</p>

	<p pid="c.12.2/1">Would my hon. Friend be surprised to hear something from the meeting that I had between Midlothian and East Lothian clubs: when they were looking for these tax exemptions, the issue of shin pads came up and the tax inspector said that they could not possibly have an allowance reduction on shin pads because they could be used for a purpose other than shoving them down a player's socks?</p>

	<p pid="c.12.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, which shows why the players and the clubs are confused. I am certainly confused and intrigued about what other purpose a shin guard might have; perhaps someone would enlighten me later.</p>
	<p pid="c.12.3/2">Some clubs had been told that they could allow a tax-free expense allowance of &pound;5 for each training session and &pound;5 more for away games. Others were told that that was totally inadmissible and that the only allowance they were allowed was 40p per mile for travelling to away games, while others still were told that they could also give a tax allowance of 40p per mile for travelling to training, although I think that decision was subsequently overruled.</p>
	<p pid="c.12.3/3">If we are to have new rules for the clubs and expect unpaid volunteers with no tax experience to implement them, surely there should have been rules put in place and laid down in an easy-to-use document that all clubs could follow. That has singularly failed to happen. On top of that, the exceptions that are being allowed are not being laid down equally between all clubs, which leads to even more confusion and also some hard feeling between the clubs. That is surely not meant to happen.</p>
	<p pid="c.12.3/4">Another area of concern is the way the tax man has dealt with these cases. Instead of starting the new regime from scratch at the beginning of April this year for example, in some cases the Revenue is making clubs pay tax in retrospect for the past two years. There are examples of clubs having to pay bills of more than &pound;7,000 that they never had any idea they would have to pay. For the smaller clubs, that will make a massive difference, yet despite that, the protests seem to be met with a large amount of indifference by the Revenue.</p>
	<p pid="c.12.3/5">The third area is the effect on the junior football clubs. Figures from the SJFA show that the average turnover of volunteers is usually about 3 per cent. a year. This year, the rate has been 15 per cent. The figure tallies with the anecdotal evidence I have received from the various clubs I have spoken to. It may not be simply because of the tax regime and the new demands placed on the members of the club committees. There might be other reasons, but I think that we are sensible enough to know that the new tax regime has had a major effect.</p>

	<p pid="c.13.0/1">I recall that in my days playing junior football we had to hitchhike to the Kello Rovers matches in Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire. What happens about insurance for injuries that may occur during those games? Is there a Government edict on players covering their own insurance or do clubs have to take it out for them? Players may also have other jobs.</p>

	<p pid="c.13.1/1">I cannot give a definitive answer and I am not sure whether there is legislation to cover that. My understanding is that clubs take out insurance for every player so that they are compensated for loss of earnings from their full-time job if they are badly injured. As my hon. Friend said, the players are usually amateurs and have other occupations.</p>

	<p pid="c.13.3/1">My hon. Friend's intervention drives home the financial constraints facing these clubs. The new tax burden is just one more exacerbating factor.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/2">The volunteers and committee men&mdash;they are overwhelmingly men&mdash;are the lifeblood of the game and without them the clubs would simply cease to exist and the vital link that they provide for the community would go&mdash;and all for the sake of easing the bureaucracy for the Inland Revenue.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/3">I am sure that there must be a way through the problem, albeit that it might take a little imagination from the Inland Revenue. Perhaps the Revenue could design a system so that any club with player expenses below a certain level could be allowed to use the old system and those with expenses above that level could be put on PAYE. That would provide clarity and allow the Revenue to get those clubs that they are obviously trying to target to sort out their own taxes. If the limit was set high enough it would provide protection for junior football and a long-term solution to stop what the Revenue obviously sees as junior clubs shirking their responsibilities. There would almost certainly be problems with that approach, but I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister and her many officials could be able to put their minds together and come up with something suitable.</p>
	<p pid="c.13.3/4">In 1997, our newly elected Labour Government published a pre-Budget report that emphasised the need for a tax system that is not only fair to current and future generations, but is seen to be fair. I am sure that we all stand by that. It is obvious from the evidence that treating junior football clubs as employers is technically legal, but will never be seen to be fair. It is not fair to the communities in which the clubs operate, it is not fair to the people who give their time free of charge to provide a service to the community and it is not fair to the many people who enjoy junior football in Scotland. I urge the Minister to reflect on that when she responds.</p>

	<p pid="c.14.0/1">I shall be brief because most of the points that I wanted to make have been covered and I do not intend to make a geographical trip around Scotland because most people know what the problem is.</p>
	<p pid="c.14.0/2">I do not want to give the impression that the Government have been unhelpful. There has been a lot of correspondence on this matter and I believe that the Minister is willing to try to find a way forward. We will do anything we can to help her.</p>
	<p pid="c.14.0/3">I want to put it on the record that we are not whingeing Scots wanting to be treated differently. If this were a whingeing Scottish argument, Scottish nationalist Members would be here, but they have not turned up.</p>
	<p pid="c.14.0/4">My local club, Renfrew Juniors, has had a very successful season and just missed promotion. Like many other junior clubs, it is under pressure from housing developers who want to build houses on its football pitch and take facilities away from the local community.</p>
	<p pid="c.14.0/5">I want to paint a picture of the weekly life of committee members of a junior football club. They are usually men, while the women usually have to wash the football strips, socks and so on, and make the tea and sandwiches. Unfortunate as that may be, it is the reality of life.</p>
	<p pid="c.14.0/6">The week begins with assessment of the injuries from the previous weekend and dealing with the insurance company, if the club can afford insurance and someone has been seriously injured. Committee members are involved not just in the summer months of July and August, but in November, December and January when they have to cut the grass, ensure that the park is suitable for play and repair pitch marks and so on for the weekend. They must contact sponsors to try to obtain money to keep the ground in a suitable condition for play. They must also go to the park on Saturday mornings to ensure that the game can go ahead. All those activities are part of a committee member's life. It may be ridiculous, but are we going down the road of taxing washing machines that are used to wash football strips?</p>
	<p pid="c.14.0/7">Renfrew Junior football club's stadium is made available to other clubs in the community, particularly during the week, and people with particular skills, such as plumbers and joiners, are often excused from training in return for repairing the roof or fixing the pipes. I urge the Minister to consider our comments seriously.</p>

	<p pid="c.15.0/1">My hon. Friend touched on a committee member's week and referred to finances. People go around pubs and clubs collecting totes on Friday nights and making draws on Sundays. They are involved all week. At a recent surgery in Fauldhouse, a local committee member told me that I had to spend &pound;50 to sponsor the ball if I did not want the risk of him going around the community saying that the local MP was miserable. Fundraising is important and happens almost daily.</p>

	<p pid="c.15.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that valuable contribution. Life as a committee member means raising money, contacting sponsors, getting programmes printed, and making sure that players can get to games on time and that transport is available. Volunteers' personal finances are involved because they make telephone calls to arrange referees, contact players and so on. Those imponderables are not taken into account and committee members often have huge telephone bills because their clubs cannot afford to repay them. That happens for the reasons that have been explained.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.1/2">The Minister kindly offered to have a meeting with interested parties later this month. If we cannot reach a satisfactory conclusion today, I would welcome the opportunity to meet her with other interested parties to see whether we can reach some commonality and solve the problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.1/3">I emphasise that we are not looking for something that does not operate elsewhere in the United Kingdom. If players are earning money above the threshold they should pay tax and if junior football clubs are making profits they should pay tax. The problem is that junior clubs do not have fancy accountants and expensive lawyers. They depend on people's own experience, and therein lies the problem. The administration cost of the scheme will be a burden on the clubs. That is the crux of the problem, and it could force clubs to go to the wall.</p>

	<p pid="c.15.2/1">I shall be as brief as possible to give the Minister ample time to respond to the issues raised by Labour Members.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">the hon. Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase> on securing the debate. I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1974" name="James McGovern">the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. McGovern)</phrase> on tabling early-day motion 2178, which highlights the concern that local clubs could go out of business because of the new guidelines, which put too much of a burden on volunteers who cannot cope with an extra work load.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.2/3">I am sure that I am not alone is being able to cite several examples of local clubs, whether football clubs, social clubs or cricket clubs, that are run by small groups of volunteers who give hours of their time just to keep the club afloat. Those people cannot now be expected to look after players' tax affairs as well.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.2/4">There is a real danger that people will end their involvement with local clubs, forcing many to close, simply because when one or two walk away, there is no one left who is prepared to run them. The more serious problem with the changes is the Government's decision to chase the tax back to 2003. I understand that, as a result, some clubs face bills of thousands of pounds in back taxes.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.2/5">Two people run a club that I know about. One of them runs the bar, does the maintenance work, fills in the grant applications, acts as security when local yobs who are hanging about cause damage, cuts the grass and even referees the matches. In his spare time, he has a full-time job, too. I am sure that, given the prospect of having to fill in forms about his players' tax affairs, he is likely to think that it is time to call it a day. The club is run on a shoestring and it simply cannot afford to pay an accountant to sort out its taxes. I also suspect that if the club were faced with a demand for back taxes covering the past three years, it would probably be unable to pay.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.2/6">The hon. Member for East Lothian made a number of valid points, especially in relation to the benefits that such junior clubs bring to young people by keeping them off the streets, giving them something good to do, making a difference to their lives and keeping them fit and healthy. She also made a valid point about the payments that are made to such players. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister the effect that the rule changes might have on the money that must be paid to players. Will they eventually have to be paid the minimum wage? No doubt that would mean a massive increase in costs to clubs.</p>
	<p pid="c.15.2/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">The hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> produced the morning's best soundbite when he said that we should have tax breaks, not tax burdens. That is a valid point.</p>

	<p pid="c.16.1/1">I thank the Minister for that clarification, but I still think it is a good soundbite.</p>
	<p pid="c.16.1/2">The hon. Member for Dundee, West conducted us on an excellent geographical tour of practically every constituency in Scotland, except those in the highlands and islands and that of Orkney and Shetland. I hope for his sake that he did not miss out any clubs, because that could be damaging for him locally.</p>
	<p pid="c.16.1/3">We need a common-sense approach. It is crazy that Revenue and Customs is expected to chase tax payments, in some cases on as little as &pound;10 wages. Surely taxpayers' money would be better spent ensuring that top earners, including a number of premiership footballers, pay the right amount of tax. If the Government are determined to continue with their policy, it would make far more sense for them to consider the turnover of sports clubs and set a limit over which clubs would be expected to sort out their players' tax affairs. A club's turnover provides an indication of its size and scale, and therefore whether it can afford to employ an accountant, or whether it must use somebody who is capable of undertaking that work from within the club.</p>
	<p pid="c.16.1/4">I also seek the Minister's clarification on the cost of recovering such a relatively small amount of money. Has there been an assessment of what tax revenue the changes will raise? Will the amount raised cover the cost of chasing it? Will she also provide some information about the relative success of the pilot scheme that I have read about? What effect has it had on the viability of the clubs involved? Have any gone out of business, or are any under threat of going out of business in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="c.16.1/5">The Government should also consider the viability of backdating the change to 2003. Local clubs are struggling to pay the bills that they expect to receive, never mind those that are suddenly dumped on them. If the Government are not prepared to review their decision, clubs should be given more opportunity to phase in the changes. They should not be chased for back payments.</p>
	<p pid="c.16.1/6">It is clear from the concerns that local clubs have raised that the changes will have a serious impact on the viability of a number of them. Any additional revenue could be cancelled out by lost revenue as other clubs go out of business. The Government need to rethink their strategy, and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

	<p pid="c.17.0/1">Mr. Chope, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair. I shall also be brief, because much of the ground has already been covered. I shall begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">the hon. Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase> on securing the debate. She has been involved with early day motion 2178, as has <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1974" name="James McGovern">her hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. McGovern)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.17.0/2">I am far from an expert on the world of junior football clubs in Scotland, and I suspect that the opportunities for me to enlarge my knowledge will be limited, but from what the hon. Lady and hon. Gentlemen said, one point came over loud and clear to me and, I am sure, to the House: the great social and cultural importance to the whole community of the clubs whose financial livelihoods seem to her and her colleagues to be under threat from the change that has been made. Football is not just a common language. The hon. Lady mentioned the World cup, and I was very amused by the banter between some Government Back Benchers who seem more inclined to support Rangers, and others who might be more inclined to support Celtic. Even though my knowledge of football in Scotland is limited, it is extensive enough to clock that. More seriously, football is not just a common language, but a neutral space&mdash;an odd way of putting it, but accurate&mdash;in which, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> said, people from different backgrounds and cultures who might not mix in other circumstances can come together. That is why, as he said, the police are so often interested in building up community football, and why a threat to the financial future of such clubs is so serious.</p>
	<p pid="c.17.0/3">If I understand the situation correctly, players in junior clubs were minding their own tax affairs and the clubs were muddling along happily, building up a community, building up football and playing a role in their communities&mdash;and then the change occurred. Like other hon. Members, I am not clear on why the Inland Revenue made the change, whether a local department made it, or the degree to which the decision had national backing. I would be grateful to the Paymaster General if she cleared that up; I am sure that she will.</p>
	<p pid="c.17.0/4">The change will have a knock-on effect, because clubs will, in effect, become employers. Government Back Benchers brought up many examples of what that might mean in practice. I think that it was the hon. Member for East Lothian who said that clubs might have to pay the minimum wage. It is the first time that I have ever heard a Labour Back Bencher express any reservations about paying the minimum wage, but in those circumstances I can understand why she is concerned. Other examples followed, including whether shin pads will be taxed. One enters such territory if one changes the nature of taxation.</p>
	<p pid="c.17.0/5">As Labour Members said&mdash;I did not get the details, but I understand the general picture&mdash;the people who make such clubs work are not professionals but essentially amateurs. They love what they do, and they support the club because it is a community endeavour. Now, they will have to deal with extremely complicated tax arrangements that will stretch their expertise. That will clearly be a problem for the clubs.</p>
	<p pid="c.17.0/6">As well as asking the Paymaster General to give us a few more details of how the change arose, I should like her to comment on the element of retrospection and back payment, which, on the face of it, seems a bit questionable. I would also be grateful if she explained the wider implications&mdash;if there are any&mdash;of the change for other clubs and societies, including those involved in sport. She may have to finish off this point at the meeting that she will attend with her colleagues, but what can she do to find a way forward that will allow the clubs a bit of space, so that they can find a balance that allows them to pay the tax that they should pay without imperilling their financial future? We look forward to hearing what the right hon. Lady has to say.</p>

	<p pid="c.18.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase> on securing the debate. A lot of important issues have been raised and I welcome the opportunity to discuss them.</p>
	<p pid="c.18.0/2">Reinforced by other speakers, my hon. Friend spoke about nurturing talent and helping young people, although I think that we are all clear that &quot;junior clubs&quot; refers to the leagues in which they are involved, not to the age of the players. I absolutely agree with her on the importance in local communities of clubs, whether football clubs or any other kind. I understand only too clearly from my own constituency experience how important those amateur arrangements are, so I have been genuinely perplexed&mdash;both by correspondence that I have received and, at times, by the debate today&mdash;about the precise nature of the problem that is that is being identified. However, I shall try to deal with the points made.</p>
	<p pid="c.18.0/3">At the outset, I want to make it clear that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is not proposing any change to the long-standing informal arrangements operated by smaller community clubs. I am not sure that I can put it any more clearly than that. I was asked what goes on in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. We are seeking the same treatment in Scotland as in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Whether I happen to represent an English constituency is irrelevant; I know that my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian and other hon. Friends feel as strongly as I do that what is important is nurturing talent anywhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="c.18.0/4">When football clubs of whatever status in England, Wales and Northern Ireland make payments that represent profit to players over 16, they are obliged to operate pay-as-you-earn. As is the case for any employer, when HMRC discovers that a club should be operating PAYE, it requires it to do so. That is what we are discussing today. We are talking about a minority of clubs where quite significant sums of money can be involved.</p>

	<p pid="c.19.3/1">That is at the heart of some of the questions asked. Frankly, the point made by the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington, about pursuing a club for &pound;10 is just daft&mdash;it would not happen&mdash;so let us try to lay out clearly what is going on.</p>

	<p pid="c.19.4/1">My right hon. Friend refers to clubs as employers who have responsibility for PAYE. Can she define who in the clubs would be responsible for administering PAYE? Would it be the unpaid community volunteers?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.19.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="19"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0119.htm#06060647000142">
	<p pid="c.19.5/1">I will come to that, but let us just keep the matter in perspective. As I understand it, there are 164 of the clubs in question. Forty-five of them are larger&mdash;I shall come later to how they got to be larger and to the sort of sums that we are talking about. They have been asked&mdash;and they have agreed&mdash;to operate PAYE from 2005-06. That is the position with regard to the clubs. As all my hon. Friends have acknowledged, tax and national insurance law requires employers to operate PAYE and class 1 national insurance. Those requirements apply to all employers, no matter how large or small, whether they are running a business, a club, a voluntary organisation, or even just employing a nanny in their own home.</p>
	<p pid="c.19.5/2">In the case of the Scottish junior football clubs, a special arrangement, to which my hon. Friends have referred, involving an informal return was introduced. That arrangement will not be disturbed; it is not as if it is being taken away from all 164 clubs. That arrangement was introduced because, at the time, except in exceptional cases, clubs paid only small amounts to cover expenses that would not have been taxable. So although technically the clubs were employers and should properly have come within the scope of the PAYE rules, the informal return, which still exists for the vast majority of clubs, was a pragmatic simplification that saved both the club and the Revenue from having to operate the system fully.</p>
	<p pid="c.19.5/3">Those arrangements simply required the club to provide a list of players and details of payments made to each of them, and if the payment included any profit element&mdash;I shall come to the expenses issue later&mdash;that was included in the tax code relating to the players' main employment. That informal arrangement lasted a long time. It was reviewed for two reasons&mdash;this will answer <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the point made by the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase>. The first reason was that the financial circumstances, in terms of the amounts being paid, had changed for some clubs. They were no longer paying only non-taxable reimbursements of expenses&mdash;for example, those relating to kit. By the way, kit does include shin pads; I have no idea where the ridiculous suggestion that shin pads could be used for something else came from. I heard clearly what was said about that, so I am saying clearly now that it is an expense. Many clubs are paying substantially greater sums in real terms than they were in the 1960s, and there can now be a real profit element involved. That causes issues at the boundary as they move away from the amateur reimbursement of expenses.</p>
	<p pid="c.19.5/4">The second reason for reviewing the arrangement was that under the old system&mdash;I suppose the question is why it has taken so long to get to this point, but never mind&mdash;the informal arrangement meant that things would be picked up through the tax system with the employer, but the introduction of self-assessment in 1997 cut across that, because it was no longer possible to identify third-party information. It therefore became difficult to determine a person's tax liability. I can see you smiling Mr. Chope. You are no doubt very familiar with this problem from your constituency experience. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Did someone ask me to give way?</p>

	<p pid="c.20.0/1">I was making reference to my right hon. Friend's comments about you smiling, Mr. Chope. You are familiar with all these tax complexities. Unfortunately, that is not true of most of the people who will be burdened by the administration.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.0/2">On a separate point, my right hon. Friend said earlier that out of 164 clubs, 45 fall into the category of making a profit. Will she make available a list of the 45 so that we can make an assessment of it?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.20.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="20"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0120.htm#06060647000148">
	<p pid="c.20.1/1">I will certainly try to do that. I was smiling at Mr. Chope because I was thinking of his Public Accounts Committee experience. As a Minister, I am used to the probing questions that it rightly asks.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.1/2">Regarding the list of clubs, I have asked for that information. I would prefer to have it myself, but it is covered by taxpayer confidentiality. If we can find some way of getting those clubs to agree to the disclosure of their names by HMRC, I will be more than happy to pass it on.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.1/3">There is no question of backdating the system to 2004. The clubs have agreed to operate the system&mdash;I shall give some examples of the things that cause difficulty&mdash;and as far as we are concerned, the remainder of the 164 clubs are covered by the informal arrangements. Of that remainder, 11 have not submitted an informal return for a number of years&mdash;that is where the point about 2004 comes in&mdash;or their returns do not make sense. A further discussion will take place with those clubs, which I hope will resolve the matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.1/4">Let us consider the sort of things we are talking about. Some clubs have been asked and have agreed to operate PAYE under exactly the same arrangements for clubs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It may be that they have received substantial sponsorship. It varies from the fixed amount, but it could be anything from &pound;3,000 to &pound;200 for advertising at the ground. These amounts, together with gate receipts&mdash;which can be up to &pound;1,000 per game for some clubs&mdash;and other forms of supported income, help to finance payments to players and coaches. We are trying to ensure that the informal arrangement works in the way agreed and that the rules are applied.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.1/5">There is no intention to add burdens to what we all agree are perfectly reasonable arrangements. The review referred to commonly made payments, such as signing fees for players that can vary from &pound;150 to &pound;2,000 per player, averaging at &pound;800. Those are not insubstantial amounts. One club paid a player &pound;100 per week. During the review, when the treasurer of one club was asked what happened to the balance of &pound;400 in gate receipts in a particular week after all other disbursements&mdash;payments, expenses, running costs and so on&mdash;had been made, he said that the club simply paid it to the players by dividing it equally. That falls outside the informal arrangement, which is what the HMRC is trying to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="c.20.1/6">I absolutely agree with all the pleas that my hon. Friend are making. Where the informal arrangements are working, that is fine: the majority are, and should be, left undisturbed by the recent changes. We should find ways of ensuring a sensible outcome for clubs that have moved beyond the circumstances with which the informal arrangements were designed to deal. Such clubs have agreed to operate PAYE.</p>

	<p pid="c.21.0/1">My right hon. Friend seems to be contradicting herself. Perhaps she can help me because at the beginning of her contribution she said that there has been no change, but she then said that she wants to bring Scotland into line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Can clubs still operate the informal arrangement? Can I go back to the junior football clubs in my constituency and say, &quot;The Minister is telling me very clearly that nothing has changed and you can continue to operate the informal arrangement. You can tell the tax department where to get off&quot;?</p>

	<p pid="c.21.1/1">Yes, as long as that club is not paying a profit element, which was never part of the informal arrangement. As long as clubs are not doing that, they still fall squarely within the informal arrangement. It is a question of the profit element and the payments over and above the norm. I am not referring to reimbursement of expenses or other such matters, but the sharing of the profit element from the club. My point about England, Wales and Northern Ireland is that that is how the rules operate in those countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.22.0/1">My right hon. Friend made the point clearly and effectively about the distribution of profit among the players. Has she any evidence of how often players do not get paid because the club is in some dire trouble? Players may have to take a cut in wages, or receive no wages at all. I bet that that happens quite frequently.</p>

	<p pid="c.22.1/1">I do not have the evidence to hand, but in circumstances where clubs are squarely within the arrangements for amateur clubs&mdash;this is also the case in England, Wales and Northern Ireland&mdash;there is no PAYE requirement. We are talking about the sharing of payments over and above a certain point and how that should be declared. I want to make it absolutely clear to my hon. Friends that we have not suddenly decided that all 164 amateur clubs, the value of which has been clearly outlined today, have to apply PAYE rules. They are not being asked to do that; that is not happening.</p>

	<p pid="c.22.2/1">My right hon. Friend mentions 45 clubs that have agreed to operate PAYE. Would she explain what prompted that? Did those clubs simply come forward and volunteer to adopt PAYE or were they chased up by the Inland Revenue? How did the change happen?</p>
	<p pid="c.22.2/2">My right hon. Friend may be coming on to answer the question I asked earlier, but if a club is regarded as an employer, who is responsible for returning the PAYE forms?</p>

	<p pid="c.22.3/1">I shall double check how the change came to pass. I hope that I am giving my hon. Friend the correct information, but I believe that in some areas the informal returns, which are considered periodically on a compliance basis, raised questions about whether clubs had moved beyond the exact requirement in the informal arrangements. That goes on all the time in the tax system and makes sure that the system operates as it should. I am taking part in the Committee on the Finance Bill, which attempts to do that every year.</p>
	<p pid="c.22.3/2">It is my understanding that the treasurer and secretary are responsible for the informal return. It would depend on the structure of the club, I suppose, but I presume that they would be required to do it. My problem in answering my hon. Friend's question is that I do not know in how many different ways I can say that the vast majority of such clubs will still fall within the informal return arrangements and that that is where they will stay.</p>
	<p pid="c.22.3/3">There has been considerable discussion with the Scottish Junior Football Association since 2002 about the problems and the need to clarify the arrangements. The new provision was not simply dreamed up. Questions arose about what was happening in some clubs, which were then raised with the clubs. Discussions took place and 45 clubs have agreed to operate PAYE if it is necessary for the payments that are to do with making a payment&mdash;a wage, or a share of the profits&mdash;other than the reimbursement of expenses.</p>

	<p pid="c.23.0/1">My experience is that the clubs in my constituency have had PAYE imposed on them by the Inland Revenue, not that they have happily agreed to do it. Would my right hon. Friend look favourably on the clubs that are saying that that is the case?</p>

	<p pid="c.23.1/1">I would certainly look favourably on clubs that take the view that they have been unreasonably asked to operate PAYE, but if they are making payments that are, in effect, a wage or a share of profits and that take them beyond the informal relationship, they have put themselves under the law that every employer in this country has to apply if they make payments in a particular way. I cannot say on the Floor of the House that we will let some employers not operate the system. That would be a disaster in the exploitation of people.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/2">We have entirely reasonably said that we need an informal arrangement when clubs are amateur and are not making such payments. They should not have any contact with the tax authorities, but should simply complete a return to confirm that they still fall under the informal arrangement and to supply the information that is requested.</p>

	<p pid="c.24.9/1">Just a minute. I know that my hon. Friend thinks the matter is important and I am keen to hear him, but I need occasionally to answer a question before the next one comes along.</p>
	<p pid="c.24.9/2">I am advised that the national minimum wage is not an issue when it comes to the payments that we are discussing. Clubs do not have to run the scheme for everyone, and the payments involved significantly exceed what would be considered the hourly rate for the national minimum wage.</p>

	<p pid="c.25.0/1">Obviously, the word &quot;profit&quot; still causes problems to us old socialists. Can I present a scenario to the Paymaster General? A team could go from the informal arrangement to employer status in one season. It could go on a cup run, get a lot of money in and pay some of that money out, but if in the next season it was knocked out in the first round of the cup, it would be back to the old scenario. Is that correct?</p>

	<p pid="c.26.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to initiate a debate on setting our schools free, and I hope that it will be conducted in a spirit of inquiry and thoughtfulness. I am a member of the Education and Skills Committee and I am constantly struck by the degree of cross-party consensus and co-operation that I find there. I hope that our debate will be conducted in a similar spirit.</p>

	<p pid="c.26.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for pointing that out; it is indeed the case. I hope that the Minister and other Members will join together if not in the Lobby, then in this Chamber today, to find some consensus on how to improve education.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.3/2">It needs to be said at the outset that not all schools with independence are good and that not all schools that conform to the micro-detail of Government diktat are necessarily bad. Far from it. We need to be careful not to assume that independent automatically necessarily means better.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.3/3">I acknowledge <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1591" name="Edward Leigh">the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)</phrase>, whose most excellent pamphlet on setting our schools free largely inspired the debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.3/4">In office, political parties are inclined to argue that things are generally better than they are; in opposition, they are sometimes tempted to argue that things are worse than they sometimes are. My criticisms of the education system are not directed at any one Government. I want to make a broader point about failures in our education system that I believe are a product of a centralist system that has been in place for 20 or 30 years, if not longer.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.3/5">The following facts prove that there is a problem in our education system. A quarter of 11-year-olds cannot read or write sufficiently well to allow them to tackle the secondary school curriculum. One in five school leavers are functionally illiterate and innumerate. The state has supposedly been looking after them and educating them for nine years, but it has failed in its most basic task.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.3/6">Many school leavers arrive at university without the basic literary skills that they need for their coursework. That failure has been masked by extraordinary grade inflation. For example, between 1992 and 2002, when Governments of both parties were in office, the proportion of A grades awarded at A-level rose from 13 per cent. to nearly double that figure.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.3/7">Those are the facts. However, we can debate the reason for that failure. I contend that the education system is failing because of over-centralisation and the quango state that administers our education system. That system is run at the behest of remote quangos and remote elites&mdash;schools adjudicators, curriculum and qualifications authorities and unaccountable bureaucrats in the local education authorities. Remote elites make decisions; local pupils, schools and parents take the rap. That is how our education system is run&mdash;almost regardless of which Minister holds office.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.3/8">The quango state has run education not only badly in terms of output, but incredibly inefficiently. It has been estimated that about 45 per cent. of education spend does not go to the schools, but is sucked up by the education quango establishment. Those quangos&mdash;for instance, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, with its plush offices in London&mdash;always seem to have enough money for such things. Regardless of the fact that there might not be enough teachers in the classroom, local education authorities never seem to run out of bureaucrats.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.3/9">The quango state absorbs an extraordinarily large amount of money that ought to be going to schools. The national curriculum is devised by distant experts. Targets and guidelines are set and imposed on schools. That process began in the early 1990s, if not before, but in recent years it has turned into an avalanche. Centralism is the problem. If we are honest, we will admit that Governments of all parties since the 1970s have thought that they could run education better from the centre.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.3/10">Some on my side of the House might be tempted to mention grant-maintained schools. They might have been decentralising, but whatever freedoms the schools gained from their LEAs were offset by greater scrutiny and accountability through the national curriculum and targets set by central Government. Grant-maintained schools show how not to set schools free, as the mechanisms for further central control remained in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.3/11">Instead, we need a bold new approach to decentralisation to devolve not so much just to town halls, but directly to parents, pupils and the schools themselves. We need to take power and responsibility away from the quango state and devolve it downwards directly to the users.</p>

	<p pid="c.27.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate; I know how passionately he feels about the subject. Each year, we all have constituents who are heartbroken to find that their child or children cannot go to the school they wish to go to because the local education authority has not provided enough places in that school. Does he agree that, in a radical overhaul of our school system, we must ensure that good schools can expand?</p>

	<p pid="c.27.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I and many other Members have been approached an extraordinary number of times by parents who cannot understand why they are not allowed to exercise effective choice because of arbitrary boundaries and catchment areas. The system is wrong, and it needs to be changed.</p>
	<p pid="c.27.1/2">We need to set schools free, and we could begin by allowing schools to control their own admissions policies. We should allow schools to have charitable status&mdash;what we might call trust status&mdash;and the freedom to set their own budgets. I shall say in a moment how we need to reform funding of the education system.</p>

	<p pid="c.28.0/1">A moment ago, the hon. Gentleman suggested that a characteristic of an ideal system would be parents being able to get their children into the school of their choice, but he went on to speak of schools having their own admission criteria. Would not that mean schools selecting children rather than the other way round?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.28.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1621" speakername="Douglas Carswell" colnum="28"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0121.htm#06060647000206">
	<p pid="c.28.1/1">I believe that if we gave schools the ability to manage their own admissions, in a few instances safeguards would need to be built in. For example, in a remote rural village where there was no effective choice, safeguards might be needed to ensure that no child was left out of the system and that no child was left behind. However, the number of cases in which such safeguards would have to apply would be few and far between. In most cases&mdash;indeed, overwhelmingly&mdash;if schools were allowed to set their own admissions criteria, few children would be excluded. There would always be a school for them. A school different from the one they attend at the moment might have to be chosen, but there would be effective choice.</p>
	<p pid="c.28.1/2">Constituencies such as mine have a number of secondary schools, and if we were to scrap the arbitrary catchment areas, we would allow people a choice that they are currently denied.</p>

	<p pid="c.28.2/1">I am a governor of a secondary school in Taunton. We recently had to appoint a new head teacher, and I was amazed by how little discretion the governors had in deciding the salary. Drawing on the point that the hon. Gentleman was making about allowing head teachers and governing bodies more budgetary discretion, should they have more freedom to, for example, pay or reward a distinguished teacher of French who has made the school admired throughout the area? A straitjacket seems to have been imposed on head teachers, which makes it difficult for them to reward excellence&mdash;and, for that matter, to allow greater advances in other parts of the school.</p>

	<p pid="c.28.3/1">The hon. Gentleman&mdash;given his comments, I am tempted to call him my hon. Friend&mdash;is absolutely right. He has given a good example of why greater flexibility and freedom for schools to set their own budgets, hire staff and set the terms and conditions for doing so could benefit individual schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.28.3/2">The idea that we should determine such things centrally is wrong. As part of the package of independence, we should give schools the ability to hire staff&mdash;and, indeed, to fire them. With one or two safeguards, as teased out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, schools could manage their own budgets, determine their own admissions criteria, and set the terms and conditions for hiring their staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.28.3/3">Schools would also have the freedom to set their own curricula. On balance, we have come to the point of needing to advocate the abolition of the national curriculum. Some will be surprised to hear that, but my view is that the national curriculum&mdash;the nationalisation of the curriculum&mdash;has not imposed the greater rigour and higher standards that it was supposed to impose. In fact, in many instances it has done the opposite of what its architects initially intended. If schools were allowed to set their own curricula, those of us on the centre right would be reassured that we were likely to get a more &quot;small c&quot; conservative curriculum. There would be diversity and choice; people could shop around for a school with a curriculum that they wished for.</p>

	<p pid="c.29.0/1">What would happen if all the schools in a certain county or area decided not to adopt the kind of curriculum that parents want, and their head teachers decided to adopt a very progressive and dumbed down curriculum? What would happen to parents and children in such areas, which would offer no effective choice of a high-quality school?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.29.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1621" speakername="Douglas Carswell" colnum="29"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0121.htm#06060647000213">
	<p pid="c.29.1/1">I cannot think of a single county in the country in which that would be the case if there were effective school independence and parental choice. However, I can think of a number of counties in which an extremely progressive curriculum is imposed with almost zero parental choice and almost zero freedom for schools to do differently. Under my scheme, we would get choice and a conservative outcome in terms of the content of the curriculum. Under the current system, there is a very non-conservative curriculum, and there is very little that parents can do about that.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.1/2">I am not here to argue for a return to grant-maintained schools. There were errors to do with the centralised system of funding in the grant-maintained system. Nor am I here to defend the local education authorities; under my scheme, I would be happy to see certain aspects of the LEAs wither away.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.1/3">Instead of centralising how local government manages its education budgets, we should try another, non-centralising way&mdash;a third way, if you like&mdash;of devolving control over school budgets. We could give every parent in the country the legal right to request and receive, in non-cash form, their share of their child's local authority budget allocation. That share could be weighted by age, geography or indicators of social deprivation to ensure greater equity&mdash;I admit that.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.1/4">Allowing parents the legal right to request and receive their child's share of the local authority budget could be done simply and would ensure that there was effective choice, which is lacking under the current system. It could be done through a relatively simple, straightforward two-line Bill in Parliament and judicial fiat. The courts could ensure that it took effect.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.1/5">What I suggest is not the same as some hideously complicated, centrally run, top-down national voucher scheme. Imagine the potential for IT failure under such a scheme; one has only to consider the history of some of the big Government IT projects to see what might happen. Nor do we need a new funding quango. That would enable future Governments of left or right to attach conditions to schools or parents for receipt of the funding. A simple legal right for parents to request and receive their share of local authority funding would solve the problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.29.1/6">In looking back at the history of the national curriculum and of a centralised system of funding for grant-maintained schools, we see clearly a lesson that we on the centre right need to learn: rigour and higher standards cannot be imposed top-down, but will come about through being driven from the bottom up. To ensure that that happens, we need not only to set schools free and give them greater independence, but to give parents effective choice.</p>

	<p pid="c.30.1/1">The pupil's passport is quite a centralising, complicated, formulaic measure. I must be frank: I never entirely understood its mechanisms, and I am not a big advocate of the big Government IT projects that such a scheme would necessarily entail. Given the history of the passport scheme at the Home Office, I do not think that a scheme with similar IT complications is called for in education.</p>

	<p pid="c.30.3/1">I began this debate by saying that I would try to bring a thoughtful spirit of inquiry to the Chamber, and I hope that we shall retain that.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.3/2">When people talk about grammar schools, emotions quite often take over and the debate starts to generate more heat than light. I am not opposed to the extension of grammar schools, of which there are about 167 in the country, but I am much more interested in having a debate about education that would improve the quality of life of all our children in all schools in the country. We need a debate far wider than an exclusive discussion of grammar schools. By all means, we can debate those schools, but I deliberately phrased the title of the debate so that it focused on the interests of the many, not the few.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.3/3">It is important that any policy should be assessed according to the impact that it might have on the most vulnerable. I feel that strongly, given my experience with children with special educational needs in my constituency. If we are to give schools greater independence and parents effective power, we need to ask ourselves about the impact that that might have on the more vulnerable in our education system.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.3/4">For me, the key critical test, first and foremost, is whether such children would be better off. We could come up with a system that ensured that. Too often, the statementing process to which those with special educational needs are subjected has put vulnerable individuals at the mercy of education experts. Such children have been more dependent on remote experts and, on occasion, have suffered as a result.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.3/5">The immoral policy of enforced inclusion and the immoral closure of specialist schools, such as the Leas school in Clacton in my constituency, which help those with special educational needs, are further manifestations of what happens when schools, parents and pupils surrender their independence to experts happy to dictate what they believe is right for other people's children.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.3/6">By reforming the statementing process, we could ensure that greater independence meant that children with special educational needs were better off. Such children's statements should not only be specific in spelling out what is necessary to help them, but include a form of financial entitlement that indicates the LEA money to which the child is entitled to have their needs met. If we introduced such a system and made schools more independent, we could show that, demonstrably, the more vulnerable children in our education system benefited the most.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.3/7">I shall wrap up my remarks and open the Floor to debate by drawing a few conclusions. There will be those who are opposed to ideas about parent power and setting schools free. Those who oppose greater independence for parents and schools are, in essence, stuck in a regressive 1950s mindset. It is progressive to give parents greater choice and to set schools free. The days of deference to remote experts are rightly over. We who argue for school independence and parental choice are the real progressives now. We need a system of education that offers genuine pluralism that cannot be dictated from the centre, and with pluralism and choice will come genuine innovation.</p>
	<p pid="c.30.3/8">To conclude, the only people in this room who are experts on what is right for children are those of us who are parents and who have the expertise to decide what is right for our child. The days of national politicians dictating what sort of education every child should receive should be over.</p>

Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell)</phrase>, who has made an excellent and thoughtful speech. He is right to use the mechanism of this alternative Chamber to have an alternative kind of debate in which we are less concerned with day-to-day politics and more concerned about developing long-term policy and, indeed, philosophy. I hesitate to use the word &quot;philosophy&quot; in the House of Commons, as I do not want to be accused of being an intellectual, which would be political death.</p>
	<p pid="c.31.0/2">My hon. Friend made an important contribution in the way that he introduced this debate. He was kind enough to mention a pamphlet that I recently penned, but I claim no particular credit for any ideas in it, as it contains nothing new. There is little that is new in the debate on education. Many of these ideas have been around for many years, but I believe that there is a new determination to question all existing orthodoxies and to be prepared to consider what happens in other parts of the world and, indeed, Europe.</p>
	<p pid="c.31.0/3">There is extraordinary diversity in educational provision in other parts of Europe. There is not a view in other European countries that there must be only one educational model. For instance, Sweden, which has a tradition of many years of social democratic government&mdash;centre-left government with short periods of centre-right government&mdash;has introduced a radical universal voucher scheme, which imposes controls on admissions. The scheme has resulted in an explosion of new, privately run schools that appear to be popular and to cater for a need.</p>
	<p pid="c.31.0/4">In Holland, which does not have a reputation for being a particularly conservative country, there has long been a tradition of the state, in effect, funding private schools. In France, the salaries of teachers in private schools are paid by the state. There is not a view in other European countries that there must be a great divide between the public and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid="c.31.0/5">In that context, I welcome the speech which I understand the leader of my party gave today in which he praised people who work in the public sector. It has always been the view of the Conservative party that we must mix and match. One cannot say as a general proposition that the public sector or the private sector is always best. We are prepared to advocate a public-private partnership, which exists in other countries but not in this one. In this country, where the fees of most private schools are way beyond what most ordinary people can afford, only 7 per cent. of children go to private schools. How can most of the people who work in the public sector, for instance, possibly afford boarding school fees of up to &pound;18,000 a year, or private school fees of perhaps &pound;9,000 or &pound;10,000 a year, out of taxed income? The situation is different in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Holland, where there is extraordinary diversity.</p>
	<p pid="c.31.0/6">However, let us not discuss private schools only. Other European countries are moving away from central direction of state education, so let us discuss that for a moment. Speaking as a parent, I know a great deal about French education. I sent all my children to the French lyc&eacute;e in London for a time. My mother and father were brought up in France. That country's education system has a reputation for being centrally driven. There is a joke that the Minister of Education in Paris knows that at 10.30 on a Wednesday morning, every child in France is opening the same geography textbook, but that simply is not true anymore. For many years, France has been moving away from a centrally driven education system.</p>
	<p pid="c.31.0/7">Incidentally, it is also instructive that most middle-class parents in France are happy to use state education, wherever they live. It is of an excellent standard, and we must ask why that is the case. I have alluded to the private schools in France and the fact that salaries in those schools are paid by the state. People use such schools for a particular purpose, but most people are happy with state education, which, increasingly, is not centrally driven.</p>
	<p pid="c.31.0/8">A point that must be considered in this debate is whether this country has taken a wrong turning since the 1960s. Did my party, when it was in power, make a fundamental error? There were two things that we could have done.</p>

	<p pid="c.33.0/1">I do indeed agree with my hon. Friend. Funnily enough, yesterday I spoke at length to Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools, about this debate. He reminded me that the national curriculum was introduced for perfectly good reasons. We were concerned that kids in many parts of the country did not seem to be achieving the basic standards in education that we expected, and it was an honest attempt to raise standards nationally.</p>
	<p pid="c.33.0/2">The national curriculum had a reasonably loose structure when it was introduced, but it has become altogether too bureaucratic and prescriptive. I agree with my hon. Friend that we could progressively move to a system in which individual state schools are independent. That is the vision that the Prime Minister set out in his White Paper, which I fully support, and I believe that in his heart of hearts, he would agree with much if not all of what my hon.

	<p pid="c.33.2/1">I am pleased that my hon. Friend made that intervention. As part of this think-piece debate, it is important that we explore such nuances and how our party would approach the problem of improving educational standards. My hon. Friend, who is totally committed to education, believes and has great trust that a future Conservative Government could return the national curriculum to something like what it was before. He is worried about the state of the educational establishment, particularly teacher training colleges, and believes that once he becomes a Minister&mdash;we all sincerely hope that he does become an Education Minister&mdash;he can impose his will.</p>
	<p pid="c.33.2/2">It is important that my hon. Friend and I should conduct this friendly debate in public as well as in private, as it informs how we will develop policy during the next three years while we are in opposition. With respect to him, one cannot impose one's view from the centre. Incidentally, that is the view of Chris Woodhead and other people I know who work in the state sector. If there are 20,000 schools in this country, that is impossible. Whatever one says and does, whatever one's commitment and however long one is allowed to be a Minister&mdash;and Ministers' powers are somewhat limited&mdash;if schools do not agree, they will simply not go along, and my hon. Friend knows that.</p>
	<p pid="c.33.2/3">When I have visited schools in my constituency and talked about synthetic phonics&mdash;now they are in fashion, but a few years ago they were not&mdash;teachers have told me, &quot;Well, we had all these circulars from the state, but we just binned them and carried on doing what we know best; we're professionals.&quot; Whatever my hon. Friend's good intentions, even if he tried to return the national curriculum to a pure state of more traditional conservative teaching&mdash;if it were possible to devise such a thing&mdash;if head teachers and teachers on the ground and teacher training colleges wanted to ignore it, they would.</p>

	<p pid="c.34.0/1">I hope that the hon. Gentleman can clarify something because I, too, am confused by the position advanced by the Conservative spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1429" name="Nick Gibb">the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)</phrase>. As I understand it, he said that giving schools and head teachers greater autonomy would lead to a more uniform curriculum. He expressed the concern that there would be a whole county in which every school offered the same package of education. That has not been my experience of head teachers being given greater discretion over setting classes. Why would the official spokesman for the hon. Gentleman's party be concerned about that possibility?</p>

	<p pid="c.34.1/1">I do not think that that would happen. If the model that my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich discussed were accepted, and head teachers had genuinely independent powers over their curriculum, is it really believable that every school in an entire county or large town would follow the same progressive model? In fact, under that model, other schools would develop and parents would vote with their feet. Do we have no self-confidence? As Conservatives, we believe in a traditional form of teaching. We believe that that works and that many modern teaching fashions have corrupted education. Do we really have so little confidence in professionals, teachers and parents that we believe that if they were given complete freedom, all of them in an entire county would move to an extreme form of progressive education?</p>
	<p pid="c.34.1/2">If that happened, however, it would of course happen under my hon. Friend's model presumably only because that was what teachers, head teachers and parents wanted. If they want it, let them have it&mdash;but I do not think that it would happen.</p>

	<p pid="c.34.2/1">In response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the intervention from the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase>, my comments related to what would happen if we abolished the national curriculum, which I am totally against. To take up my hon. Friend's point about whether Ministers can determine matters, I am not saying that central Government can or indeed should prescribe everything that happens in schools; what I am saying is that Ministers can determine the content of national curriculum documents that emanate from the Department for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.34.2/2">My understanding, from what I have experienced in my current role and as an MP for nine years, is that too often Ministers from both parties have not been engaged in the detailed minutiae of what emanates from the Department. We live in a democracy, where accountability rests here, so it is important that Ministers should have detailed knowledge of the issues and be engaged in them. An incoming Conservative Government would take that view. I am afraid that there are too many documents currently emanating from the Department that do not reflect the wishes of Ministers, the public or the party in power.</p>

	<p pid="c.34.3/1">I wish my hon. Friend well. He is right: Ministers can take charge and issue whichever documents they want. Whether those documents will be obeyed in all or most schools, I do not know. That would rather depend on whether they went with the flow of what teachers wanted. If such documents went with the flow, they would be obeyed; if not, they would not.</p>

	<p pid="c.35.0/1">I am sorry to intervene again, for the final time, but the point is that a lot of these documents are influential on teachers. Most teachers with whom I come into contact are conscientious, and will lean on documents that emanate from the DFES. The problem, particularly with phonics and the teaching of reading, has been that teachers have leant on the framework document but it has been wrong. The searchlights model is the wrong method for teaching children to read, yet many conscientious teachers, doing their best, have relied on it to the detriment of many children's reading skills. My point is not that we should be more prescriptive or take more powers but that where we have influence we should use it the right way, based on evidence of the pedagogical methods and curriculum that works and that parents want.</p>

	<p pid="c.35.1/1">I agree completely. Great&mdash;let us try that, but we have to be realistic about our abilities, especially when we are dealing with the educational establishment that we have.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/2">The opinion of one professor of education writing recently, which Chris Woodhead mentioned in a speech, is that</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The great challenge for education in the 21st century is...the discovery of a holistic, problematised pedagogy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/4">Does that mean anything to you, Mr. Chope? It means nothing to me. Then there is the commissioner for London schools&mdash;an official person, presumably&mdash;who said recently:</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/5" class="indent">&quot;In the light of research into the brain and theories of learning, teachers' questioning techniques will have moved (by 2050) beyond traditional methods.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/6">That is what we are dealing with, and what my hon. Friend will be dealing with as a Minister.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/7">We will go on debating the issue, but let us not get any more bogged down. I must not speak for too long, because others might want to get in. However, my hon. Friend has raised an interesting debate that need not necessarily be the preserve of members of the Conservative party. I have great hopes for the hon. Member for Taunton, whose early intervention convinced me that there are people in the Liberal party who also believe in localism and local determination&mdash;I hope that there are such people in the Labour party, too.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/8">Such people might follow us in supporting the concept of schools being given increasing powers over their budgets if, for instance, there was a shortage of maths or language teachers. Indeed, there is a great crisis in languages in state schools, as well as in mathematics and science teaching, and it is independent schools that are saving sciences and languages in universities. That is something that the Government should be worried about. I hope that all hon. Members here would agree that schools should be given more independence over their budgets, if that is what they wish.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/9">The great divide is of course over selection. My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich was again right to say that we should not get bogged down in the debate about grammar schools. That debate has gone&mdash;it is finished, it is in the past. A Conservative Government would not need to say that we will introduce a grammar school in every town. That was one line in the 1997 manifesto. It is not going to return and the debate is in the past. All we need to do is give head teachers and their governing bodies increasing powers over admissions.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/10">It was said earlier that the only result of doing that would be that schools would choose pupils, and that pupils and parents would not be able to choose schools. It is claimed that if we give head teachers greater power over admissions, large numbers of schools will suddenly become ultra-selective and turn people away, and there will be no decent schools for kids. Indeed, I am not sure that my children could have got into grammar schools, although I am not for or against those schools&mdash;that is irrelevant.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/11">For the sake of argument, does the Minister or anybody else think that if we gave head teachers increasing independence, there would be a revolution in our schools? Teachers are actually quite conservative in how they run their schools. Those running a pure comprehensive school are allowed to test anyway, to create a pure comprehensive system, in which there are three bands, of the most able, the middle and the less able. If comprehensive schools were given the freedom to select who they wanted, some might become more academic, some might remain comprehensive and some might admit more pupils of less academic ability. We do not know.</p>
	<p pid="c.35.1/12">There are schools in the independent sector that cater for all abilities. There are Winchesters and the Etons, which are highly academic and highly selective, but there are also many independent schools that cater for middle and lower ability ranges. I therefore urge hon. Members to forget the party political polemic about grammar schools and to think about giving more freedom and responsibility to head teachers to run their own schools in their own way. Let us imagine that we did that and allowed schools to run their own budgets&mdash;we allowed, in effect, all schools to become grant maintained. The problem with the creation of grant-maintained schools was that only some schools became grant maintained, so there was a dispute about whether those schools were receiving preferential capital funding. Let us imagine that all schools had the freedoms of grant-maintained schools in respect of hiring and firing, selecting and deselecting, their budgets and paying French teachers and others. I do not believe that there would be a revolution in those schools, but I do believe that there would be a revolution in terms of choice and freedom, and that that would be extraordinarily beneficial to our system.</p>

	<p pid="c.36.0/1">Is the hon. Gentleman really saying that if there was a free-for-all on admissions, some schools would voluntarily select pupils who were less academically able and who came from more challenging backgrounds, such as children with special educational needs and looked-after children? Is he really saying that he believes such pupils would be catered for without some protection from an admissions code and without the local authority having a role to play in admissions?</p>

	<p pid="c.36.1/1">My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich and I, and all others who advance the point of view that we have expressed, accept that there have to be special measures under the statementing procedure. We are critical of the present statementing procedure. I have my own experience of it. We believe that it is overly bureaucratic and could be simplified and that a financial value should be attached to the statement. However, we all accept that there will always be under any system a financial subsidy&mdash;whether or not it is called a statement and whether it is run centrally or by local authorities&mdash;to assist children with special educational needs. Yes, I take that completely on board, but I believe that if we moved to a system in which head teachers were free to set their own admissions criteria, we would have a vast range of schools catering for different abilities, and most schools, as happens in the private sector, would cater for all abilities. I know that Labour Members cannot philosophically accept that&mdash;it is anathema to them&mdash;but I urge them to have more confidence in head teachers and not to believe that all head teachers would simply go ruthlessly for the brightest 10 per cent. of children. There simply are not enough of those children to go round.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.1/2">My hon. Friend and I are talking about the money following the pupil. We are arguing that instead of the money being siphoned off by central and local government, it should, through a small funding council, go direct to schools. That would allow each child to have, under the present set-up, &pound;6,000 or even more, and there would be a school for everyone.</p>

	<p pid="c.37.0/1">If we gave schools greater choice, certain schools that are currently barred from taking on children with special educational needs would do so. Market Field school, just outside my constituency, is trying to expand, but is in effect prevented from doing so by educational experts. If we adopted the scheme that my hon. Friend and I are advocating, a school such as Market Field would expand and welcome children with special educational needs&mdash;children that other mainstream schools may find it more difficult to cater for. More children would have their needs catered for than under the current system.</p>

	<p pid="c.37.1/1">I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> accepts that a lot of disguised selection goes on at the moment. All those of us who deal with the education system know that. For instance, I know comprehensives in London that will do anything they can to avoid taking in children with statements. A lot of cheating goes on in relation to SATs&mdash;standard assessment tests&mdash;league tables and all the rest of it. It would be wrong to think that at the moment we have a comprehensive system that is as pure as the driven snow and works. Well, let us deal with whether it does work. That is the crucial question. Are we providing the education system that we should be, given all the investment that has been put in? I give credit to the Government because they have increased investment in education, but are they satisfied that every extra pound of taxpayers' money that they are spending is producing results?</p>
	<p pid="c.37.1/2">Is the Minister satisfied with the level of education available to our children? Is he worried about the National Audit Office report showing that 1 million of our children are in failing or coasting schools? If he is satisfied with the present system, why is he supporting the Education and Inspections Bill? Why is there so much controversy over these issues in his own party? Why does he believe that there must be more diversity? He will probably say that the debate just shows that he is right. There are people to the left and to the right of him, the cannons are thundering and he is going down the third way, the middle route&mdash;all the stuff we hear from new Labour Ministers&mdash;but they, who are now in charge, must be very worried about that.</p>
	<p pid="c.37.1/3">My final point relates to the most controversial part of what my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich said and what some of us in my party are trying to convince those on our Front Bench of, in the truly democratic and open party that we have. We strongly believe, as my hon. Friend said, that parents should have a right to opt out of the state system if they want to and that they should be allowed to take the cost of state education, which they have contributed to all their lives as taxpayers, out of the state system and into the private system. That is happening increasingly around the world and is very popular, particularly with marginalised people. Black people in ghetto areas in large United States cities like the voucher: it allows them to escape from the ghetto. It could be called a voucher or an education credit. I find one particular description rather attractive and I believe that the idea could be made quite popular. I am talking about a parent saying, &quot;I have a right to this money. This is my right for my child. I can take this &pound;6,000 where I want. I can leave it in existing state schools or take it to new schools.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.37.1/4">That would be good for the private sector, which is too cosy at the moment. Independent schools might not email one another any more because they are worried about being reported to the Office of Fair Trading, but we all know that it is an extraordinary coincidence that they all seem to charge the same fees. However, many other people are entering the independent sector, and surely it is a new Labour idea to encourage choice, diversity and new entrants into the private sector, because new Labour is not against the private sector, is it?</p>

	<p pid="c.38.1/1">I am delighted to answer that question, because I have thought about the issue a lot. I have been arguing for this proposal for many years, and my colleagues on various Treasury teams have said, &quot;Oh, it's a wonderful idea, Edward, but of course we can't do a dead-weight cost.&quot; My idea is that we would do it incrementally. If there was an incoming Conservative Government, we would say that we would provide a voucher, a credit, a right to opt out in the first year of the new Act operating. The first year to which it would apply would be year R, the next year would be year R plus year 1 and the next year would be year R plus year 1 plus year 2. The scheme would roll out over 14 years. Therefore, I am not arguing for myself, because by the time that happened, all my children would have left school. I fear that you, Mr. Chope, would be in the same sad position. We would not benefit from the proposal.</p>

	<p pid="c.39.0/1">Yes, our grandchildren might; why not? There is in effect no dead-weight cost because the scheme applies only to future children. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, the shadow Minister, agrees that it is at least an intriguing idea that we could think about. I think that it would be quite popular and I hope that it appeals to our Treasury colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich. So far, the debate has been very interesting. We shall shortly hear the Front-Bench speeches. I hope that, in the spirit of the debate, those speaking from the Front Benches will not talk simply in party political terms, but will open their hearts in the way that I know Ministers of the Crown love doing and will think ahead to how we can provide a truly effective education for all our children.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.39.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" speakername="Kerry McCarthy" colnum="39"  time="011:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0122.htm#06060647000275">
	<p pid="c.39.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1621" name="Douglas Carswell">the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell)</phrase> on securing the debate. I shall comment on a few of the issues raised. I was somewhat surprised at how little reference there was to the debate that we have been having over the past few months on the Education and Inspections Bill, which I believe strikes the right balance between moving away from a very centralised, local education authority-controlled education system towards more independence for schools. However, some ideas flagged up today by Conservative Members go too far down that route.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.1/2">On admissions, when I intervened earlier the focus of the debate was very much on pupils with special educational needs, to whom it was said a price tag is attached which acts as an incentive to take in such children. I was looking at the matter in a broader context, in relation to pupils who might be termed less desirable from the point of view of a head teacher who wants the school to do well in the league tables. In my constituency, for example, there are pupils from refugee backgrounds who have English as their second language, and whose parents, often, are illiterate, so that they do not receive support at home. What would happen to them?</p>
	<p pid="c.39.1/3">I welcome the move to give more power to head teachers and parents. I think that, often, those at the chalk face in the teaching profession know what is best for children. Parents, too, obviously know what is best for them, but that does not necessarily apply across the board. A great many parents, because of their educational background or social circumstances, do not have all that great a role in their children's education at present. I welcome the moves in the Education and Inspections Bill to give the local authority the role of parents' champion and of supporting parents in exercising a greater say in their children's education. However, there will always be some children whose parents are not the best people to make those choices for them. There must be a mechanism to enable other people to supervise the child's education and make the right choices.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.1/4">The hon. Member for Harwich frequently used the term &quot;expert&quot; pejoratively, which is quite demeaning to people who work in the education profession. I recently met, in my constituency, a group of educationists who work with children who have special educational needs, and they are devoted to making sure that children in the city of Bristol get the best education. To dismiss their contribution and the expertise that they have built up by working with children, parents and teachers over the years is going too far. The hon. Gentleman also talked about local education authorities all in the same breath, as though all were equally bad. There are local education authorities that do an incredibly good job of ensuring that schools perform well and give pupils the best deal.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.1/5">That leads me to my main points. I am in the unfortunate position, I suppose, of representing the place that has the worst-performing local education authority in the country as far as state secondary schools are concerned. It is now adrift at the bottom of the league tables by about 5 per cent. As the Secretary of State would tell hon. Members, even Hull is performing better than Bristol these days. We accept that we have a serious problem. It is not a recent development. Over many years the local authority has failed to tackle the problem of underperformance in Bristol's state schools. We have schools where not even one in five pupils achieve five good GCSEs. In two schools serving my constituency, with a very diverse intake of pupils, not one African-Caribbean child achieved five good GCSEs last year.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.1/6">People admit that the state school system in Bristol is failing pupils. As a result there has been a mass exodus from Bristol schools, either into the private sector or out to schools in Gloucestershire and Somerset. It is estimated that about 50 per cent. of parents choose to abandon Bristol's state secondary schools as a result of that poor performance. I accept that the local authority has not got to grips with that, and although there has been some incremental improvement and the school results were up last year by a tiny percentage, unless there is change on a radical scale we shall fail another generation of children.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.1/7">That is why I welcome some of the proposals in the Education and Inspections Bill to give schools more independence. I have in my constituency a school that is a shining example of what happens when schools are given more independence. It is one of the first city academies. Before what was called the St. George school became an academy it was one of the most unpopular with parents and one of the most under-subscribed schools in Bristol. Parents went to great lengths to avoid sending their children there. It serves a deprived area and parents in the locality do not have high incomes, but they would still scrape together the money to send their children to private schools or bus them out of the county, because they did not want to send their kids to St. George. The pupils were disaffected and the exam results were dismal.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.1/8">When St. George became a city academy and got the independence&mdash;and, admittedly, the capital injection that went with that&mdash;things turned around dramatically. In the past year, 51 per cent. of pupils gained five or more good GCSEs. That was a 19 per cent. increase on the previous year. There are some schools where not even 19 per cent. get five GCSEs in the first place; it is a fantastic increase. The academy is now the most improved school in Bristol and one of the best performing academies in the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.1/9">That success is all the more remarkable in the light of the intake of pupils at the academy, 35 per cent. of whom have free school meals. That compares to a national average of about 10.5 per cent. and a Bristol-wide average of less than 10 per cent.&mdash;about 9.3 per cent. Sixty per cent. of the pupils in the academy come from visible ethnic minorities and 31 languages are spoken there. Many pupils come from refugee families and live under the constant threat of deportation or have endured traumatic situations to get to the school. Often they start at the school with a limited grasp of English, but leave with a very good education. They have a real pride in their school.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.1/10">I do not say that all that has been achieved at the academy is due to independence, but whenever I have visited the school it has been clear that the head teacher can mould what happens there to the needs of the people who attend it. For example, he is working with the Institute for Fiscal Studies on piloting a financial capability study, which teaches children the basic facts about handling money&mdash;finance&mdash;and how to run their finances in future life. From speaking to IFS representatives I know that those children go home and teach their parents how to do the same. The school is in an area with a significant financial exclusion problem, but it is also in a city that is fast becoming one of the biggest financial services centres in the country, and the curriculum is being tailored both to deal with problems that pupils and their families might experience in the wider world, and to give them a leg up into the job market. They will get a diploma, on completing the course, equivalent to a GCSE.</p>

	<p pid="c.41.0/1">I am enjoying the hon. Lady's speech enormously. She is making a principled and honest speech about the schools in her area and it is very interesting. I want to ask the Minister, through her, about the new qualification, which has been recognised by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. It may not be called either a GCSE or an A-level, because of the proprietary control of those names exercised by the three examining bodies. Will the Minister address that point? Why can the new qualification not be called a GCSE or A-level? That is what it really is.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.41.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" speakername="Kerry McCarthy" colnum="41"  time="011:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0122.htm#06060647000286">
	<p pid="c.41.1/1">I agree about that. I believe the qualification has been accredited with exactly the same value as an A-level for university admissions, but there is always a danger that it will be seen as a lesser qualification, because it does not carry that tag.</p>
	<p pid="c.41.1/2">Something else that the academy's head teacher has done is to offer pupils payments according to their exam results. Staff discuss with pupils, before they sit their exams, the grades that they hope for. A system is operating in which, if they exceed expectations, they get an extra &pound;10 or so. Pupils tend, at the end of the year, to walk away with &pound;300 or &pound;400. That is something that middle-class parents do all the time. They promise their kids that if they do well in their exams they can have driving lessons, a computer or a holiday. The head teacher can do something similar through managing the school budget. I spoke to a group of pupils who had just finished their GCSEs last year, and although it was not the only incentive for them to work, as they were a quite motivated bunch of children anyway, knowing that they would finish their GCSEs with money in their pocket was an incentive too.</p>

	<p pid="c.42.0/1">I am uneasy about that concept. What makes people uncomfortable about the new variant of Labour is that, instead of education being seen as a process of enriching oneself, widening horizons, becoming broad-minded and gaining experiences and opportunities that one would not otherwise gain, everything is brought down to the lowest common denominator, which is a monetary award for passing exams. Surely education is more varied, interesting and diverse than that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.42.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" speakername="Kerry McCarthy" colnum="42"  time="011:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0122.htm#06060647000289">
	<p pid="c.42.1/1">I accept that point to a degree, but we are talking about pupils from families with little spare household income. As I said, middle-class parents do that sort of thing all the time by way of reward, and the pupils whom I spoke to were motivated by their enjoyment of the lessons at the school, by having had good careers guidance, and by being motivated to do further study or go to university. That was their prime motivation, but some value was also attached to their getting the qualification. As I said, many parents recognise that that is sometimes an incentive when pupils have to slave over their books long into the night.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.1/2">The involvement of sponsors and the wider community will be crucial to academies and the trust schools proposed under the Education and Inspections Bill. Those factors was perhaps lacking in the vision outlined by the hon. Members for Harwich and for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). This is not only about parents and teachers making decisions, but about the wider community being very much involved in how its schools are run. The academy in my constituency is sponsored by the university of the West of England, Bristol Rovers football club and the chamber of commerce. We have a real problem with the school staying-on rates in Bristol&mdash;indeed, we are way below the average, and Britain, as we know, performs very badly&mdash;so it is important that we involve potential employers and sponsors.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.1/3">I end with a plea to the Minister. In my discussions with Ministers at the Department for Education and Skills and the Treasury, there has been a real issue about the VAT status of academies and other schools, and I suspect that the same applies to foundation schools. Schools want to open their facilities to the community, but if they do so for more than 10 per cent. of their opening hours there is a possibility that they will be penalised and have to pay back the VAT exemption on the capital investment that they made. The Minister is probably well aware of the issue, and I simply urge him to bear it in mind when he responds.</p>

	<p pid="c.42.2/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Pope. It might surprise some hon. Members to hear that I was the keynote speaker at the Independent Schools Bursars Association conference about three weeks ago. It was an enjoyable event, and I was pleased to receive the invitation. I met a lot of independent schools' bursars and got an invitation to visit Eton, which I might take up once I have visited all the schools in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1621" name="Douglas Carswell">the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is very timely, given the stage that we have reached in the education debate nationally. In the spirit of our proceedings, let me start by agreeing with him on various points. The Liberal Democrats certainly agree that there are problems and that far too many schools are failing or coasting. We wholeheartedly agree that we need to encourage innovation and local leadership, free from central Government diktat, which still casts a shadow over the education system.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/3">We also agree that we have an over-prescriptive centralised national curriculum, with far too much nationally imposed testing. Fur<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1591" name="Edward Leigh">thermore, I agree with the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)</phrase> that the dogmatic obsession with the question whether public or private is best is damaging, and there is clearly a role for the public, private and voluntary sectors in our public services.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/4">I would probably also agree with the hon. Member for Harwich and the Conservative party that the trust schools proposed in the Education and Inspections Bill will not deliver the vision that he outlined. Indeed, they have become something of a fudge&mdash;they are neither one thing nor the other. So, despite the Conservative party's support for the Bill, I am sure he would acknowledge that it will not implement what he advocates.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/5">That Bill is certainly a long way from the original vision outlined by the Prime Minister, who said that he wanted all schools to become trust schools. I fundamentally disagree with that approach, which is a strange and over-prescriptive way of running our education system. It reminds me of Henry Ford, because it is a bit like saying, &quot;You can choose any school you want as long as it's a trust school.&quot; That is not parental choice, which is the one thing we all agree that we want, although we have different ways of achieving it.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/6">I shall follow the development of Conservative party education policy with interest, because having supported the Bill, Conservative Members are likely to be quite critical of trust schools when they do little to improve standards over the coming years. However, we shall wait and see.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/7">As regards the Liberal Democrat vision, we agree with more freedom, localism and choice&mdash;those the buzz words that we all use, although we have different ways of implementing our policies. However, the one freedom that schools need above all is the one that the Bill does not give them&mdash;the freedom to teach what they want. We made that clear throughout proceedings on the Bill, although we shall not, of course, go through those debates again.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/8">The one freedom that the Bill gives schools with which we disagree is the freedom to pick pupils. A Headspace survey of head teachers showed that 38 per cent. admitted breaking their own admissions code. I accept that my party has a different vision of education, but our concern is that giving schools more independence will allow them to pick their own pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/9">My party does not agree with that approach, although other hon. Members might, and that is a perfectly reasonable perspective. However, the evidence is that such things are happening, and they will become more likely to happen the more we go down the route of having independent schools. That will be to the detriment of the pupils whom our education system currently fails most.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/10">My hon. Friends and I are also concerned about accountability, which is another reason why we do not want to go down the route of introducing further independence for schools. The hon. Member for Gainsborough mentioned localism, and it is extraordinary that, in trust schools and particularly academies, private companies will now have power over elected parent governors, never mind head teachers and elected local education authorities. That is a strange vision of localism and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/11">There is a danger in saying that independence is the solution to the problems in our schools, in the same way that we said that comprehensive education was the one-size-fits-all solution. We have had a healthy debate, and it has been interesting and valuable to take part because none of those who have contributed have fallen into the trap of talking about party political positions, but we must be aware of the danger of saying that independence in itself, or a comprehensive education in itself, is the key to unlocking the door and will give us wonderful schools everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/12">Let me also sound a brief note of caution. I understand the vision outlined by the hon. Member for Harwich, but we must listen to schools. Throughout proceedings on the Education and Inspections Bill, there was lots of talk about how we must empower schools, but are we listening to schools in the first place? In January, a Guardian/ICM poll of 805 head teachers and assistant head teachers showed that only 29 per cent. backed plans to free schools from direct local education authority control, but I suspect that such things are not taken into account in those debates or when we discuss measures such as those in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/13">Indeed, in <i>The Independent</i> in April, Mick Brookes, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said that trust schools are</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/14" class="indent">&quot;all smoke and mirrors. We already have freedom as heads. You don't have to buy into local authority services if you don't want to.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/15">Again, are we falling into the trap of political dogma?</p>
	<p pid="c.42.2/16">To conclude, there is little concrete evidence that self-governing independent status for state schools drives up standards, and driving up standards is the one thing to which we are all absolutely committed. The Minister could mention other examples, but in the case of academies, there is extra funding and various other things. As we know, academies have a mixed record, so independence in itself does not deliver&mdash; <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is welcome to intervene.</p>

	<p pid="c.44.1/1">The facts speak for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.44.1/2">On a consensual note, we all agree that what drives up standards and improves schools is good local leadership, good management and, of course, good teaching. There has been too much focus on structures instead of standards, and on political dogma. One thing that I learned from my interesting chats with the Independent Schools Bursars Association is that we can learn from real, independent schools in the state sector. That is what we should concentrate on, rather than status and structures. We can learn about flexible learning, having a broader curriculum to suit individual pupils and&mdash;my big bugbear&mdash;smaller class sizes, which my wife, who is a primary school teacher, tells me would make the biggest difference to children's education overall.</p>
	<p pid="c.44.1/3">This has been an interesting and valuable debate, and I am pleased to have contributed to it. Now that the dust has settled and we have debated the Education and Inspections Bill, whatever the type or name of school, let us focus most on standards, particularly those in schools in which children are being failed, who most need the intervention of the education system. I am certain we can agree that we should concentrate on that.</p>

	<p pid="c.45.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase>, and I agree that we must not concentrate too much on structures. There is a range of issues that we need to address to raise standards, which we should now focus on in our debates.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1621" name="Douglas Carswell">my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell)</phrase> on securing the debate. He made an interesting and thoughtful speech, but we have come to expect that during his first year as a Member of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/3">The desire to increase independence for state schools is shared in all parts of the House, or at least on the Government and official Opposition Benches. That commitment was demonstrated by the overwhelming support that the Education and Inspections Bill received on Second and Third Reading. We supported the Bill because it makes it easier for schools to adopt foundation status and become trust schools. That reflects the increasing body of evidence, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1591" name="Edward Leigh">my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)</phrase> mentioned, from Sweden and the United States, and indeed from this country's grant-maintained schools programme, that increasing diversity, independence and choice has powerful effects in raising school standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/4">The Prime Minister is committed to independence. He recently said:</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The logic of changing to the specialist schools, of starting City Academies, of giving greater freedom to schools in who they hire, what they pay, how they run their school day, is very clear. It is to escape the straitjacket of the traditional comprehensive school and embrace the idea of genuinely independent non-fee paying state schools.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/6">A key part of the Prime Minister's solution to this problem lies in granting schools additional freedoms. In October, he said:</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/7" class="indent">&quot;By the end of this third term, I want every school that wants to be to be able to be an independent, non fee-paying state school with the freedom to innovate and develop in the way it wants and the way the parents at the school want&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/8">That commitment to giving greater autonomy was a dominant feature of the recent education White Paper, in which the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Our reforms must build on the freedoms that schools have increasingly received, but extend them&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/10">rapidly.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/11">Independence and innovation can play a vital role in raising the quality of education. That is why, in 2004-05, only 38 per cent. of pupils at community schools achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C, including English and maths, but in city technology colleges, which have independence, 66 per cent. of pupils achieved five or more good GCSEs, including English and maths. A quarter of pupils at community schools leave with no GCSEs at all, but in the CTC sector that figure is only 3.6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/12">Thomas Telford school, which I mentioned on many occasions during our debates on the Education and Inspections Bill, has a national ability range or intake, and 11 per cent. of pupils take free school meals, but 100 per cent. of pupils achieved not five or more, but 12 or more, good GCSEs or equivalent.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/13">Of course, the results for academies seem slightly less promising, although, in an excellent speech, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> pointed out that her academy is achieving results of about 51 per cent. of pupils getting five or more GCSEs, which is a 19 per cent. increase on last year. Those are promising results. It would be interesting to visit that school at some point.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/14">Many academies still achieve quite poor results, but if we compare them to those of their predecessor schools, there are still clear signs of improvement. Results show that by 2005 the proportion of students gaining five or more good GCSEs had risen from 21 per cent. in the predecessor schools to 36.4 per cent. in the academies. There is an interesting comment in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report:</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/15" class="indent">&quot;A very clear and significant finding from the early research is that there does seem to be a significant difference in the learning culture in new Academies, compared to their predecessors. For example, 8 out of 10 pupils in the survey said that 'the teachers at this Academy really believe that all pupils can achieve', and similar numbers of staff surveyed said 'staff at this Academy believe that all pupils can achieve regardless of their social background'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/16">Some academies have failed principally because they appointed the wrong head teachers to run them. At Unity City academy in Middlesbrough, only 12 of the 200 pupils taking GCSEs achieved grade C in maths and English compared with 17 pupils at the two predecessor schools. An article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> in March said:</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/17" class="indent">&quot;When Unity opened in 2002 the new head...promised a revolution in learning that would 'discard the Victorian-style chalk and talk' and put in place 'learning sessions' taken by 'learning facilitators'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/18">That reflects many of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough made about some of the vogue methods of teaching that take place in some schools. The article continued:</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/19" class="indent">&quot;Old-style history and science were to be replaced by 'concepts' taught as topics, and teachers were told to adjust their styles to cater for whether children were 'kinesthetic, visual or auditory' learners.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/20">Since then, the Unity academy has been identified as a failing school by Ofsted, with debts of &pound;1.5 million. Of course, the head teacher was got rid of, and the school is showing signs of improvement. In that case and in other examples, the governing bodies and proprietors of schools took decisive and swift action, replacing the heads and ensuring that standards were safeguarded.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/21">I want to raise two quick points with the Minister, the first of which concerns the importance of provisions on freedoms, which are already on the statute book. The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West made the point that a lot of the freedoms for the new trust schools are illusory and that the real freedoms are in previous legislation, such as, to quote the Secretary of State, the</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/22" class="indent">&quot;tortuous process under the power to innovate&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May 2006</phrase>; Vol. 446, c. 1590.]</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/23">available under chapter 1 of part 1 of the Education Act 2002. Only a tiny number of schools have taken advantage of that freedom because of the tortuous route to acquiring it. In fact, only 178 out of 26,000 have made use of it.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/24">It is also disappointing that the Government have not yet implemented chapter 2 of part 1 of the 2002 Act on earned autonomy. That was a major element of the previous education White Paper, which said:</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/25" class="indent">&quot;Where schools are successful, well-led and have a record of school improvement, we want to free them from those conditions and regulatory requirements which they tell us stand in the way of yet higher standards and further innovation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/26">It went on:</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/27" class="indent">&quot;We will allow schools flexibility over some elements of teachers' pay and conditions, for example to provide even greater recruitment and retention incentives&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/28">Those reforms were central to the 2002 Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/29">The then Secretary of State, now Lady Morris, said:</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/30" class="indent">&quot;We want to give the best schools even greater freedoms.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-04">4 December 2001</phrase>; Vol. 376, c. 196.]</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/31">Despite her words, those provisions have not yet been implemented. The Department for Education and Skills website said that a consultation document on earned autonomy was due to be published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-30">30 September 2002</phrase>, but that that did not take place due to &quot;operational pressures&quot;. The issue has become a saga that has run for over four years.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/32">I recently asked the previous Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" name="Jacqui Smith">the right hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith)</phrase>, what was happening with the new provisions and when they were going to be brought into force, to which she replied:</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/33">&quot;We are keeping the provisions of Chapter 2 of the Education Act 2002, conferring exemptions related to school performance, under review.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 444, c. 889W.]</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/34">As the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West said, giving schools more autonomy and freedom over their day-to-day running is not the whole story when it comes to raising standards. Issues such as the curriculum, discipline in schools and ending mixed ability teaching in comprehensives are all hugely important. However, when the right head teacher is appointed, autonomy has a major effect in raising standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.45.0/35">Conservative Members hope that many schools will use the provisions in the latest education Bill to become trust schools in the years ahead. If the Government are committed to autonomy, it would be helpful if they implemented the earned autonomy provisions in the 2002 Act and made it easier for schools to use the other elements of freedom that are contained in it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.47.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Minister for Schools"  colnum="47"  time="012:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0123.htm#06060647000337">
	<p pid="c.47.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1621" name="Douglas Carswell">the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell)</phrase> for securing the debate and congratulate him on doing so. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1591" name="Edward Leigh">The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh)</phrase> described it as a think-piece debate, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. At times, it felt like listening to a Conservative party policy forum, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the contribution by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> provided excellent balance to that. There were also significant and interesting contributions from Liberal Democrats Members.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/2">Both the hon. Member for Harwich and I recognise that increasing independence for state schools is essential if we are to deliver the best education possible for all our children and young people. However, like my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East, I caution that he advocates a much more extreme version from his avowed position of the centre right. I do not feel able to support it, certainly not in its entirety.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/3">As my hon. Friend said, the recent Education and Inspections Bill has enshrined the principle of greater independence for state schools&mdash;Parliament willing&mdash;in law. That has not just come out of the blue. It is the natural next step in the journey that this Government have taken to raise standards since 1997. It is worth reflecting for a moment on that journey to see how far we have come.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/4">We have invested record sums in education because it is such a key priority. By 2008, spending per pupil will be twice what it was in 1997. Capital spending has risen sevenfold, so that by 2020 all secondary schools, and half of all primary schools, will be refurbished or rebuilt and will be fantastic places to teach and learn.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/5">We are backing up that investment with reform. We have freed up teachers to teach, and delivered on our promise to achieve the smaller class sizes that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/6">We are continuing to address behavioural and disciplinary problems, which have caused disruption and mayhem in our most difficult classrooms. The &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; programme is tackling problems outside the classroom that impact on children's ability to flourish and progress, helping to ensure that they are ready and able to learn once they are at school.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/7">Far from there being a quango state, which the hon. Member for Harwich alleged, since we introduced the fair funding framework in 1999 the percentage of funding delegated to schools has increased from 79 to 87 per cent. We are making good movement in the right direction on delegating funding directly to schools, and that approach is paying off.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/8">Last year, there were record results across the board at 11, 14, 16 and 18. In 1997, just 65 per cent. of 11-year-olds reached the basic standards in English, whereas today the figure is 79 per cent. That means 84,000 more children every year going on to secondary school ready and able to learn. Speeches that, admittedly, tried not to be too partisan still started from the premise that everything in our schools is a disaster and is failing. I do not accept that.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/9">The improvements that I mentioned are dramatic, but, importantly, we are well aware that we have not delivered for everyone: only 30 per cent. of children receiving free school meals get five good GCSEs and, as we have heard, one in 10 of those children do not achieve any qualifications at all.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/10">I must tell the hon. Member for Gainsborough that we believe that it is unacceptable for 1 million children to be in failing or coasting schools, although I would advise caution over the use of that statistic, given that about 60,000 pupils in secondary schools and 30,000 in primary schools are in failing schools. Hearing that statistic, it would be easy to think that 1 million are in failing schools whereas the real figure is fewer than 100,000, which is roughly what it was in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/11">Every child really does matter, and we believe that every child should have the opportunity to fulfil their potential through the best education possible. That is why I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East and why I share her concern for her constituents, some of whom are being failed by the education they are receiving. That is also why the Education and Inspections Bill sets out a number of ways in which we will achieve that goal of fulfilling potential. Greater independence for schools is an important part of that package, because greater independence for state schools is not only the next logical step. We already know that it works.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/12">Independent schools have a number of distinctive features that help to deliver an education that meets the needs of their pupils. The best independent schools are highly accountable to parents and responsive to their wishes, and they develop innovative teaching practices and a positive ethos. They are supported by active and effective governors, and we know that in many cases they deliver excellent results. Equally, we reject the worst of independent schools&mdash;fee paying. We abolished the assisted places scheme in 1997 and are proud that we did so. Obviously, we also reject selection, which is a feature of many private independent schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/13">Schools that have greater independence within the maintained sector are achieving great results. We heard about the excellent progress being made at the city academy in Bristol, and I am pleased that the Liberal Democrats there are actively supporting the creation of new academies. I hope they are also keen to pilot some of the first trust schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/14">On average, academies have improved their collective GCSE results by five percentage points per year since the first schools opened, and that success can be directly attributed to their greater independence. That freedom and independence allow academies to develop the innovative approaches to the curriculum, teaching and performance management that deliver the results. Academies are challenging the culture of underachievement in our most deprived areas and they are succeeding.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/15">Specialist schools also have increased freedoms and are demonstrating that greater freedom works. They are doing so on a much grander scale. Some 80 per cent. of all schools have achieved specialist status. In specialist schools, almost 60 per cent. of children achieve the diploma standard that we discussed in the 14 to 19 White Paper&mdash;five good GSCE passes&mdash;compared with less than 50 per cent. in non-specialist schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/16">High-performing specialist schools are taking on a vital role in driving improvement across the system. Some are taking on a second specialism, some are focusing on underperforming pupils and some are taking on training school status, but all are working in partnership with other schools to raise achievement among local young people in their communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/17">Alongside greater independence, such partnership working will also be central to the delivery of our reform. That independence for schools does not mean that they will all do their own thing in isolation. We do not see any conflict between seeking greater dynamism in the system and collaboration. We want a system of strong self-confident schools with a distinctive ethos working in partnership to respond to parental demand and to meet the needs of every child.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/18">Schools benefit a great deal from collaboration with each other. Our objective is to ensure much wider collaboration, embracing all local partners. Academies and specialist schools are proving every day that schools that think beyond the education sector and draw on the energy and expertise of local community groups, local businesses and, of course, local parents can be the most successful.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/19">The development of trust schools is the next major step in ensuring greater independence for state schools in the maintained sector. It is the next step in this evolution, not the revolution feared by the hon. Member for Gainsborough. Acquiring a trust will give schools many of the freedoms already enjoyed by foundation schools, and they will be really important in ensuring a dynamic and exciting maintained sector for this country. They will mean greater diversity across the whole system, which, in turn, will mean a genuine choice between high-quality schools that offer different opportunities and specialisms where pupils can develop their own individual talents. The involvement of a trust from the private, voluntary or public sector can improve the ethos and governance of a school.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/20">However, there is a distinction between freeing-up schools and ensuring that they have greater independence within the maintained sector, and more independent schools. Working within the maintained sector, we can ensure fair access and opportunity for all; it is independence within important boundaries. I shall not rehearse yet again the debates relating to the Education and Inspections Bill because there is not enough time to do so in order to convince hon. Members of the merits of trust schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/21">The Bill puts parents in the driving seat. Trust schools will have to comply with admissions legislation and act in accordance with the new school code, just like other schools. They will be part of the local authority family. I am looking forward to that legislation becoming law. It will then be my job to make progress by implementing it. I will also think about implementing those o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1429" name="Nick Gibb">ther things mentioned by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.47.0/22">I again thank the hon. Member for Harwich for raising the issue. We both agree that we must get away from the one-size-fits-all approach that too often does not fit anyone at all. Through the Bill and our wider programme for change, we want to achieve greater independence for state schools&mdash;not dogmatically for the sake of doing so, but because it can deliver real improvements in standards, building on what works in academies and specialist schools.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.51.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" speakername="Louise Ellman" colnum="51"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0124.htm#06060647000359">
	<p pid="c.51.1/1">The world's attention is focused on Iran's nuclear ambitions and the danger that that undoubtedly poses for the region. However, there is a long-running cause of concern that should not be allowed to escape the spotlight: Iran's abysmal record on human rights. Iran's abuse of human rights has been condemned by the United Nations, the European Union, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. In this short debate, I shall focus on limited areas of persecution, but it is important to appreciate the context in which the abuses that I shall detail take place.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/2">The systematic suppression of dissent in Iran permeates the whole of Iranian society. The abuses are not random. They are organised by the Government or by what Iranians call parallel institutions, such as the intelligence service and paramilitary groups. President Ahmadinejad's Cabinet is dominated by former members of the intelligence and security services, some of whom are allegedly implicated in serious violations, including the assassination of dissident intellectuals.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/3">Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have condemned the deterioration of freedom of expression and the routine use of arbitrary arrest, torture and solitary confinement. Tehran's public prosecutor, Saeed Mortzavi, has been implicated in major violations, including the unresolved death in custody of the Iranian-Canadian photo-journalist Zahra Kazemi in June 2003, yet no proper investigation has taken place.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/4">Executions, including those of juveniles, continue after highly questionable judicial processes. Amnesty International reports that in the past year at least 94 people have been executed, including at least eight who were under 18.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/5">At the end of May 2006, 500 armed riot police stormed into Tehran university campus following a student protest after a purge of the university's academic faculty. Live bullets were fired, people were injured and arrests were made. At the end of May, no further information was available about the fate of the arrested students.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/6">A systematic purge of the media in 2000 closed newspapers and imprisoned journalists. In 2005, the Iranian Government turned their attention to targeting websites and internet journalists. Those who were arrested were sent to secret detention centres. In February 2005, a court in the province of Gilan sentenced Arash Sigarchi to 14 years imprisonment for online writing.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/7">Those attacks on the media send out a clear message. The result is that where the media is not shut down, there is self-censorship. Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International report that independent harassment of human rights organisations and lawyers continues. Prominent activists such as the Nobel peace prize winner, Shirin Ebadi, was held in jail in January 2005 and released only after an international outcry. Akbar Ganj, the investigative journalist who exposed the role of high-ranking officials in the murder of writers and intellectuals in 1998, remains in prison. Political executions take place, and in May concern was expressed about the imminent execution of Valiolla Feyz Mahdavi, a 28-year-old member of Iran's main opposition party.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/8">That systematic oppression has had profound consequences. It has resulted in what Human Rights Watch calls</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/9" class="indent">&quot;an atmosphere of impunity in which oppression thrives&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/10">It means that people are silenced because they fear speaking out and there are fewer voices to speak out about what is wrong, so abuses are not fully documented. It is against that background that I draw attention to particular concern about two minority communities in Iran.</p>
	<p pid="c.51.1/11">The Iranian Baha'i community numbers 300,000, but Baha'is also live in other countries and, indeed, there are some in my constituency. The Baha'is in Iran have long been persecuted.</p>

	<p pid="c.52.0/1">I apologise for my slightly late arrival, Mr. Pope.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.0/2">I thank the hon. Lady for letting me intervene as chair of the all-party Friends of the Baha'i group. Does she agree that the difficulty is that the Baha'i community, whose religion is passive and seeks no ill will toward others, has been persistently persecuted? That persecution has become serious in Iran. Does she agree that the best thing the Iranian Government could do is to enter some sort of dialogue to try to understand why those of us who have supported the Baha'i community feel that this is an unnecessary attack on Baha'is, who present no threat of instability whatever to the Iranian state? Does she agree that the Iranians should enter some sort of dialogue to try to ease the difficulties that the Baha'is in Iran are experiencing at present?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.52.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" speakername="Louise Ellman" colnum="52"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0124.htm#06060647000371">
	<p pid="c.52.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the Baha'is are peaceful and do not pose a threat. Their persecution is intolerable and I shall outline some of the detailed concerns about their treatment. That concern is so great that the United Nations has appointed a special rapporteur to investigate their situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/2">The Iranian regime wants to weaken the Baha'i leadership by attacking people in leading positions and preventing Baha'is from entering higher education. During the 1980s, 200 Baha'is were killed or executed. International monitoring had some impact on inhibiting that, but arbitrary arrests continue, and since the beginning of 2005 125 Baha'is have been arrested. As recently as May this year, 15 Baha'is, mainly young people, were arrested in the city of Shiraz while participating in a community project. Three remain in custody but no charges have been made. Those arrests coincided with six raids on Baha'i homes in which papers and computers were taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/3">Recently, there have been more sinister developments. The UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir, issued a highly significant report on the condition of Baha'is in Iran earlier this year. She concluded that she was &quot;highly concerned&quot; about the persecution of Iranian Baha'is and condemned the letter sent on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-25">25 October 2005</phrase> by the chairman of the command headquarters of the armed forces in Iran to Government agencies, which stated that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has instructed command headquarters to</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/4" class="indent">&quot;identify those of the Bhai faith and monitor their activities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/5">She judged that that was</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/6" class="indent">&quot;impermissible and unacceptable interference with the rights of members of religious minorities&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/7">and expressed fears that the information would be used for the persecution of the Baha'is in violation of international standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/8">Against that background, Bani Dugal, principal representative of the Baha'i international community to the UN, spoke of the unrelenting persecution of the Baha'is. Concern has since intensified with the publication of a series of defamatory articles in Tehran's <i>Kayhan</i> newspaper, including one in February stating that Baha'is gather on Muslim holy days</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/9" class="indent">&quot;to consume alcohol, dance, and sacrifice a Muslim child.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/10">Those outrageous allegations, which have created an atmosphere of fear and hostility, were published in Iran's national newspaper. There is no evidence whatever for the allegations. They are venomous and reminiscent of anti-Jewish blood libels that also circulate in Iran. Indeed, the 20,000-strong Iranian Jewish community, which has diminished from 85,000 in 1979, feels increasingly anxious.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/11">President Ahmadinejad's recent provocative holocaust denial, combined with his call for Israel to be</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/12" class="indent">&quot;wiped off the face of the map&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/13">is, sadly, not a new phenomenon in Iran, but its intensity and central place in the international furore about Iran's nuclear ambitions have raised acute concern about the situation of Iranian Jews&mdash;one of the oldest Jewish communities&mdash;and created an atmosphere of fear. President Ahmadinejad stated just a few months ago:</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/14" class="indent">&quot;They have created a myth today that they call the massacre of Jews and they consider it a principle above God, religion and the prophets&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/15">I have viewed a highly disturbing programme that was broadcast on Channel 2 of Iranian television on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-05">5 January</phrase>. It hosted a discussion in which political analyst Dr. Majid Goudarzi stated&mdash;unchallenged&mdash;that following Jesus' birth, the Jews of Yemen prepared a pit of fire for Christians who refused to renounce the religion of Jesus. Dr. Goudarzi stated that &quot;burning believers&quot; then became ingrained in Jewish consciousness so that the Jews later blamed the Germans for atrocities that they themselves had started. For good measure, Dr. Goudarzi also proclaimed that the Jews created the &quot;protocols of the elders of Zion&quot; to enable them to become the</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/16" class="indent">&quot;board of directors of the world&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/17">It is truly shocking that that statement, aired as fact, was broadcast on national television in the 21st century. National television, a public resource, stated it not even as a matter of debate&mdash;although that would not have been acceptable either&mdash;but as a matter of fact. It is little wonder that Haroon Yeshaya, the former chairman of the Jewish community in Tehran, sent a public letter to President Ahmadinejad stating that his current stance of holocaust denial had created:</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/18" class="indent">&quot;astonishment among the people of the world and spread fear and anxiety among the small Jewish community of Iran.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/19">I have mentioned detailed problems concerning Jews and Baha'is, but they are just two of Iran's minority communities. Other groups such as Arabs, Kurds and Christians suffer from tremendous discrimination. The whipping-up of hostility towards them and other minorities can only damage Iran's reputation. Sadly, the extent of Iran's human rights abuse is immense, and in the short time available today, I have been able to describe only a small number of concerns.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/20">At the beginning of my contribution, I referred to the systematic suppression of dissent and the absence of a free media in Iran. That means that it is especially important that voices outside Iran speak up for those who face oppression. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> spoke about the peaceful nature of the Baha'is. The Iranians think that they can persecute groups because they believe that there is nobody there to speak up for them. I hope that through the expressions made in this Chamber today, and the work undertaken by the all-party Friends of the Baha'i group and other groups, the Iranians will be proved wrong in their assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/21">Because of the suppression of freedom of speech, and the atmosphere of intimidation in Iran, it is particularly important that voices outside Iran speak up and speak up loudly. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are to be congratulated on exposing Iran's failings on human rights. The work of the UN special rapporteurs has been invaluable in identifying abuses, although requests for visits by UN special rapporteurs on torture and extra-judicial executions have so far gone unanswered. Sadly, although the exposure has made the world more aware of what is happening in Iran, it has not changed Iran's fundamental approach.</p>
	<p pid="c.52.1/22">The world is right to be worried by Iran's nuclear ambitions, but the aggression displayed by its President is not necessarily backed by its population. Dissent in Iran is suppressed and minorities face discrimination. It is essential that the spotlight focuses on human rights abuses within Iran's oppressive regime, and I call on the United Nations and the European Union to step up their activities.</p>

	<p pid="c.54.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Pope, for that helpful suggestion.</p>
	<p pid="c.54.2/2">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" name="Louise Ellman">my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)</phrase> on securing a debate on a subject that is of real concern to the United Kingdom Government and, indeed, to this House.</p>
	<p pid="c.54.2/3">Efforts to improve respect for human rights have long been a central element of the United Kingdom's and, indeed, the European Union's approach to Iran. The current situation in Iran seems to be deteriorating and lacking in transparency&mdash;from the situation of religious minorities to the conduct of trials and sentencing. The situation is well reported by non-governmental organisations such as Amnesty International, and in its latest report Amnesty highlighted the growing difficulties faced by ethnic and religious minorities, harassment of human rights defenders, the erosion of free expression and the serious concerns about Iran's use of the death penalty.</p>
	<p pid="c.54.2/4">We have frequently set out those concerns bilaterally and through the relevant international human rights mechanisms. As my hon. Friend mentioned, that includes our concern about the position that the Iranian Government have taken towards Israel. President Ahmadinejad call for Israel to be wiped from the map and his attempts to cast doubt on the holocaust are outrageous and unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="c.54.2/5">We have long-standing concerns about political freedoms in Iran. An unelected committee, the Guardian Council, comprised of jurists and clerics, was able to prevent all women and many reformists from standing in last year's presidential elections. Many reformist candidates, including a third of the sitting Members of Parliament, were similarly excluded from standing in the parliamentary elections in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.54.2/6">We are also very concerned about Iran's treatment of women. Although the situation for women is in some respects better than in certain other countries in the region&mdash;women can, for instance, vote and drive, and they make up more than half of the university population&mdash;they nevertheless face significant discrimination. For instance, the evidence of a woman continues to be worth less than that of a man in court, and women do not enjoy equal rights in cases involving divorce, inheritance or the custody of children.</p>

	<p pid="c.55.0/1">The Minister has referred to the serious deficiencies&mdash;to say the least&mdash;in the legitimacy of the parliamentary process in Iran. This Parliament should beat its breast and apologise. As you know, Mr. Pope, I personally opposed elsewhere the receiving here of a delegation from the Majlis. I thought that it was a mistake, although I understand the compelling case for Committees such as the Foreign Affairs Committee to become engaged. My judgment might be wrong on that issue, but where this Parliament has got it wrong is in respect of the Inter-Parliamentary Union having Majlis delegations.</p>
	<p pid="c.55.0/2">I put it to the Minister that the British Government and this Parliament would not countenance comparable relationships with the Parliament of Belarus. For all their warts and deficiencies, the Lukashenko Government and that Parliament are innocent compared with the abuse of human rights and the denial of true franchise seen in Tehran. We have double standards. I wonder whether the Minister will comment on that.</p>

	<p pid="c.55.1/1">I am aware of the delegation, which is led by an experienced Member of Parliament who is a former Foreign Office Minister. I anticipate that he and other members of the delegation will be well aware of the issues that my hon. Friend has quite properly raised. However, I think it is for the judgment of individual Members of Parliament and members of delegations whether such visits go ahead. By visiting, it is possible to identify some of the very concerns that my hon. Friend is anxious about.</p>

	<p pid="c.56.2/1">Repeatedly.</p>
	<p pid="c.56.2/2">I was dealing with the question of political freedoms, and I turn now to freedom of expression. As anyone who reads Iranian newspapers will be aware, they certainly engage in colourful and sometimes vigorous debate, but it appears that the confines of such debate are closely circumscribed. In the course of the past five years, the regime has quietly extended its control over the Iranian people's ability to express their views. Dozens of newspapers have been closed and journalists have been arrested. The journalist Arzhang Davoudi received a 15-year sentence simply for producing a documentary about another journalist who died in custody in suspicious circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.56.2/3">The Iranian Government's clampdown on the internet has largely passed unnoticed but is also of concern. Many websites that were accessible in Tehran two years ago are now censored, including the BBC's Persian news website. The Iranian Government recently announced plans to establish a national internet. That would further restrict communication between Iran and the outside world. It would also facilitate control by the authorities. It appears that the Iranian Government do not believe that the Iranian people should be able freely to choose what they read.</p>
	<p pid="c.56.2/4">The situation of Iran's trade unions is also of concern. Strikes are not permitted, and in January hundreds of Tehran bus drivers were arrested for taking part in a series of strikes. The wives of some protestors were also arrested and several houses were searched. The head of the bus drivers' syndicate remains in custody, some four months after the strikes.</p>
	<p pid="c.56.2/5">Hon. Members voiced concern about the situation faced by Iran's religious minorities, and I am grateful to them for their continuing efforts in ensuring that Parliament is kept abreast of developments. Reports that Iran's supreme leader has instructed the army to identify Baha'is and monitor their activities are especially worrying. Hundreds of Baha'is have had their property confiscated, faced intimidation or been denied access to education. Mehran Kowsar is one of many members of the Baha'i faith to have been arrested for his religious beliefs; he has been in prison for well over a year. It is clear from that case that elements of the Iranian judicial system are in need of urgent reform.</p>

	<p pid="c.56.3/1">I apologise for not having heard the whole debate, but I did watch <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" name="Louise Ellman">the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)</phrase> on television.</p>
	<p pid="c.56.3/2">So far, the one group that has not been mentioned is lesbians and gays. Many gay men have been executed in the past year. Indeed, execution comes not just through the courts but through officially or unofficially sanctioned death squads roaming villages, trying to find young gay men and executing them. That is outrageous and extraordinary. Has the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had an opportunity to raise that specific issue with Tehran?</p>

	<p pid="c.57.0/1">Certainly there is concern about the situation faced by homosexuals and we are monitoring the situation carefully. We are not aware of any individuals being executed in Iran over the past two years solely on the grounds of homosexuality, but clearly there are other ways in which homosexuals are seriously affected by how the law operates there.</p>

	<p pid="c.57.1/1">I would be very worried if the FCO genuinely believed that no one had been executed solely because of their sexuality. Trumped-up charges are brought before courts regularly, and it is the work of many organisations in this country to reveal the true outrages going on in Iran. The FCO should look into the issue much more carefully.</p>

	<p pid="c.57.2/1">I chose my words carefully, and I do not see any need to resile from them. Charges are brought for other matters, but I accept the force of what my hon. Friend was suggesting and the issue is of concern to us.</p>
	<p pid="c.57.2/2">Referring to the Iranian judicial system, we have concerns about court hearings not always being held in public and about the principle of due process not always being respected. Cruel punishments such as flogging, stoning and amputation remain on the statute book. In a prominent recent case, the Iranian authorities executed two youths&mdash;one aged 17 and the other 20&mdash;on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-13">13 May</phrase> this year. They were hanged in Lorestan province barely a month after their alleged crime. The case raises important questions. How could a fair trial be completed in such a short time? Were the two able to exhaust every avenue of appeal open to them? Why does Iran continue to execute under-18s, in violation of international law?</p>
	<p pid="c.57.2/3">The UK Government and the European Union have, naturally, posed those questions to the Iranian Government, but the case highlights important inconsistencies between Iran's stated policy of ending such executions and its actions. The international community clearly has a duty to respond to such developments, which undermine basic principles of human rights, and we are committed to addressing that issue.</p>

	<p pid="c.57.3/1">I hope that the Minister will not think me impertinent, but before he concludes I would like him to tell us precisely what Her Majesty's Government have done about such issues. Anyone who looks at the record tomorrow will see that, in the past few minutes, the Minister has acknowledged that we are aware of the problems. I want to know&mdash;as does the House&mdash;what he and his colleagues in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office do in the face of those repeated human rights abuses, of which they are aware.</p>

	<p pid="c.57.4/1">I am, as always, grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. I was just about to set out what we have done.</p>
	<p pid="c.57.4/2">Under the British presidency of the European Union, we raised our human rights concerns with the Iranian Government on no fewer than 16 occasions. We led the European Union in issuing five statements, covering many of the issues that we have discussed today. We were pleased that all EU member states supported a UN General Assembly resolution that highlighted Iran's human rights record last December. We have continued to be active in supporting EU action since then. We said at the start of our presidency that human rights would be a priority in our relations with Iran, and it remains a central part of our policy approach. Progress in our relations with Iran is dependent on action by the Iranian Government to address our human rights concerns.</p>

	<p pid="c.58.0/1">Is the Minister, like me, an optimist about human nature, and if so, does he agree that however difficult it has been so far to secure a change through dialogue with Iran, there is mileage in hoping that, through dialogue and by presenting the benefits of constructive action by the Iranian Government, we could make progress? I would be less optimistic if I had not seen some signs of response from the Iranian Administration in the past, especially when they knew that the public abroad were watching. Does the Minister think that dialogue might be worth while, and if so, can we discuss, outside today's debate, the options for holding such dialogue with regard to the Baha'i?</p>

	<p pid="c.58.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He sets out the position sensibly and in a way that allows for progress. By highlighting the problems, we draw attention to how the Iranian Government should improve their record on human rights, but we must also acknowledge that the picture is not uniformly bad. There are areas where progress can be made&mdash;and indeed the benefit of this debate is that it allows us all to set out our concerns&mdash;but we acknowledge that in some areas there has been progress, although clearly far more work needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="c.58.1/2">In the recent past, under the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, Iran seemed to be taking significant steps forward. I regret that that progress has slowed in recent years. Indeed, as we have discussed, in many areas Iran is, sadly, moving backwards. However, we should not devalue the efforts of those in Iran who are working for reforms. Their task is being made increasingly difficult.</p>

	<p pid="c.59.1/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to raise one of the most important issues facing my constituency. It also affects the wider south Manchester and Cheshire sub-region.</p>
	<p pid="c.59.1/2">Following the Government's roads review in 1998, long-held plans for three new road schemes in the south-east Manchester area were reconsidered as part of the Government's multi-modal study for the north-west region. The three schemes are: the completion of the Manchester airport link road, west; a new Poynton bypass; and an A6 Hazel Grove bypass. The three roads are all interlinked and together make up what is commonly referred to as the south-east Manchester multi-modal study area&mdash;SEMMMS&mdash;or the A555 relief road. It is not a catchy name, I admit, but its importance to our area is immense. The plans for those roads, in various different forms, have been on the cards for decades. Indeed, the route of the relief road in my constituency has enjoyed protected planning status for around 60 years, and large numbers of houses and businesses in the locality have been shaped around those plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.59.1/3">I hope that hon. Members appreciate the patience displayed by local people in my constituency and those neighbouring it. A succession of MPs, including my predecessor Patsy Calton and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" name="Andrew Stunell">my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase>&mdash;who I am sure will give his views this afternoon on the importance of the scheme to his constituency&mdash;have fought doggedly to keep the relief road high on the agenda and to deliver a transport network that is fit to meet the needs of our communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.59.1/4">Since the completion of the SEMMMS strategy five years ago, Stockport council and the neighbouring authorities in Manchester and Cheshire have invested considerable resources, time, effort and expertise into developing the road scheme. That represents one of those rare tripartite alliances at political level, but it has involved considerable co-operation on a professional basis, too. I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the work done by staff in the local authorities who have been involved in developing the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.59.1/5">In addition, the Government have provided substantial funding for aspects of the SEMMMS strategy and other local transport schemes in order to support the wider aims of the project. The public transport and regeneration improvements are welcome and are testament to the multi-modal nature of the project. There are, however, two gaping holes in the SEMMMS strategy that will ultimately determine the success of the policy, and with it traffic conditions in the community for a generation or more to come. The first is the extension of the Metrolink tram network, about which many of us have strong feelings, but which I shall leave for a different debate. The second is the relief road.</p>
	<p pid="c.59.1/6">As we debate the issue this afternoon, Stockport council has been in the process of re-submitting further technical and financial details to the Department for Transport, as requested, in advance of what we understand will be a final decision this autumn. We have reached an absolutely critical stage of the process, and as decision day looms I am grateful for the opportunity to put the case in favour of the road to the Minister. I hope that she will be able to take on board the views expressed this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="c.59.1/7">The case in favour of the relief road is substantial to say the least. For example, consultation with residents and other stakeholders on the SEMMMS strategy, and more recently on the relief road itself, has been thorough and its results extremely positive. Environmental studies have been carried out in a meticulous fashion. The key local authorities involved have co-operated with the Department for Transport's funding criteria and an expression of interest for a private finance initiative bid was submitted to that end. On the finer details of the road itself&mdash;traffic analysis, the organisation of junctions, use of land and consideration for other road users, such as cyclists, those using public transport and pedestrians&mdash;no stone has been left unturned in developing the best possible solution. It is my firm belief that this work makes a compelling and outstanding case for the construction of the relief road. It will provide value for money and undoubtedly enhance the quality of life for many thousands of residents and millions of commuters.</p>
	<p pid="c.59.1/8">In the meantime, the relief road scheme has received the backing of local, sub-regional and regional partners, all of whom recognise its importance. The Greater Manchester chamber of commerce supports the plans; Manchester airport&mdash;a key economic driver for our region&mdash;is in favour; the regional assembly emphasises the strategic importance of the road not just to south Manchester but to the north-west as a whole; and most importantly, local people, who know the roads best, are overwhelmingly in favour of the scheme. During the last major public consultation, approval rates were around the 90 per cent. mark.</p>
	<p pid="c.59.1/9">I have repeated on many occasions during this long process that a policy of building our way out of the trouble when it comes to traffic congestion is not the solution by itself. That is precisely why this scheme has been designed not to attract extra traffic but to deal with existing levels more sensibly and efficiently. It is also why it is an integral part of a wider package of public transport improvements, including Metrolink, which I mentioned earlier. The simple fact is that the south-east Manchester area has a road network that never has been, and never will be, able to cope with its volumes and patterns of traffic. Previous Governments have ignored and compounded the situation, but Ministers have now been presented with an ideal opportunity to correct and improve matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.59.1/10">If further evidence of the unsuitability of the current network is required, one has only to look at the existing A555 airport link road. In short, the A555 currently represents a colossal waste of public money insofar as the central section of the scheme was built first, but its beginning and end were never built. It is no wonder that it has been christened by local residents as the &quot;road to nowhere&quot;. It stands as a monument to bungled, short-term transport planning and its legacy has been to funnel congestion through Heald Green, Bramhall, Woodford and Poynton&mdash;to name just a few of the districts affected. With that congestion has come damage to the quality of life for people living in those areas. Residents in the Cheadle constituency put up considerable opposition to that &quot;road to nowhere&quot; at the public inquiry 15 years ago, and they were right to do so. I believe that they are right now in their support for the relief road and the need for its urgent completion.</p>
	<p pid="c.59.1/11">The benefits of the scheme as proposed go much further. There are many roads in the Cheadle constituency that simply were not designed to carry the weight of traffic that currently passes over them, which has such a negative impact on the quality of life locally. They include, to name just a few: Finney lane and Wilmslow road in Heald Green; Jackson's lane, Bramhall lane south and Woodford road in Bramhall; and the A34 at Gatley. I have not even mentioned the knock-on effects felt in other communities such as Cheadle and Cheadle Hulme, or at locations such as the A6 between Stockport and Hazel Grove&mdash;one of the busiest bus corridors in Europe and a transport route that all too often resembles one enormous, polluting car park.</p>

	<p pid="c.61.0/1">My hon. Friend has made a powerful case, and I hope that the Minister has listened carefully. He has just drawn attention to the A6 in my constituency, and the part of the A555 known as the Hazel Grove bypass will complete the road network in my area. It is a key part of the Government's strategy. It is cost-effective, essential and has broad local support. It is part of a package; my hon. Friend mentioned the tram and rail links. Does he agree that we need the Minister to give the go-ahead to the public inquiry, so that we can roll the scheme forward for the benefit of his constituents and mine, and the whole community of south-east Manchester?</p>

	<p pid="c.61.1/1">My hon. Friend makes his point in his usual exemplary way. I agree that we are looking for the Minister to indicate that the Government will give the green light to the public inquiry and allow the urgent completion of the road scheme that is so badly needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.61.1/2">Of course, the south-east Manchester region is not alone in facing severe traffic congestion; I am fully prepared to acknowledge that. We are not alone in lobbying for major improvements, as I am sure the Minister will testify, but the plan is unique in that it is a long-term, sustainable scheme. It is my firm belief&mdash;shared by many others&mdash;that it deserves the approval of the Department for Transport. To the best of my knowledge, no other scheme has been in the planning for so long while having so much support from so many different sections of the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.61.1/3">A vast array of information has been made available to the Department for Transport about this scheme&mdash;much more than we could possibly do justice to in the short time we have this afternoon&mdash;concerning traffic flows, junction design, environmental factors, public transport integration, consultation, cost-benefit analysis and much more. On every count, the SEMMMS A555 relief road comes out positively.</p>
	<p pid="c.61.1/4">Ministers have made themselves available to speak to me and other Members over the years about the importance of the scheme, and I thank them for that. Without wishing to tempt fate, I have always found their attitude to the scheme to be positive and their responses to be constructive, if slightly more non-committal than I would have liked. However, as I have already said, I simply do not believe that any other transport project has jumped through as many governmental hoops, has overcome as many obstacles and has the backing of such a wide group of interested parties as this relief road.</p>
	<p pid="c.61.1/5">It is not a cheap project and as we continue to await the Government's response costs will inevitably creep upwards, but its benefits to our region mean that it is worth fighting for. The Minister and the Government have been presented with a chance to deliver a visionary, ambitious and truly integrated transport strategy for our region. I implore the Government to seize this unique opportunity and approve the road. My constituents and many others are depending on it.</p>

	<p pid="c.62.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase> on securing the debate. I have carefully listened to the points that he has made so clearly.</p>
	<p pid="c.62.0/2">I feel that it would be helpful if I structured my response. First, I will set out the background as I see it; secondly, I will review the progress so far; thirdly, I will review the current state of play; and last but by no means least I will outline the issues before us, many of which I realise the hon. Gentleman appreciates.</p>
	<p pid="c.62.0/3">To set out the background, the south-east Manchester multi-modal study&mdash;SEMMMS&mdash;was one of 22 multi-modal studies set up following the 1998 review of the roads programme to consider the case for major schemes on key sections of the road network. An important feature of the studies was that they looked in detail at the contribution that public transport improvements could make to resolving the identified problems on the road network, reflecting the principles set out in the 1998 integrated transport White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="c.62.0/4">Three linked road schemes were originally planned as trunk road improvements&mdash;the A6 Stockport north-south bypass, the A555 Manchester airport link road west and the A555-A523 Poynton bypass&mdash;and were all remitted to the SEMMMS. After examining a range of options, the study concluded that those road schemes should be taken forward on a smaller scale than the original trunk road proposals to cater more for the needs of local traffic than for longer distance strategic traffic.</p>
	<p pid="c.62.0/5">The study recommended that the road improvements should be implemented alongside a package of other improvements including quality bus corridors, light and heavy rail improvements, measures to encourage cycling and walking, and initiatives to encourage more sustainable patterns of travel, all of which I am sure would be welcomed by the hon. Gentleman's constituents. The study also recognised that although some of those measures could be implemented quite quickly, the larger investment proposals would require further detailed development and appraisal before they could be considered for entry into the Government's approved programme of transport improvements. In particular, that applied to the major road scheme proposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.62.0/6">March 2002 brought our response to the study's recommendations, which invited the three local authorities to continue the development of the road schemes and to bring forward detailed proposals for further consideration under the local transport plan funding arrangements. An issue raised generally by multi-modal studies was that many of them proposed ambitious programmes of investment that, in aggregate, would not have been realistically affordable.</p>
	<p pid="c.62.0/7">It is worth pointing out that partly because of that experience we have now introduced a much more transparent system for seeking regional views on the transport investment priorities within indicative regional funding allocations. Regional and local bodies have a much clearer picture of the resources that are likely to be available to their region over the next 10 years. We have given them the opportunity to advise the Government on how they think those resources should be allocated to best serve the region's needs and objectives. The advice was received from the regions earlier in the year and we plan to respond to it shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.63.1/1">I will be addressing that point, so the hon. Gentleman will have to be a little patient.</p>
	<p pid="c.63.1/2">I want to move on to reviewing the progress that we have made so far in implementing the SEMMMS recommendations. Good progress has undoubtedly been made and many of the shorter-term measures are in place. Up to 2006-07 we have allocated &pound;55 million for small-scale integrated transport works and &pound;23 million to the SEMMMS quality bus corridor scheme, which is now well advanced. I am glad to say that that funding is bringing real benefits to south-east Manchester through improved bus reliability and patronage, the regeneration of local and district centres, improved pedestrianisation and cycling facilities, road safety improvements and initiatives to reduce the number of cars on the road. I want to put on record my congratulations to the authorities concerned on the progress that they have made with the measures. I look forward to seeing that continue.</p>
	<p pid="c.63.1/3">I turn now to reviewing the current state of play. Alongside all the work that I have described, the three local authorities, led by Stockport, have made significant progress in developing and appraising the major road improvements recommended by SEMMMS: the north-south bypass of Stockport, the completion of the link road into Manchester airport and the Poynton bypass. The authorities' detailed appraisal of the proposals and bid for funding was submitted to the Department in July 2004. A number of issues on the transport modelling, scheme appraisal and funding arrangements were followed up over the following year.</p>
	<p pid="c.63.1/4">In the light of that further work, the Department is satisfied that the transport modelling and appraisal of the scheme is now sufficiently well developed for the purposes of a decision on the entry of the scheme into our approved programme of transport investments. We also recognise that the scheme appraisal produced by the authorities demonstrates that the SEMMMS road proposals would bring significant benefits to the south-east Manchester area, including bringing traffic relief to a number of local centres and the improvement of access to Manchester airport and other employment centres. They would provide a high-quality route for freight traffic from south-east Manchester to access the trunk road network and help to facilitate complementary measures to encourage walking, cycling and bus usage.</p>
	<p pid="c.63.1/5">However, we have to remember that alongside those benefits there would also be some negative impacts, particularly on the environment. In particular, the north-south bypass of Stockport would run through the Goyt valley, adversely impacting on the landscape and biodiversity of the area.</p>
	<p pid="c.63.1/6">I recognise that it is now some time since the Department concluded its work on the appraisal of the scheme, and the hon. Member for Cheadle asks why that is so. It would be helpful to outline the challenges that need to be addressed before a decision can be reached. First, I would like to consider the cost of the SEMMMS road scheme. A key factor that has to be very carefully considered is that the SEMMMS road proposals are extremely expensive. Although it is true that the proposed scheme is on a smaller scale than the previous trunk road proposals, the authorities' latest estimate of the cost of delivering the complete SEMMMS road scheme is around &pound;550 million. That assumes that construction will start before the end of the decade and that construction inflation will run at 2.5 per cent. over the period. That cost estimate is significantly higher than that produced for the multi-modal study.</p>
	<p pid="c.63.1/7">Moreover, evidence has emerged across both the trunk road and the local roads programmes in recent months that suggests that construction inflation has risen significantly more quickly than 2.5 per cent. per annum, partly due to increasing oil and commodity prices. In view of that evidence, departmental officials recently asked Stockport to review the current cost estimate, looking in particular at the potential pressure on construction costs. We are awaiting Stockport's response on that. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that no Government could enter into such a large investment decision without considering carefully the scheme's affordability and deliverability, and the implications for other priorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.64.0/1">I am grateful for the generally positive and supportive things that the Minister has said about the relief road scheme, but does she not accept that it is somewhat frustrating for those who have long campaigned for the relief road to be completed to hear the Government talking about cost escalation, especially given that the delay caused by successive Governments has led to much of the increase in costs over that period? I acknowledged earlier that a substantial price tag was attached, but none the less local residents feel strongly that the Government ought to be prepared to meet their part of the bargain.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.64.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1686" speakername="Gillian Merron" colnum="64"  time="013:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0125.htm#06060647000456">
	<p pid="c.64.1/1">I appreciate the frustration expressed by the hon. Gentleman on behalf of his constituents. He rightly acknowledged, however, that previous Governments have failed to respond as he would have liked. I stress the need to take all factors properly into account before taking a decision.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/2">That leads me to the second point: funding and procurement. As is normal with all large transport schemes, we invited the three authorities to explore the possibility of private finance as a means of delivering and funding the SEMMMS road scheme. One of the principal advantages of private finance is that, for such large schemes, it can offer valuable efficiencies in the procurement and subsequent management of the assets over the life of the concession, which is normally 25 years. However, PFI is approved only when it represents better value for money than the alternative of conventional funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/3">The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Government provide financial support for local authority PFI schemes through the system of PFI credits. The amount of the PFI credit broadly represents the amount of capital investment that the Government are supporting financially. The authorities' latest estimate of the PFI credit funding requirement for the SEMMMS road scheme is about &pound;860 million, which covers both construction and future capital maintenance. As I have already noted, we have asked the authorities to update their cost estimate, which makes it possible that the estimated PFI credit requirement will increase further.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/4">Even at &pound;860 million, that is a very large amount of funding. For example, it is more than the Department's total PFI budget for the current year for local authority transport PFI schemes in the whole of England. We must therefore consider the affordability of SEMMMS alongside our other priorities for PFI funding&mdash;including, for example, our programmes for street lighting and road maintenance, as well as other major investment schemes. We are still considering the provision of PFI funding for the scheme, which raises some complex issues, but it has to be recognised that delivering SEMMMS as a conventionally funded scheme would raise even more difficult questions on affordability.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/5">As I mentioned earlier, we provided each region last year with indicative funding allocations for major transport schemes over the next decade. In the north west, the funding allocation starts at &pound;115 million in 2006-07, rising to &pound;135 million in 2014-15. The north-west has an ambitious programme of transport improvements and, even without SEMMMS, it has faced some difficult choices in deciding which schemes to prioritise. It is clear that SEMMMS, at its current estimated cost of some &pound;550 million, would take up several years of the region's allocation if the scheme were to be funded conventionally. It seems doubtful that the region would be prepared to prioritise funding for the SEMMMS scheme by sacrificing a major part of its other scheme priorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.66.0/1">I am sure that the Minister will have papers showing that the public sector contribution to the scheme is &pound;32 million. We are talking about a PFI scheme, which is outside those limits&mdash;and that was the point of the refinancing package supplied by the three authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.66.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman, but that is all that we are considering in reaching a decision. I must tell both hon. Gentlemen that we need to consider how such an ambitious scheme can be funded other than conventionally. It is only right and proper to put those issues before the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.66.1/2">All of that raises significant issues about the provision of funding for the SEMMMS road proposals. We recognise the good work that Stockport and the other authorities have carried out to develop and appraise the SEMMMS road proposals, and we understand their desire, as well as that of the hon. Gentlemen, for a decision to be made as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.66.1/3">We also recognise the importance of the scheme and the benefits that it would bring to the south-east area of Manchester. However, it would represent an enormous investment by Government. We need to consider the risks associated with the scheme as well as our other funding priorities. I cannot today give a definitive date for reaching a decision. I can say only that we aim to work through the issues and to reach a decision as speedily as possible. I anticipate that that will be before the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="c.66.1/4">Once again, I congratulate the hon. Member for Cheadle on securing this debate, which has given me the opportunity to set out the position and associated issues in respect of such an important matter.</p>

	<p pid="c.67.1/1">I am grateful to have the chance, yet again, to raise in this place what I believe is a vital and important matter. I am pleased to see the Minister in his place. He has returned from visiting our oldest veteran, who I believe is 110 years old. It was a great ministerial duty&mdash;and, I am sure, one of importance to the nation&mdash;to visit one of our oldest and most important citizens.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/2">Defence is a genuine interest of mine. I used to be an adviser at the Army Land Command headquarters. I maintain the rank of Major, and I am still on the reserve list of the Territorial Army. Most important of all, I represent a constituency with a proud history of providing our Army, Navy and Air Force with the real means to do the job&mdash;in other words, to put forward the Government's will anywhere in the world. In Bridgwater, we make bombs. We have done so efficiently, economically and successfully for more than 50 years&mdash;since 1939 in fact. Some of my constituents are the best legal bomb-makers in the business. They are true specialists and dedicated to their work. Unfortunately, next year there may be no work for them to do. Next year, the people who now own what we call the Royal Ordnance just outside Puriton intend to close it. Why? They reckon that they can buy what we need elsewhere in the world but a whole lot cheaper&mdash;and unfortunately they have convinced the Government&mdash;but they are absolutely wrong, and history proves them to be wrong.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/3">It is rather pithy that the debate should be on the anniversary of D-day. It was today, 62 years ago&mdash;unfortunately, the Minister and I were not there. Thank God for the Americans; we launched a joint operation from these islands to bring a final end to the bloodshed that we know as the second world war. Brave allied soldiers&mdash;British, American, Canadian, Australian and other allied forces&mdash;landed on the beaches of Normandy. It was the severest test of manpower and equipment. The symbolism of a successful invasion disguised the carnage; we have only to ask those soldiers who survived. Putting it in today's crude terms, there were far too many Private Ryans, far too many weapon systems that did not share the same ammunition, far too many home-grown disasters on that day. D-day was a victory, but it was also something of a miracle.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/4">Military success relies on courage, training and scrupulous attention to detail. That detail includes knowing exactly what your weapons are capable of doing&mdash;what they will do when the trigger is pulled. We can be completely sure only if we know exactly where the kit was made and by whom. When Hannibal set off across the Alps, he had not bought his elephants on eBay; he knew exactly where they came from and what they were capable of. Those elephants were tried, tested and reliable. In Queen Victoria's time, the dear old British Admiralty, which we all love, would insist that every issue and item of munitions on board all our fighting ships was made here, at home&mdash;hence the Royal Ordnance factories, which have existed since the days of Henry VIII.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/5">Even the glasses for the telescopes had to come from a specific British manufacturer with a reputation for excellence&mdash;no ifs or buts. That was not blind patriotism or protectionism, but simple common sense. I wish our neighbours and allies no disrespect whatever; I have trained and worked with most of them. However, British standards in military matters have rightly always been of the very highest; every other nation works hard to match them. There is a huge risk in buying bits and pieces&mdash;especially those deliberately designed to go bang&mdash;on the open arms market.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/6">I am afraid that under many Governments, Britain has acted stupidly in the past. Not long ago, the British Army took delivery from India of an enormous consignment of 9 mm ammunition. I have a horrible suspicion that it was bought as a special offer&mdash;probably two for the price of one. The ammunition jammed and misfired with such frightening regularity that it was taken out to sea and quietly dumped. Meanwhile, British officers and soldiers who attempted to fire certain 7.62 mm shells made in Portugal still refer to them as &quot;Lisbon crackers&quot;. Unfortunately, once again, the Ministry of Defence had to cut its losses; it fed the useless Portuguese munitions to the fish. Buying those munitions was neither sensible nor economic.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/7">We still have problems with shells. These days we get them from France, where &quot;quality control&quot; is a phrase for which there does not seem to be a direct translation. Even suppliers in Germany are suspect on quality. I hope that the Minister is taking note of what I say; I am delighted that he is here, although I accept that responsibility for defence procurement lies with another Minister. As the Minister can well imagine, much of the information comes from the experts who make the bombs in Bridgwater. Those people, who make up an old work force, have spent their lifetimes in the industry. They believe strongly in their country and in what they do, and still see themselves as employees of the Royal Ordnance factories.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/8">I shall provide an example of some slightly heavier artillery. The old Royal Ordnance factories won a contract to manufacture the RO18, a weapon still in service today. However, the MOD first insisted on buying a Belgian version, which went on test in Canada and proved so inaccurate that the safe area for our troops had to be increased tenfold. The Secretary of State at the time&mdash;not the present one&mdash;said that he knew all about it. He explained that the fault was common, but refused to stop the MOD buying cheap Belgian products. That was not acceptable. The only line of defence against the shoddy workmanship was the expertise of Royal Ordnance staff, who were then responsible for checking every item of stock that came in. One report eerily catalogued the landing of a consignment from a European arms factory:</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/9" class="indent">&quot;When the first batch arrived the base plates simply fell off. We had to teach them how to weld them on!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/10">That ought to be the scary stuff of history. Unfortunately, however, I know that it still happens. The more we buy abroad in the mistaken belief that cheapest is best, the more we risk embarrassment, accident and, ultimately, potential military disaster.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/11">When loading big munitions, we need propellant, which we used to make here. However, now we buy it from Switzerland&mdash;a little nation more famous for its cuckoo clocks and chocolate. Swiss propellant still gives problems. We still import erratic naval shells from Australia. TNT from eastern Europe is of &quot;very dubious quality indeed&quot;. Those words are not mine, but from the report of someone who deals with TNT and works inside this close-knit and very loyal British industry. Why are we forced to import TNT, of all things, from eastern Europe? The British company that makes it over here reckons that it can make far more money by not making it here at all.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/12">The parliamentary advisers to BAE Systems should start taking note at this point. British Aerospace was proud enough to use the national name when it bought Royal Ordnance plc in 1986, not under this Government. However, then came the rebrand&mdash;everything in this country has to be rebranded. Out went the words &quot;British Aerospace&quot;; in came the abbreviation &quot;BAE&quot;. The company is now so busy getting rid of other essential British assets that I rather wonder why its title still includes the B for British at all. I do not believe that it is a British company any more. We should say goodbye to Airbus and to the Bridgwater bomb factory, too&mdash;it is all becoming a bit of a tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/13">Some 130 BAE Systems workers agree with me, as do, I like to think, many Members of this House. My illustrious predecessor, the former Secretary of State, Lord King, agrees with me. Shutting the BAE plant would be much more than a local blow; it would be a national disgrace. It could put at risk the very defence of the realm, about which every Member, regardless of who they are, should care.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/14">We started making armaments in Bridgwater during the last war; it was a question of necessity. Germany was stretching our military capabilities to the limits. It was in my local Royal Ordnance factory that the famous bouncing bombs designed to destroy the Ruhr dams were loaded. Their inventor, Sir Barnes Wallis, is probably rotating in his grave at the news that we now know.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/15">The bombs aimed at Saddam Hussein's bunkers were also made at Bridgwater; the final charges for our ultimate weapons are still made in the area. Next year, however, the essential ingredients will be shipped in from France, provided that the French are not on strike. Relying on foreign suppliers for anything as essential as military munitions is mad. No Government should treat defence as they do commerce, and no Government should ever be held hostage by any company, British or otherwise. Who will pack our bombs in future? Who will load our bullets? It will not be done at Glascoed.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/16">I hope that my questions are sensible, but so far I have not been given a real answer from any Minister in this place or the Lords. I have corresponded with Ministers and taken part in rather too many detailed face-to-face sessions. I am always told, not only by Ministers, but BAE, &quot;There is nothing to worry about; BAE Systems is confident that there is no risk to supply.&quot; I am sorry, but I do not believe that. I can understand why BAE Systems cannot be bothered with a little bomb-making factory that ticks over nicely but will never make a real bomb in the financial sense.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/17">I am told that a consignment of explosives was recently shipped from France to Somerset so that the experts at Puriton could have a look at it. The product was passable&mdash;just about. However, security at the French depot at which it was collected was lamentable. The gates were wide open; the staff had gone to lunch. The lorry driver went in, picked the stuff up himself and delivered it back here. That cannot be right in any country. It certainly would not happen here&mdash;I know that it would not&mdash;and it should not be allowed to happen in places on which we depend in other countries. Making weapons is far too important to leave to the sloppy or cut-throat practices of the marketplace. I am convinced that the risks of buying abroad outweigh the advantages. To adapt the words used by a recent Defence Secretary when giving evidence to a Select Committee, buying abroad is not &quot;fit for purpose.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.67.1/18">Of course closing our arms factory would be a bitter blow to Bridgwater, but it would also be a dangerous step for national security. I ask the Minister to use his muscle and to intervene before it is too late.</p>

	<p pid="c.70.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" name="Ian Liddell-Grainger">the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger)</phrase> on securing a further debate on the procurement of munitions and for providing me with the opportunity to speak in my first ever Adjournment debate as a Minister.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.0/2">The hon. Gentleman brings his considerable defence experience to the debate, and he is a powerful advocate for his constituents. I suspect that I shall be able to reassure him on the points he raised about security of supply, although I shall not be as reassuring on the independent commercial decisions made by BAE Systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.0/3">The hon. Gentleman has raised vital strategic issues, and I recognise the disappointment being felt by the loyal, committed and experienced work force in Bridgwater. Although general munitions are important for the future of defence, this is a commercial decision for the company. However, I understand what the work force must be feeling. As a former trade union representative, I hope that I can be sensitive to that.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.0/4">Turning more specifically to weapons and ammunition, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that the UK defence market is the most open in the world. We procure a range of weapon systems from overseas that provides us with an effective military capability and value for money to the British taxpayer. It includes munitions&mdash;I shall refer to some of his specific points on munitions later&mdash;but also complex weapons and other equipment. It would be wrong to deny ourselves the opportunity to draw from a wider market if it made sense to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.0/5">The focus of the debate is the use of foreign-procured munitions, which is an emotive issue on both sides of the House, but one which I assure the hon. Gentleman has been thoroughly investigated and tested by Members of the House in Adjournment debates in this Chamber and on the Floor of the House. Such investigation helped to underpin much of the munitions chapter of the defence industrial strategy, which provided clarity in the thinking of the Ministry of Defence on the supply of general munitions.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.0/6">The strategy explicitly recognised the military importance of munitions and the critical capabilities that we want to retain and develop in the UK industrial base, such as the ability to design munitions, support them through life and test them safely. In that regard, we have a stated policy to convert our explosives to insensitive munitions.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.0/7">On the hon. Gentleman's point about TNT, of course it was important to our general munitions policy in the past, but demand for it will decrease as we start switching to insensitive munitions with a polymer-bonded explosive that do not rely on TNT as the explosive fill.</p>

	<p pid="c.71.0/1">Is the Minister aware that the Americans tried to make that explosive and blew up the plant? He may not be aware of that, as he is filling in. BAE Systems people have gone out to Holston to help sort out the mess.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.71.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1919" speakername="Tom Watson" colnum="71"  time="013:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0126.htm#06060647000492">
	<p pid="c.71.1/1">I am not aware of that situation. Obviously, my officials will find out about it, and I will write to the hon. Gentleman if I cannot get an answer in the next 20 minutes.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/2">The re-engineering of the explosives manufacturing process was always going to be necessary, regardless of any company rationalisation plans. In simple terms, it was already undergoing considerable change as new technologies were adopted and new forms of chemical bonding developed.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/3">As the hon. Gentleman is aware, BAE Systems provides the armed forces with the majority of their general munitions mat&eacute;riel. In October, we reaffirmed our long-term commitment to BAE Systems and its supply of munitions in the form of signed partnering principles, which ensure security of supply of munitions and build on the framework partnering agreement that we signed with the company in 1999. Those principles encourage improved performance, value for money and modernisation of the company's systems. Without that, there is unlikely to be a substantial future for munitions production in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/4">Any site rationalisation activity is a commercial decision for the company. I strongly understand the hon. Gentleman's point about security of supply, but we have been given assurances that the required capability will be delivered at value for money. It may be that today we will have to disagree on our interpretation of those assurances.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/5">BAE Systems has announced the closure of two of its munitions sites: Chorley and, as the hon. Gentleman knows, Bridgwater. I understand his continuing concern about the Bridgwater site. If it were in my constituency, I would also be advocating my constituents' case. However, the decision remains a commercial matter for the company. I am aware that it is providing a comprehensive redundancy package that is well above the statutory minimum. In addition, there will be opportunities for relocation within the company. Nevertheless, as I said earlier, I recognise that this is a difficult time and that an older work force might choose not to take that option.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/6">BAES Land Systems intends to outsource the supply of several explosive products, but some elements of the explosives manufacturing process at Bridgwater will be transferred to Glascoed. As such, a programme of significant investment has commenced to underpin a secure and affordable source of supply and to ensure that essential munitions capabilities continue to be supplied from a UK base. To secure greater value for money, BAE Systems may source base materials for those munitions overseas.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/7">The company has assured us that, in assessing potential overseas sources of supply, security of supply considerations are a key factor in deciding which companies can provide such mat&eacute;riel. I have asked my officials at the MOD to keep me informed about this, and of course I will write to the hon. Gentleman if there are any changes.</p>
	<p pid="c.71.1/8">For a variety of other munitions, the MOD and BAE Systems have a significant stockpile of mat&eacute;riel to ensure access to munitions when the armed forces need them. The hon. Gentleman will be reassured by the fact that we have undertaken rigorous assessments of our future arrangements with BAES Land Systems in respect of the supply of munitions and are confident that the right decisions are being made on security of supply and value for money.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.72.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" speakername="Ian Liddell-Grainger" colnum="72"  time="013:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0126.htm#06060647000500">
	<p pid="c.72.0/1">The Minister is making a powerful point, but I beg to disagree with him. May I give him one example? During the first Gulf war, my predecessor, Lord King, asked the Belgians for 7.62 mm ammunition for general purpose machine guns. The Belgians refused to give it to us because they did not agree with our involvement in that war. I hope the Minister agrees that we cannot ignore the point that we have no say at all if a country disagrees.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.72.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1919" speakername="Tom Watson" colnum="72"  time="013:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0126.htm#06060647000501">
	<p pid="c.72.1/1">The countries that are hoping to supply us will have given guarantees that they will retain a security of supply. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be comforted on that point when I discuss Eurenco and future reassurances that we hope to make in that area.</p>
	<p pid="c.72.1/2">The company has indicated that it is likely to source raw materials from the Holston plant in the United States, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. It is one of two potential international suppliers, the other being Eurenco in France. The hon. Gentleman raised the point about security in a previous debate. I have been assured that BAE Systems has talked to the company about security, and perhaps some of his concerns could be allayed by its security arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.72.1/3">My officials have visited Holston and are wholly assured that it can easily produce ample quantities of the materials we require while meeting the stringent quality standards that he says are vital. However, the final decision on sourcing will be for the company, based on the parameters that we offer in the contract.</p>
	<p pid="c.72.1/4">The hon. Gentleman tried to test my French on quality control. I shall not even attempt to come up with a phrase, but I assure him that quality control underpins everything that our officials are trying to achieve in the contracts. It is important that we include a system of monitoring and testing so that quality never decreases. He raised an important point, and I hope that the systems that we put in place will reassure him in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="c.72.1/5">It should also be noted that the Holston plant can manufacture crude RDX to the same standard as that previously produced at Bridgwater. BAES Land Systems, overseen by the Defence Ordnance Safety Group, validated initial samples, and I am assured that they are of excellent quality. From the frown on the hon. Gentleman's face, we might have to disagree on that point as well. Each batch of raw material will be tested in the same manner to ensure continued quality.</p>
	<p pid="c.72.1/6">The hon. Gentleman should be reassured that the decision to support the company's plans was not taken lightly. The company could not allow a situation to continue in which BAE Systems was starting to underwrite inefficient production. We applaud the company's efforts to achieve a better balance of cost and capability. Its decisions are in line with the defence industrial strategy and are in the best interests of producing a modern and sustainable munitions business in the UK for which we can tell the British taxpayer we are getting value for money. I hope he understands that that is the balance we must strike.</p>
	<p pid="c.72.1/7">The hon. Gentleman should be reassured that a project team is closely monitoring and challenging BAE Systems as it undertakes that transition. I congratulate him, because these debates are profoundly challenging to BAE Systems as well, and perhaps a bit of parliamentary scrutiny will its keep technicians&mdash;although he mentioned its parliamentary officer&mdash;on their mettle.</p>
	<p pid="c.72.1/8">In addition, the company has contingency plans, particularly as there are at least two overseas suppliers for each of the main raw energetic materials that we require. Should the unforeseen happen and supply be interrupted from one source, BAE Systems will retain the technical ability to switch to the alternative or draw on existing stockpiles.</p>
	<p pid="c.72.1/9">Another benefit of the company's transition is the considerable investment&mdash;up to &pound;10 million&mdash;in its facility at Glascoed. That will become a centre of excellence in the development and production of insensitive munitions, which are what we will need to operate all our future munitions requirements safely.</p>

	<p pid="c.73.0/1">The Minister has been generous in giving way and I hardly dare ask him another question, but can he give an assurance on whether we have any long-term commitments as a nation to ensuring that the Glascoed plant is retained? Are there any long-term guarantees from BAE Systems on that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-06c.73.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1919" speakername="Tom Watson" colnum="73"  time="013:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060606/halltext/60606h0126.htm#06060647000511">
	<p pid="c.73.1/1">I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a long-term guarantee, but I can certainly write to him and sketch out the future arrangements for munitions manufacture.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/2">The company has already invested about &pound;12 million in the new insensitive munitions plant at Glascoed, and we continue to examine new ways to provide capability and value for money. That is not an exclusive process, and if the hon. Gentleman can bring his experience to bear on it, I will welcome his input and that of his colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/3">In munitions, that aim is being exercised through project MASS&mdash;munitions acquisition, the supply solution. With the hon. Gentleman's defence background, he will know that the MOD is fuelled by acronyms, and project MASS is one that does what it says on the tin. The project is in its assessment phase and is examining our requirements beyond 2010 with regard to the entire munitions supply chain, as well as analysing the potential benefits of further involving industry in the end-to-end supply chain for munitions.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/4">The hon. Gentleman should also be reassured that even though BAES Land Systems is doing its utmost to guarantee security of supply, we have gone one step further. The Department is taking active steps to help the company to create an even more robust supply chain. A good example of that can be seen in the potential Holston arrangements. The supply arrangement from Holston will be a commercial one between two separate arms of BAE Systems&mdash;BAES Land Systems in the UK and BAE Systems Inc. in the US, which runs Holston&mdash;but we are already in negotiation with the US Department of Defence for a stand-alone munitions memorandum of understanding to underpin that. That will ensure clear understanding on both sides of the importance of reliable supply.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/5">A similar memorandum of understanding with France is being considered for the products supplied by Eurenco, so on the hon. Gentleman's point about Belgium, I hope I can reassure him that we are trying to offer that extra confidence to the system.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/6">More widely, there are also a number of international agreements with our allies, such as the implementing agreement on security of supply with France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Sweden, and the US-UK defence co-operation memorandum of understanding, which provide support and assurance in the security of supply of defence equipment, including munitions.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/7">Although the supply of explosives to our armed forces is an emotive matter, it must be remembered that we already rely on overseas suppliers for a great deal of our equipment. The UK is successfully procuring a range of munitions components from overseas already, not to mention a range of complex weapons. Therefore, even if BAES Land Systems was to reinvest at Bridgwater and accept the resultant cuts in other capability areas, we would still have to source many of the remaining components of each ammunition round from overseas.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/8">In general, even if a UK company is the prime contractor for a particular equipment, it is likely that it will source many of the components from overseas. We would not wish to hamper UK companies in their efforts to produce top-line equipment for our troops by insisting that they source components in the UK. Obviously, a balance must be struck between security of supply and value for money, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will, if not be happy with my contribution, understand that we keep the issue at the forefront of our minds in every decision that is taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/9">Conversely, many of our allies rely on us for many of their defence equipments where we are the leaders in a particular area. Only through that global marketplace can we ensure that we can afford to give our troops the best equipment they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/10">As a new defence Minister, I say to the hon. Gentleman that I want the best equipped and the best trained forces, so that they can live up to their name as the best armed forces in the world. Although I do not do defence procurement&mdash;that is done by another Minister&mdash;and I am not the Minister with responsibility for the armed forces, that is a shared goal that all four Ministers at the Department are keen to achieve. Our new Secretary of State is particularly keen that we give the reassurances that the hon. Gentleman and other Members are looking for on security of supply.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/11">To sum up, I am confident that the changes that I have described will provide better capability at better value for money in such an important sector, ensuring that our armed forces are provided with the general munitions necessary for success on operations. The hon. Gentleman might not walk away with the assurances that he requires on the future of Bridgwater, but I hope that I have been able to allay some of his fears on the strategic level of security of supply.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/12">I understand how the hon. Gentleman is standing up for his constituents and the work force, and he has also talked to the trade unions about the issue. If there are any other ways in which the Department can soften the blow in our commercial relationship with BAE Systems, we will do everything we can to help him and his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/13" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/14" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at two minutes to Two o'clock.</p>
