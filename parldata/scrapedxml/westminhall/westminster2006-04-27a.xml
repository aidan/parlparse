	<p pid="a.329.3/1">It is a great pleasure to be able to introduce to the House a report of the Public Administration Committee on the honours system. It is always customary to say that reports are timely, but in this case the report is particularly so. However, in a sense it would always have been timely. I shall quote from a report:</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/2" class="indent">&quot;There is no doubt that there have been for some time, and recently in increasing numbers, persons who, for want of a better name, we may stigmatise as touts, who have been going about asserting that they were in a position to secure honours in return for specified payments&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/3">That is from the report of the royal commission on honours in 1922.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/4">Honours matter. They are important. I shall quote only once from our report, at the beginning of which we stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/5" class="indent">&quot;We take the honours system seriously, as a way in which the state seeks to recognise service and achievement that it values. This is an important function, which is why it deserves proper attention.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/6">We continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/7" class="indent">&quot;In particular, we consider that honours are not mere decorations; they are important symbols of what is valued in national life.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/8">Last week I visited a youth club in my constituency in an area called Hednesford, which is an old mining area. Just behind the Florence street Methodist church is a building that is no more than a wooden shack, in which a 70-year-old ex-miner twice a week runs an over-subscribed youth club. He is also, by the way, the caretaker at the local school, where he acts as a general counsellor to the students. It would never occur to that man that he might be thought of for any kind of honour. It is work that he does because he thinks he should, because his God has asked him to and his civic consciousness drives him to it. I cite that example only because I came away from there thinking, &quot;If ever a man needed an honour, it was that man.&quot; That is why the honours system matters. It is a way for us to say, &quot;This is the kind of activity that our society values&quot;. That is what the honours system should do.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/9">If we cause that system to be contaminated by things that should not contaminate it, we of course devalue the system across the board, for people including the man I have described, who deserve honour. That is what happens. A confusion has always existed between honour as something that we should like to value as a society and honour as a lubricant of patronage&mdash;usually patronage associated with money. Those two ingredients have always characterised the honours system and caused difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/10">As the first of my quotations suggests, there is nothing new about that. In case any hon. Member is minded this afternoon to try to make political points by describing the problem as a phenomenon of a particular period or Government, the merest glance at history is enough to sweep such attempts away. Our old friend Maundy Gregory, the only man to be convicted under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925, was only one of the touts who engaged in the trade in the first part of that century.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/11">It was said that Maundy Gregory would sell a viscountcy for &pound;80,000 to &pound;120,000 and a barony for &pound;30,000 to &pound;50,000, and that a baronetcy would cost from &pound;25,000 and a knighthood &pound;10,000 to &pound;15,000. Lloyd George is estimated to have amassed more than &pound;1.5 million in his private bank account from the sale of honours&mdash;that is about &pound;150 million at today's prices. Between 1916 and 1922, 120 hereditary peerages were created, and more than 1,500 knighthoods were awarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/12">It has been suggested that Gregory was paid &pound;30,000 a year for his role as an honours broker. He continued to sell honours after Lloyd George's resignation in 1922 and after the 1925 Act was passed, splitting his spoils with a corrupt Conservative official, Sir Leigh Maclachlan, and Sir Ronald Waterhouse, Stanley Baldwin's private secretary, through whom he was able to get names on the honours list. He was caught after approaching Edward Billyard-Leake, a retired naval lieutenant-commander, and offering him a price of &pound;10,000 for a knighthood.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/13">Billyard-Leake reported him to the police and Gregory was charged under the Act. He was fined &pound;50 and jailed for six months&mdash;of which he served two&mdash;in 1933. After serving his brief sentence in Wormwood Scrubs he was collected by a car from Conservative central office before he could be rearrested on a murder charge, and was whisked off to a life of exile in France on an alleged &pound;30,000 payment authorised by Baldwin; he died there in a prison camp during the Nazi occupation.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.3/14">I put that on the record only so that we may remember where we have come from; and so that, when some people suggest that there has been a great falling-off in standards in public life, we can compare standards in public life at the beginning of the 21st century to the things that were taking place at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

	<p pid="a.330.0/1">My predecessor as Member for Caernarfon, Lloyd George, took, in the 1920s, a very straightforward view of the sale of honours as a way of raising money for his political enterprises; does not the contrast with today lie in the amount of pious claptrap about the exchange of honours possibly for political support? Is it not that hypocrisy and claptrap that brings the system into disrepute in the country?</p>

	<p pid="a.333.5/1">As the renowned Tom Jones might say, it is not unusual to find people who would add lustre to awards in the way that my hon. Friend suggests in every community, county and region of the country. The problem in achieving fairness and diversity is shown by the fact that 3,000 awards are made a year and there are 1 million people in Leicestershire and Rutland. One sixtieth of 3,000 equals 50 awards a year. Do that many awards go to the people of Leicestershire and Rutland, or indeed to any other group of 1 million? No, of course not. There is a distinct metropolitan skew to the system, is there not?</p>

	<p pid="a.335.6/1">There is only one thing worse than deliberate political correctness, and that is deliberate political incorrectness. There is no reason why we should not think freshly and radically about such matters without being accused of political correctness. Indeed, we were given evidence, which we took strongly on board, by John Major, who was a great advocate of what he wanted to call&mdash;as we called it in the report&mdash;the order of British excellence. He thought that that was exactly the right kind of organic evolutionary change, retaining the letters but adapting the award into a form that everybody would feel comfortable accepting.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.6/2">We built on the suggestion, culled the number of awards down to four, and took account of the considerations of whether there should be separate awards for civil servants, concluding that there should not be. We think we have produced a proposal that takes the honours system out of the hands of politicians into those of an independent commission and is more sensible about defining the criteria for the receipt of honours and not just having them for people of higher rank or for people who are doing their job. We tried to define the basis of the system, removing the name-changing honours and having an honours commission that would report to Parliament on the characteristics of the honours system that have been raised by hon. Members, such as the people who it represents.</p>

	<p pid="a.336.1/1">It might be that a character of honour could appropriately be arrived at by that route. Perhaps honours for particular purposes, which we could define, would be a creative addition to the honours system. I am not averse to such an idea in principle. Do I think that Parliament should create the honours? No, I do not, for many reasons.</p>

	<p pid="a.336.3/1">The distinction is between those who can nominate and those who make awards. It is perfectly proper for Departments to make nominations, because they are often the ones who know best what is going on. The key point is who receives the nomination and who makes the reward.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.3/2">While we were conducting our inquiry the Government set up their own inquiry under Sir Hayden Phillips, who is turning out to be a jack of all trades on such reform. We had a good relationship with Sir Hayden as he was making his report. He produced a report on behalf of the Government, which they later largely accepted, that took on board some of these points. His report said that all we needed to do was have more external people on the awarding committees and more transparency about who they are, and that that would produce greater public confidence in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.3/3">In that sense, the Government have responded to some of the issues and put in place their own reforms. My view is that the Government's response was a halfway house. It would have been much better to take a proper, comprehensive look at the whole system, not just to tidy up the edges that are causing difficulty at the time, as a mandarin might do.</p>

	<p pid="a.338.3/1">That is an interesting point. The argument was that transparency would take care of the issue; that is, because we had transparency&mdash;again, we have to give the Government credit for legislating on party funding&mdash;but that role was not required. That was wrong. We need scrutiny of the higher honours too, not just of peerages.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.3/2">I end by returning to the 1922 royal commission on the honours system, which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.338.3/3" class="indent">&quot;It is repugnant to honest feeling that a person otherwise undeserving of an honour should get it simply because he promised to contribute so much to the Party funds&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.3/4">That is the case and has been so for a great number of years. The problem contaminates the House of Lords and it contaminates the honours system. It is my contention that something must be done about it. That is why we have to reform the honours system, reform the House of Lords and reform the system of party funding, because they are all indissolubly connected.</p>

	<p pid="a.339.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Tony Wright] on his introduction and his rather selective brief history. In summary, he said that the Liberal Democrats started raising money by selling peerages, that the Conservatives cottoned on and that the Labour Government have taken it up with great gusto. However, I do not want to make political points; I want to talk about a constituency matter. <i>[Interruption.]</i> No, I really do.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.0/2">In essence, whatever the House does, we will never remove the suspicion that people are awarded peerages because they have given money to a political party. Does the Minister agree that the only solution, the only way in which such suspicions can be entirely removed, is to have a completely elected House of Lords? If we did that, there would be no question of patronage.</p>

	<p pid="a.339.4/1">I am saying only that we should have an elected House of Lords. We have reached that stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.4/2">I hope that the Minister can answer my next point. I see no problem in someone who gives a large amount of money to an educational institution receiving an honour. The honour could be inscribed &quot;For provided funds to improve education&quot;. However, it would be a problem if that person were then made a Member of a House that makes our laws. It is correct that those who give donations for public service should receive honours, but they must be described as such. However, I am not concerned about those who make donations but with people who, in my view, really deserve honours.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.4/3">I have come across the problem twice in my political career. It first happened when I was in the Welsh valleys. The lady in question had worked for years on behalf of the Conservative party, almost single-handedly flying the flag. She had never wanted to go up the greasy pole and she had no personal ambition. She did it for what she believed in. I am sure that Labour Members know of similar people in their constituencies. I was asked to provide some background information with a view to that lady being given an honour. Unfortunately, she never received one. I would like to see more people like her receive honours.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.4/4">That brings me to my main point, which is a constituency matter. I shall not mention the name of the person concerned, because that might be counterproductive. My predecessor as the Member for Wellingborough worked hard for someone who had done much to improve the lot of children in a very deprived area of Africa. My predecessor had supported an application for an honour, but nothing ever happened. He came to see me, the newly elected Member for Wellingborough, and asked me to support the application and to ascertain what had gone wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.4/5">I made inquiries and found that the person in question had been rejected. I could see no reason for the rejection, and I have supported a new application. It transpired that there is a limit to the number of honours awarded each year, and the category in question was limited to 1,000 awards. I find it hard to believe that there were 1,000 people more worthy than my constituent. Will the Minister say whether honours are capped, or are they determined on merit?</p>
	<p pid="a.339.4/6">If he can, I would appreciate the Minister helping my constituent, who is extremely deserving, has spent years improving conditions for children in Africa, is well known locally and has had national recognition.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-27a.340.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" speakername="Michael Wills" colnum="340"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060427/halltext/60427h01.htm#60427h01_spnew49">
	<p pid="a.340.0/1">I begin by congratulating the Committee on an admirable, thorough, first-class report. I agree with most of it; it is constructive and it makes some important proposals for reform of the orders and the process by which such awards are made. I strongly associated myself with the remarks of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Tony Wright)</phrase> on the need for reform of the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/2">The honours system does matter, partly because the recognition embodied in the awards powerfully motivates those who serve&mdash;a significant point made by my hon. Friend&mdash;as well as their colleagues. The system also represents what we value as a nation. It is an important component of our national identity. The report reflects the widespread feeling that although the honours system still fulfils that purpose, in some important ways it fails adequately to reflect our national identity as many would wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/3">It is not a matter of individual awards, or even the sprinkling of stardust over each list. Ultimately, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase said, each award is subjective, and no matter how committees consider the honours system, that degree of subjectivity will remain. Rather, the question is about the overall balance of awards. What categories of individual receive awards, and why?</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/4">One issue goes to the heart of the question; it is fundamental to ensuring that the system properly reflects the values of the nation. It is how far the awards recognise exceptional achievement and exceptional service. If awards are given only in recognition of achievement, they could easily be seen as being little more than the privileged reinforcing their privileges&mdash;the great and the good establishing themselves even more firmly in the bastions of power and privilege. I hope that few people would think that such a process reflected something desirable in our national life.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/5">Equally, achievement cannot be excluded as a criterion. I share my hon. Friend's view of Sir David King's remarks to the Committee. It is important that awards should shed lustre on the award as well as dignifying the recipients. Exceptional achievements can clearly help do that. However, in this admirable report and more widely, the tendency has been to conflate the honouring of achievement and of service as if they are synonymous. They are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/6">Those who have achieved much in their lives may also have given great service to the nation, but it is not axiomatic. The report recognises the widespread dislike of honours being given to people for simply doing their job. However, I am not sure that it follows that a higher proportion of the higher honours should be given for service rather than achievement. When examining any honours list, it is hard to avoid the impression that awards for services rather than achievement are focused on the lower ranks of each order; the knights, the companions and the commanders are concentrated in the traditional ranks of the established classes.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/7">The report includes the evidence of Sir Hayden Phillips, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Fifty years ago around 40 per cent. of all awards went to Crown servants . . . it is now under 14 per cent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/9">That is 40 per cent. of all awards. It is often instructive to examine carefully the use of language by civil servants and politicians.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/10">The use of the word &quot;all&quot; drove me to look at the distribution of the higher awards. I read the summer list in 2005, and among the higher honours I counted 147 knighthoods and awards such as commanders and companions for various orders, of which, by my rough and ready analysis, 52 went to Crown servants. In other words, 35 per cent. went to the great and the good. When other categories of the great and the good are added to the equation, the proportion is far higher. That might not be surprising, but that does not make it acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/11">Any honours system must use a sifting process. There are two stages in the process that might easily work against those who have given exceptional service, but have not achieved eminent status. First, there is a sifting by category and occupation. It is right, in my view, that there should be an attempt to reflect all facets of national life in rewarding achievement. Not to do so would artificially elevate certain activities above others. It is also clear that that will be a subjective judgment, which might shift to reflect changes in national priorities. For example, the Government are focused on education being a priority, and that has led to educationalists appearing more prominently in the higher honours. Most people would agree that that change is welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/12">There will always be a tendency to reflect the most visible and powerful categories, not necessarily those who give the most selfless service to the nation. Some 200,000 people in this country work in social services. Those important, often thankless, jobs often require extraordinary dedication, but such workers are often punished and humiliated in the media when they make mistakes. They rarely receive public commendation when they get things right, and their jobs are not well paid. Yet how many social workers do we see in the upper echelons of the honours system every year? Does that imbalance reflect our core national values?</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/13">I do not say that businessmen and permanent secretaries should not qualify for such awards&mdash;of course they should&mdash;but I wonder whether they should receive them so disproportionately in comparison with the caring professions. I am not trying to elevate the status of the caring professions above that of business or that of the civil service. All can serve, but there should be a greater equivalence of esteem, and it should be reflected in the honours system.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/14">The second institutional bias in the system against honouring service instead of achievement might flow from the difficulty of identifying recipients. Achievement and status, by definition, thrust themselves forward for recognition. Exceptional service divorced from status will inevitably be harder to identify, but that does not mean that we should not try harder to do so. Of course, that will be a subjective process. I feel humbled every time I see a teacher of children with special needs at work. Their selfless patience and dedication, often in difficult circumstances, can be extraordinary, yet how many of those teachers do we see represented in the higher echelons of the awards every year?</p>
	<p pid="a.340.0/15">As I said earlier, my personal view is that the system is inherently subjective. If we had a system that genuinely recognised service rather than simply achievement, we would see, every year, among the knights, commanders and companions, not only the businessman but the social worker, and not only the head teacher&mdash;to pick up on a point that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> just made&mdash;but the form teacher who has given selfless service over many years. We would see not only the head of a royal college, but the hospital cleaner. If that seems a strange proposition, it is only because the system rewards status more than effort. We can all think of genuinely selfless people who make extraordinary efforts on the part of others, yet whose status in society apparently renders them ineligible for the higher honours. I am talking not about the lower orders, but the higher honours which inherently reflect the value that we place on them in society.</p>

	<p pid="a.343.4/1">Suppose that a police sergeant were to be made a knight. Given that there are 43 police forces in England and Wales&mdash;I do not know how many there are in Scotland&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Eight in Scotland, I am reliably informed. There is one knight in all 43 forces, plus the eight in Scotland. Does my hon. Friend think that it might devalue a knighthood if so many were given out in one tranche every year?</p>

	<p pid="a.343.5/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his contribution, but there is no question of inflating the number of honours given out; it is just a question of distributing them differently. I thought that my hon. Friend was going to make a slightly different point&mdash;one with which I have sympathy, because it is practical&mdash;about how conferring a higher honour on a police sergeant who had gone that extra mile would impact on his position in his police force, and about whether that would undermine the command structure in that force. That would be a practical issue. However, the fact that we think that that is a problem says much about how we think the honours system reinforces existing power structures. It should not be doing that; it belongs to the nation, not to a prevailing power structure. That is the point. It reflects what we value and honour as a nation, and therefore it ought to be separated from power structures.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.5/2">Of course we should be able to reward achievement, but we should be able to do so at the upper echelons to show that we truly value those people who, in the words of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase>, go that extra mile. I would like the system to be extended in that way, but that would be enormously difficult to do, and I fear that my plea will go unheeded, because people who have reached the top of their profession expect an honouring in that sort of way. They will find it difficult to accept that people lower down the power structure should be honoured for their extra effort. However, I strongly believe that the system should be extended, because it reflects something important about our nation: the fact that it is one nation, and that we are all citizens, equal in each other's eyes, and should reward those of us who go that extra mile.</p>

	<p pid="a.347.0/1">It has been a great pleasure to listen to the debate, Mr. O'Hara. On purpose, I did not seek to catch your eye earlier because I wanted to hear the points made by those who were described quietly as &quot;the usual suspects&quot; just before the debate began. I cannot say to whom those words referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.347.0/2">For the most part, the report is good. However, one or two points are fundamentally bad and detract from its overall value, and I intend to refer to those. From where did the Committee get its information? It is an honour to be asked to give evidence to a Select Committee, and none of those who gave evidence&mdash;including my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>&mdash;could be described as normal. So where did the information come from?</p>
	<p pid="a.347.0/3">I recognise that there was lots of written evidence as well, and I do not know all those who gave it, but the list on page 68 is made up almost entirely of the great and the good. I accept that a fair sprinkling of politicians are perhaps not quite as great or good as the rest of the great and the good who gave evidence. However, it is hardly surprising that the Committee came to the conclusion that politicians&mdash;even the Prime Minister&mdash;are not the right people to hand out honours, but that the great and the good are. As I said in an intervention, the Prime Minister can be sacked&mdash;by Labour Members at the moment, or by the public later.</p>
	<p pid="a.347.0/4">One thing that worries me is the conservative&mdash;with a small &quot;c&quot;, obviously&mdash;nature of the great and the good in this country. As I said, I think it highly unlikely that in 1966 or 1967, or whenever it was, the great and the good would have risked giving the MBE to the Beatles. However, Harold Wilson did that. He described it as sprinkling a bit of stardust. Perhaps that was foolish, but it was not the only foolish form of words he chose to use in his time. He said, &quot;These people have achieved something and we believe that it should be recognised, not through money, but through the formal recognition of the state.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.347.0/5">The award did more than add stardust to the list; it naturalised&mdash;that is the best word I can think of&mdash;the youth subculture of the 1960s and brought it into the wider culture of the state and the establishment. The knighthoods given to Tom Jones and Mick Jagger&mdash;belatedly, I admit&mdash;did the same. They brought them into the imperium, if you like. Those knights were no longer rebels against the establishment, but part of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.347.0/6">I say in particular to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> that one of the great virtues of the British honours system is that those who would be rebels can usually be brought in. That is why there has not been a successful revolution in this country since 1688. It is greatly to our benefit and good fortune as a nation that our systems evolve rather than being thrown up in the air, with a great deal of bloodshed, to land who knows where.</p>

	<p pid="a.349.2/1">The road to hell is paved with good intentions. I am sure that the Committee's intentions are perfect, but no committee in the world will not eventually be taken over by the great and the good, at whatever level. The great thing about the Prime Minister and politicians taking responsibility for these things is that they can be sacked. Sooner or later, the public usually sack them.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.2/2">I shall move on from the composition of the list of witnesses. The excursion that I would most describe as a waste of time that rather devalued the report relates to the Order of the British Empire. The excursion was silly and it devalued the argument. Of course, some people object to the British empire, which was, on balance, a huge force for good in the world. However, people also object to saints and organised religion&mdash;some might even object to garters. I do not understand why the Committee feels there is a need to change the name of an order, when its function is to remain substantially the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.2/3">I understand why people jib a little at the Order of St. Michael and St. George, but it has changed significantly over time from having its previous function to having its current status as an award for foreign affairs. The Order of the Bath has changed significantly over time. We have a range of different orders and they have different histories. I am sure some will fall into disuse, as the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India and the Imperial Order of the Crown of India did in the previous century.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.2/4">Others orders appear to be dormant and are resurrected. In the most recent case, Sir John Major resurrected the baronetcy, which we all thought extinct but which had merely gone into dormancy. For the benefit of Labour Members, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, although he is no longer in his place, a baronetcy does not entitle one to a seat in the House of Lords. The suggestion that merely by changing the name of an order we are doing anything other than tinkering at the edges is silly.</p>

	<p pid="a.350.4/1">I am sure I could devise a more minimal change than changing one word in the order's title.

The so-called great and good&mdash;or independents&mdash;often have their own agenda and are accountable to no one. I am not encouraged by the so-called independents to which one or two of my hon.

	<p pid="a.359.3/1">I agree with the thrust of what my hon. Friend said, but I am not sure that I would have made exactly the same observations.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/2">In general, when upholding the honours system, its fairness, integrity and so on, we must be careful not to demean our place in our community and democratic structure or to devalue the contribution that many of us make.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.3/3">An interesting thought occurred to me when we talked about people being honoured for charitable work. Given the way in which the honours system aspires to reflect positive values in society, most people would say that that is good. The debate about a tangential issue&mdash;party funding&mdash;has referred to political parties becoming charities, so would financial contributions to them provide a democratic and legitimate basis for honouring people under the honours system? All sorts of conundrums could be thrown up and we could have a long debate on that, but my central point is that there is nothing wrong with the involvement of politics in the honours system so long as it is transparent and that the final selection is made by a body of people who are not party political.</p>

	<p pid="a.360.1/1">The point that I was making is that an independent body that is divorced from the political process should determine whether someone should receive an honour. There should be a legitimate political nominating process but the selection process should be independent. Presumably an independent panel would not make such a selection on party political grounds or because of a contribution made to a party political organisation. I do not think we disagree substantially on that, but I may not have made myself clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/2">There is a gap in the report, although under the terms of reference it might not have been thought appropriate to consider it. It was recognised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1842" name="Joan Walley">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Joan Walley)</phrase>, who has now left the Chamber. There is an inability in the present honours system to recognise the contribution made by people who are now dead. The rationale for the honours system is that it is based on community values, and my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase said in the opening speech that honours are important symbols of what is valued in public life. He also said that it was legitimate for a Government to use the honours system to promote certain values in the community. I believe that that, in essence, is what my hon. Friend was saying. Honours may reflect the values of society, but they also promote them, because they uphold those who exemplify such values as things to be followed and to inspire others. I believe that a number of people who are now dead should be honoured, because they would fulfil that purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North mentioned R.J. Mitchell, who designed the Spitfire. I too have someone in mind: a person from West Bromwich who exemplifies the sort of qualities that should be recognised publicly and have been recognised by other countries. Hon. Members present might have signed an early-day motion that I tabled approximately one year ago to honour Madeleine Carroll, the film actress. For the benefit of younger Members, including the Minister, I should explain that Madeleine Carroll was a film actress. She was born in 1906, and this year is the 100th anniversary of her birth. She grew up in West Bromwich, the daughter of a French teacher in the local grammar school. She was one of the first female graduates of Birmingham university and was therefore a pioneer in female education. She taught French in local schools, then decided to become a film actress. She starred in the first version of &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; as the lead opposite Robert Donat, in &quot;Secret Agent<i>&quot;,</i> Alfred Hitchcock's follow-up film in 1936, and in many other films. She was Bob Hope's favourite blonde.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/4">In 1941, Madeleine's sister was killed by a bomb in London during the blitz. Thereafter, she devoted her life to working for the Red Cross in field hospitals in France and Italy, and subsequently for the United Nations as a spokesperson, supporter and propagandist on behalf of UNICEF. If anybody wants to read an inspiring speech, I suggest that they read her contribution when, in 1949, she became the first ever female to speak at the international conference of the Rotarians. She spoke about UNICEF and the work that she was doing with children and refugees, many of them severely damaged as a consequence of the war.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/5">Madeleine's contribution was recognised by the French with the l&eacute;gion d'honneur and by the Americans with the medal of freedom. I wrote to the Cabinet Office to ask that she be granted an honour and was told that posthumous awards could not be made. She exemplified the very qualities that we have spoken about today for underpinning the honours system: excellence&mdash;she was a world-class, iconic actress of her day; sacrifice&mdash;she experienced at first hand the horrors in field hospitals during the second world war; and service to others&mdash;she took up a cause that was hugely important but totally unrecognised in the immediate aftermath of the war. Surely the Minister will recognise that such a contribution should be acknowledged and that there should be within the honours system the flexibility to be proactive in singling out people who have made a huge and genuine contribution and who are inspirational figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/6">Unusually for me, I shall refer to Lord Hurd's evidence to the Select Committee. The report stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/7" class="indent">&quot;When honours recognise truly distinguished service or outstanding achievement, they can inspire real enthusiasm, reinforce public pride in achievement, and 'make the country feel good about itself' in the words of the Wilson Review. This is particularly noticeable when honours strike a chord with local or regional loyalties.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/8">This honour would strike a chord with local and regional loyalties, as those qualities that I mentioned are essential to enabling deprived urban communities such as those that I represent to give young people values to uphold, recognise, follow and be inspired by. I ask the Minister, please, to look at that issue. I hope that Madeleine's contribution can be truly recognised and that her role in inspiring young people in areas such as mine will live on in their aspirations.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.0/1">I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> and the Public Administration Committee on the report. During the time that it was being put together, I was successful, after three attempts, in securing a debate on the honours system in January 2004. When I first applied before the Christmas recess in 2003, I was told by the Table Office that questions on the honours system were answered by the Prime Minister and, because my right hon. Friend does not respond to Adjournment debates, that it was not possible to have such a debate. Thankfully, that difficulty was overcome, and I am delighted that we have a fully competent Minister here today who can respond to this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/2">I share the anxiety about an apparent lack of clarity and openness in the honours system, and, like many other Members of the House and the wider public, I have some concern about those living in our communities who richly deserve the wider recognition that the honours system could bring, but who have never been honoured.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/3">I pointed out in my previous debate that in December 2003 <i>The Sunday Times</i> ran an article on a secret document leaked by a Whitehall whistleblower. Apparently, the minutes of the main honours committee revealed</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/4" class="indent">&quot;the government's obsession with spin and rewarding Labour sympathisers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/5">I asked at the time, and I believe that <i>The Sunday Times</i> should also have asked, whether the system had ever been different under successive Governments.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> mentioned 1966, or 1967, and the fact that an award was given to the Beatles. I wish to remind hon. Members that awards for purely party political services were discontinued in 1966, but the policy was reversed in the premierships of Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher, and Sir John Major continued the policy of awarding political honours.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/7">It would be wrong for me to say that no attempts have been made to address the problems in the system. My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase went as far back as Lloyd George, and this afternoon we heard all the sorry tales about the honours system. History is marked with such situations. If anything has remained the same, it must surely be the anxiety and uncertainty about the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/8">The 2001 review by Sir Richard Wilson considered how the nomination system had developed during the 1990s. A dedicated nominations unit was established and a standard nomination form produced. Perhaps one issue on which Sir John Major and I will agree is that the system needs to involve more ordinary members of the public, which would thereby</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/9" class="indent">&quot;help increase the recognition of merit of all kinds.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/10">In fact, if there is a common theme on which the majority of people would agree, it must surely be the need to bring the honours system far closer to the people.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.0/11">In recent years, there has been a fairly significant shift in the percentage of awards to those who dedicate so much time to voluntary work. In the 1994 birthday honours, only one in three awards was given for voluntary service. Thankfully, the figure rose to much nearer the 50 per cent. mark during the next 10 to 12 years, but, if I am absolutely honest, I would much prefer it to increase even more. I would like awards to those dedicated, local people who work in their communities to move closer to the 75 or 80 per cent. mark. If we were honest about having a reputable honours system in this country, that would happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.363.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend, at least partially. I am sure that we can all recount tales of those working in our communities, whether they work with carers organisations or young children, or whether they are from wealthy or deprived backgrounds, or are disabled. People might have put in many long hours of work for 20, 30 or 40 years, bringing smiles to people's faces and providing community facilities that otherwise would not exist. We have heard such examples this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> raised the important point that no one seems to know what happens once an application or nomination is made. It seems to go into some sort of black hole, and sometimes it comes out in a positive manner. If it is refused, no one ever knows why, and that has to stop. People need to know where a nomination is in the current system.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/3">The report brought up a number of points. I notice that my predecessor&mdash;Lord Monro of Langholm, formerly Sir Hector Monro&mdash;felt that the role of the lord lieutenant should be more significant:</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Much more weight in the CBE-OBE-MBE area should go to the recommendation of the Lord Lieutenant.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/5">He went on to say that he</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/6" class="indent">&quot;had 34 years of experience as an MP and had an excellent relationship with successive Lords Lieutenant. The frustration at the few awards accepted by the Scottish Office was obvious. The Lords Lieutenant know more about local affairs than Civil Servants.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/7">I do not disagree that lords lieutenant know more about local affairs than civil servants, but none of us knows absolutely everything about our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/8">I hesitate to add support to my predecessor's recommendation; in fact, I voice my objections to what he says. I have spent 20 years&mdash;11 as a councillor and nine as a Member of Parliament&mdash;working in local communities. I know a lot of people. I have had good working relationships with lords lieutenant, but I am not convinced that we should put more emphasis on their views in the selection of people who receive awards through the honours system.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/9">Much was made of Benjamin Zephaniah's refusal of the OBE in 2003, which was mentioned this afternoon. It became clear that refusals are not uncommon. I mentioned earlier that an average of 2 per cent. of nominations are refused on a fairly regular basis. It has become clear that the process of selection for successful nominations needs much greater local involvement. I am keen to see local panels established to assist in the process, perhaps moving thereafter to a committee of senior standing&mdash;to use a loose term.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/10">Many relevant points have been made this afternoon about our honours system, the second Chamber in the Palace of Westminster and how we should fund political parties in the future. Some people will say that those are three separate issues, but others will say that all are intertwined. I believe that they are, but in 2006, we need to move towards resolving each of the three issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/11">As I did in 2004, I want to make it clear that my congratulations go to all the recipients of honours over all these years. I know that some people are in the system for far longer than others. Some of our sportsmen and women and celebrities&mdash;whether they are in the field of art, film, television or whatever&mdash;seem to be able to jump through the system far quicker. I have no regrets about that, and I congratulate everyone who has received an honour. However, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> talked about six principles. He and I might disagree on those&mdash;I might have six different principles&mdash;but they come down to two things: openness and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/12">I close by again congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase on this report. I am slightly disappointed that the Government have not responded more favourably. I agree with Sir John Major about the need to dispense with the &quot;British empire&quot; element, and I am wholly behind the idea of an Order of British Excellence. We live in a modern society; we should be treating and rewarding people in a modern way.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.1/13">References have been made to the British empire. It has a history, of which we in this country can be proud, but it has also had some dark days, which bring offence not only to those in far-flung places, but to some of us in the UK. We need to move towards British excellence rather than British empire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-27a.366.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="366"  time="016:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060427/halltext/60427h01.htm#60427h01_spnew120">
	<p pid="a.366.1/1">No. For example, the lord lieutenant for Greater London is Lord Imbert, the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner. He is a relatively unusual lord lieutenant in terms of background and pedigree, and is well respected throughout Greater London. By and large the lords lieutenant are not necessarily the people who would be most capable of knowing what was going on and who were the right people to be involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/2">I support the idea of an honours commission to which people can make nominations, including political parties and the rest. We can discuss how it will be formulated. I agree that it should not be a quango, so that we end up with all sorts of people who are already eminent.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/3">There is a truth in what the late Anthony Sampson said both in his original &quot;Anatomy of Britain&quot; and in his last book, written just before he died. If one looks for where the power lies in Britain, one discovers it in a small number of places with a small number of people, disproportionately concentrated on London and the south-east and among those who know the others who have power and influence. We have an opportunity to break out of that circle and to honour the people in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">The hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase> is right. Honours are more valuable and important in local and regional communities for people who are respected from the bottom up, rather than those who are spotted as valuable from the top down. Such credit is given, on occasion. Gary Stannett, a guy in my constituency, got an MBE for his youth work integrating disaffected kids who are difficult with really good kids, and making sure that we have a much more effective way of dealing with antisocial behaviour. He is about 30, and has done valuable work. He would never have dreamt for a moment that he would have ended up with an honour for that, but just did that work from the time he left school.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/5">There are some difficult issues about how to get the balance right. I share the view about volunteers who carry out community service, as other hon. Members have mentioned. Some public servants should be honoured for going above and beyond their call of duty. Of course, people should not get an honour just for doing their job, but if they do their job particularly well or excel, that is justification&mdash;whether they are a teacher, a school keeper, a head teacher, a school governor or anybody else. The community beat police officer who had never wanted to be promoted would be another example.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/6">We should not bestow additional honours on those of us who are honoured by getting through the democratic political process. Councillors, Members of Parliament Members of the Scottish Parliament, and so on, are honoured by virtue of their posts. There should not be additional honours for having got there in the first place. Those people have plenty of rewards and I hope that we are clear about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/7">People in the public sector who perform over and above the call of duty should be honoured; so should many in the voluntary sector. Those in the private sector who do more than line their own pockets and make profits, but who contribute as innovative entrepreneurs should of course be honoured. People in the political sector who are not elected should also be honoured. I can think of people who have worked for political causes&mdash;cross-party, no party or party causes&mdash;who deserve to be honoured. They are the sort of people whom we all know, who have never sought elected office but have worked for no reward for political causes, voluntarily flying the flag&mdash;I am not trying to be partisan, but for the Tories, for instance&mdash;for years in an area where their party has been little represented. Many people ought to be rewarded for such contributions to public life and for ensuring that democracy works. They should not be excluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/8">I want to make one other plea. Team awards, such as the Queen's awards for industry, are often not recognised as being of the same merit. The Queen's awards are about the only recognition of that kind. I nominated a local charity, XLP in Southwark, for a Queen's award for the voluntary sector, which it got. XLP was hugely deserving of the award and was pleased. Such an award does not offer a financial benefit, but I hope that we might award corporate awards to sports teams, other teams, the voluntary sector and business, as well as personal awards. There seems to be scope for those.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/9">I have a clear view on the question of OBEs: we ought to make the proposed change. The Order of British Excellence seems a simple and easy way forward, and a comfortable transition. If we could unite around that, that would be helpful. I like the idea of extending the Companion of Honour and getting rid of all the knighthoods. It is a little like the middle ages still to be giving people knighthoods. Let us pause to think for a minute about knights and dames&mdash;it is like a cross between Robin Hood and the pantomime. I am not disparaging people who have those honours, as that was what was available at the time, but we ought to move on and have a more modern system.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/10">I made the point earlier that if somebody who is married is made a knight, their other half gets a handle. That does not work the other way around, which seems bizarre, ridiculous, sexist and old-fashioned. There ought to be more attention to diversity. It is getting better. The commission would need to be diverse, and it should be particularly attentive to diversity. I am talking about diversity in terms not only of gender, ethnicity and religion but of geography. That is important. There has to be an attempt to ensure that the honours system reflects the fantastic diversity of this country and its traditions, as well of all four countries of the United Kingdom and their traditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/11">The last point that the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway made is absolutely true. People nominate people, fill in forms and expend a lot of effort. Sometimes they approach MPs and ask whether we will nominate someone, and we do so. Nothing more is heard. As far as I know, that has not changed. Whichever system we use might say no, but somebody should get a courteous letter telling them that their nomination has been considered and that although the person might be very worthy nothing can be done with the nomination at the moment, as well as advising them to feel free to nominate somebody in future. At the moment, it is a sad end to an effort to recommend other people. Such changes would be worth while.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/12">I thank the Minister for listening. I hope that he will go away and talk to his colleagues and even to the Prime Minister. I hope that he will say, &quot;Prime Minister, as part of your legacy, you are going to do all these things. You are going to reform the House of Lords, reform party political funding and sort out the public services, which would be wonderful. But let's also get the honours system sorted. Be bold, be brave, be radical and we will end up with a good honours system that is robust and fit for the new century.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-27a.368.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" speakername="Oliver Heald" colnum="368"  time="017:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060427/halltext/60427h01.htm#60427h01_spnew121">
	<p pid="a.368.0/1">I congratulate the Committee on its report. We are indebted to it for such a detailed piece of work, but, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> said, it is a shame that it has taken from its publication in July 2004 until now for us to debate it.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/2">Quite a lot has happened since the report was published. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the recent scandal&mdash;or at least public concern&mdash;over cash for peerages. The police are investigating the matter, so it is perhaps not for me to go into the detail. However, what has appeared in the media has alarmed the public, so it is right that we should also consider the issue in the context of Lords reform and reform of party political funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/3">I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> that we should have a second Chamber, upper House or whatever one wants to call it with a substantially elected element. I also agree that there is a role for some appointment, but substantial election would help with the package of issues that we are discussing.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/4">The Conservative taskforce, which my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> is chairing, is looking at a range of constitutional issues, including those three. My remarks will be coloured somewhat by the fact that he might make recommendations that we shall want to consider as seriously as we do those that the Committee has made.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/5">The Committee's report is good on how one might want to improve the procedures, and the Government have gone some way in meeting its points, but the disappointing thing, which received some publicity at the time, is the controversial idea of ending appointments to the Order of the British Empire and phasing out knighthoods and damehoods, and replacing them with an Order of British Excellence. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1795" name="Alan Duncan">the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan)</phrase> was my party's spokesman on the subject at the time. He described the proposal as a lot of trendy nonsense and a recipe for a &quot;bland and boring&quot; system.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/6">It is right to have proper procedures and to get away from political nominations, but to deny our history and to pretend that we are a young country with new ideas and that we have to forge a new constitution, which seems to be the politically correct idea behind the proposals, is a lot of nonsense. We are an ancient country and we have a lot of ancient traditions. People like honours, so why be a party pooper? The Committee has got that wrong&mdash;subject, of course, to what our taskforce says. <i>[Laughter.]</i></p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/7">The Government have done well in their response, saying that the Order of the British Empire continues to play a well-understood and, in terms of numbers, predominant role in the honours system. They point out that 120,000 people have one and say:</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/8" class="indent">&quot;A number of existing members of the Order have said that they would be dismayed if there were serious moves to stop new appointments to the Order now, or in some other way to show that it had no continuing place in the life of the nation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/9">The Government alighted on the common sense of the situation, and I am glad that they decided to opt for continuity and tradition rather than radical upheaval. I also agree with their conclusion on knighthoods, which they are right to say play a</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/10" class="indent">&quot;well-respected, understood and valued part in our national life.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/11">We have had a good debate today, and the point that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> made about people who have made a lengthy contribution to political parties locally was well taken. A lady in my constituency who has worked for the Conservative party her whole life has been awarded an OBE. In terms of encouraging people to participate in politics and make a difference, it is good to set such people up as role models and say, &quot;Here's somebody who has devoted their life to a cause they believe in. They've tried to make a difference and this is something that is good for our nation.&quot; Of course, that applies equally to other parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/12">I do not want us not to honour people in the political field, but I agree with my hon. Friend that the foot soldier who goes the extra mile should be recognised. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I hear a comment, sotto voce, about that also being true in Scotland, and I agree. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> also set out some important principles, and some excellent points have been made from all parts of the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/13">It is right that we should take a more proactive approach to seeking out those who merit an award. There is probably an element of truth in the point about metropolitan elites, so if we can move to a process that finds the people in the region or locality who genuinely deserve to be rewarded, we should. It is fair to say that John Major, who has been mentioned, started that process. He was committed to trying to spread the honours and to encouraging awards for people who had made a notable contribution locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/14">The Prime Minister's announcement in March that he would give up the right to nominate people for honours&mdash;the so-called Prime Minister's list&mdash;is to be welcomed. That is also something that the Committee recommended. We support the Prime Minister's decision, although wonder why he choose that moment&mdash;perhaps it was just convenient for him. Members of the Committee will be aware that other changes have been made. I do not want to go through them all, but the Government have moved somewhat.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/15">What should the principles be? The first principle must be that honours should be based solely on merit. As has been said, they should not simply be a reward for long service. The Government said that, for long service, the question should be whether a person has gone the extra mile and, for achievement, whether they stand head and shoulders above their peers. That is a good way of putting it, and it is also a point that John Major has always made. In his 1992 review, he was keen that merit should be the touchstone. There has been a considerable increase in the honours awarded for voluntary work since then, and the proportion of state servants in the list has fallen from 20 to 15 per cent. over that period. John Major can be proud of having started that process, but there is a lot more to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/16">Secondly, the system must be free from any corruption, or even the appearance that there might be an element of corruption. I hope that we can do more on that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-27a.370.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2010" speakername="Jim Murphy" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Cabinet Office"  colnum="370"  time="017:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060427/halltext/60427h01.htm#60427h01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.370.3/1">I am delighted to have this opportunity to respond to the debate, which has been remarkable in its tone. That is probably down to the way in which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> introduced it; he helped to influence its tone and content. I do not think that it is controversial to say that, at times, it has been more of a conversation than a debate, which is not a bad thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.3/2">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase> without whose perseverance I would not have the honour of responding to today's debate on behalf of the Prime Minister. I think that we all congratulate him on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.3/3">We are short of time in our deliberations this evening, but I, like other hon. Members, want to pay tribute to one outstanding individual in my constituency: the Rev. Ernest Levy, MBE. In the nine years that I have been in Parliament, it has been my proudest moment hearing that he was to be honoured, because I nominated him. The reason why I nominated him&mdash;more than once&mdash;was that he survived seven concentration camps and then dedicated his entire life in Scotland to encouraging reconciliation and promoting dialogue between people of the Jewish, Christian, Muslim and other faiths. He has visited hundreds of schools throughout Scotland, and continues to do so. His case is one of the many fantastic examples of an honour being rightly awarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.3/4">I turn to the issues raised today. If any hon. Member feels that I have not responded to all of the local points that they made, I will happily write to them, if encouraged to do so, with more substantial and specific responses. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> asked about a constituency matter. I confirm that the list submitted to Her Majesty is limited to 1,000 names per annum. That is the established upper limit on names that can be submitted. By custom and practice, Her Majesty takes a personal interest in literally every one of those nominations, so that is considered to be the appropriate number to enable such genuine involvement and engagement from Her Majesty.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.3/5">The hon. Gentleman quite rightly did not mention the name of his constituent, but requested that I should take some interest in the case. This is quite a difficult issue, in that some hon. Members say that we should have more political involvement and some that we should have less. It is therefore difficult for me to promise to fast-track any application, because that would be inappropriate. If the hon. Gentleman wants to identify the individual concerned to me outside of our deliberations, I will certainly ensure that all the relevant processes are followed appropriately. That is the right thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.3/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase>, who is no longer present&mdash;I know that he cannot be with us&mdash;raised a point that was followed up by other hon. Members. He asked whether awards should be for service or achievement. A related issue in which I am most interested and have taken a keen interest is the way in which that affects the gender balance, or imbalance, in our awards system. If awards are given simply for achievement or position in a society in which, despite substantial progress in recent decades, position and power are still disproportionately allocated between men and women&mdash;if we reward simply status and people who have held official positions&mdash;the system will have an in-built bias towards men. However, there has been some important progress in that regard in recent years, as we have increased the emphasis on awarding honours to those who work in public services and the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.3/7">An important point that many have picked up on is the need to award the higher honours to those who work locally but who act as examples nationally. That is the distinction that the Government draw; we are talking about local action from which people can draw national inspiration. For example, 49 teachers were on the new year honours list of 2006. Hon. Members have spoken about head teachers; only one has been made a dame. Some 20 per cent. of honours go to those in the health service and education, and almost 40 per cent. of awards go to those working in local services and the charitable and voluntary sectors.</p>
