<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18a.1.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1.3/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean. The request for this Adjournment debate arose from the visit a number of hon. Members made in January to the United Nations headquarters in New York. I thank the Minister and his officials for arranging that visit and supporting us so effectively. The purpose of the visit was to learn more about the UN and to consider the challenges that it is facing. It was also aimed at increasing our knowledge of the importance of UN reform and how the process of reform is developing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/2">At the outset, it is worth saying that the visit was extremely useful. The group decided on our return to do what we could to raise the profile of UN reform with our fellow MPs; hence today's debate. It is always important for MPs to learn more about the UN, but the timing seemed particularly acute because of the proposals for reform agreed at the world summit in September 2005&mdash;an important year for the UN as it saw its 60th anniversary. Obviously, that gave added impetus to the process of reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/3">In broad terms, the summit agreed that reform should happen across a number of fronts simultaneously. The first tranche covered institutional innovations, such as establishing the Peacebuilding Commission and reforming the Security Council. There was then a second tranche about management and secretariat reform, such as reviewing existing financial and human resource rules, and budgetary review. A third tranche concerned policy co-ordination.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/4">The wide-ranging reform package is intended to make the organisation more fit for purpose for 21st century needs. The role of the UN is a changing one, and has been changing especially in recent years. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, has summarised the changes thus:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/5" class="indent">&quot;In the 16 years since the cold war ended, the Organization has taken on more than twice as many new peacekeeping missions as in the previous 44 years . . . Over half of its . . . civilian staff now serve in the field&mdash;not only in peacekeeping, but also in humanitarian relief, criminal justice, human rights monitoring and capacity-building&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/6">That is the background, but there are other reasons for the need for reform. We look to the UN to prevent conflicts, broker solutions to disputes, lead the fight against world poverty, disease and malnutrition, and tackle environmental issues, especially climate change. There are also concerns about the UN's past failure to respond effectively to crises such as Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur, not to mention the thorny issue of Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/7">In order to respond to these issues and challenges, the Secretary-General put together a high-level panel to consider reform, which published a report in December 2004. The reforms were outlined at the world summit, and they largely followed the report but with some changes. We can conclude that the expectations of the role that the UN can and should play have never been higher. The reform programme is essentially about trying to deliver a UN that can meet current and future expectations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/8">Opinion about whether the reform programme goes far enough is varied, with probably about 191 versions&mdash;one or more for each member state. The Secretary-General has expressed his unhappiness that it has not gone far enough, especially in tackling the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. That is pertinent at present, given the situation with Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/9">In general, there seems to be a degree of agreement that with so many different&mdash;and often competing&mdash;agendas at the UN, it is perhaps surprising that reform has got this far and that it is so wide-ranging. There is even a website that documents the process of UN reform. Our Library has put together an excellent briefing, which I am drawing heavily on in today's debate. I am also relying on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the report put together by my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase> on behalf of the group who attended the UN in July.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/10">Where are we now with the reforms? I hope that the Minister will ultimately answer that question, but I have a few issues to throw out for consideration. First, I want to centre on the tranche of work on institutional innovations. That sounds as though it could be quite a minor task, but it is absolutely huge. It includes putting together the Peacebuilding Commission, the human rights council and the central emergency response fund and tackling Security Council reforms, the mandate review and the General Assembly review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/11">I will turn first to the Peacebuilding Commission, which was created in December 2005, just before our visit. It aims to fill a gap in bringing together relevant actors and resources to advise on and propose integrated strategies for post-conflict peace building and recovery. That is an enormous task. Negotiations are continuing about representation on that, and I would appreciate an update from the Minister. It is fair to say that the group saw the establishment of the commission as an important step forward for the UN. We were a little surprised to find that 18 peacekeeping missions are taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/12">In the many meetings on the topic that we attended, there was complete agreement that security and development needed to go together hand in hand. It was hoped that by co-ordinating post-conflict work more effectively in a country through the Peacebuilding Commission, some of the issues underlying conflict might be addressed, which might reduce the likelihood of conflict erupting again.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/13">It is worth looking at Sierra Leone as an example of a country where the UN is due to leave in the near future and where the Peacebuilding Commission may have a role. We discovered when we were at the UN that there was some uncertainty about what the UN's leaving would mean for Sierra Leone. The ambassador was unsure not only of the possible consequences, but of the time scale. A ministerial update would be helpful, in particular a comment about how the Peacebuilding Commission could help.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/14">Most importantly, the Peacebuilding Commission is seen as a vehicle for reconstruction post-conflict, to co-ordinate the multiplicity of institutions that can become involved in reconstruction. It would be interesting to know whether other agencies, including non-governmental organisations, are willing to co-operate with the Peacebuilding Commission's activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/15">I move on to the human rights council. When we visited New York, one of the issues that was causing greatest concern was the establishment&mdash;or rather, the lack of it, at that stage&mdash;of the human rights council to replace the largely discredited UN Commission on Human Rights. The issue was raised by a number of countries, and it was clearly divisive. The establishment of the council was eventually agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March 2006</phrase>. The new council will be smaller than the commission, with improved status as a subsidiary of the General Assembly rather than the Economic and Social Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.3/16">The human rights council's membership is still being debated. Notably, the United States opposed its formation because members will be elected by simple majority rather than the two thirds favoured by America. Elections are scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase>. America argued for the two-thirds majority because a simple majority vote for membership would enable rogue states to become members, and the presence of rogue states in the membership of the commission had been responsible for eroding its credibility. Despite that view, some changes have been made, however, and members that commit gross or systematic human rights violations can now be suspended by a two-thirds vote, although we shall have to see whether that happens. However, there is probably some relief that the US is still on board to the extent that it is applying for membership and giving financial support. I am sure that the Minister's comments on how he sees the human rights council developing will be interesting.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18a.3.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.3.1/1">I absolutely agree and I shall come to some of those points when I discuss the appointment of the new Secretary-General.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/2">The idea for the central emergency response fund was very much pushed by the United Kingdom Government. Incidentally, the group got the impression at the UN that the UK Government were very highly regarded because of their efforts to push forward not only the central emergency response fund, but the reform agenda more generally. The aim of the fund is to improve the UN's ability to respond rapidly to humanitarian crises by ensuring that critical funding is available immediately, and I am sure that all hon. Members would welcome that. The fund was officially launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March</phrase>, and the Secretary of State was much involved. The fund can receive donations from corporations and individuals, as well as Governments, although the UK Government are currently the largest donor.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/3">As we saw during our visit, the issue of the new human rights council led to heated debate, but that pales into insignificance beside the debates and competing views about Security Council reform. Indeed, so many different views were expressed that I hardly know where to start summarising them. None the less, I shall try, and the Minister and others can add to, correct or amend what I say, as necessary. There seemed to be little consensus about the number of new permanent members and who they should be, whether new permanent members should have a veto, whether current permanent members should maintain their veto, what the number of permanent members should be, whether there should be new non-permanent members, and if so, how many. The list went on and on; there was very much a lack of consensus, with many competing and contested views. Currently, about six different draft resolutions for increasing the number of permanent and non-permanent members are on the table for discussion, and we shall have to see how the international debate on them plays out. Again, the Minister may be able to give us an update.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.1/4">One positive point to arise from reform of the Security Council is the extension of the mandate to include a responsibility to protect. Establishing such a responsibility addresses the anti-genocide clause in the world summit report of September 2005 and recognises the need for the international community to act if states fail to protect their populations from war crimes, mass abuse of human rights, genocide and other crimes against humanity, such as ethnic cleansing. It is also intended to respond to some of the UN's previous perceived failures in handling crises in Bosnia and Rwanda. Again, it is very much to be welcomed.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way, because the Minister has raised perhaps one of the key points about the issue of UN reform. Our group discussed the responsibility to protect, which features in our report, but the whole matter was encapsulated in our discussions with the Kenyan permanent representative to the UN. Leading him on, I asked, &quot;Should we have intervened sooner in Darfur?&quot; and he said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I asked, &quot;Should we be intervening in the possible dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea?&quot;, and he said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I then asked, &quot;Should we have intervened earlier in the Zimbabwe situation?&quot;, and I got a great deal of waffle. In the middle of it, however, was the word &quot;solidarity&quot;, and that is the problem with the UN organisation: there are too many vested interests, so it is difficult to achieve agreement between 191 nations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18a.5.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="5"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.5.4/1">I absolutely agree. Again, the group's view was that the responsibility to protect was an important step forward for the UN. Our collective view was that it will not get us anywhere if is just words; it must be backed by action, and that means taking some tough decisions. Indeed, our view of the whole reform process was that it should enable tough decisions to be taken more quickly and readily.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.4/2">I know that mandate review is boring, but perhaps I can return to it for just a moment. Not only does the UN have too many mandates, but those mandates do not have time scales, and they are continually added to&mdash;or are not removed. In a sense, they clutter the UN agenda. In his preliminary report, the Secretary-General said that the reporting mechanisms were burdensome, that there was too much overlap and an unwieldy and duplicated architecture for implementation, and that there were gaps between mandates and resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.4/3">Straightforward as the task may appear&mdash;it would seem to be a bureaucratic tidying up&mdash;we were again surprised at the suspicion that the process engendered in some member states. I understand that some progress is now being made, but we were genuinely shocked at how even that fairly bureaucratic process was being contested.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.4/4">The second main problem is with the overhaul, oversight and audit arrangements. Almost every element of that aspect of reform produced suspicion in some quarters. For instance, we might think that forming an ethics office would be fairly straightforward. We would be wrong. It was as much bound up in conspiracy theory as major reforms, such as that of the Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.4/5">Nevertheless, and despite the tensions, an ethics office has been established and a whistle-blower policy has been agreed, as have policies on preventing fraud and corruption and so on. There will also be a review of existing financial and human resources, although as a recent review in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> by Francis Harris demonstrated, there is still some way to go. Staff reacted angrily to Kofi Annan's proposals to overhaul the secretariat, and an update on that from the Minister would be useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.4/6">The last main area is policy co-ordination. In February, the Secretary-General put together a high-level panel to tackle the problem, so it was very much the topic of conversation while we were there. It will lay the groundwork for a fundamental restructuring of UN operational work. The panel is expected to complete its work in the summer&mdash;it is good to have such a short time scale&mdash;and its recommendations will go before the General Assembly in September. It is a 15 member panel, and the UK is ably represented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.4/7">I turn briefly to development. Undoubtedly a great deal of reform was geared towards delivering on the millennium development goals. However, getting development agencies such as UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the UNDP to work together more closely seemed to be fraught with difficulty. Again, I hope that the Minister can update us on that. We were pleased to see so much emphasis being placed on delivering on the millennium development goals. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase>, who was with the delegation, pushed strongly on climate change, and I am sure that he will want to say something about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.5.4/8">An important challenge will be the appointment of the new Secretary-General. The dilemma facing the UN in that respect were excellently summarised in a recent article in the <i>Financial Times</i> by Lord Hannay of Chiswick, who stressed the need for transparency, the need to get the best person for the job regardless of region and the need for that person to have a policy platform. One innovative idea was that the Secretary-General should serve one seven-year term rather than two terms, so that he did not have to pander to the needs of particular sections or blocs to get re-elected. Some of those ideas are worth discussing.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He adds further evidence to my point. I think that the commission's headquarters may be in Beirut, rather than Damascus, but his point is absolutely right none the less. There is a sense that such organisations exist just to give jobs to senior UN diplomats, or to reward certain countries which believe that it is their turn, or right, to have an important international post. It is right and proper that there should be international parliamentary scrutiny of such organisations, so that we can get rid of them if they are not justified. If they are justified, let us see what they are doing and make use of their reports, but if they are not worth the considerable sums that go into their budgets, they should properly be got rid of.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.2/2">The UN gets a bad press from time to time because of issues of malfeasance and financial irregularity, on which it is right that there should be a spotlight. I understand that the financial reporting limit for gifts to UN staff members is $10,000, which seems extraordinarily high. Certainly, for this country and many others around the world, that is a considerable sum. The UN should focus on small points such as that to clean up its act and make sure that it is properly immune from charges of acting in an irregular manner. I hope that the current review will look into that.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.0/1">My hon. Friend is more than generous, as always, and credits me with having read a book that I am ashamed to confess that I have not yet read. It will have to be summer reading, as it has obviously escaped my Easter reading pile. Hopefully, there will be time to make up for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/2">My hon. Friend again makes an important and serious point. What happened in Rwanda is a scar on the conscience of the whole world, and is something that we must never allow to happen again. I know that the horror of what happened there motivates my hon. Friend and many others in keeping a beady and watchful eye on what is happening in Darfur. Indeed, I am interested to know whether he thinks that the UN has all the necessary troops on the ground in Darfur to ensure that things run there. He indicates that he does not think that it has, which, perhaps, makes my point. I am. Of course, aware that there are political considerations: the UN might be able or want to put more troops in, but might be prevented by the political situation on the ground or arguments within the African Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/3">The second main purpose or pillar of the UN is human rights. That was achieved only by the considerable efforts of a very doughty lady&mdash;Eleanor Roosevelt&mdash;in the late 1940s and 1950s. She fought passionately to ensure that the promotion and safeguarding of human rights across the world was a fundamental and principal part of the UN's remit. It is surprising that the money spent on human rights has only just gone past 1 per cent. of the UN's total budget. Last year's summit brought about the responsibility to protect, which is a step forward in philosophical and political terms. It puts an obligation on Governments across the world to prevent genocide and to look after their own people rather than abuse them. The question is how to enforce it on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/4">One of the most disappointing meetings that we had in New York was with a senior official of Mrs. Arbour, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. When we pressed him about how the responsibility to protect would be enforced on the ground the response was vague. I, like most Members present, did not come away from that meeting with any confidence that there were real teeth to this measure, that it could be enforced and would mean something, and that there were mechanisms in place. We were unsure whether a ratchet effect would occur if a Government ignored the responsibility to protect. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>, who accompanied us on the trip, put his finger on that in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">his intervention on the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase>. There was talk about a sense of solidarity, particularly among some African countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/5">It is high time that we started to name and shame some of the countries in the United Nations who are voting against resolutions on human rights issues. The European Union has done good work trying to raise several such issues at the United Nations; it has recently done so on Iran, Burma, North Korea and Uzbekistan. The United Kingdom played an important part in getting the issue of the house clearances in Zimbabwe raised at the United Nations not so long ago. All credit to the Government and to our staff in New York for bringing that about. I understand that nine countries voted for in respect of that in the Security Council. None the less, five&mdash; Russia, China, Algeria, Benin and Tanzania&mdash;voted against. In addition, Brazil abstained, even though it would like to be a permanent member of the Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/6">It is high time that the actions of countries in the United Nations such as those are well known and well publicised. Every time a delegation of parliamentarians, sports people or business people from those countries comes to this country it should be asked why its Government have voted against protecting the human rights of some of the most downtrodden peoples in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/7">Things can change, albeit slowly. Governments are not immune from pressure from their own people. We must get the facts more out in the open. They need to be much better known, so that we can bring pressure to bear on such Governments. It is high time that that was done. I hope that our Government can do their part to publicise how some countries are acting in the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/8">The third pillar of the United Nations is humanitarian development. The start of the charter of the United Nations talks about its purposes and puts this in rather roundabout terms. It talks about &quot;international problems&quot; whose nature is</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/9" class="indent">&quot;economic, social, cultural or humanitarian&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/10">International development rightly falls within that phrase. The United Nations properly devotes a considerable amount of its resources&mdash;for example, its personnel and management time&mdash;to development work.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/11">It seemed to us all that there is a proliferation of UN organisations. It is not necessary to have a massive cull of them, because there are small or specialist organisations that it is right to keep. One such example would be the World Health Organisation. Such organisations are internationally respected and do an extremely good job. However, the case for some form of rationalisation and for some form of proper reporting structure at least is clearly overwhelming.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/12">There are currently 12 different UN agencies working in Tanzania&mdash;to name but one country&mdash;all of which have different reporting lines and so on. If one talks to UN staff at headquarters in New York about the development work that they are doing, one finds that they sometimes despair about the separate fiefdoms that the UN maintains. One former UN Secretary-General referred to the heads of the main UN agencies as being barons in respect of the power that they exercised over their organisations. There is no doubt that the UN's work would be better focused if there were better co-ordination and clearer reporting lines. Less developed countries should have a clear head of all UN operations within the country accountable to the Government as a whole. I hope that our Government will press for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/13">I shall discuss climate change in relation to the purposes of the UN and the reform programme that is occurring. It should come as no surprise to any of us that climate change does not feature at all in the UN charter, because it was not an issue when the UN was being founded in San Francisco in 1946, shortly after the second world war. The UN is the only organisation in the world with the international scope and moral authority to take all countries to task on the issue. We asked senior UN officials about it when we were there.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/14">The UN, to some extent, has a role in tackling climate change; the recent Montreal meeting was known as the 11th conference of the parties to the UN framework convention on climate change. However, no one would pretend that tackling climate change is a central core purpose. There is a principal thrust to what I want to say. The UN currently has three pillars: international peace and security, human rights, and development. They should be in place, but the case is overwhelming for adding a fourth pillar and making tackling climate change and safeguarding the future of our planet a principal and primary purpose of the UN.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/15">No other organisation will have the moral authority in that area. The G8, and the Kyoto protocol and other international agreements, have some merit in this respect, but the UN has an unparalleled and incredibly privileged position to speak with amazing authority to every country. It can monitor what is going on, rank how countries are performing in this area, encourage the development of technologies, and name and shame countries that are emitting carbon way above limits agreed on on an international basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/16">Among the many UN organisations is the World Meteorological Organisation, which is based in Geneva. I was alerted to its existence by someone who is shortly to move into my constituency. He is something of a climate expert and he suggested that that organisation should be given greater prominence and should take the lead as the key UN body to take us forward on the issue of climate change. I hope that the Minister will give us some comfort that the Government are seized of the importance of this issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18a.15.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1965" speakername="Michael Moore" colnum="15"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew24">
	<p pid="a.15.1/1">This has been an important and impressive debate. Like o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">thers, I pay tribute to the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> for securing the debate and setting out the issues so comprehensively at the outset. I extend that tribute to those who went on what was clearly a worthwhile visit to the United Nations. I echo the comments made about the value of going to the UN to see for oneself its range of activities and its complexities. I certainly gained enormous benefit from going there myself a few years ago. In common with others, I pay tribute to British diplomats and officials in the UN for the excellent work that they do, day in, day out. The fact that Britain punches above its weight is in large part due to the skills, expertise and approach of our diplomats in important places such as the UN.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/2">I shall pick up on a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> about the prospect of an annual debate on the UN. I have recently returned to the foreign affairs brief, but I recall that just over a year ago the current Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning pledged that there would be such a debate&mdash;and, indeed, for two years we have managed to secure one, albeit usually in Westminster Hall on a Thursday afternoon. Nevertheless, that is important, and I hope that today the Minister will confirm that it is still the practice and the intention of the Government to provide such debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/3">The United Nations matters more than ever because of the uncertain nature of our world; collective security is vital to us all. It also matters because, as contributors have said, there is still the huge issue of the lack of human rights and democracy across the globe; that remains an absolute disgrace. The inequalities of wealth and opportunity in different continents is, to borrow a phrase already used once this morning, &quot;a scar on the conscience&quot; of us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/4">The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire was slightly critical of the prosaic language in the UN charter about the different pillars of the organisation. I refer him back to the preamble, in which the lofty ideals of the representatives in San Francisco are set out in slightly better language, which says,</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/5" class="indent">&quot;to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . and . . . to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/6">Those ideals are still relevant today, across the world. Recent debates about reform of the UN have brought them into even sharper focus.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/7">In a recent speech to the British Council, Mark Malloch Brown&mdash;the new deputy Secretary-General of the organisation&mdash;stressed the centrality of security, development and human rights to the reform programme that is now under way, following the world summit last autumn. He emphasised that reforms had to be underpinned by radical change in the organisation and in the management of the UN itself&mdash;a strong theme in our debate this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/8">The oil-for-food scandal undoubtedly rocked the UN, and it lapped uncomfortably close to the Secretary-General himself. To his immense credit, he has not shied away from facing the weaknesses and rot that were exposed by that scandal and others referred to this morning. He will need strong support from Governments such as ours if he is to carry out the painful processes that he has outlined and now seeks to implement.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/9">It is always pretty easy to set out a list of the failures of the UN, or the differences between its high-blown rhetoric and the often grubby reality. On security, there have been failures in Rwanda, the Balkans, the Congo and now Darfur; on human rights, there is the embarrassment and disgrace of the old commission's having Zimbabwe and Libya as members; on development, there is the horrible reality that we are barely on track to meet the millennium development goals&mdash;the basic targets set in a flurry of good intentions five years ago&mdash;by 2015. Also, as contributors to the debate have stressed, there is a worrying lack of attention to perhaps the most important challenge for all of us: climate change, which we need to tackle with great urgency.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/10">The attempts at reform are well documented. The high-level panel and the world summit last year got that process firmly under way. The world summit was a mixed bag, perhaps reflecting the mixed motives of the participants. However, we should recognise the achievements, not least of which is the fact that a debate was started on intervention for humanitarian purposes&mdash;the so-called &quot;responsibility to protect&quot;. Also, a peace-building commission was set up, and&mdash;not at the time, but subsequently&mdash;there was agreement on the human rights council. Also, a new emergency development fund was created; the UK has led the way in terms of its contributions to it. I pay tribute to the Minister and the Government for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/11">Alongside those strengths of the summit, there was a worrying failure to tackle the issue of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, or to make any mention of disarmament. Even the Secretary-General himself branded that &quot;a real disgrace&quot;. Also, the issue of pre-emptive strikes&mdash;which have undermined the United Nations since the war in Iraq started some three years ago&mdash;was not referred to. Although there was unqualified condemnation of terrorism, there is as yet no working definition of it. Those are serious disappointments, but it is not time to give up. It has been said that we get the United Nations that we deserve. Sometimes there is a risk of our treating the UN as if it were a fully autonomous and independent organisation. The reality, of course, is that the UN is very much a creature of its individual member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/12">The UN is not beyond meaningful reform or irredeemably damaged, as long as there is the political will to sort it out. It is unlikely that we will have a &quot;San Francisco Moment&quot; in which to put it all right, but effective and deep reform is possible if a coalition of democracies, the United States placed centrally among them, perseveres in the development of an effective United Nations. That means that we need a more open approach to the UN from the United States. Its ambassador, John Bolton, has characterised his approach as &quot;muscular diplomacy&quot;, but was recently rebuked by the <i>International Herald Tribune</i>, which said that there has been plenty of illustrations of the muscle, but not many of the diplomacy. We need to rebalance that approach. Britain has an important role in persuading the Americans of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/13">As others said, we need to recognise the realities of the 21st century, and not only the post-war realities of 1945. We need to consider seriously Security Council reform to bring others such as Brazil, Germany, India, Japan and a representative from Africa into the Security Council, if they meet the high standards that we should all expect of them. It is in nobody's interests for the impetus for United Nations reform to fail. The world needs a strong UN to face the complex challenges of the 21st century. However damaged it is, and however marginalised it has been in recent times, no other organisation can compete with it as a source of global legitimacy. At a time of worrying developments in Iran and the middle east, and of catastrophe in Darfur, the world needs a United Nations that works.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18a.17.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="17"  time="010:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew25">
	<p pid="a.17.0/1">It is delightful to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> on securing this debate and on her excellent contribution to it. She is obviously a fast learner; I have no doubt that she will go far in her party.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/2">Much has been said about the importance of UN reform. Excellent speeches have been made not only by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Lady, but by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase>. I congratulate the hon. Lady on her courtesy in cutting short <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1914" name="Mike Hall">her speech so that the hon. Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall)</phrase> could make his contribution, which was particularly about human rights but also ran the gamut of world problems. His contribution was valuable and it would have been a pity to have missed it.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/3">As has been mentioned, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase> led an excellent delegation, which included Members present today, to the United Nations in January. However, we missed the presence of any Liberal Democrat Member; that party would have benefited greatly had it been able to send one.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/4">The members of the delegation learned a huge amount, and the hon. Member for Gedling, aided by contributions from other members, has produced an excellent document that summarises the totality of UN reform as encompassed by the summit, and particularly by the fifth committee and the budget reforms that led right up to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-23">23 December 2005</phrase> and were a great tribute to all the nations that participated. That had to be done by consensus. It is fitting to pay tribute to our permanent ambassador to the United Nations Sir Emyr Jones Parry and Tony Kaye, whom I see here today and did so much organisation during our visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/5">Members have referred to the fact that in 1941 it was Churchill and Roosevelt's vision that led to the founding of the United Nations as we know it today. After the catastrophe of the second world war, that was an important vision. However, the weakness of the League of Nations was one of the contributory factors that led to the second world war, and we have to grasp the nettle of that same spirit of Churchill and Roosevelt in 1941. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire came out with one of the most apt phrases that I have heard in a long time. He said that the UN had the international scope and moral authority to take nations to task, and that was precisely what Churchill and Roosevelt had in mind in 1941.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/6">Unless we take the opportunity to reform the United Nations so that it becomes competent, we shall see more global catastrophes and problems. In my view, the UN failed on Iraq. Diplomacy is always preferable to war. With the <phrase class="date" code="">28 April</phrase> deadline set for Iran, we now have the next low-water mark for the UN. If we fail on that as well, we are heading for deep trouble. Reform is particularly important today, and I hope that the Minister will take that message back to the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister, and that the British Government will use their special relationship with the UN.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/7">The UK Government are now the second largest contributor to the UN; the USA is by far the largest contributor. If the largest and second largest contributors cannot effectively push this reform, particularly given their special relationship, I do not know what will be able to. The Prime Minister has a special relationship with President Bush; we hear that they speak for half an hour every week. Let us hope that some of those conversations can be directed towards achieving some real and positive UN reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/8">Mention has been made of a number of reforms; perhaps the most important is the budgetary reform, to which I referred in my opening remarks. On <phrase class="date" code="">23 December</phrase>, the fifth committee decided that each tranche of the half-yearly budget would be released only if progress on reform was made. During my meeting with him, John Bolton was adamant that the United States would not sanction the next half-year's budget unless progress towards reform was made. I hope that the British Government will support the United States on that, because only through budgetary discipline will reform be forced through. Given that a nation as small as the Tuvalu islands has the same vote on the General Assembly as the United States, it is difficult to get reforms through.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/9">The contribution of the United States is massive at $24.2 billion and it therefore has a right to have a say in how the UN should be reformed. We need to pay great heed to Ambassador Bolton's words. I hope that there will be reform on the budget and the other areas that I am going to talk about.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/10">Budgetary reform is vital and has been highlighted by the oil-for-food programme scandal. During the seven-odd years of that programme's existence it dealt with $64 billion worth of potential aid for food. When we think that Saddam Hussein skimmed off up to $10 billion of that, we see the scale of the scandal. We must never allow that extent of fraud to happen again. Such things require proper safeguards and external audit.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/11">I turn to the issue of Security Council participation. We cannot expect nations to contribute more to the UN unless there is some enlargement of the Security Council. The issue of the G4 group is fearfully controversial; Venezuela does not want Brazil in it, Pakistan does not want India in it and other African countries do not want South Africa in it. It is difficult, but we have to try to make progress on Security Council reform, especially given that Japan is the second largest contributor to the core budget and one of the major aspirants to becoming a member of the Security Council. It is perhaps the most deserving of them all.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/12">Time is limited and I shall skate over much of what I was going to say. The UN needs to concentrate more than anything on two areas: first, the transformation from the Human Rights Commission to a human rights council. We have to make sure that the human rights council is more effective; the commission failed too often in the past. In 2003, it was under the chairmanship of Syria; other nations with poor human rights records such as Zimbabwe, Cuba and Sudan have been members of that three-nation commission. Any nation that fails in implementing at least basic human rights should not be a member of the council, and certainly should not be able to influence its role.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/13">Peace building and whether there should be pre-emptive action has been mentioned. That issue is important and the UN needs to address it. I quote Ambassador Bolton:</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Some member states are attempting to engage in 'mission creep' by redefining the scope of the Peacebuilding Commission and attempting to involve it in pre-conflict situations or long-term development. We do not believe this should fall under the purview of the Peacebuilding Commission, which needs to have a clearly defined and specific mission and mandate in order to maximise its effectiveness.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/15">The issue of whether the United Nations should have a more pre-emptive role is difficult. Currently, there is a potential conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Whether the UN should intervene to stop those nations, among the poorest in the world, going to war is a big question.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/16">I have almost come to the end of my time. We face some difficult world threats. Terrorism is on a scale that we have never known before. If we fail on United Nations reform, the world will suffer&mdash;we will all suffer. Today, one nation's problem can well have consequences for another nation on the other side of the world. Environmental reform has been mentioned; a lady using hair spray in Australia will affect global warming in America. It is no good the Americans standing aside on the environmental issues of the day. We need to bind them in to what is happening in the international community and the world today, not only on the environment but on peacemaking, peace building, conflict resolution, terrorism resolution, human rights and all the other ways in which the UN gives assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/17">I learned the other day that in Uganda between 2001 and 2004, the figure for poverty&mdash;the number of people living on less than $1 a day&mdash;rose from 30 to 40 per cent., yet millions of pounds-worth of aid were poured into Uganda in that time. The world needs to wake up when it comes to how it helps poor countries. It needs to link aid with better government and a move towards democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/18">I conclude with this phrase, which is what the issue is all about. It comes from Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. He says that the reform is a</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/19" class="indent">&quot;once-in-a-generation opportunity for the world to come together and take action on grave global threats that require bold global solutions. It is also a chance to revitalise the United Nations itself. It is in short, an opportunity for all humankind.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/20">If we fail, the world will suffer.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18a.20.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" speakername="Kim Howells" speakeroffice="The Minister for the Middle East"  colnum="20"  time="010:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.20.0/1">I reiterate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the comments of the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> by saying what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean. I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> for initiating the debate and for her comments. I welcome the interest that Members of both Houses take in the United Nations and in the crucial reforms that that organisation faces. What a pleasure it is to follow such fine contributions from the hon. Members for Cotswold, for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) and for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1914" name="Mike Hall">my hon. Friends the Members for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall)</phrase> and for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy).</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/2">The Government are a strong supporter of the United Nations. We have been a staunch ally of the Secretary-General in his reform efforts. We want those efforts to result in a more effective and efficient UN, better able to meet the interlinked challenges of development, security and human rights. My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham drew us a vivid picture when she said that reforming the UN was like trying to turn around a huge tanker with several ships attached to it. As someone who once had a shot, unwisely, at using a ship simulator and managed to sink a 100,000-tonne coal carrier, wreck the navigation pier at Avonmouth, block the Severn navigation channel and cause a major pollution hazard, I know exactly what she means. We need to communicate vividly the importance of reform, and the hon. Member for Cotswold explained its importance very clearly.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/3">We continue to work hard to achieve the objective of reform. I am pleased that several colleagues present at the debate were able to see for themselves, when they visited New York in January, the challenges that the UN faces and the energy that we are devoting to help it to meet those challenges. I agree with the assessment of our team working in New York. Sir Emyr Jones Parry has a superb team and is one of our best diplomats. No doubt hon. Members can play a role in furthering the good work in which they are engaged on the reform agenda. Debates such as this are welcome and important. With regard to the comments of the hon. Members for South-West Bedfordshire and Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, I will take that valid message to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House. The issue is hugely important and I believe that this needs to be a regular debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/4">The reform debate of the past few years culminated in the 2005 UN world summit last September, which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister attended along with 152 other Heads of Government. Some people expressed disappointment at the outcome of the summit, but it was a significant step forward for the UN and delivered an essential package of reforms and commitments by the international community. We have heard about those this morning. We must try to channel that energy and enthusiasm so that our representatives and those of the EU and other progressive forces in the UN can take the reform agenda forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/5">The UK, when it had the presidency of the EU, played a crucial role in the negotiations leading up to the summit. The Government intend to lay before Parliament a Command Paper on the United Nations shortly. That will include our assessment of the progress made on implementing the reforms agreed at the summit and on the outstanding issues to be addressed. Hon. Members might welcome a brief assessment of where things stand on the implementation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/6">The agreements reached in New York on development and climate change&mdash;I was glad to hear hon. Members mention those issues&mdash;reflected several important Gleneagles and EU commitments. Those included the need to accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals, to address the special needs of Africa and to create, as my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham said, a new central emergency relief fund to strengthen the UN's ability to mobilise quickly and effectively resources to tackle humanitarian crises.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/7">The challenge now is to ensure that those commitments are fulfilled. We continue to lead by example, as shown by our recent commitment to spend at least &pound;8.5 billion on aid for education over the next 10 years. I was glad to hear my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire mention the discussions that have been held on the role that the UN should play in seeking to fulfil environmental commitments. At the world summit, there was an agreement to explore the possibility of a more coherent UN institutional framework, including a more integrated structure built on existing institutions and instruments. I was glad to hear the hon. Gentleman point out something that we do not think about enough, which is that no other organisation in the world has the ability to speak to all nations as the UN does. We are pleased with the raised profile that the General Assembly president, Jan Eliasson, has given the issue. I shall consider carefully the interesting examples of possible intervention by the UN that the hon. Gentleman suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/8">We hope to make progress on the EU's goal of transforming the UN Environment Programme into a specialised agency with a revised and strengthened mandate and improved financing. That will enable the UN's environmental pillar to tackle better developing countries' needs, to strengthen the scientific basis of decision making, to focus on emerging priorities such as the environment and security, to improve co-ordination at policy and operational level and to ensure sustained delivery in respect of environmental priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/9">The world summit invited Kofi Annan to launch further work to consider how all the UN operations that we have talked about this morning could be managed more tightly around three pillars: development, humanitarian assistance and the environment. The development, humanitarian and environmental efforts of the UN have become increasingly fragmented, with multiple agencies competing for donor funds, different agencies occupying the same policy space, and overlap and duplication at both headquarters and country level. As many hon. Members pointed out, that is inhibiting the UN from making as significant a contribution as it could make to the achievement of internationally agreed development goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/10">The Secretary-General's panel on system-wide coherence in the areas of humanitarian assistance, the environment and development is therefore crucial. It heartened me to hear many hon. Members mention that. I am proud of the contribution that the UK made to the world summit's success and of the continuing efforts&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18a.23.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" speakername="Ann Winterton" colnum="23"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/halltext/60418h02.htm#60418h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.23.1/1">May I say at the outset of my contribution on the future of the Territorial Army within the Army structure what a pleasure it is to see you in the Chair this morning, Mrs. Dean? I believe that this is the first time that I have served under your chairmanship.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/2">I am delighted to have secured this debate. It could not have come at a more appropriate time, bearing in mind the Minister's statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase> concerning the rebalancing of the TA and, hot on its heels, the National Audit Office report of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase> on reserve forces. I have been following the changing role of the TA for some time, not least because of its position at the base of the pyramid that will form the future Army structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/3">One could describe the TA as the bedrock of the Government's policy. For several years, successive Ministers have clarified what is expected of it. It will play nothing less than a vital role in future operations and will be fully integrated with regular forces in all types of military and, in the case of the TA infantry, civil operations. There is nothing to criticise in that ambitious objective, as long as the limitations of the arrangement are fully and clearly understood.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/4">The words &quot;territorial&quot; and &quot;reserve&quot; hardly seem appropriate these days, as the TA is operating as nothing less than infill. By its very definition, a reserve force is one that is held back from the line of battle to be used to assist where necessary, or that is called up in an emergency. I do not believe that the Government's present objective for the TA falls into either category, as the TA undertakes all the roles of the regulars without being on the permanent payroll.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/5">The key difficulties in the Government's present strategy for UK armed forces personnel are to do with recruitment, retention, integration and, especially, maintaining morale. As the Minister knows, my initial interest in the infantry stemmed from the recent changes to my local regiment, the Cheshires, and from the strategic defence review, which proposed a 55 per cent. cut in infantry TA. We now face a further reduction of 900 personnel&mdash;or, to be accurate, 910. It is not clear whether they are to come from present strength or from establishment. If that further cut is to come from strength&mdash;this is based on figures from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> last year&mdash;the infantry will be the same size as the logistics, have the same establishment as the medical services and be not far ahead of the Royal Engineers. It is fair to say that the backbone of the Army, the infantry, which has the greatest experience of command in the British Army, is in terminal decline.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/6">I did not understand the part of the recent statement that dealt with medical services, and the Minister's replies to questions did not make it any clearer. Have the Government given up trying to get strength up to establishment in that area? What is the meaning of combat medical staff? Surely all medical staff are combatants to some degree or other; if not, what do they do? For the Ministry of Defence not to know the time span between deployments of regular and TA medics to Iraq is just not good enough. I know one medic in the regulars who will shortly be going to Iraq for the third time.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/7">It is also puzzling when the Ministry says that 13,450 personnel are available for deployment as at <phrase class="date" code="">1 June 2006</phrase> from all TA units, yet the Department cannot or refuses to give exact numbers of unit availability. Does the Department genuinely not know the number? If it does not, how did it arrive at the figure of 13,450? It has been stated that the figure excludes those who have exceeded the MOD's limit on mobilised service of a total of 12 months in every 60. However, most deployments in Iraq have been for around 10 months. Technically, with two months of obligatory service yet to be served, those soldiers could be counted as part of the force of 13,450. I also suspect that the personnel who are available are those such as officers and non-commissioned officers, who are not in particularly short supply, rather than privates, who are the soldiers most needed in such deployments and who operate under the most pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/8">What are the recruitment figures for individual TA centres? I suspect that those that have low recruitment have high retention, as recruits are told openly that, after completing basic training, they will be called up within a year for a 10 to 11-month deployment. Why does the Ministry not know the figures for those who have completed basic training? That is a vital piece of information for understanding what is happening on the ground in respect of recruitment and, thereafter, availability for deployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/9">On the basis of information straight from the horse's mouth, I know that infantry privates are not only in great demand but are being put under considerable pressure. That was the subject of a written question that I tabled in January but to which I have not yet received a reply. I remind the Minister that my question asked which main areas of the TA were identified as undermanned and which required increased recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1369" name="Gerald Howarth">My hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth)</phrase> recently mentioned that the present strength of the university Officer Training Corps stands at 5,750 and is 2,250 over establishment. Those personnel are, of course, non-deployable. The OTC is an excellent organisation for students and an extremely successful tool for future recruitment, but should not those figures be kept separate from figures for deployable troops? It seems dishonest to bulk up the overall figures with those who will not be available in an active sense for a considerable time.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/11">From the figures that I have been given in response to written parliamentary questions, it appears that the TA consists of a hard core of as few as 17,000 to 20,000 personnel, which is far short of the establishment figure of 42,000. In 2003&ndash;04, the number of TA bounties paid for classification year 5 was 14,585. The figure was 2,288 for year 3 and only 2,098 for year 1. We need to know the latest figures, as it appears that there is high turnover. I cannot believe that the Ministry does not know how many have left the TA shortly after returning from deployment in Iraq. That is another crucial piece of information that is missing&mdash;at least, it is not in the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/12">I suspect that some of the numbers in respect of the stated TA strength of 31,680, excluding the OTC, are what I call paper figures: the personnel do not exist in reality but are figments of creative number crunching. As the Minister knows, TA centres are under tremendous pressure to keep numbers up at all costs, and some are not efficient in clearing from the statistics those who have fallen by the wayside.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/13">Many TA centres are fearful of being downgraded or closed down completely because of reducing numbers. It is a fact that a small number of units will be disbanded and a handful of underutilised TA centres will be closed. However, it is nothing but a joke to say that displaced personnel will have the chance to transfer to other units. Does anyone really imagine that they will make a round trip of some 50 miles to go to another unit? In that way, TA members' service will end involuntarily for logistical and practical reasons, yet we cannot afford to lose even one person, as numbers are so low at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/14">Many civil servants who were told last June that their TA units would be downgraded and that further information would be given in October still do not know their fate. When will they be informed about their future prospects, and is this not a case of bad man management? Nothing erodes confidence and motivation as quickly as uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/15">Another concern is that the TA is required to contribute to the civil contingency reaction force, which is another creation of the European Union and part of its continuing regionalisation policy. If there were a long-term crisis in the future, the requirement of 12 out of 60 months service for TA personnel would soon be used up for the simple reason that most would have already served between 10 and 11 months. Surely, therefore, more people would be excluded from long-term CCRF service. I find it extraordinary that the Department cannot respond to the query concerning how many personnel from each TA infantry regiment are signed up for CCRF duties. Does the Department know the answer or does it not?</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/16">That brings me to the terms of service: a legal requirement of one year in three, possibly extended to five, which translates into a six-month deployment. That can be compared favourably with the USA equivalent of a 12-month deployment in three years. It is true that the United States is running into difficulties with recruitment, retention and morale in the national guard. How can anyone have a successful civilian career when they may be required to disappear for such long stints, especially those in the specialised professions, whose expertise and career advancement may be adversely affected?</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/17">I know that the Minister appreciates the contribution of employers, especially those in smaller businesses. The work undertaken by SaBRE&mdash;Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers&mdash;is excellent, as are the holiday training packages offered to TA personnel after deployment. As the Minister knows, that requires a great sacrifice of both time and finance for those left at home holding the fort.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/18">Let us not forget that those in the TA are, first and foremost, civilians, and although it may be true, as the Minister has stated on more than one occasion, that the TA cannot be distinguished from regulars on active duty, it has to be recognised that its members are in a totally different category without many of the services or the back-up available to members of the regular forces. I understand fully that the Government are trying to create a smaller, high-tech, medium-weight Army, backed up by a highly professional and well trained part-time force, but the integration process is nevertheless fraught with difficulties. Integration between territorial and regular forces is working well in the run-up to Operation Telic 8 because a well established system has developed, not least because the situation in Iraq has gone on for so long. It would be a different story should a war-fighting mission develop, and the difference in capability and experience would then become obvious.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/19">I note the Minister's statement that recruitment has been changed to incorporate regulars and TA, although I doubt that the present financial commitment to recruitment can be maintained. That is the subject of another written question that has remained unanswered since January, when I asked the Secretary of State for Defence</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/20" class="indent">&quot;what spending has been allocated to Territorial Army recruitment for</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/21" class="indent">a) the last three quarters of 2005,</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/22" class="indent">b) the first quarter of 2006 and</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/23" class="indent">c) 2006&ndash;07?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/24">I also feel that the TA does better when undertaking its own recruitment. I welcome the commitment to allow TA volunteers to undergo short deployments that will give them tremendous experience when working with the regulars, but care must be taken not to produce a small mercenary force.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/25">We must ensure that the new infantry TA battalions linked directly to their equivalent regular regiments work well in the integration process, but we must fully involve the local communities upon which they rely for recruitment. Sometimes those developments, which are part of the plan for the future Army structure, overlook the small details that create good morale and good working relationships. If recruitment can be maintained only by a massive level of funding and it falls when the foot is taken off the accelerator, we have to ask what is wrong with the conditions of service&mdash;the cause of the recruitment and retention problem. We know that there is a manning crisis because units go into deployment undermanned. Are falling numbers a direct result of long deployments? If the TA is continually expected to fill the gap, we should ask why people are not attracted to recruitment into the regulars. The differentials between pay and conditions play a part in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/26">The TA is no longer seen as the reserve force to be called up in an emergency, but as a continual front-line force instead. However, whatever civilian skills the TA can bring to the Army, it is not the equivalent of the regulars. Its officers do not have the same in-depth training and experience, and it is a tragedy that so many Sandhurst TA places remain unfilled each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/27">Although the TA does an excellent job, it should never be expected to be equal to the regulars. Instead, it should be considered a very capable back-up, trained to the highest degree, bearing in mind the limitations in the hours of service volunteered. When the TA is on deployment, including on second or further deployments, those involved are paid their equivalent civilian wage or salary, which is often far in excess of that of equivalent ranks in the regular forces. It has been drawn to my attention that some TA personnel working alongside regulars have bragged about the differentials in pay rates and remuneration. It has even been alleged that they have rigged their civilian wages in order to get higher pay and a recent example of this happening in Belize was pointed out to me. I am sure that that situation could be checked out through cross-referencing with the Inland Revenue, but the point is that care should be taken when dealing with soldiers on two different pay scales&mdash;without which, I hasten to add, there would be no volunteers or recruits. The regulars should be informed about the pay procedures of the TA, and those in the TA should be briefed not to damage morale on deployment by flaunting superior pay rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/28">The continuing problem of overstretch has been raised many times in debates and it is one of the reasons why the TA is in such demand. Understandably, regulars like to be deployed where there are varied tasks, which is one of the reasons why they signed up in the first place. I suspect that some of the more boring operational requirements are down to NATO and European Union commitments. I understand that the Gurkhas, who were recently in Bosnia, were deployed to check on illegal logging and undertook patrols without arms, which seems to me to be quite extraordinary for an infantry regiment. At present, the TA in some regiments is being deployed to a far greater extent than its regular cousins, which is another factor that can cause friction and which needs to be monitored.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/29">I cannot stress enough the importance of good morale to the retention of our armed services personnel, who are undoubtedly respected and admired by the British people. With numbers in the regular forces shrinking, the TA is carrying out a greater variety of roles today, although numbers available for deployment are decreasing, as the Minister knows. With so much change taking place, the impetus is to consider the big picture, but it is important not to overlook the small details that, if forgotten, can quickly damage morale.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/30">There are many serving in the Army today who feel resentful because their cap badges have been taken away&mdash;although obviously not from those in the Scottish regiments&mdash;and they have been forced into different regiments or re-roled into different functions. Will the Minister respond today to the written question I tabled in November 2004 about the progress of the re-roleing of the three regular infantry regiments that were being disbanded? The same situation is now occurring in the TA infantry.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/31">One of the purposes of this debate is to emphasise that armed services personnel are people who, in this day and age, are not compelled to do what they do on behalf of us all. They should not just be pushed around. They need to have a strong inner conviction to be able to serve and they need to know what this country stands for and what it expects of them. We are immensely proud of their achievements but it has to be recognised that when an army is downsized, it is difficult to manage that downward spiral and it is essential that morale is maintained, often by attending to the small details that can make such a difference. We must listen to those who serve at the base of the military pyramid, and I hope that the debate will highlight some of the issues that most concern them.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/32">We live in times of great political and military change, do we not? The Government are walking a tightrope with a huge future financial and technical commitment to the field of defence. The whole package has to be delivered if it is to be successful. As financial constraints kick in, as they surely will, the choice will be between cutting the number of personnel, obtaining new, up-to-date and expensive equipment, or pushing back further the dates of implementation. Quite honestly, it is a frightening scenario for the Government who will be in office between 2010 and 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/33">Although no one will admit it, I believe that the UK is heading quietly and stealthily towards participation in a fully integrated European Union force. The Minister will, however, be relieved to learn that that is not a subject to pursue this morning, although I intend to return to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/34">I shall listen with great interest to the Minister's contribution and to others who catch your eye, Mrs Dean. I am grateful to the Minister for listening so carefully to what I have had to say.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18a.28.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" speakername="Michael Penning" colnum="28"  time="011:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/halltext/60418h02.htm#60418h02_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.28.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase> on securing this debate. Having served with the infantry in the Guards and, during the latter part of my military career, in the Royal Army Medical Corps, I wish to discuss the two key areas highlighted by my hon. Friend as being severely overstretched.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/2">The integration of the Territorial Army with the regular forces has changed beyond belief in the past 20 years. In the 1970s when I served with the infantry in the Guards, the TA was, to be frank, a laughing stock among the regular forces. The two never worked together or integrated; and they rarely trained together, apart from an annual two-week exercise in Germany&mdash;and we usually ran out of fuel, bullets and everything else, because we were so badly funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/3">I congratulate the Government, because in the past 10 years, the integration and training of the TA have worked fantastically. Thank goodness they have. The armed forces are now so small that without the TA&mdash;which comprises civilians who, as my hon. Friend said, work with the armed forces&mdash;how would the infantry and the Royal Army Medical Corps cope when serving this country so brilliantly throughout the world?</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/4">I have two concerns about the way in which the Government propose to deal with the cuts in the TA, and they are cuts; there is no argument about what is happening. We can put as much spin on it as we like, but they are cuts, especially to the infantry and to the medical corps.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/5">First, I fear that we shall use and abuse the TA even more. I have raised that issue many times with the Secretary of State and the Minister on the Floor of the House. There is no shortage of volunteers, but each time they are the same volunteers&mdash;guys and girls&mdash;who are keen to serve their country and gain experience. They are not the people who are leaving in their droves. In my constituency, TA recruitment is suffering. One reason is that TA centres locally have been closed and there is a huge distance to travel between centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/6">Another reason is the pressure on married serving TA members as well as regulars. People want to be with their families, and such people tend to have the experience in that they have served in the armed forces and now serve with the TA. They want to serve and to be deployed but they do not want to go back time and again. The people who tend to volunteer time and again are single and without the experience and training that are desperately needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/7">By deploying so often, there is a massive problem with training. One reason why there are so many problems with the bounty is that people can be deployed with the TA to Iraq, but when they return, they are not guaranteed the bounty, because they have not done the training. At first, I thought that that was wrong, but the jobs that TA members undertake on deployment do not form part of the training needed for deployment elsewhere. TA members undertake not only long deployments, but further training on their return. That puts even more pressure on their relationships, job prospects and careers. That is why so many people are leaving.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/8">I am not surprised that the Government have not answered the questions tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton, because I think that they are embarrassed about the problems with recruitment and retention levels in the armed forces as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/9">For my sins, I am taking part in the armed forces parliamentary scheme this year by serving with the Army. I know that I am getting a bit long in the tooth to be wearing uniform, but having been around some units, I have been shocked at the age of some of our NCOs and their lack of experience. Everybody needs to be made up and given responsibility. I was lucky: I joined the Army as a junior guardsman and just about made guardsman, so I have no experience of promotion in the armed forces. However, the people who commanded tended quite rightly to have the experience and, within the regiment or battalion, the necessary kudos to lead. I have been to Iraq twice and seen the training regiments and some of the people who are training our armed forces. They are very young and they have limited experience, partly because we are losing so many experienced people.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/10">My second concern is about pay and morale. My hon. Friend highlighted an interesting point when she said that there are two types of unit: those made up of regular soldiers, whose pay is better than it was when I served, although we would all accept that it is still not great; and, often embedded with the regulars, those made up of the TA personnel who match their civilian salary.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/11">There is a third category, however, about which I was surprised to learn. I have raised this matter before with the Secretary of State and the Minister. Agency staff are brought in to supplement units in Iraq, especially the Royal Army Medical Corps field ambulance units. The regulars are on their set pay, the TA units are on theirs, and then agency staff are brought in to fill the gaps in the TA medical units. When I was in al-Amara in Iraq just before the election, I witnessed that situation and its damaging effect on morale within the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/12">I compliment the bravery of agency people who have gone in to such environments as untrained civilians. However, the effect on the morale of the armed forces is phenomenal. Without high morale, we do not have armed forces. We cannot deploy them throughout the world and ask them to do what we ask, week in, week out, if morale is low. Morale is low in certain parts of the Army, and particularly in the infantry, partly because of the reorganisation and abolition of regiments, and partly because of the sheer size of the deployment. That issue must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/13">I cannot see that the shortfall in the Royal Army Medical Corps will be addressed by cutting back the TA medical services. It seems illogical. If the Government have admitted defeat in their attempts to recruit people to the medical services, perhaps we need to consider how other countries have recruited successfully. The Americans have an excellent system. Their medical services are some of the best in the world, because they encourage people to undertake commitments as part of their civilian and military career structure. If one moves on in the US civil guard medical services, one moves on in one's civilian career. It is a twin-track approach, and perhaps it is something that we need to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/14">We have a fantastic Territorial Army. Without it, we should never have been able to do any of the things that we have done in the past 20 years throughout the world, from the Falklands, through the two Gulf wars, to Afghanistan and so on. We must not use and abuse TA personnel. We must not assume that those people will volunteer every single time. They are young and enthusiastic, but sometimes common sense must prevail. I hope that we can consider that issue, and I look forward to the Minister's answers to the debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18a.37.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" speakername="Don Touhig" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence"  colnum="37"  time="011:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/halltext/60418h02.htm#60418h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.37.0/1">As this is the first opportunity that a Defence Minister has had to appear before the House since the break, I hope that you, Mr. Caton, will think it appropriate for me to pay tribute to Lieutenant Richard Palmer of the Royal Scots Guards, who was killed in Iraq on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-15">15 April</phrase>. I am sure that all who have read the comments in the press over the past few days will know that this young man was committed to his job. He was greatly loved by his family and he will be sorely missed. I am sure that our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family at this time. I doubt whether any of the 600-odd Members of Parliament could think of a better epitaph than the one that appeared in the <i>Daily Express</i> today, which said that this young man was trying to make lives better for others. He demonstrated a hugely moral and wonderful commitment. I have no doubt that his loss will be greatly felt by his family and his colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/2">I take the opportunity to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase> on securing this debate. I am in regular correspondence with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1369" name="Gerald Howarth">the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth)</phrase> on the Armed Forces Bill; indeed, when we have finished with that Bill, there will be a huge gap in his life and mine. If the day comes when the hon. Lady stops sending me questions about reservists, there will be a similar gap in our lives. She is certainly assiduous in pursuing such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/3">I have no doubt that the hon. Lady understands the nature of the changes to the Territorial Army that my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, who is responsible for the armed forces, referred to in his statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-23">23 March</phrase>. I apologise again for his absence; he is abroad at present. The changes that he spoke of are essential to maintaining a British Army that works as well in this century as it did in the previous one.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/4">The job that our soldiers do today is every bit as important as the job that their predecessors did during the first and second world wars. However, the challenges that they face are, as we all know, very different. Today's soldier must not only engage in combat, but must play the part of peacekeeper and sometimes peace enforcer. The modern British soldier may be fighting to overthrow a dictator one day, keeping peace the next, and rebuilding schools, bridges or power stations the day after. Those are all potentially hostile environments, and they often work under the auspices of different organisations such as NATO or the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/5">A British soldier's job is not easy. He or she must be capable of changing not only what they do but the way in which they react to particular situations. They are dedicated, brave and committed men and women, and I have no doubt that all hon. Members are justly proud of their commitment and service. This constantly developing role, which reflects not only the changing nature of warfare but the changing world in which we live, demands British forces who are even more responsive and effective while maintaining their reputation for professionalism and fairness&mdash;points made earlier in the debate. That is why changes are being made to the Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/6">Today's debate is about the Territorial Army, but I emphasise that the TA is an integral part of the British Army, part of the &quot;one Army&quot; concept to which most hon. Members referred. The Territorial Army was set up almost 100 years ago. Since then, TA volunteers have time and again proved their mettle and their worth, from the battlefields of the first and second world wars to Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. Indeed, the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Mike Jackson, said that our forces are busy&mdash;they all are&mdash;but that our commitments are not unmanageable. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the Reserves have always delivered everything we have asked of them&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/8">He said that he was confident that they would continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/9">It is fair to say that there are few places in which the British Army has operated in the past decades where it has not had some TA colleagues alongside them. The House does not need to be reminded that they are volunteers&mdash;a point made by Opposition Members&mdash;who give up their time for small reward to serve their country. They are serving right now, in the UK and around the world. Although they are called upon to serve less often than their regular counterparts, in some ways, the job is even more difficult&mdash;as colleagues fully understand. When they are deployed, they must be as professional and well disciplined as their regular counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/10">Last year, the Government announced changes to the regular army that will help to prepare us for new challenges. We live in a world in which challenges to democracy, fundamental rights and freedoms, and the rule of law are more prevalent than ever. We cannot choose to ignore those global challenges in a global world. They require a different British Army to deal with them. The Regular Army is now far enough down the road of those changes for us confidently to say that we must now tackle the shaping of the Territorial Army in order that it can best support and be integrated with the Regular Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/11">We are confident that we have found the right solutions not just because we have carefully analysed our future defence needs, but because we have consulted widely with members of the Territorial Army and others. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State paid tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> in the debate on the Floor of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-23">23 March</phrase>, when he said that he had had a good meeting with the hon. Gentleman and that he was grateful to him for asking a range of questions that he put to his officials, thus helping him to be better informed when taking ministerial decisions. We have consulted on the need to adjust for the future and the manner of that adjustment. Only after careful consideration of all the relevant factors did we come to the right solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/12">I do not want to spend too much time repeating what my right hon. Friend told the House less than a month ago, because the details are well known to colleagues. The changes are good for the TA, the Army and Britain. As colleagues know, the size of the TA will remain unchanged, with a current liability of 38,500, excluding the 3,500 in the Officer Training Corps. We will, however, deploy our men and women and their equipment more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/13">At this stage, I should make a point about the proportion of the TA that is currently deployable for operations. That issue was touched on by Opposition Members. There have been several reports of late about manning shortages in the TA, and I would like to provide some context, which might help colleagues. About 13,000 TA soldiers are classed as being available for deployment, whereas our current requirement is about 1,200 a year&mdash;about 10 per cent. of those available for deployment. A similar number are classed as being unavailable due to the Army's intention that soldiers should not be mobilised more than once every five years. If we were to work to the less rigid provisions of the Reserve Forces Act 1996, which states that TA soldiers may not be mobilised more than once every three years, the number of soldiers available for mobilisation would be about 17,000. I accept the points made by the hon. Members for Congleton and for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) about the numbers available for deployment, but the current requirement is about 10 per cent. of the number who are available.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.1/1">We have extensive surveys about all aspects of the operation of our forces. The point I am making, in response to remarks by the hon. Member for Congleton, is that we are looking at exit surveys to try to get a better and more accurate understanding of this matter. We have a lot of anecdotal information, and other bits of information are fed in, but if we were specifically to target the group that causes concern&mdash;people who are leaving, for whatever reason, following deployment&mdash;that would give us the information we seek.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.5/1">Pained expressions are pained expressions, but we as a Government have a duty to be as open as possible about these matters. I strongly believe that&mdash;as, I know, does the Secretary of State. There are difficulties, which I have explained, but we will examine what we can do to ensure that this information can be provided to colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.5/2">The hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead brought to his comments the experience of having served in the forces. He welcomed the integration of the TA with the regular Army, and I thank him for that. However, he was concerned about the TA being deployed too often, and he talked about morale and issues to do with pay. I think I have answered some of his points, but I will look further into that when I refer to <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow, and if there is a need to respond in more detail, I will do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.5/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">The hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> can also speak with considerable authority because of his background: he represents a large garrison town, so he knows a lot about some of the key issues. He talked about the TA footprint being important in recruitment. I strongly agree; where we have that strong footprint, recruitment is good. That is clearly an important message for all of us to take on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.5/4">I also welcome what the hon. Gentleman said about the employers who support the TA. The hon. Member for Congleton also mentioned that. Without the support of many employers, it would be difficult for people who have a life outside the forces to give the commitment and service that we often ask of them. I wish to take this opportunity to pay particular tribute to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, who last year held an event for employers at Highgrove. I met a number of employers there&mdash;not the large ones that we often think of, but those who employ two, three or four people, and who have somebody who is in the TA and on deployment. I understand the difficulties that they face as a result. They make a huge contribution by giving their support to our reserve forces. We cannot thank them enough for what they do.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.5/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">The hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> made some important points. He talked about our defence planning assumptions. They are, of course, kept under constant review. All Governments do that, and it is right and proper for them to do so. He also referred to the National Audit Office report on deployment. I tried to cover that when I explained that approximately 13,000 people in our force are available for deployment and our current need is about 1,200.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.5/6">The hon. Gentleman went on to talk about the close links between the MOD and the NHS. That is an important point that we need to explore. Those two organisations must be brought together even more closely, as there would be huge benefits in doing so. When I visited Selly Oak last year, I saw evidence of the benefits of the close collaboration between our Army Medical Services and the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.5/7">During the century of service that TA volunteers have given our country, they have proved their adaptability in meeting the requirements of national security in all its guises. They, like their regular colleagues, continue to be a force for good in dealing with the challenges of this new century, and they are a more integral part of our land forces than ever. They do a tremendous job for our country. We are hugely in their debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.5/8">I have no doubt that the comments made by all colleagues were intended to reinforce the understanding that we value, appreciate and cherish the work that they do, and the service and commitment they give. It is up to all of us&mdash;Government, Opposition and all Members&mdash;to do everything that we can to ensure that they know that they are valued, and to make sure they have all the resources and everything else they need to carry out the tasks we set them.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.5/9">From the tone of the debate, I have no doubt that there is a willingness on both sides of the House to ensure that our reserve forces know that they have the complete backing of Members, and that we will do everything we can to ensure that they continue to carry out their job effectively. I feel certain that that message will go back to our forces as a result of the comments made in this debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18a.50.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" speakeroffice="The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform"  colnum="50"  time="012:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/halltext/60418h03.htm#60418h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.50.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" name="Mark Todd">my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his thoughtful contribution on what I consider a subject of key public policy importance on which we shall spend more time in the coming period.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/2">My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the changing nature of the population. Many of our policies look at employment rates beyond the age of 50; at that age, men and women have life expectancies of more than 33 years and more than 36 years respectively. One can pull out very stark statistics on this issue. The one I have chosen to mention is that by the late 2020s, almost half the adult population in the UK will be over 50.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/3">If we compare the employment rate of those over 50 to that of the general population of working age, we see a gap. Some 70.7 per cent. of people below state pension age but over 50 work, whereas just under 75 per cent. of the population as a whole work, so the gap is about 4 per cent. The other interesting thing is that most of those over 50 who are no longer in work did not volunteer to leave their jobs, yet once out of the labour market very few of them&mdash;only 8 per cent.&mdash;try to get a job again. There is genuinely an issue here, and my hon. Friend is right to draw attention to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/4">Many of the issues that we are dealing with today come from the legacy that we inherited, and the most rapid decline in the employment of older men in particular came after 1979. That was due partly to the structural change and the decline of heavy industries, but also to the fact that company policies, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> drew our attention, were pretty rigorous in using the pretext of age to reduce work forces. The stewardship of the economy meant that there were not as many job opportunities as we enjoy today.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/5">Progress has been made since 1997, when the Labour party came to power. In 1979, the employment rate among those aged 50-plus was 72.4 per cent., but by 1994 it had gone down to 62.6 per cent. We have returned the figure to just over 70 per cent. Not surprisingly, the employment rate for women has also increased. It was at its lowest in 1984&mdash;54.7 per cent.&mdash;but at 68.4 per cent., it is now almost equal to that for men.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/6">Our record of using the instruments of public policy to encourage the employment of older people is good and has been recognised as such by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&mdash;we are about 10th out of the 30 OECD countries&mdash;and by the European Union. In relation to our European partners, we are second in respect of the employment rate for the over-50s. The unemployment rate for older people is now lower than that for other groups. If older people choose to stay active in the labour market, they are more likely to be in work than the rest of the working-age population. That is another interesting fact to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/7">Since we have been in government, we have brought more than 1 million extra people aged 50 or over into work. Of course, we want to go further and tackle many issues to which my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire alluded, but we are proud of our record. We have reduced the gap in employment rates between the over-50s and the under-50s by about 20 per cent. Again, we are proud of that. It is interesting to see where the over-50s work: about a quarter are self-employed&mdash;there is a greater propensity to self-employment among the over-50s&mdash;and 70 per cent. work part-time. My hon. Friend might not know that figure, but there is a lot of part-time working by older people.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/8">There are problems that we need to tackle and there are structural questions. We need to think about whether we have the structure of the tax and benefits system right and whether we have the right rules on pension schemes. We have done a lot, but we need to do more. There are personal issues for people that we need to confront. Older people tend to be the ones who have issues relating to health and disability. Many of our welfare reform Green Paper proposals focus on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/9">My hon. Friend drew attention to the lack of flexible working. The Green Paper also contains proposals on that. We are attempting to tackle lower qualification levels among older people through many of the employment and training programmes that we have introduced. There are also cultural issues, as individuals might have unrealistic aspirations on early retirement and employers might have outdated prejudices on the capabilities of older people and their capability to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/10">I shall go through some of our plans and then briefly tackle the issues to which my hon. Friend alluded. We published our health, work and well-being strategy document about six months ago and it is very important. In it, we consider the links between the work undertaken by the Department of Health, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Health and Safety Executive, so that we ensure that people can get the benefits of work. I am talking about healthy workplaces and ensuring that efforts to secure early rehabilitation to keep people in their jobs or to bring them back into their jobs are co-ordinated across Government and all agencies that respond to individual needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/11">I have talked about the welfare reform agenda, whereby we are trying to ensure that proper support structures are in place so that we can provide opportunities for older workers to stay in or return to work. Once those support structures are in place, there will be a responsibility on individuals to take up the opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/12">I note that my hon. Friend does not think that the changes to the state pension go far enough, but there are now better financial incentives to defer taking the pension. I am referring to the rate of increment and the ability to access a lump sum, which is pretty generously calculated. It is set at 2 per cent. above the Bank of England interest rate and compound interest is built into the calculation.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/13">We have made an important alteration to private pension schemes so that people can take their pension and carry on working. We have introduced improvements to personal allowances for those over 65. The personal allowance for someone over 65 who is working is &pound;7,280 as compared with the general allowance of just over &pound;5,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/14">The welfare reform Green Paper contains a series of propositions, which we are taking forward. They involve giving older workers access to the new deals, piloting better one-to-one support for older workers and seeing whether we can take the introduction of flexible working further.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/15">We are also considering how we implement the age discrimination legislation. My hon. Friend talked about that for some time. The legislation has just passed through the processes of the House and will come into force in October. He is right to say that, under the legislation, there is a default retirement age of 65, although we have promised that we will review that, as the measure beds in, over five years. I tend to agree with him that if we can get rid of that default age, we will improve the ability of older people to participate in the labour market. However, I hope he accepts that as we try to transform cultural attitudes in our society towards the employment of older people, we should bring all the stakeholders with us. As we set the default retirement age, we were conscious of the concerns of business. There were fears among those in the business community that if there was no retirement age, they would find it difficult to manage their work force and ensure that younger people had the opportunity to develop in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/16">My hon. Friend talked about the lack of knowledge of and information about the changes that the Government are introducing. I have been engaged in a number of changes, particularly involving individual rights in respect of equality, and I know that it takes time for such changes to become known to employers. I am thinking particularly of the work that I have done on disability. Despite pretty extensive publicity, there was still some reluctance among employers to understand and take on board their responsibilities under disability discrimination legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/17">We probably face a similar situation with the issue that we are debating today, but 37 per cent. is not a bad knowledge base, given that we have some months to go before implementing the legislation. I hope that our &quot;Age Positive&quot; campaign and the &quot;Be Ready&quot; campaign, which we are running with our partners, will help to build understanding of the new legislation so that there is compliance when it comes into force in October.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/18">I agree with what my hon. Friend said about the advantages of older people staying in work. That is better for the individual in terms of their prosperity and status in society. There is also a growing body of evidence that work can benefit individuals' health and well-being and can prolong life rather than reduce life chances. He was also right to draw attention to the benefits to society&mdash;not only the gains from additional income, but those from less expenditure on benefits, health services, social services and social infrastructure to support individuals. There is also a loss of productivity to society if we do not take full advantage of the capabilities of older people.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/19">My hon. Friend talked about whether we should waive employer national insurance for those over 65. He will know that that recommendation emerged from the Turner commission. We are considering it and we will report on the way forward that we want to pursue, having considered the Turner review.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.0/20">My hon. Friend talked about whether we could go further on greater advantages to individuals through the tax and national insurance system. Again, we constantly review our position on that to see whether we can do more. He talked about greater help for those who defer taking the state pension. We have made huge progress in that regard, but I will take his views on board as we consider how we can better benefit from the undoubted huge strength that we have in older workers, whom we want to keep in work and contributing to the well-being of our society. We also want to ensure that they, too, feel that they make an individual contribution.</p>

	Football Players (Behaviour)

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18a.62.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="62"  time="013:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/halltext/60418h05.htm#60418h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.62.1/1">I come to this debate not because footballers any more than MPs are the cause of society's ills, or because footballers reflect society's ills, but because they can help us to do something about them. In my constituency and city, we are attacking antisocial behaviour in one of the country's most deprived and educationally under-attaining areas. At every primary school, alongside literacy and numeracy, we are seeking to teach social behaviour to develop youngsters' emotional intelligence and empathy, and their ability to learn, resolve differences without violence and develop mutual respect. Those same youngsters go home, and those lessons are not always reinforced by their sporting heroes.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/2">Just over 12 months ago, I asked the Minister about the insidious effect of footballers' bad behaviour on the behaviour of young people. He told me in a written reply that he had written to all football club chairmen in the hope that they would lobby their players to behave. It has not worked. However, the Minister does not run football. English football is run not by the state, but by three private companies&mdash;the Football Association, the Football League and the premiership. But even they cannot change the rules of football. That role lies with the global rule-setting body, FIFA, which has already failed to respond to the FA's calls for retrospective penalties and, at the other extreme, has responded to English football's request to attack racism in global football, but in a crude and disproportionate manner. However, football is now of such social significance that we should all reflect on our responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/3">I wish to use the debate to put on the Minister's agenda the issues that people have brought to my attention in the last two weeks of my local consultation. There is a remarkable similarity of views across the spectrum, from the local Crown prosecutor and the chief executive of Nottingham council through to local beat officers, teachers and parents. They see pictures of a referee surrounded by a mob of bawling players, who are showering the referee with foul language and physically intimidating him. That teaches youngsters that if they reject a decision made by someone in authority&mdash;be it a teacher, a policeman or a parent&mdash;it is acceptable to berate or intimidate him or her to get the decision changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/4">My consultation shows that there is a public thirst for those footballers who are in the public eye to devote time to showing youngsters that football is not about immature, spoilt behaviour and making money. We need to demonstrate that football is about teamwork, honesty and fairness, as it is for most of the 37,000 football clubs in England, the vast majority of which are tremendous role models for our young people, and for the young athletes who show dedication in their lifestyle to get to the top. A small number of people are the problem, but none the less they are often the most important people in the game.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/5">I want the Minister to address six key problems. The first is behaviour on the field. Cheating must be punished at the time of the offence when possible, and afterwards with the benefit of TV replay if not. The FA, to its great credit, has proposed that but cannot move without FIFA's okay. Penalties should not only be financial but, since many clubs and individuals can afford them, offenders should also be banned. How can we expect youngsters to learn the values of hard work and honesty when they see their idols grinning after their latest con, or disguising petulance and poor sportsmanship as &quot;attitude&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/6">Young men, especially those with absent fathers, crave role models and&mdash;like it or not&mdash;footballers often meet that need. At the most extreme, those with a predisposition to violence find it endorsed or justified in football. Lame excuses about a few bad apples are no longer acceptable. Bad behaviour in football is unacceptable and needs to be tackled fearlessly. After appropriate public debate, will the Minister convene a summit of all the relevant organisations and authorities in football to agree and to thrash out a way forward?</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/7">My second point is about the treatment of referees. Referees' decisions should be final, not the start of infantile behaviour escalating to arguing, abuse and collective intimidation, and such behaviour should lead to immediate dismissal from the field. The FA must look again at referees' powers. Rugby union shows that such player misconduct can be eliminated, not least by an intelligent running commentary on the game from the referee and the convention&mdash;not law&mdash;that only the captain may ask to speak to the referee. Dissent is punished with a repeatable 10 yd penalty. I have asked the FA to propose such measures again to FIFA for football. Managers would soon teach players that such behaviour harmed their team and their wage packet. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity unequivocally to back referees and extra powers for referees, as well as the FA as it proposes change to FIFA.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/8">The third issue is the off-the-field conduct of parents and spectators. A trip to the local park at the weekend to watch a youth game is a chastening experience. The worst offenders are the parents. Often, referees are no more than 14 or 15 years old, yet they have to deal with intimidation from people old enough to be their parents. Most premiership academies, I am told, no longer allow parents to watch their children because of that problem. Although a better example must be set by professionals, parents, too, must play their part. The clubs also have a strong responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/9">More pressure must be put on clubs to enforce better behaviour, either contractually or through a code of conduct that incentivises good behaviour. Players must be taught by clubs the social skills to recognise the impact that they have on others and be supported to become better role models on and off the pitch. As one police officer replied to my consultation,</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/10" class="indent">&quot;they need to become professionals in the moral as well as financial sense&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/11">Although the FA is a not-for-profit organisation, and all funds go back into the game, one idea suggested was that the players' fines should go to the FA, and be more obviously put into a &quot;community chest&quot; to educate players about drinking, smoking, social responsibility and so on. Sponsors, too, can play an important part; they have a clear interest in associating their products with high standards of behaviour from the players who wear their logo each week.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/12">We already enshrine into FA contracts the guidelines for a certain percentage of players' time to be devoted to community activities. I underline again that most professional footballers and most clubs act in a responsible way: 5 per cent. of gross TV royalties go on corporate responsibilities and an additional &pound;12 million goes from the premiership clubs to the Professional Footballers Association for education. Will the Minister consider rewarding more obviously and more publicly those clubs and individuals who serve the community, and introducing incentives and public recognition for those who behave well?</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/13">Already three UEFA cup places are awarded to the three national associations in Europe with the best fair play record&mdash;a great incentive. Accordingly, those three places are given to the clubs with the best fair play record for that season. Football in the community schemes, the &quot;Kick It Out&quot; campaign, and many other campaigns sponsored by those in and around football have already proved what football can do when it sets its mind to the task. Perhaps we can do something similar with the campaign on homophobia, with equal success.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/14">As a focus for the effort and as a way of making a clean start, I suggest that the Minister considers a public declaration that the FA, PFA, premiership, league and the League Managers Association, as well as the media, will confront and eliminate bad behaviour. I ask him to organise that at the beginning of the next football season and publicly to sign up everyone in a ceremony that should be replicated on the first Saturday of the coming season at every ground from Wembley, where they will be playing the charity shield&mdash;perhaps not this season, but one lives in hope&mdash;to the local recreation ground. That ceremony should be replicated throughout the land, from the finest grounds to the local pub 11 playing their knock-about game, to signify a new start to a new season. I hope that the Minister will consider entertaining that idea and taking the lead, even given the limited powers that he has over the game.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/15">My next point is about the basic education of the young athletes, which also has to be addressed. Most youngsters do not make it at football clubs and even for those who do their careers are short. Preparation for later life for both groups is essential, not least some financial education for those who make it. In the United States, colleges that take on young athletes&mdash;many of whom go on to become professionals&mdash;are allowed to take a certain number of young people on athletic scholarships if their grades are perhaps not as strong as they might be but show some academic potential. Those colleges then have a duty to ensure that their players reach a certain academic level. If they fail to do so, the number of scholarships the following year is cut down. In an age when we demand five good GCSEs of all youngsters, can we not insist on stretching personalised learning programmes for all young people in football? That should be the minimum standard for any football club that signs a teenage footballer. That would make every club take the same level of care and responsibility as the best. Education, discipline and standards would also improve young footballers' behaviour on and off the pitch. Again, I ask the Minister to use his good offices to negotiate that basic educational standard with the relevant football authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/16">We must recognise the media's role in helping footballers' behaviour to influence society&mdash;for good or ill. The media must report what happens on the field, but they can also influence our perception of it. The smirk or cynical wink of a commentator&mdash;a Lineker or a Hansen&mdash;in front of a viewing audience of millions, many of whom are youngsters, can undo much of the good work that is done at home or at school. The media must sign up not to glamorising violent, cheating players, but to exposing them for what they are. They have an even bigger responsibility when it comes to reporting off-the-field behaviour, and that is particularly true of the press. They have the power of choice, but if they continually choose to report only on the tiny minority of players who cheat on their wives and children or who are binge drinkers, drug users, excessive gamblers and criminals, they should not be surprised when, on the inside pages, they report on youngsters who follow the same example. It is not an easy issue to tackle, but I ask my right hon. Friend, who is well aware of the difficulties involved, to speak to the game's important non-playing players&mdash;the media&mdash;to see what can be done to achieve a stronger ethic in the coverage of sport, and particularly football, because that coverage has an influence on our young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/17">The nation is reaching the conclusion that the current system is unacceptable, and we want to improve it. There are no easy answers, and we must all work together to find a way forward. Changes are necessary, and I have several clear questions for the Minister. First, what plans does he have to improve behaviour? Will he convene a summit to thrash out a way forward, support referees, reduce cheating and improve parental behaviour? Secondly, will he publicly reward clubs whose players set the best examples? Thirdly, will he use the first day of the season to launch a sportsmanship in football or a similar initiative, which will range from the premiership down to the local recreation ground? Fourthly, will he make representations to FIFA, which writes the rules of football, to ensure that the FA's sensible requests can be met? In that context, can he tell us when the independent European football review will report and what impact it might have on the issue? If FIFA and others refuse to play ball&mdash;if I can use that phrase&mdash;will he look at the domestic independence of English football and at whether we can have rules in the domestic context that we feel are appropriate? Finally, will he challenge the PFA to engage senior players who are clearly not engaged in promoting better behaviour?</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/18">I sought this debate not to score easy points or to talk about current issues in the media, such as diving, gambling abuses or wages, but to focus on an important issue for my constituency, where people are working night and day to improve young people's behaviour. At three consecutive Prime Minister's Question Times, I have raised with the Prime Minister the importance of promoting social behaviour as well as tackling antisocial behaviour. I hope that everything that professional footballers, MPs and everybody else does will be done with an eye to underpinning, rather than undermining, the efforts that all of us, particularly in tough constituencies with poor educational records, are piling in to help youngsters make a better life for themselves. We in this place can do more than anybody on that issue, but professional footballers and the game itself can also make a contribution, and I hope that the Minister will be able move the professional game towards helping us some time in the next year or so.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Member for Nottingham, North on securing this debate and endorse everything he said. When the Minister writes to the football clubs, does he also write to the rugby league and rugby union clubs? As he said, those sports involve far more physical contact than football. If not, what is his reasoning as to why football misbehaves as it does?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18a.67.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" speakername="Richard Caborn" colnum="67"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060418/halltext/60418h05.htm#60418h05_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.67.1/1">I have not written to rugby league or rugby union clubs, nor to cricket clubs or those of other team sports. In that respect, we might even think of ice hockey, which is another contact sport. Yes, I have raised the subject with the football authorities, but I might also raise with them&mdash;indeed, I thank them for it&mdash;the fact that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North said, the vast majority of players not only conduct themselves fairly on the park, but do a tremendous amount of good in the community. Later, I shall put down a few markers about the role of football and the majority of players.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/2">My hon. Friend asked whether representations should be made to FIFA, requesting it to meet representatives of the FA, particularly on the question of discipline. It is not easy for FIFA to square up to that, but I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend. Indeed, I know that the FA has made strong representations to FIFA, asking it to consider recent issues that have affected football, especially the question of diving.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/3">Although I acknowledge that my hon. Friend does not want to home in on the question, I believe that it is something FIFA could consider. I understand the position of FIFA's president on the question. FIFA has to give governance to the game internationally and its president will argue strongly that although the developed countries of western Europe have the facilities&mdash;for example, a premier division football match in England is filmed by eight television cameras&mdash;that is not the case in parts of Africa or Asia, nor in other parts of the world. FIFA wants to ensure that the rules are universally applied and that governance of the game is universal.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/4">That argument has some merit. However, other arguments are being made by football authorities in England, and I have discussed them with a colleague and friend, Keith Hackett, who is the senior referee. He heads up the referees' organisation. As an aside, Mr. Caton, I can tell the House that he sent me off once&mdash;I got a red card&mdash;which shows what an objective man he is. However, that was some years past. The discussion going on inside football is one that FIFA could consider, and we should consider whether to run some trials, as Keith Hackett tells me that one of the most difficult things a referee has to do is decide whether someone is diving.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/5">We could consider what happens in rugby league. In that sport, players can be put on report and incidents can be considered on video after the match. Other options could be considered by the FA, but an experimental period over a season could also help to inform FIFA decisions. I acknowledge that the president of FIFA has a problem: he is the president of an international organisation and I know he wants to ensure that governance is as fair internationally as it can be. There is some merit in his argument, but it is a finely balanced one. Football has changed dramatically over recent years and perhaps, as in other sports&mdash;even international ones&mdash;we ought to bring in new technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/6">My hon. Friend referred to the independent European football review on the governance of football in the European Union. Without going into too much detail, Heads of Government said in 2000 that sport has a particular role to play in the Community. That was specified in the Nice declaration, and EUFA is interpreting the declaration to see how it fits with football. It will be considering the governance of football in relation to the EU. Many know that EU and Commission regulations and directives have had a considerable impact on football, and the review is being undertaken in that context.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/7">I assure my hon. Friend that social inclusion is not specifically about behaviour on the park; it is also to do with supporting grass-roots football and examining ways to support, encourage, educate and train new players. The health of young players is also very much part of that review, which I hope will be completed by the end of May.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/8">What we have been doing in England, and in the UK, is an exemplar for football&mdash;I am thinking of football in the community and the playing for success initiative. The latter has had one of the biggest impacts on education, numeracy, literacy and information, communications and technology, or ICT, skills of almost anything the Government have undertaken in the past seven or eight years. It was driven largely by football professionals putting at our disposal the grounds, players and know-how of the clubs, and it has made a massive contribution to social cohesion.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/9">My hon. Friend also asked whether we would consider the domestic independence of English football if insufficient progress was made through FIFA. We have FIFA, EUFA and the FA. That is the line of command for the sport, and I would not want the FA to break away from that. I know that dialogue continues between FA and FIFA on a number of issues, which is how it should be. There should be no political interference and the two should work for the good of the game. This is about the good governance of the game. I am sure that much of what we are developing in England will influence Europe and the world. That is how it should be. As with every other game or sport, developments should be within that broad governance.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/10">My hon. Friend asked whether I would wish the Professional Footballers Association to engage those players who are not engaged in promoting better behaviour. In my view, the PFA does a first-class job in this area, and I know that Gordon Taylor promotes it strongly through the Prince's Trust, helping many young people to get back into society through football. The commitment of two to three hours a week to community work for each player is part of the charter and the contracts that the professionals sign up to.</p>
