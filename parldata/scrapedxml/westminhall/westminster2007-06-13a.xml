<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-13a.263.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" speakername="Alistair Carmichael" colnum="263"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070613/halltext/70613h0001.htm#07061380000444">
	<p pid="a.263.2/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity of serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Caton, and to have secured this debate on an important issue for many of my constituents and people throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/2">It might assist the Chamber if I first explain why I have chosen this topic. The universal service obligation has been an ongoing concern of mine for the past six years while I have been a Member of Parliament, but it has particular relevance and resonance at the moment following the recent application by the Royal Mail for zonal pricing for bulk mail, on which consultation with Postcomm has just concluded. That has particular relevance to this debate and I shall discuss it in greater depth later in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/3">This debate must be put into its proper context of recent political history, particularly the way in which the Government opened up the letter post market to full competition. They did so at the prompting of many in Postcomm and, I regret to say, Postwatch with unnecessary and unseemly haste in what history will record as an act of commercial, economic and social vandalism. The full implications of that act, the way in which it was done, and the way in which it was driven by officials at Postcomm in particular, will ultimately show it to have been highly damaging to the basic market structure of postal services in this country, and especially to our most remote and peripheral communities. Too many people in the Department of Trade and Industry and in Postcomm feel qualified to speak on matters of competition without ever having run a proper business. If there is to be a new phase of Government, I hope that some economic realism will be injected into bodies such as Postcomm and&mdash;I say this with considerable regret, because it is supposed to protect consumers' interests&mdash;Postwatch.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/4">My concern is that if Royal Mail's application for zonal charging for bulk mail is approved, bulk mail will be removed from the universal service and what is left will hardly be worth the name. It will hardly be universal and it will barely be a service.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/5">According to Postcomm,</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/6" class="indent">&quot;The universal service means that anyone in the UK can post letters and parcels to any other part of the country at the same affordable rates. And it guarantees one delivery of mail for every UK household and business, each working day, and one collection of mail, six days a week. One of Postcomm's most important jobs is to protect the universal service, by requiring it in Royal Mail's licence and making sure the company has the resources to fulfil its duties.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/7">The USO covers letters and packets weighing up to2 kg, the non-priority service and parcels weighing up to 20 kg, the registered and insured service, and a range of support services to ensure security and integrity of the mail&mdash;for example, the Royal Mail's re-direction service, international outbound services, Mailsort 1400 and the Cleanmail bulk mail services.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/8">It would be remiss of me if I did not remind the House that the writ of the USO does not run in some parts of the country, where the availability of transport and the sparsity of population make it difficult to provide a daily service. Many of those places are in my constituency, but I shall strike an uncharacteristically positive note and say that since the creation of Postcomm and Postwatch, we have seen significant improvement in the service in those hard-to-deliver-to areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/9">Communities in Orkney and Shetland depend on Royal Mail's universal service. Local businesses face many challenges&mdash;we have additional travel costs and exceptionally high fuel prices as a result of our geographical location. However, mail prices have remained largely uniform throughout the country and companies in the northern isles have been able to send mail at the same price as firms in other parts of the country. Some of the most innovative and exciting uses anywhere of the mail order business are to be found in the northern isles&mdash;indeed, I am told that no less a person than <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody)</phrase> orders high-quality products by mail from businesses in Orkney.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-13a.265.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" speakername="Alistair Carmichael" colnum="265"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070613/halltext/70613h0001.htm#07061380000448">
	<p pid="a.265.1/1">That is, in essence, my concern, and I share my hon. Friend's concern about Parcelforce, which draws an invisible line in Scotland, and once that line is crossed charges increase. Parcels sent from elsewhere in the UK to the north of Scotland still have a surcharge added and parcel recipients in my constituency must pay a surcharge wherever that parcel comes from. Allowing, in effect, a free-for-all in the parcel post market has given people living in Scottish highland communities a bad deal. I had hoped that Ministers had seen what we experienced with parcel mail, and learned some lessons.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/2">At the heart of the debate is the challenge of reconciling liberalisation of the mail market with protection of the universal service. A truly free market would not produce or sustain a universal service. The Government have not thought through how to reconcile those differences and resolve the tensions. In truth, there is a tension between the two objectives, but the Government seem happy to continue to open up the mail market without truly considering the practical impact on the universal service.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/3">Some Departments&mdash;particularly the Department for Work and Pensions at the beginning of the year&mdash;appear to think that there is no contradiction whatever between saying that they support the universal service and taking their own bulk mail contracts away from Royal Mail and giving them to its competitors. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1721" name="Geraldine Smith">The hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Geraldine Smith)</phrase> highlights that point in her early-day motion 587, which criticises the DWP's decision to award contracts to the Royal Mail's competitors. I should point out to the Minister thatthe early-day motion has the support of no fewer than 67 of his Labour colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/4">The universal service obligation has positive and negative aspects from Royal Mail's point of view. Although there are costs involved, its universal coverage should provide it with a significant competitive advantage. I hope that Royal Mail can maintain the universal service obligation without a subsidy or a levy from other mail companies. However, the Liberal Democrats recognise that if that is not possible, a levy might be imposed on other mail delivery companies to help to finance the universal service obligation. Such a levy is specifically envisaged and permitted by the European postal services directive, which gave rise to liberalisation of the mail market in the first place. I hope that when the Minister replies he will tell us the Government's thinking on the use of such a levy. Even if he were to place on record a willingness to consider it, he would send to operators in the postal service market an important and powerful message that the Government are prepared to act if necessary to ensure that constituencies such as mine and many other less peripheral areas in the United Kingdom will be protected from the worst excesses of a liberalised market.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/5">My very real concern is that the Government, and Postcomm, are pressing ahead with the opening up of the mail market without first ensuring that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect the universal service. That point was demonstrated by recent proposals for zonal pricing of business mail. As the Minister knows, Postcomm's second consultation on zonal pricing for some business mail products closed at the start of this month. When Postcomm last consulted on zonal pricing, the idea was not supported by large bulk mailers, who are key customers for Royal Mail, or by Royal Mail's customers. Royal Mail applied to Postcomm in April 2006 for zonal pricing of business mail. The decision will be made no later than <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-02">2 January 2008</phrase>; if the application is approved, Royal Mail will start zonal pricing in April 2008. As the Minister knows, Royal Mail wants to divide the country into five price zones, allowing it to charge its business customers different amounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/6">I have real concerns about heading down that road. However, even if we support the principle of cost-reflective pricing, which I do not in this instance, Royal Mail's proposals do not make any sense, and they are certainly not the best way to bring about that situation. The proposal is for a surcharge of 4.8 per cent. for delivery to rural areas. Royal Mail has also made it clear that that will be just an initial extra charge. Over time, it intends to increase the differential, which appears to be an open-ended commitment. Royal Mail estimates that, to be cost-reflective, the surcharge should be 11 per cent. Clearly, if the concept is introduced, there will be pressure for the surcharge to increase over time, which will result in uncertainty for local businesses when planning just how much bulk mail to produce.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.2/1">I congratulate<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> on his choice of debate and the thorough way in which he made his case. I cannot promise to have the same style as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody)</phrase>, but I shall do my best to make a small contribution to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/2">Last night, my bedtime reading was the Labour party manifesto. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland briefly referred to one of the promises that we made in it, which I shall read out for the record:</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/3" class="indent">&quot;We will review the impact on the Royal Mail of market liberalisation, which is being progressively introduced under the Postal Services Act 2000 and which allows alternative carriers to the Royal Mail to offer postal services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/4">My hon. Friend the Minister has been a staunch defender of the manifesto. I was pleased that he and his ministerial colleagues defended the concept of the publicly owned Royal Mail making its decisions on Mr. Leighton's recent proposals. I have high hopes that the review will be able to proceed without further delay. It appears to be a mechanism under which the impact of the Postal Services Act 2000 and the performance of Postcomm and Postwatch, to which the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland referred, can be reviewed. In many circles, there is disappointment at the performance of Postwatch in comparison, for example, with Energywatch, which I would say was a stauncher defender of consumer interests. I hope that the review will proceed without delay and I would be interested in the Minister's thoughts about how it might proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/5">It is interesting that Postcomm has made various calculations of the cost burden of the universal service obligation. A few years ago, it said that that was&pound;80 million-plus&mdash;no doubt it has increased since then. Many things have changed in the postal market since Postcomm last looked at it. Even with bulk mail and so on, the postal market is declining for the first time in many years. Royal Mail's share of bulk mail is also declining quite rapidly and about 40 per cent. of such mail is now in other hands. It is interesting to see how the rest of Europe is responding to the issue. Oxera, an Oxford-based research consultancy, has produced a report entitled &quot;Funding universal service obligations in the postal sector&quot; that considers about eight different postal services throughout Europe, including La Poste, Poste Italiane, Magyar Posta, Cyprus Post and Poczta Polska. Royal Mail did not contribute towards the study, which nevertheless provides interesting ideas, some of which the hon. Gentleman referred to.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/6">If Royal Mail continued to lose market share, it would be possible to set up a compensation fund, as has been done to protect the universal service obligation in telecoms markets around the world. It would be possible to put a mark-up on the access charges for Royal Mail's competitors. In Finland, a system of &quot;pay or play&quot; is already in place. In other words, competitors to the established operator contribute to the universal service obligation through delivering, or by paying towards it.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/7">Those are many possibilities for the future. There is a feeling among Back Benchers of all parties that Postcomm is being a little complacent in its mantra that the only way to preserve the universal service obligation is to continue cost-cutting at Royal Mail&mdash;basically, that is its answer. Obviously, that is a comfortable message to give from offices in London, but ultimately it has implications for the terms and conditions of postal workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/8">To be fair, Royal Mail has stripped out a lot of costs in recent years. It will be interesting to see whether Postcomm will at any stage feel the need to think about the perfectly legal measures that are being considered in other parts of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/9">Finally, it would be interesting to hear from the Minister about progress on other Royal Mail issues that are relevant to the pursuit of the universal service obligation. Obviously, certainty at the top is vital for any organisation. I note that Mr. Leighton has written a book entitled &quot;On Leadership: Practical Wisdom from the People Who Know&quot;&mdash;like the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland, he does not believe in underselling his case. I do not know whether Mr. Leighton intends to spend more time on the lecture circuit. Incidentally, many Leeds United supporters remember his leadership while he was on the board of their club. At one stage, the Department was thinking of appointing a vice-chairman to bolster Royal Mail's leadership, but I do not know whether that will happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/10">As the Minister has often said, the Government have been generous in providing investment facilities to the Royal Mail. Are those being implementing? I hope that it is not still smarting from the rejection of some of its plans. Finally, while the universal service obligation is delivered during the summer, it would be extremely helpful if the industrial dispute could be solved. That will require both sides to talk together. I hope that, without taking sides, Ministers will encourage both parties to talk so that we can avoid an extremely damaging postal strike over the summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.272.2/1">I am delighted to be able to speak briefly on the matter, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> on raising it. I presume that it is a second choice, because its title is nice and bold on the paper that notifies us about upcoming debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.2/2">For a good or bad reason, I was on the Committee that considered the Postal Services Act 2000 when it was a Bill, so I have some knowledge of what happened at that stage. To be fair, the Government made great play of the fact that it was not a privatising Bill. All the way through we heard the mantra of liberalisation, and that it was about ensuring that Royal Mail and the postal market were fit for purpose and were fit to compete in the UK market and further afield. It has not quite worked out that way, and that is why it is fair to ask the Minister, his team and Royal Mail to reconsider the Act. It was made clear when it was considered in Parliament that the universal service obligation was not an add-on and could not be undermined but was a key part of the Act. If it is not working properly, and if changes could threaten that universal service obligation, we should go back to the legislative process.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.2/3">The then Minister for Competitiveness, now the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, made it clear that the Government would consider open-mindedly how we could maintain the universal service obligation. I reiterate the call for the Minister present to tell us whether they will consider how that is working, produce a report and talk to MPs from all parties to consider some of the implications. It is not just about Royal Mail per se. I always get a bit confused about Royal Mail's domain, because it is made up of different elements that seem to drop in and out of what we mean by Royal Mail. Of course, it includes the parcel service, but it also included the sub-post office network.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.2/4">The Minister knows that Gloucester sorting office might close. That is about presence on the ground, so I do not dismiss it, although I know that it does not form part of the debate. However, what is part of the debate is the controversy over the 2,500 sub-post offices that are likely to be hit by the proposals. I am sure that all hon. Members have their spies in the camp, as I have, but we have just had a meeting to go through the potential process. As always with Royal Mail, it is cloak-and-dagger stuff. No one is supposed to know that the meeting has taken place, and the only thing we know is the compensation package. None of the sub-postmasters or sub-postmistresses know whether their office will be one of those notified for closure, but some areas are going more rapidly. Once a decisionis taken, we will be given a month to make representations, but the opinion is that the circumstances would have to be extraordinary for the decision to close an office to be changed. It is not much of a consultation, then, is it? It stresses the point that once a decision is made it is made.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.2/5">Who is doing the work to ensure that there is a rural provision and that the three-mile rule is kept to? Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have been asked to give their opinions by e-mail&mdash;an interesting statement on Royal Mail's confidence in its own network&mdash;but who will be carrying out that co-ordination? It affects the universal service obligation, because if we do not have sub-post offices, we will not have a universal service. I accept that some areas are already without post offices, and we are told that is possible to put new post offices back in place where the need is not being met. That is an interesting point on which we need to dwell.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.2/6">An interesting aside that presents a dilemma is that in one respect the universal service obligation works like osmosis&mdash;it is there because it has always been there and we assume that it will continue. With zonal pricing and the potential loss of sub-post offices, that must not be taken for granted.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.2/7">Royal Mail cannot have it both ways. There is an incident at the moment in my constituency, where a post office might change hands for all sorts of reasons. It is a good post office and has a future, and I imagine that it will be maintained. Royal Mail wants to micromanage it, and the sticking point is that it wants to set the opening hours. It is not about whether it opens on a Wednesday or a Thursday; it is about whether it is open at lunchtime, even though the whole town shuts at lunchtime. That may be quaint, but in some rural areas people might have something of a siesta. It has been demanded that that post office should open through the siesta, which is not a good example of localism. On one hand Royal Mail is trying to micromanage the post office, but on the other it is trying to lose its responsibilities and say &quot;It's nothing to do with us, guv, it is to do with the market, and ifthe marketplace doesn't allow the universal service obligation to operate, we want to lose our responsibility.&quot; It is not fair to put the decision just in the hands of Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.2/8">I hope that the Minister will at least consider&mdash;I shall put it no more strongly&mdash;whether, as was implied in the passing of the 2000 Act, other major national carriers, not just companies delivering the odd piece of post here and there, should, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> mentioned, pay a levy to ensure that the key part of that Act is being adhered to. Otherwise, the universal service obligation will be under attack and will one day just disappear.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-13a.274.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" speakername="Alan Reid" colnum="274"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070613/halltext/70613h0002.htm#07061380000462">
	<p pid="a.274.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Mr. Caton. I add my congratulations to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> on securing this debate on an item that is of particular importance to both our constituencies, particularly on the islands, and on the powerful case that he made against the proposals for zonal pricing and the problems that it will cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/2">One of the basic principles of Royal Mail has always been that whatever part of the country someone lives in, the cost of sending a letter to any other part of the country is exactly the same. That is an important principle for sustaining rural communities and the small businesses in them. The universal service obligation means that anyone in the UK can post letters and parcels to any other part of the country at the same rate, and it guarantees at least one delivery and one collection of mail throughout the country six days a week, excluding public holidays.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/3">However, I have concerns that the USO is slowly being chipped away at. My hon. Friend the Memberfor Orkney and Shetland mentioned the case of Parcelforce, which shows the danger of what can happen in an entirely free market, free from the safeguards of the USO. Parcelforce has dividedthe country into three zones. Zone 1 is the vast bulk of the country, zone 2 is the highlands and islands and zone 3 is Northern Ireland, the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Man. It costs far more to send a parcel from zone 1 to zone 2 or 3 than to send it to another part of zone 1. That means that some small parts of the country get a far worse service than the rest of the country. The pricing structure is complicated, but sending a parcel to the highlands and islands costs roughly double what it costs to send one anywhere else in the country. That is an indication of what would happen to postal services in the highlands and islands without the USO.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/4">There are, of course, private companies in the parcel delivery market, but Parcelforce is a big player and the rates that it sets are largely the charges that others have to compete with. Parcelforce charging more to deliver to the highlands and islands makes it easier for private parcel companies to do the same. Parcelforce is an unelected quango and has the important job of deciding what is and is not covered by the USO.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/5">We have heard from other speakers about the threat to the USO from Royal Mail's application to introduce zonal pricing for certain types of bulk mail, which is a large part of the postal market these days. That means that organisations such as utility companies and magazine delivery companies will be charged more for sending bills or magazines to customers in remote areas. The initial proposal from Royal Mail is to increase the charges by 4.8 per cent. for postage to what are called low-density areas, such as my constituency and, I suspect, those of most hon. Members who have spoken, compared with a 2 per cent. fall for sending to a high-density area. That would mean a price differential of about 7 per cent. between living in a remote rural area and in a large town or city. We all suspect that that is only the thin end of the wedge. If the principle is established that Royal Mail can charge more for deliveries to remote rural areas, we will all expect the differential to increase greatly. In its submission to Postcomm, Royal Mail claimed that it costs about 11 per cent. extra to deliver to a remote rural area, which is perhaps an indication of what we will be faced with if the proposals are accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/6">The proposals would clearly have an unfair impact on recipients of mail who live in remote rural areas. Although they would perhaps not be buying the stamps, it is quite obvious that utility companies, banks and magazine distributors are likely to increase their charges to those customers, as they will want to recover the charges. There would also be an unfair impact on companies that regularly send bulk mail to residents of rural areas. The most obvious example that springs to mind is publishers of farming magazines. There would also be an impact on councils in rural areas, because when they sent rent or council tax notices they would have to pay more than they currently do or than a council in a big city would have to. I hope that Postcomm will reject Royal Mail's application, mainly because it would impact unfairly on people living in rural areas but also because it would mean costs to big organisations such as utility companies and banks, as they would have to change their computer systems to be able to cope with the extra cost of mailing customers in remote areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/7">Another example of Postcomm not properly protecting the USO is the 15-minute rule, which it has allowed Royal Mail to introduce from <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July</phrase> this year. It will extend the current 15-minute exclusion rule, which until now has applied only to individual premises accessed by a private track to which it would take the postman more than 15 minutes to carry out a round trip. The rule applies mainly to a single house at the end of a private track. Royal Mail has applied to Postcomm to extend that exception from a single house to a group of houses, and Postcomm has accepted the application.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/8">I shall quote from Postcomm's decision document and direction, &quot;Policy Review of Exceptions to Royal Mail's Universal Delivery Service&quot;, which was published in April. Ruling 11(c) introduces a new long-term exception in the case of</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/9" class="indent">&quot;the need to make round trips to premises over private roads or tracks (whether or not they are the subject of public rights of way) which are in poor condition (but not in such poor condition as to preclude delivery on health and safety grounds) in excess of 15 minutes...by a vehicle driven in a safe manner, or...by foot if access by vehicle is not reasonably practical.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/10">Whereas I would be perfectly happy to accept an exclusion on health and safety grounds, I find it impossible to accept Postcomm's decision. It has allowed Royal Mail to exclude a group of houses, even if it is safe to deliver to them, simply because it would take more than 15 minutes to carry out the delivery. That is simply a cost-cutting exercise and has nothing to do with health and safety. It chips away at the principle of the USO. The highlands and islands are full of badly maintained tracks, so the exclusion will deprive many of my constituents of their daily deliveries.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/11">All is not doom and gloom, however. There is at least one piece of good news. At Postcomm's insistence, Royal Mail agreed to review its recent decision to bring forward collection times in rural areas. When Royal Mail introduced earlier collection times, the only collection of mail in some rural areas was as early as9 am, which is ridiculously early. That means, for example, that the mail in many rural areas is collected before that day's mail is delivered, thus depriving people of the ability to reply to mail the same day that they receive it.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/12">However, rather than reliance on Royal Mail's review, there should be safeguards in the USO. As well as specifying at least one collection and one delivery each day, it should specify the time of the last, or only, collection and the latest time for the daily delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/13">Nearly every hon. Member who has spoken this morning has said that, as it is seven years since the passing of the Postal Services Act 2000, it is time that the Government reviewed its operation. I certainly endorse that view. It is obvious that if we do nothing, Royal Mail will gradually lose more and more of the profitable business to private operators, leaving it largely responsible for delivering mail to remote communities. Obviously, that is the more expensive part of the business.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/14">A review is needed to create a more level playing field for Royal Mail and the private operators, otherwise the USO will be chipped away by Postcomm decisions and the gradually increasing cost of a stamp. I echo the suggestion that has been made by other hon. Members that a levy should be placed on major bulk carriers that do not fulfil the terms of the USO, and that the proceeds from it should be used to pay Royal Mail for the extra cost that it incurs in fulfilling the USO. That is the only way to create a level playing field. Clearly, a situation in which we simply allow the private sector to cherry-pick the lucrative parts of the market and leave Royal Mail with the USO would be unsustainable. A levy would create a level playing field.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/15">We will be heading for a serious situation if steps are not taken now, so I hope that, in his winding-up speech, the Minister will respond favourably to the calls for a review and for imposing a levy on large-scale private operators.</p>

	<p pid="a.279.1/1">I would welcome that information from the Minister, because when we were debating the 2000 Act, there was concern that it had not been put on the statute book. Will the Minister say whether Postcomm has the power to go down the levy route without legislation? That would provide a chance to put a safety net in place. Will he also update us on his view of EU competition and what rival providers in the rest of the EU are doing to implement competition in the market to which Royal Mail should be allowed access? Will he inform us when the review of the Postal Services Act 2000 will take place, as mentioned in the manifesto? Finally, the changes are taking place when Postwatch is going through a major upheaval underthe Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Bill. Will the Minister say how scrutiny will be maintained in the consumer interest during the transition?</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/2">I repeat: the regulator said that the USO is an asset. If it is an asset, we should not allow it to be chipped away, but should consider how it can be maintained and conserved. The Government must ensure that Royal Mail serves all consumers across the UK; not just the easy consumers. The Government will not be forgiven if they allow such a valuable asset to be lost.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.0/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Caton. I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> on securing the debate and by expressing my appreciation to all hon. Members who have contributed to this interesting and useful discussion. The hon. Gentleman spelled out clearly and fully his concerns about the future of the universal service obligation. I hope to be able to address the specific points raised by him and other colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/2">Let me start by making it clear that the Government consider the maintenance of a universal postal service to be of the highest importance. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there are no plans to abandon the universal postal service obligation, which is an obligation under EU law. The Postal Services Act 2000 reflects that and requires the universal service to be provided at an affordable, uniform tariff throughout the UK. The Government have no plans to change that requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/3">As well as enshrining the obligation in primary legislation in the Postal Services Act, we established Postcomm as an independent regulator and gave it statutory duties under the Act, with the primary duty of ensuring the provision of a universal postal service at an affordable, uniform tariff. Postcomm ensured that the obligation was written into Royal Mail's licence as the universal service provider.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/4">The universal service is written into law as well. Section 4(1) of the 2000 Act guarantees a delivery every working day to homes across the UK, a collection every working day from access points throughout the UK and a uniform and affordable price for posting a standard letter. Postcomm has taken the lead among Europe's national postal regulators by initiating a thorough public consultation on what services should be enshrined as &quot;universal services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/5">In June 2004, following a year-long review, Postcomm listed five areas of service offered by Royal Mail that the company will be required to provide as universal postal services at an affordable flat rate. They are Royal Mail's first and second class services, Royal Mail's standard parcel service, a registered and insured service, a range of support services to ensure the safety and integrity of the mail, and an international mail service.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/6">Postcomm is responsible for defining the scope of the universal service and may choose periodically to revisit it. Although there will be exceptions, they can be allowed only in specific and restricted circumstances. The 2000 Act is clear on that by asserting that the universal service is provided</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/7" class="indent">&quot;except in such geographical conditions or other circumstances as the Commission considers to be exceptional&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/8">Following a wide-ranging consultation, Postcomm published a policy statement in January 2003 in which it explained the circumstances under which Royal Mail could be exempted from its licence requirement to deliver letters to all homes or premises every working day. Long-term exceptions can be justified only, for example, in cases where there is a risk to the health and safety of Royal Mail staff, or in cases of geographical remoteness, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" name="Alan Reid">the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid)</phrase> referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/9">The reasons for building that exception into the Act are clear. It is recognised that there are some circumstances in which it might be impractical to deliver and collect mail on a daily basis. The responsibility for determining those circumstances rests with the postal regulator, Postcomm. Consequently, Royal Mail requires authorisation from the regulator on exceptions. In such cases, there is a formal process involving four stages of assessment and scrutiny, under which any proposed exemption is carefully examined by Postcomm, together with the Consumer Council for Postal Services&mdash;Postwatch. Postcomm's exceptions policy is designed to ensure that the number of homes or premises excepted from delivery every workingday is kept to a minimum. I understand that just over 2,800 of the 27.5 million addresses in the UK are exempted from the universal obligation.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/10">Postcomm fully opened the UK postal market to competition in January 2006. It is now developing a strategic review on how postal regulation should develop in the medium to long term. Specifically, Postcomm is addressing three fundamental questions: first, how the postal market might develop over the next five to 10 years; secondly, what postal users will need from the universal service and how that will be best provided; and, thirdly, what is the best long-term framework for promoting effective competition and deregulation. Following an initial consultation in 2006, Postcomm is expected to bring forward proposals later this summer. It is important that all those with an interest in postal services make their views known. Given the comments that have been made in the debate, I am sure that all hon. Members who have contributed are waiting for those proposals so that they can respond to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/11">A number of hon. Members mentioned the levy. The Government have not said anything specific about the levy, but the 2000 Act allows Postcomm to put a levy on other operators to fund the USO, if that is necessary. Several hon. Members, including my hon. Friends the Members for Selby (Mr. Grogan) and for Stroud (Mr. Drew), raised the issue of &quot;pay or play&quot;, which is contained in the proposal for the third postal services directive. The UK strongly supports the option for USO funding. To respond to hon. Members' questions, it is possible to raise a levy, if necessary, because Postcomm's primary responsibility under the 2000 Act is to sustain the universal service obligation, and a levy would certainly be one way of doing that, via licensing obligations. I understand that the third postal services directive has been agreed and that it is expected to be introduced some time in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/12">Let me respond to the question about conducting a review of the working of the 2000 Act, which was set out in our manifesto. The Government's view is that that will not be appropriate until the strategic review has concluded, but that it might be appropriate after that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/13">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland raised the issue of zonal pricing, as did virtually every other hon. Member who contributed to the debate. It is clear that Royal Mail is interested in charging bulk mail companies for the delivery of mail on a zonal basis, given that different delivery footprints, as they are known, have different costs, according to the geography and population density of the delivery area. There is, however, a critical consideration to bear in mind on zonal pricing. Even if it is ultimately agreed by the regulator, it will apply only to bulk mail products on which prices are negotiated commercially by Royal Mail. Zonal pricing will not extend to universal services. There is no question of the consumer being charged different prices for single-piece letters deposited in letter boxes simply because they are addressed to different destinations in the UK. As we know, international mail is different because prices vary according to the overseas destination.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.1/1">I do not have the figure that the hon. Gentleman requests to hand. It might be handed to me in a moment, but if it is not, I will write to him and other hon. Members who have contributed to this debate. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I am advised that bulk mail constitutes about 85 per cent., which is a significant element of the market, as he suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">The hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase>, among others, asked about the differential market in the EU. It is important to remember that we liberalised the market in the UK for consumer benefit, not to secure reciprocal access. Postcomm takes those elements into account when considering what Royal Mail can and cannot do in its overall businessand when setting its price controls, which are to be reviewed later this year. According to Postcomm's figures, 18 months after the liberalisation of the market in 2006, the effect of competition is that Royal Mail still has 96 per cent. of the market. The suggestion that Royal Mail has been decimated by its competitors therefore does not really stand up.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/3">The Government consider the universal service tobe of the highest importance. We have tasked the regulator with the duty to protect the provision of the universal postal service. It is not for the Government to become involved in decisions on deliveries to specific areas because that is rightly the responsibility of Postcomm. Postcomm has put in place a robust process for examining any proposed exceptions on the basis of established criteria. It also undertakes public consultations from time to time so that all postal service stakeholders may make known their views on whether the universal service meets consumer needs,or whether it should be modified. It is right that it should do so. As consumer needs and the wider communications market evolve, it is in all our interests that the universal service evolves with them. That is the best way of ensuring that mail services have a sustainable future.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/4">I was asked about the consultation exercise on the Post Office restructuring programme. There will be considerable advance planning among Post Office Ltd, Postwatch and local authorities before proposals come forward, so they will be quite refined before the six-week consultation period.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.1/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Prime Minister established a Cabinet Sub-Committee&mdash;the Post Office Network Committee, or MISC 33, as it is called&mdash;to review Post Office Ltd. It has created a framework for all the main Departments to discuss Royal Mail Group and Post Office Ltd and the services that they provide. We have thus reinforced the Government's awareness of the importance of the services provided by Royal Mail and the Post Office. Notwithstanding the fact that Departments have a responsibility to the taxpayer to ensure that they get the best possible value for money from services, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the&pound;1.7 billion that we are committing to Post Office Ltd and the &pound;3.5 billion that we have committed overall to Royal Mail Group demonstrate the Government's full commitment to both the universal service obligation and the post office network. We are determined to ensure that that is in the best possible position and that it has a secure financial footing.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.0/1">Let us remember why this document is so important. It is the first full draft of the dossier&mdash;a dossier that was instrumental in convincing this country to go to war. The first full draft should, in my view, be made public, but my view is perhaps less important than that of the Information Commissioner, who has already adjudicated on the matter and believes that it is in the public interest to make the document available to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/2">In answer to my parliamentary questions, the Foreign Secretary talked on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-23">23 April 2007</phrase> at column 914W of <i>Hansard </i>about &quot;prejudicing national security&quot;, but those concerns about national security hardly make sense, as the John Williams document was a draft document intended for publication&mdash;that was its purpose&mdash;and previous and subsequent drafts have already been made public.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/3">Certainly the importance of the document was downplayed by the Government during the Hutton inquiry. During his evidence session, Alastair Campbell was asked very straightforwardly:</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Do you recall whether or not at 9<sup>(th)</sup> September there was a dossier?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/5">He answered: &quot;No, there was not.&quot; John Scarlett, in his evidence, acknowledged Williams's role in &quot;some additional drafting&quot;, but downplayed its significance. He said that Williams was working &quot;on his own initiative&quot;. However, when circulating his own draft in September 2002, Scarlett referred to</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/6" class="indent">&quot;considerable help from John Williams&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/7">We know, from new evidence from the Information Commissioner, that Williams's draft</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/8" class="indent">&quot;was requested by the Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/9">hence its importance. In his own evidence to the inquiry, John Williams failed to refer either to his draft document or to his presence at the drafting meeting on the afternoon of <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-09">9 September</phrase>. No wonder the Hutton inquiry did not focus on the Williams document and the report did not even mention it.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/10">I have recently been told in a letter from the Foreign Secretary that the Williams draft was indeed submitted to the Hutton inquiry on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-12">12 September 2003</phrase>. However, I have seen no evidence that its significance was appreciated, and it has not been made public on the inquiry's website. We do not even know that Lord Hutton was made aware of the authorship of the document and its place in the chronology of the dossier.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/11">The Minister will remember that at FCO questions recently I asked him about the Williams draft. He replied that Lord Hutton was given the opportunity to see the dossier because</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Both John Scarlett and John Williams referred to the draft dossier in their evidence sessions.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-05-01.1361"><i>Official Report</i>, 1 May 2007; Vol. 459, c. 1361</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/13">We now know that that is incorrect. Why did not the Minister&mdash;I believe him to be a very straightforward individual&mdash;simply confirm to me what the Foreign Secretary had stated in her letter? That long trail of smoke and mirrors in the downgrading of the importance of the John Williams draft is consistent with Government policy generally on downplaying the role of press officers in the drafting process.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/14">However, let us move on. What about the idea that the JIC was given an opportunity to approve or sign off the final dossier? Ultimately, Lord Hutton saw the sexing up of claims in the dossier as the legitimate redrafting of existing intelligence assessments because he believed that the JIC had the power to reject or endorse any suggestions that were made. It is important here to distinguish between the JIC, the JIC assessment staff&mdash;the secretariat&mdash;and the committee's chairman, John Scarlett. The dossier was always in the hands of Scarlett, whom Alastair Campbell commissioned to produce it, but I have seen no direct evidence that the JIC as a whole was asked to approve the dossier. The final draft was circulated among individual members for comment, but John Scarlett signed it off. Indeed, there is little evidence that the Committee even debated it. During the Hutton inquiry, Dr. Brian Jones of the Defence Intelligence Staff said:</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/15" class="indent">&quot;What was unusual or what did not follow the normal practice was that this was not a paper that was going through the process by which it was examined and argued over at a full meeting of the Joint Intelligence Committee&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/16">Essentially, the JIC was commenting on a document issued in the name of the Government, not the JIC. After all, the dossier included the words &quot;The Assessment of the British Government&quot; in its title and was written in the first person, with the JIC referred to in the third person. In addition, we know that Campbell tried to describe the dossier as</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/17" class="indent">&quot;the work of the JIC&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/18">but Scarlett would not allow it and insisted on the words</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/19" class="indent">&quot;based, in large part, on the work of the Joint Intelligence Committee&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/20">Had the dossier been written exclusively by the JIC, Scarlett could have had no objection to Campbell using the words that he had proposed. At the time, the grey area between the assessment of the Government and that of the intelligence community did not seem important. However, we now know that it was because the dossier upgraded or exaggerated assessments made by the JIC.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/21">In summary, our understanding of the Iraq dossier must now fundamentally change. The idea that we had was that spin doctors stood outside the drafting process, making suggestions that could be endorsed or rejected by the JIC as a whole. We now know that spin doctors were inside the process, drafting material and shaping decisions about content. The JIC appears not to have been given the opportunity to approve the final dossier. When we understand that, the scope for sexing up appears much greater. Let us briefly look at some examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/22">First, there is the notorious 45-minute claim. The claim appeared in the standing JIC assessments, but was not thought important enough to be included in the parallel draft dossiers of 5 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-09">9 September</phrase>. The Government have always stated that the 45-minute claim appeared in the first draft dossier, but we now know that that is in incorrect, courtesy of a recent letter to me by the Foreign Secretary. Even when the claim did appear, there was a significant change in the wording. According to the assessment:</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/23" class="indent">&quot;Intelligence...indicates that chemical and biological munitions could be with military units and ready for firing within 20-45 minutes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/24">The final dossier rendered that as:</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/25" class="indent">&quot;The Iraqi military are able to deploy these weapons within45 minutes&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/26">a much stronger statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/27">Secondly, let us take the changes that were made between the draft documents of 10 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-16">16 September</phrase>. In the first, the executive summary makes a clear division between one set of bullet points, which are described as judgments, and a second set, which represent what recent intelligence was said to indicate. In the later document, the two sets of bullet points were merged, and all the points that had previously been described as indications were upgraded to judgments. The Cabinet Office has been unable to identify the person who wrote the executive summary.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/28">Thirdly, there is the nuclear claim. It was claimed that if sanctions had been removed and Saddam Hussein had acquired fissile material from abroad, he could have produced a nuclear weapon within one to two years. The Prime Minister was careful not to attribute that claim directly to the JIC, and now we know why: the JIC assessment was significantly different, saying that it would take Saddam less than five years to produce a nuclear weapon. During the drafting process, that changed to &quot;at least two years&quot; and then, finally, to &quot;one to two years&quot;. Again, further new evidence shows that the Cabinet Office has been unable to substantiate that claim. Some weeks ago, I asked the Prime Minister on the Floor of the House to explain the justification for that timetable, but he was unable to answer. It appears to have been quite simply an exaggeration of the assessment provided by the intelligence experts.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/29">Those three examples are serious enough, but the dossier is littered with others. In many places, a phrase such as &quot;intelligence indicates&quot; was replaced with one such as &quot;intelligence confirms&quot;. Even the title of the dossier was changed at the last minute from &quot;Iraq's Programme For Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;to &quot;Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;&mdash;one suggesting that Iraq wanted WMD, the other implying that it already had them.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/30">The Hutton and Butler inquiries acknowledged those facts, but the role of spin doctors and the marginalisation of the JIC must now be re-examined. In the light of the new evidence, will the Minister answer the following questions? First, what is in the John Williams draft of <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-09">9 September</phrase> and why are we not allowed to see it? What are the Government hiding? Secondly, if the Williams draft was submitted to the Hutton inquiry, what form did it take? Was Lord Hutton fully informed of its authorship and the document's place in the chronology of the dossier? Why is there no evidence of it on the inquiry website? Thirdly, who were the members of the drafting group supporting John Scarlett, and who, in particular, wrote the executive summary? Fourthly, in what meaningful sense, if any, did the JIC approve the dossier? Surely it was John Scarlett, the chairman, acting independently of the committee and reporting back to Alastair Campbell, who signed off the dossier, not as a JIC document, as we have heard, but as the Government's assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.0/31">The case for addressing such concerns is overwhelming. On Monday, our future Prime Minister said that lessons should still be learned about the role of intelligence in presenting the case for military intervention. The Chancellor would not have said that if he believed that the Hutton and Butler inquiries had been exhaustive. British servicemen and Iraqi civilians are still dying in Iraq. The Prime Minister is leaving office this month, and the war is his legacy. We must never again go to war on a false premise, and the questions that I have put to the Minister must therefore be answered.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-13a.293.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" speakername="Kim Howells" colnum="293"  time="011:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070613/halltext/70613h0005.htm#07061380000487">
	<p pid="a.293.2/1">I will come to that in a moment if the hon. Gentleman will allow me. The sequence is important, and we need to get it absolutely right. He said that the war goes on and that men and women are still dying in Iraq. As a frequent visitor to Iraq, I know what the situation is like and I know the gravity of our military involvement. That is why it is important that we separate the conspiracy theories from the facts, so I will continue, if I may.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/2">The threat posed by Saddam's regime was real. It had waged a long and bloody war against Iran, occupied Kuwait and violently suppressed its own people&mdash;notably the Shi'a and Kurds. Saddam had used chemical weapons against Iran and his own people. The threat went further, into the international arena, where the regime's flagrant disregard for the numerous Security Council resolutions that followed the first Gulf war was a running sore for more than a decade. Saddam's serial flouting of international conventions and his determination to abuse programmes put in place to help the Iraqi people, such as the UN oil for food programme, not only added to the suffering of the Iraqi people but threatened to undermine international relations and the rule of law. We also had to take seriously the threat posed by Saddam's determination to develop weapons of mass destruction, coupled with his proven willingness to use them against other states and his own people.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/3">Through the UN's inspection regimes, intelligence gathering and subsequent examination of Iraqi archives, we now know a lot more about the extent of Iraq's nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programmes and Saddam's determination to maintain or resurrect them up to and beyond the inspection regime. Despite exhaustive attempts to establish the facts, not least by the Iraq survey group, it remains unclear exactly which of Iraq's WMD programmes were ended, or when. The fact that those programmes existed, and that Saddam had shown a readiness to use WMD, is beyond doubt. It was against that background that the Government's dossier on WMD was conceived. It was designed to help explain, within the limits of our knowledge at the time, the extent of the threat that Saddam's regime posed.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/4">As the hon. Gentleman has told us, concern about the dossier has centred on two issues: first, the accuracy of the intelligence that informed it, and secondly, the drafting process&mdash;specifically whether it was modified in its tone and content to have more public impact. Both of those issues were extensively covered by the four inquiries that have already been conducted on Iraq. All found that the Government had acted in good faith and that the assessment of Iraq's WMD presented in the September 2002 dossier was consistent with the Joint Intelligence Committee assessments on which it drew.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/5">The hon. Gentleman has claimed that he has new evidence, and I shall try to deal with that. The inquiries, however, also made important criticisms of the Government dossier. They found that key intelligence used in drafting the dossier had been &quot;unreliable&quot; and that some intelligence&mdash;particularly that relating to the claim that Iraq could deploy chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes&mdash;had been presented, as the hon. Gentleman has told us, without adequate context.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/6">Following the Butler review, the then Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" name="Jack Straw">the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase>, announced in a written statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-12">12 October 2004</phrase> the withdrawal of some of the intelligence that had formed the basis of the Government's dossier. The Government further accepted that by March 2003 it was unlikely that Iraq possessed actual stockpilesof WMD; and the Prime Minister accepted full responsibility for mistakes made with intelligence. Lord Butler's committee said that some of the intelligence included in the dossier should have been better validated. The Government accepted that, and the Secret Intelligence Service has taken steps to improve the validation of intelligence, as the 2006 annual report of the Intelligence and Security Committee acknowledged. The ISC annual report also noted that the Government have introduced measures to ensure greater awareness and understanding of the limitations of intelligence among Ministers and other senior officials, including a confidential guide covering the nature and use of intelligence circulated to readers of intelligence across Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/7">The inquiries confirmed that in drafting the dossier the Joint Intelligence Committee had not been subjected to political pressures; nor had its impartiality been compromised. That, I understand, is what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Yet some people continue to see conspiracies despite the work and findings of Lords Hutton and Butler, the Intelligence and Security Committee and the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>

	<p pid="a.295.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall try to answer his questions and the debate in my own way, and my own words. I am sure that he would not have taken a leaf out of the book of spin doctors, and tried to mouth what I am about to say. However, I will say this: first, he has said that Alastair Campbell commissioned the dossier, and I can tell him categorically that that is not true: the Prime Minister commissioned the dossier. I have no doubt that Alastair Campbell was involved in subsequent discussions with other civil servants about the dossier&mdash;I should be surprised if that did not happen&mdash;but the Prime Minister commissioned it. That is the first assertion that must be nailed.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/2">Secondly, it is claimed that the first draft of the of the Government's dossier was produced not by intelligence officers in the Joint Intelligence Committee but by press officers. That is essentially what the hon. Gentleman is saying, and it is simply not true. As I have said, John Scarlett and the Joint Intelligence Committee were commissioned by the Prime Minister to produce the Government dossier and they led throughout in drafting and finalising it. What Mr. Williams did, on his own initiative, immediately after hearing the Prime Minister call for such a document in a speech made on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-03">3 September</phrase>, was to produce a version of his own over the weekend of6 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-07">7 September</phrase>. By the time that Mr. Williams produced it, it was already redundant, because Sir John Scarlett had in the meantime been asked by the Prime Minister to produce a dossier. That is what he set about doing. As I said earlier, John Scarlett and the JIC produced what became the Government dossier. It was not based on the Williams draft. Again, as I said earlier, I can also categorically assure the House that Williams made no reference in his draft to the issue of WMD being deployed within 45 minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/3">The hon. Gentleman also suggested that there is no evidence that the document was provided to Lord Hutton's inquiry. As I told the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-01">1 May</phrase>, Lord Hutton had access to all documents that he wished to see, including the Williams draft. That document was provided to Lord Hutton's team on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-12">12 September 2003</phrase>. It did not appear among the documents that Lord Hutton chose to make public on the inquiry's website, but that was Lord Hutton's decision. Next, the Government are asked why, if they have nothing to hide, they should refuse to release the draft in response to a freedom of information request. That is a very fair question, and it is currently the subject of an appealto the information tribunal over the Information Commissioner's ruling that the document should be released. I am therefore somewhat constrained in what I can say.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/4">I will, however, say that an important principle at stake: it is vital that we provide thinking space for officials and others who routinely draft policy documents. They should not feel constrained in presenting new or challenging ideas because they fear that they will be made public. That is specifically recognised in the Freedom of Information Act 2000. I can understand that the hon. Gentleman would press hard on the question, which is at the heart of his case. However, when I intervened on him he said that the document was of such importance that it should be published, which implies that judgments must be made about what things it is important, very important or vital to release. He is making that judgment without having seen the document. This is a matter that has never been easy for any Government. It is very difficult to decide whether the release of a document may in the future prevent the radical thinking that is sometimes needed to take policy forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.297.1/1">I welcome the chance to have this debate on a very important matter under your chairmanship, Mr. Caton. It is the first time that I have had such an opportunity and I am sure that it is the start of a long relationship.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/2">This is our first good opportunity to catch up and have a discussion with the Minister since Remploy's announcement and the Secretary of State's statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">22 May</phrase>. I missed the statement because I was in Washington with the Treasury Committee, but a fair number of hon. Members participated in the proceedings. The seriousness of the statement and the announcement was demonstrated to everyone. A description of the announcement as devastating to the people involved would be universally accepted as accurate. On the day, the closures were shamefully applauded by a handful of mainly Government-financed organisations, but for the people affected by the decisions, the announcement was traumatic, although it represented the end of a long period of uncertainty and trauma for many of the people in the factories.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/3">The announcement means that 43 factories will close. Some 32 of the closures are straightforward, whereas 11 involve mergers. Having read the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, I have the suspicion that more closures are to come, because the figures demonstrated that a number of factories&mdash;the number was in double figures&mdash;would close before 2009. Unless the Minister is able to indicate otherwise, it sadly appears that the ground is being prepared for closing a further group of factories, give that the accountants' figures demonstrate the case for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/4">Some 2,500 people are affected by this situationand by redundancies, voluntary redundancies, early retirement, and forced&mdash;perhaps I should say agreed&mdash;employment moves, whereby people are moved out of the factories and into mainstream employment. I do not argue that that is being done with good financial support and pension arrangements in place, but it remains the case that the situation faced by a number of the people involved is not one that they would have chosen.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/5">All this is happening to some of the most vulnerable people in our communities. Those with learning difficulties and mental health problems are among the most prominent of the casualties. People in the factories are often working for the first time in their lives. They are finding self-respect, self-confidence, friendship, dignity and focus in their lives, but they face uncertainty. I genuinely fear that people with the most complex cases will return to their former living in four walls, where they have no friends, no communication, nowhere to go, no one to speak to, no one to care, and no one to share experiences with.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/6">I understand that those who move into mainstream employment are promised support. My next point is not a dig at the Minister, or the Department for Work and Pensions, but an empirical observation based on the support that was promised to youngsters in special schools. Such people are probably a younger version of the people whom I was just discussing. The minute the youngster moved out of a special school or a school was closed, the support generally disappeared. The speed with which that happened to youngsters in the mainstream was frightening and totally unacceptable. I believe that Ronald Reagan said that the worst words he ever heard were a Government official saying, &quot;I have come to help you.&quot; Therefore, when any Government promise support, one should always bank the cheque as quickly as possible, because it is often not long lasting.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/7">Given all that, we are working on the basis that the unions and staff are taking steps to ratify industrial action. I hope that such action will not be necessary because I take it as read, with a qualification that I shall discuss later, that there will be dialogue on these matters. The Secretary of State has promised as much, and I am sure that the Minister will do so again now. Having said that, I fear that the consultation could be a section 90 consultation&mdash;I think that that is the term used. Such a situation occurs when a factory is been closed due to redundancy and consultation is confined to redundancy terms and the like, instead of being a real dialogue among the employees, the relevant Department and concerned Members to find out whether there is a different way forward. If the dialogue is about only how we place these individuals, or if it is about how to finesse the closure of43 factories, I will find it unacceptable. I hope that the Minister will indicate that such a situation will not occur.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.1/1">I totally agree. I recently met Ian Hunter, the regional manager of my jobcentre. I can tell the Minister that he is excellent, but she should leave him in Yorkshire. I have the names of five constituents whom I have encountered in one way or another and are all unemployed. Some are the wrong colour andso, despite having degrees, they are, incredibly, unemployed. Others have mild special needs or learning difficulties. I was at a loss to understand that, and thought that I should ask the manager to account for it. I am sending him the five names because I do not know why Jobcentre Plus cannot employ those people. There is clearly a problem. I totally agree with the right hon. Gentleman.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-13a.302.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" speakername="George Mudie" colnum="302"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070613/halltext/70613h0006.htm#07061380000500">
	<p pid="a.302.1/1">When I was a young Labour party member growing up in my hon. Friend's constituency, I had visions of perhaps being the Member of Parliament for that constituency, but I am glad that I moved because the quality of its Member is so great that I could never have matched it. I totally agree with my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/2">We do not want the status quo. There needs to be a change in the set-up&mdash;the operation is demanding change&mdash;but we want thoughtful, sensitive action, rather than the butchery suggested by Remploy.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/3">On the financial argument, the trade unions and staff have worked earnestly over the past 18 months&mdash;many hon. Members have met them, seen their work and know of the time that they have put in&mdash;to agree plans to improve trading and output, and to cut costs. They even employed a firm of accountants to help them to draw up acceptable suggestions to help Remploy's finances. Their reward was that their suggestions were ignored or scoffed at by senior management.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/4">Why has that happened? The Minister has been genuinely supportive, open-minded and helpful. She gave Remploy a blank sheet of paper and told it to drop its plans and to return with other plans that she would ensure would be considered. However, that attitude did not percolate down to senior management. Perhaps that was because the unions were a little too blunt about the shortcomings of a management that seemed to accept the fall-off of manufacturing in the general economy as a cover for its inability to obtain work for various factories, or perhaps it was because the unions pointed to unnecessary spending by the management on the plant and at a personal level. Perhaps the unions were just too honest and blunt.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/5">I have been in public life as a councillor&mdash;I wasa council leader&mdash;and Member of Parliament for30 years, but Remploy's management has never approached me for help with procurement decisions. I wonder whether that is the experience of other hon. Members. Remploy has never asked me to lobby or speak to anyone. It would have been entirely reasonable for it to do so, but it has never approached me in30 years, so I wonder how dynamic its management is and how interested it is in finding work for the people in its factories. Why are the unions being treated in such a shabby fashion when they are trying to be as constructive as possible about the agency's financial problems?</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/6">The most important aspect of a refusal to accept the status quo is throughput, which must be discussed. At the moment, and for the past 60 years, a job with Remploy has been a job for life. Mild attempts might have been made to try to persuade an employee to consider a job in the mainstream economy, but as of now&mdash;I checked with my local factory today&mdash;the decision is left to the individual. In effect, that means that Remploy is seen as a destination. It is thought that once someone works there, no one is anxious for them to move on and that no one's purpose in life is to see employees move out of the factory and into mainstream life. The decision is left to employees. If they wish to stay, they stay.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/7">Modern thinking, which I accept, is that Remploy should be a gateway, rather than a destination or a stopping point. There is a place in modern society for a gateway, whether that is a sheltered workshop or a skill centre, that allows employees to build their confidence and self-esteem so that they believe that they can make a go of taking their place in society. Some of the people have never worked before in their lives and have had the most traumatic experiences. Their self-esteem is low and their self-confidence is non-existent. Their confidence should be built up, and they should then move on.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/8">Modern thinking is that there should be a gateway establishment, whether in factories or appropriate skill centres&mdash;perhaps with a relationship with a further education college&mdash;to which people could go with the knowledge that their job was not permanent. They should be assessed and given a time scale should be negotiated for how long they will stay there to acquire the necessary skills to build up their confidence. However, the people in the building and DWP partners would be responsible for guaranteeing to find those people a job before they left the establishment and for supporting them during the first few months in their new jobs. That would be a relevant change.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/9">The trade unions have made some interesting suggestions about money, and even the Government have said that money is a secondary consideration. Is it fair to keep people in a workshop and an artificial situation? Should not we build up their confidence and set them free with suitable support? Remploy factories should not be a destination at which people stay. However, if people have gone through a bad time and, for the first time in their life, they have mates and a wage packet, feel that they are contributing and have self-respect, they would have to be very brave to risk all that by going to find a job. They know what failure is because they have been through that. It is asking a lot to expect people to do that, unless the aim is set out.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/10">We must face up to the fact that some people will never be able to move and take the necessary steps to address that. However, Remploy should be a temporary gateway for the majority of people. Disabled people could come in and be out in three months. Other people with complex problems might take a year, but everyone should know that the objective would be for those people to move into a position in which they have the same rights as the rest of us.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-13a.308.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="308"  time="015:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070613/halltext/70613h0007.htm#07061380000505">
	<p pid="a.308.0/1">I apologise to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> for being late for the debate, as I had a difficult journey.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/2">More than 25 years ago, I was the TUC representative on a committee called CORAD&mdash;the Committee on Restrictions against Disabled People. It was the first committee that the Government established to look at discrimination against people with disabilities to see how we might move forward. Hon. Members may remember that we had a quota at that time, under which companies and Departments were required to employ a certain percentage of people with disabilities, but none of them&mdash;even Departments&mdash;did. The committee therefore looked again at the issue and said that we needed to get people with disabilities into work. To do that, we recommended that those responsible should support people with disabilities by identifying opportunities, providing training and supporting people in work, as well as resourcing employers to enable such things to happen. To assist in that, the committee recommended that disability discrimination legislation be introduced, and both those recommendations have now been implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/3">The third recommendation was that there should be continuing support by way of specialist provision. Remploy, founded by George Tomlinson, the predecessor of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase>, was a good example of that. Remploy's role, along with other organisations, was to bring people into the working environment again, give them support and, if possible, allow that to be a transitional phase in moving towards employment, but if necessary, to give them an environment in which permanent employment would be provided. To be frank, I do not think that things have changed. I have heard about the economy booming; it has for some, but not for others. Employment has risen, but the report that has been published extensively in the press today shows that unemployment has risen too in some areas, and particularly in certain regions. Unemployment overall is not as low as many people think. The experiences of people with disabilities have, tragically, barely changed, despite the Government's efforts over the past 10 years, for which I commend them. This is a hard nut to crack.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/4">There are some tendencies in the economy that fly in the opposite direction, such as, I am afraid, outsourcing by Government. The example in my areais Ministry of Defence records, where there were150 people, several of them with disabilities; it was then privatised and relocated off site. Not one person witha disability was redeployed elsewhere, despite allour promises. Another example is private equity operations, which we discussed in Parliament recently. We now have evidence that when private equity companies have taken over companies and shareholdings within them, there have been reduced employment opportunities. The GMB reports that in the case of the Automobile Association people with disabilities have been specifically targeted to get them off the books. The issues are as relevant today as they were 25 years ago, and in some ways more pertinent.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/5">That is why I believe that before we do anything to reduce capacity in this field, we need to be convinced that the jobs are out there and the support mechanisms are in place, and that we are succeeding. I follow my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East in recognising the reality. We shall always have to subsidise the people in question, to enable them to have a decent quality of life. It is not just a matter of employment. As my hon. Friend said, it is a question of pride and respect and being part of overall society. I can understand where the Government are coming from in considering how to modernise provision overall. In areas such as this hard decisions must often be made; that is true in any management change. However, it is necessary to take people along, and we have failed to do that. It is not for want of trying; I am not criticising anyone. Nevertheless, we have failed to take people with us, and we should recognise that. We almost need to start again and to involve people in a wider discussion, particularly at the micro-level&mdash;individual factories and communities. The issues seem to have been dealt with at a macro-level, where we know there has been a lack of confidence in the management's track record for some time. It is a question simply not only of confidence, either, but of the relevant management teams' objective record of success and failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/6">I urge the Minister to stand back, have a breathing space and allow us the next six months to bring the unions back in and consult all the relevant organisations again, and see whether we can build up confidence in a shared way forward. I know that that is ambitious and it may not be realistic, but at the moment we cannot continue with horns locked, while people become disillusioned and feel that we are undermining provision rather than supporting it in the long term. I support other hon. Members in urging the Minister to be positive and accept that we need a new route to bring people back together again. A six-month timetable will enable us to return with real solutions to enable us to bring everyone with us as best we can. If that means that additional resources will be needed, this is one area of Government in which I would expect resources to be found.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-13a.313.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1859" speakername="Jeremy Hunt" colnum="313"  time="015:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070613/halltext/70613h0008.htm#07061380000510">
	<p pid="a.313.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> on securing this incredibly important debate and on the passionate and eloquent way in which he put the case for the 2,270 disabled Remploy employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/2">Listening to the varied but thoughtful tone of the contributions, I realised that there are two distinct issues that we should recognise. The first is the move towards inclusive employment, which is a significant change. Listening to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase> talking about the battles that he fought under the previous Conservative Government also reminded me of the Andrew Marr series that is currently on television. I do not know whether hon. Members saw the episode last night, but it had a scene about the miners' strike. That reminded me how much the country has changed, although I do not want to get into that debate, because I am somewhat outnumbered in the Chamber. Watching that programme also reminded me how much we have moved from being a manufacturing economy to being a service economy. That has good aspects and bad aspects, but for people with learning disabilities in particular, it can pose a problem, because jobs in manufacturing industries were often particularly well suited to people with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/3">I have visited a manufacturing business in Cardiff that is a social firm&mdash;an interesting new model that which should replace workshops. In a way, social firms are a modern version of the sheltered workshops that we used to have. The management at that business told me that people with learning disabilities had a competitive advantage over other employees when it came to certain types of tasks. The problem is that as we have moved away from being a manufacturing economy, a lot of those jobs have gone.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/4">However, there is a consensus that the move towards inclusive employment is important. If disabled people are to move not only towards independent living, self-respect and dignity and out of poverty, which affects too many of them, but towards a sense of being part of mainstream society, then we should encourage a model in which disabled people are employed wherever possible in jobs where they sit alongside non-disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/5">That is an important change, and I should like to do something that has not been done so far this afternoon: compliment Remploy on the way in which it has tried to adapt its business to take account of that change. Last year it placed 5,200 people in mainstream employment through the Interwork programme, which is a 25 per cent. increase on the year before. That is a lot of people who have been helped. Remploy has therefore been trying to adapt in a difficult competitive climate.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/6">I, too, want to leave the Minister time to respond fully to the points that have been raised. The problem that the Government face is that there is a limited budget, which means that we shall at some stage have to consider whether the &pound;5,000 that it costs to employ someone with a severe disability under the Workstep programme stacks up against the &pound;20,000 that it costs to employ someone in a Remploy workshop. We have to be honest about that terribly difficult dilemma because the Shaw Trust, for example, says that it has 600 disabled people waiting to get on the Workstep programme and that it cannot get funding for them. The trust desperately wants to get those people into employment. If I can put it this way, there is an opportunity cost to not using the resources as wisely as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/7">That said, the other clear strand to this debate has been the genuine and heartfelt concern, particularly among hon. Members in whose constituencies Remploy factories are scheduled for closure, aboutthe fate of the individuals who work in them. As the Secretary of State said in his statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">22 May</phrase>, the majority of those individuals have learning disabilities, and that group is the hardest to employ. The hon. Member for Leeds, East spoke of a 20 per cent. employment rate among those with learning disabilities and histories of mental illness, but according to a survey that Remploy did with Radar, the employment rate is even lower among those with learning disabilities only: it is 10 per cent. That group is the very hardest to employ.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/8">A second factor has to be added to that: many such people are older employees. In his statement, the Secretary of State said that 650 of the 2,270 employees&mdash;28 per cent. of the total&mdash;were over the age of 60. They may wish to take early retirement. However, we have not yet been able to find out how many of the employees are over 50, although I suspect that they make up about half the total. It will be particularly difficult to find another placement for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/9">People are concerned that it may be very difficult for someone who has worked loyally in a role for much of their life&mdash;someone who has found the inclusion, involvement and friendship that the hon. Member for Leeds, East mentioned&mdash;to find another job full stop, even with all the support provided by Remploy. We know that such people will be financially looked after because the terms and conditions will be preserved, but it would be a tragedy if those people, at that stage of their lives, ended up receiving the money but not all the other incredibly important benefits that come from being at work.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/10">The Minister could help us with some specific matters. One is the concern about pension entitlements. I believe that the Remploy pension fund has a &pound;48 million deficit. There are particular concerns about whether promises made about pensions will be secure, particularly given the current environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/11">There is also concern about how the factorieswere chosen for closure. Remploy factories in the constituencies of a lot of prominent Cabinet Ministers, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;and the Minister, I think&mdash;have not been chosen for closure. The real concern is that Remploy has not published the business case on the future that it saw for each of the factories under consideration. That makes people worry that that is the first step to the wholesale closure of the entire Remploy network. I am prepared to accept the Minister's assurances that she does not want that to happen. However, if we are to have confidence that that is not part of the plan, we need to see a good business case for the factories that are not threatened with closure to remain open.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.0/12">I am grateful to the Minister and the management of Remploy for keeping me in the picture on this difficult issue in the past few months. I recognise the benefits of the financial package offered to the 2,270 disabled employees. However, money is not the only issue; a lot of other factors are very important in those people's lives, and we are all seeking reassurance that those other factors will be adequately addressed in any restructuring.</p>

	<p pid="a.315.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Caton, in what has been a thoughtful and thought-provoking debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/2">At the outset, I want to put some things up front and on the record. We still believe in supported factories and that there needs to be a subsidy for some employed disabled workers, whether within supported factories or in the mainstream. We still believe that Remploy has a future, and I ask hon. Members to remember that Remploy is more than the factory network. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> said, Remploy is part of a wider family of provision. We are guaranteeingthe budget for Remploy over the next five years&mdash;&pound;555 million, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> said.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/3">I thank my hon. Friend for generating this debate and for some of the comments he made during it. We need to recognise that the issue that we are discussing is difficult. Colleagues from all political parties have made contributions. Other Members in the Chamber have not participated in the debate but have Remploy factories in their constituencies. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2003" name="Frank Roy">the Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Mr. Roy)</phrase>, for example, is a Government Whip and so is not allowed to participate, but I welcome his presence.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/4">When my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East was deputy Chief Whip, people would never dare say &quot;no&quot; to him or his colleague, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1730" name="Nick Brown">the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East and Wallsend (Mr. Brown)</phrase>. It was a case not of getting retaliation in first, but of not retaliating.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/5">We Members here today have a lot in common on this issue; we agree about a lot. I certainly welcome the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East on how he envisages Remploy's future in terms of providing, not a destination, but a gateway for disabled people. I also welcome his comment about wanting more disabled people in work, because that is exactly what underpins the modernisation programme. Neither the Secretary of State nor I have embarked lightly on this process; we appreciate the sensitivities involved. However, we know that our underlying ambition is shared with Remploy and its trade unions. We want to get more disabled people into work&mdash;and more disabled people want to move into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/6">We have to be clear that in its current configuration, Remploy is not going to rise to that challenge. That is why we brought in PricewaterhouseCoopers&mdash;not only, I say gently to my hon. Friend, as number crunchers. We also made sure that that consultancy included a senior employment adviser, who is disabled himself and who has extensive experience of disability employment issues. As part of the team, he was there to act as advocate in any disagreement on the disability-employment side. It was not just a case of number crunching.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/7">I turn to the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> about where we should start again. We can go round that issue as often as we like, but there comes a point when we have to make a decision. What we are discussing has not been sprung on the trade unions or hon. Members in the past few weeks. We have been talking about the modernisation of Remploy since May last year, when I laid a statement before the Commons that clearly stated that the Secretary of State and I had ruled out the two extreme options in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which were to do nothing or to close the whole factory network. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase> reminded us, that was once an option in the dim and distant past.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/8">Within that framework, we asked the Remploy board to consult, discuss and negotiate with their trade unions over that period to consider how we can reach a position on which we can all agree. Those discussions have taken place, a great deal of work has been done and the business has been opened for the trade unions to scrutinise over that period. Nothing has been hidden; it is all up front. We put the PricewaterhouseCoopers report into the public domain so that everybody shared the information, and we ensured that PricewaterhouseCoopers engaged meaningfully with the trade unions. However, to be frank, there comes a point when we need to consider making a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/9">Of course, we do not underestimate the difficulties that will be caused for individual people. I take on board the comments made by various hon. Members to the effect that the change is enormous for disabled workers who have worked in a factory for a long time. That is why we have built in a protection package, including the guarantee on final salary pensions. I am sure that when my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East was a trade union officer for the National Union of Public Employees and then for Unison, he would have been pleased if an employer had put that on the table as the first stage of the bargaining rather than having to have it pushed, shoved and dragged out of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/10">We did all that, and we also ensured that Remploy engaged with the trade unions. I want to be clear about that engagement. In order to ensure that Remploy knew the parameters, we promised to maintain the baseline funding. The work with the trade union consortium deserves particular mention, and I am sure that my hon. Friend, who has extensive experience as a trade union officer, will recognise the quality of the engagement. A joint Remploy-trade union working group was established to consider the challenges that face the company and to discuss possible solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/11">The group has met on no fewer than 10 occasions since last July, with the business on the table. In order to enable the trade unions to have the support on the detailed financial and commercial information provided by the company and the advice that they thought was necessary, Remploy provided them with the services of the consultants Grant Thornton. Remploy paid for the consultants to ensure that that the unions had the same professional advice as the board. It has provided the trade unions with other financial support, including covering the costs of all the meetings on modernisation. Indeed, as we speak,14 members of the consortium&mdash;16, in fact, but only14 are employed by Remploy&mdash;are in Brussels to discuss the issues with MEPs, which was paid for by the Remploy company.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.0/12">As a company, Remploy has been exemplary in the way in which it has managed the discussions with our trade union colleagues. I say our trade union colleagues because as a member of the GMB I recognise the sensitivity of the matter. When the new chairman, Ian Russell, was appointed, he held discussions with allthe trade union general secretaries involved in the consortium. He also invited the consortium to present its own modernisation proposals to the February and April Remploy board meetings. The engagement has been widespread, and I hope that my hon. Friend will take that in the positive spirit in which it was&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that he is only trying to josh me, but he knows from his experience that there are few situations where engagement with the trade unions at all levels took place throughout a lengthy process.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-13a.320.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" speakername="Graham Stringer" colnum="320"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070613/halltext/70613h0009.htm#07061380000515">
	<p pid="a.320.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity that this debate gives me to dispel some of the myths about asylum seekers that have been put about by the British National party and other racist organisations. The debate is unusual because, although the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">the Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase>, is on the Front Bench, it could as easily have been answered by the Minister for Immigration and Asylum. I wish to put on record my thanks to him for a number of meetings and the significant amount of correspondence that we have had on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/2">Before I come to the details of bus passes in north Manchester, which I suppose sounds like an esoteric subject but has become important, I should like to give a little background information to help hon. Members understand why I am so concerned. North Manchester and Higher Blackley, in my constituency, have had an exemplary record in race relations. Relations were good in the mid-1990s and before, and a large number of Kosovan refugees came and stayed there successfully as the war took place in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/3">The genesis of the increased problems that the BNP is trying to exploit was the decision by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" name="Jack Straw">the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase>, Home Secretary in the 1997 to 2001 Government, to disperse asylum seekers throughout the country. The dispersal went well in many areas, but not in north Manchester. We were promised that the asylum seekers who would be dispersed there would be from a small number of language clusters and serviced by a sufficient number of interpreters and extra resources in schools and education. To put it quite simply, they were not. There were no interpreters and the dispersed people spoke30 or 40 different languages between them, which made matters more difficult for the public authorities. Iranians were put in the same house in multiple occupation as Iraqis, which was a most extraordinary circumstance. People who had been paying rent to private landlords were thrown out of their houses because the Home Office, via the National Asylum Support Service, paid higher rents.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/4">The dispersal was a disaster and led to a number of racist attacks on asylum seekers, some of whom were hospitalised. After I spoke to my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn and Barbara Roche, whowas then a Minister of State at the Home Office, it was agreed that there would be a moratorium. That was publicly proclaimed. Since then, my right hon. Friend the noble Lord Rooker and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1849" name="Beverley Hughes">the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Beverley Hughes)</phrase>, when they were Home Office Ministers, have confirmed the moratorium on dispersal of asylum seekers. Race relations have improved and returned to their previous good state, with one exception. In 2005, just after the general election, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" name="Tony McNulty">the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty)</phrase>, when he was the responsible Minister&mdash;a lot of people have been in the job in the past five or six years&mdash;had to apologise because there was a small breach of the moratorium.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/5">Relations have generally improved but, as has happened throughout history when there have been waves of refugees and immigrants, the nasty bottom-feeding racists have exploited the situation and perpetuated myths and lies, some of which are still going around. That is really the point of the debate. Two of the myths, other than the one about bus passes, are worth referring to because they are so bizarre, but people repeat them anyway. One is that Oldham council, which is the neighbouring council to my constituency on one side, provides asylum seekers with cheques for second-hand cars. If I have heard that once, I have heard it ten times. It is unusual and ridiculous, but it creates resentment if some people are gullible enough to believe it. The second myth repeated by many people was that a shop on Kenyon lane in my constituency was open only to black people. They said that there was a sign there saying that white people were not allowed. Local councillors investigated and spoke to the shopkeeper, who said, &quot;Look, 60 to 70 per cent. of my customers are white. That is the reflection of this area. This is absurd.&quot; But still the myth was repeated.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/6">That brings me to the persistent myth that asylum seekers are given free bus passes to travel all over Greater Manchester which are not available to other members of the public. When I go to public meetings, talk to people in the streets or go to street meetings, often towards the end I am asked, &quot;Why are the asylum seekers getting better treatment than we are on public transport? It's not fair.&quot; A number of local councillors in the area have heard the same myths and, with me, have investigated the cause of the misconception. Councillor Risby, the long-standing councillor for Moston, Councillor Murphy, Councillor Cooper, Councillor Curley and Councillor Hackett have all helped to get to the bottom of what turns out to be quite a complicated story, which is worth relating and putting on record.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/7">I wrote to the passenger transport executive, as did Councillor Risby. We got back a reasonable letter saying that there were no special passes available to asylum seekers, but the myth persisted. A little later, we found out that the Home Office was purchasing for asylum seekers about &pound;53,000-worth a year of passes called system one scratchcards, which were not available in that form to the general public. Day saver tickets are the equivalent, cost the same and can be purchased on buses by members of the public, but the scratchcards are mostly bought by companies that want to give them to their employees, who can scratch the dates off and use them. Although there was no preferential treatment for asylum seekers, people had seen different passes on the buses.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/8">I had a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February</phrase> with my hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration and Asylum, who wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March</phrase> having exchanged information with the passenger transport executive. He explained the Home Office's basis for purchasing the passes. It is worth my reading a couple of paragraphs of his letter. The letter explains how the passes are funded:</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The terms of the travel expenses policy were previously agreed by my predecessors and a rollout schedule was produced for the implementation of RepARC and travel expenses to begin on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-10">10 October 2005</phrase> in Manchester and Liverpool. The travelling expenses policy is in the public domain and the terms of it are published on the IND website. Travel expenses are now available for supported asylum seekers requiring travel to each of our12 Reporting Centres: four in London and a further eight across the rest of the country at Solihull, Kent, Liverpool, North Shields, Glasgow, Leeds, Loughborough and Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/10" class="indent">Travel expenses are provided in the form of travel tickets made valid for the applicant's next reporting event. My predecessors considered a range of payment options which included the chartering of buses for those living outside the specified distance (this would have required considerable organisation in each location, empty buses still to be paid for and the arrival of large groups likely to diminish the efficiency of the reporting location) and payment in cash on production of receipts for the journey (cash would have to be held in all reporting locations to which people report, requiring secure handling, storage and accounting processes in every operational location). The chosen option was to obtain tickets from local Passenger Transport Executives and issue them to applicants for their next reporting event. This was considered as the most effective avoiding waste and the risks of cash handling whilst still encouraging compliance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/11">The letter makes it clear that an asylum seeker who lives more than three miles away from the reporting centre gets a card that they can use on the day that they have to report to the centre. That is the travel assistance that they get. It is not preferential treatment for asylum seekers but the Home Office being as efficient and effective with its money and its policies as it possibly can be.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/12">Because the myths were persisting, local councillors and I wondered whether there was some sort of scam going on at the same time. I wrote to the PTE, and it agreed to investigate what was happening. It reported its findings in a letter to Councillor Risby on<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-15">15 November 2006</phrase>. It found that about 2 per cent. of activity on the buses was fraudulent&mdash;activity such as people sneaking past the bus driver, people not paying for a ticket, other people using the wrong ticket. A relatively small amount of money was involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/13">That investigation took place before it was known that the Home Office was using a scheme that was, in principle, the same as the scheme that is available to the general public but slightly different. When I discovered that, I asked for another investigation to be carried out to see if there were any other scams going on, and the PTE investigated again. In an interesting letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-02">2 May</phrase>, David Leather, the interim chief executive, said that in the final investigation</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/14" class="indent">&quot;7,000 passengers had their tickets and passes inspected during the two week period. The findings of the revenue inspection in Moston&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/15">that is part of the area in north Manchester that I am talking about&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/16" class="indent">&quot;were similar to the findings on the wider network and in line with our other inspections, when a ticket or pass was not deemed valid, it was withdrawn. A total of 241 tickets and passes were withdrawn; of these, 178 were System One PayPoint tickets&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/17">that is not the kind that asylum seekers have&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/18" class="indent">&quot;45 PTE concessionary passes and 18 single operator tickets. Only six of the System One scratchcards which had been sold to the Home Office were seen, all of which were being used on the correct date.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/19">There is no evidence that there was any fraudulent activity by asylum seekers. The letter continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/20" class="indent">&quot;A note was made of the number of each one seen and there was no evidence of the same ticket being used later the same day. However, we believe that there is fraudulent activity in respect of the System One PayPoint tickets and we are working with the bus operators and GMP to address this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/21">I wish to conclude by making a series of points. What has been learned from the investigations and the exposure of the myths as racist myths is that a small amount of fraud is going on, as often happens in any cash system, and the police and the PTE are dealing with it. But, not uniquely in history, we have a situation that the British National party, which increasingly camouflages itself as an ordinary community activist organisation as opposed to the group of racist thugs that it actually is, has been able to exploit. There are lessons to be learned from this case about fighting racism and dealing with the BNP. When things that public bodies do go wrong&mdash;in the first place, the Home Office simply got this wrong&mdash;they have to be put right as quickly as possible so that the public service, whether it involves delivering bus passes or dispersing asylum seekers, is effective and can do what it is supposed to do as well as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/22">The system must be open. The most fertile ground for racists is a situation in which they are able to say to people who have lived in this country for a long time that people who have just arrived, in whatever circumstances, are getting a better deal than they are. We must ensure that all our services are delivered as effectively, openly and fairly as possible. We have seen in this case how, over a period of seven or eight years, racists have been able to exploit the situation. There is a by-election in my constituency at present, and the myths that are being spread include myths about bus passes, earlier myths that would be laughable if they were not seriously directed at refugees, and other racist myths that have gone on as long as people have existed.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/23">This is a difficult debate for the Minister to reply to. It is about transport and the Home Office, and also about the big issue of how central Government, local government and local democracy deliver services. I hope that he can assure us that the principles of effective and transparent government will be pursued to expose myths.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-13a.323.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" speakername="Tom Harris" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport"  colnum="323"  time="016:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070613/halltext/70613h0010.htm#07061380000516">
	<p pid="a.323.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> on securing time this afternoon to discuss this issue. He and I have discussed transport issues on several occasions since I was appointed as Minister. He will be unsurprised to hear me say that this is probably the first debate in which I can honestly say that I agree with every word that he has uttered. He has performed a valuable service, and I will come back to that at length later.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/2">I understand that there are some local issues regarding the issuing of payment for the travel expenses of asylum seekers in Manchester. My hon. Friend explained the system better than I could have, so he will know that the vouchers are issued to asylum seekers by the immigration reporting centres to be used for travel to the next reporting event&mdash;or appointment, which is how most of us would refer to it. The reporting centres purchase the vouchers in advance from the Greater Manchester passenger transport executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/3">My hon. Friend has previously met my hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration and Asylum to discuss his concerns about the payment of travelling expenses for asylum seekers. I understand that my hon. Friend the Minister wrote to him in March setting out the background to the provisions. As was explained to my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley, the payment of travel expenses is a fundamental part of the Government's policy to encourage compliance with our requirements that asylum seekers keep in touch with the immigration and nationality directorate during consideration of their case. We make no apologies for that particular policy&mdash;it was the right thing to do because it prevents the use of lack of funds as a reason for failing to comply with a reporting event. Such payments are made to those asylum seekers who live 3 miles or more from a reporting centre or on the grounds of exceptional need. That is a national policy and is not unique to Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/4">As my hon. Friend said, travel expenses are provided in the form of a scratchcard travel ticket that is made valid for the applicant's next reporting event. In other words, it is valid only for that particular day and is not a travel card in the normally accepted definition of the phrase. That is the most effective way to avoid waste and the operational risks associated with cash handling. My hon. Friend discussed the issue of fraud with my hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration and Asylum, and he confirmed that fraudulent use of the system was not significant, but that his officials remain vigilant. If evidence of abuse on a significant scale comes to light, appropriate action will be taken to counteract it. The information that my hon. Friend has given hon. Members today is extremely useful in nailing one of the many myths surrounding the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/5">Asylum seekers are not being provided with bus passes as some people are claiming&mdash;my hon. Friend was absolutely correct about that. To be totally clear, the issuing of travel vouchers has nothing to do with concessionary bus passes and it is certainly not a preferential system. However, it is sadly typical of the extremists of the British National party to try to exploit the fears of ordinary people and to whip up resentment and hatred against a vulnerable group of people purely for political gain. Frankly, that is a disgraceful attitude and all hon. Members are grateful to my hon. Friend for highlighting that obnoxious tactic. He deserves the thanks of the whole House. I hope that I can share his optimism that now that we have nailed those myths, the spreading of the lies will cease. However, given the record of the British National party on fact and truth, I am not optimistic that the myths will stop being circulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/6">In the meantime, as my hon. Friend has raised concessionary travel it might be helpful to explain who is eligible for the statutory minimum bus travel concession in England. From April 2006, residents of England who are 60 years of age or over and eligible disabled people have been entitled to free off-peak local bus travel within their local authority area, and across the whole passenger transport executive in the metropolitan areas, if that is where they live. Eleven million people in England and more than half a million people in Manchester are eligible for the statutory concession, which is already making a real difference to the lives of many constituents, including those of my hon. Friend&mdash;especially older and disabled constituents. In fact, those people account for two out of three public transport journeys, which is more than 4 billion journeys a year in England. As we all know, last year my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced that from April 2008, people in England who are aged 60 and over and eligible disabled people will be able to travel for free by local bus anywhere in England, not just in the local authority or passenger transport executive area.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/7">To make the national bus concession a reality, the Government introduced the Concessionary Bus Travel Bill to Parliament, which completed its Committee stage last week. Throughout the past year, in the run up to the Bill and since its introduction, we have actively involved members of the concessionary fares working group in our plans for the national concession. The group consists of representatives from all tiers of local authorities, including the passenger transport executives, and is assisting us in the implementation of the national bus concession.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/8">The group advised that there would need to be greater consistency in the assessment of eligibility by local authorities across the country because, for the first time, a local authority will be required to reimburse operators for travel by a concessionaire who may not be resident in its area. I can assure my hon. Friend that we are seeking to improve the guidance that we issue to local authorities on assessing the eligibility of disabled people. Indeed, next week the Department's officials are holding a workshop with local authorities, to which a passenger transport executive representative has been invited, to explore the issues surrounding eligibility. We intend to discuss the matter with stakeholder organisations as well, with a view to updating and reissuing guidance in the run-up toApril 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/9">The Government, of course, share the concerns raised by my hon. Friend. We are constantly in dialogue with local authorities and passenger transport executives through our concessionary fares working group. The Government have an excellent record on concessionary fares and it is important to note that it is all too easy for extremist, neo-fascist groups to exploit for their own political ends a positive policy that offers social inclusion to a vulnerable group of people. I reiterate the gratitude that hon. Members and I feel towards my hon. Friend for raising an absolutely crucial issue. I share his hope that now that we have nailed the myths, they will stay nailed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-13a.326.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" speakername="Lorely Burt" colnum="326"  time="016:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070613/halltext/70613h0010.htm#07061380000517">
	<p pid="a.326.2/1">I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to speak about such an important subject, which is as diverse as the debate title suggests. I appreciate that the Minister will do his utmost to deal with the points that I am raising, but I would be grateful if he would write to me if there are matters that he is unable to address for any reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.2/2">When I trained in personnel management, I remember being confronted with the following question from an old-fashioned recruiter: &quot;Would he fit in at my club?&quot; We were recently treated to the news that the British intelligence services&mdash;MI5&mdash;had had a record number of applicants from diverse backgrounds because it had advertised on the internet. The days are long gone when someone had to be an Oxbridge graduate who was watched carefully before being hand-selected for MI5&mdash;or so John le Carr&eacute; novels would have us believe was the case. Today we realise that our spies need to look like the population that they are required to blend into and the civilian work force should have the same laudable aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.2/3">Management theory teaches us that the best teams are made up of different types of character, which means that they can perform better because they incorporate different talents, aptitudes and abilities. That is also the case in relation to diversity in the work place. I will make the case for more sensitive employment policies for ethnic minority women. However, the case is just as clear for women generally, ethnic minority men, and people of a different sexual orientation&mdash;lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, to which I will refer using the term LGBT.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.2/4">On ethnic minority women, I am indebted to the Equal Opportunities Commission for its excellent briefing, on which what I will say is based. The EOC research identified several employment gaps facing ethnic minority women, including participation in the labour market. Some 79 per cent. of white men are in employment, compared with 66 per cent. of white women and 62 per cent. of black Caribbean women. Those figures go down to 22 per cent. for Pakistani women and 18 per cent. for Bangladeshi women. On progression, 19 per cent. of white men are in managerial or senior official positions, compared with 11 per cent. of white women, 9 per cent of black Caribbean and Pakistani women and 6 per cent. of Bangladeshi women. On pay, although women as a whole face a pay gap, it is far worse for many ethnic minority women. For example, Pakistani women working full-time earn 28 per cent. less than a white British man working full-time. Surely that cannot be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.2/5">The business case for employing ethnic minority women is clear. They represent a growing pool of talent with better qualifications than white males. Given that the Leitch review in 2006, looking at the UK's long-term skills needs, highlighted a serious shortage of skilled school leavers, it makes no sense for so many Bangladeshi, Pakistani and black Caribbean women to be working in jobs so far below their levels of qualifications. Furthermore, businesses whose work forces reflect the diversity of the population are in a better position to tap into new markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.2/6">The Government's introduction, in April, of the gender equality duty is extremely welcome. It requires public sector employers to look more closely at their gender representation and to identify underlying cultural or other barriers to the recruitment and progression of women in the workplace. That duty extends down the supply chain as well, so at least some private business is covered. However, there is no requirement on private organisations per se to examine their recruitment and promotion strategies in order to tackle unconscious sexism.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.2/7">Yesterday, the Government published the discrimination law review, which aims to enshrine all anti-discrimination law in one Act. For ethnic minority women, the single equality duty will be a big help because it brings the issues of women and ethnic minorities, which previously straddled two equality strands, under one integrated duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.2/8">There are three main barriers to the progression of ethnic minority women at work. The first consistsof racism, sexism and anti-Muslim prejudice. Bangladeshi, Pakistani and black Caribbean women under 35 and in employment are two to three times more likely than white women to be asked in job interviews about their plans for marriage or children. That research, which was carried out by Botcherby in 2006, also found that one in three black Caribbean working women under 35 and one in five Bangladeshi and Pakistani women have experienced racist comments at work.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.2/9">The second barrier is workplace culture, which was well-documented in a report by the EOC entitled, &quot;Moving on up? Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Black Caribbean Women and Work&quot;. To be seen as team players, staff feel obliged to participate in out-of-work activities, which might make them feel uncomfortable&mdash;for example, going to the pub, gambling or even adult clubs&mdash;if I may dare to even mention them within these hallowed portals. The latter is hardly a Muslim woman's cup of tea, or indeed that of a lot of other people. That club atmosphere does not exclude people deliberately, but it has that effect, I think. Furthermore, people who speak fluent English but with a foreign accent are often treated impatiently. Managers make assumptions about women's home life, which is especially damaging if those assumptions affect recruitment or promotion decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.2/10">The third barrier is the lack of support for working parents and carers. Finding affordable child care and a job with flexible working arrangements is critical for black Caribbean women, who are more likely to be lone parents, and Bangladeshi and Pakistani women, who are more likely to have larger than average families. There are still far too few jobs available on a flexible basis. Another EOC investigation, published this year, found that 35 per cent. of people not in work said that they would be encouraged back into work if flexible working was on offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.2/11">So how can the Government and employers address that unfairness?</p>

	<p pid="a.328.0/1">I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I am afraid that I have not read the report, but I shall do so. Clearly, it is breaking new ground in a difficult area, particularly in relation to the attitude of local communities towards entering work. I am minded to recall the situation of women who have difficulties entering a job. Perhaps they would be interested in self-employment. A number of extremely valuable micro-finance initiatives compliant with sharia law are available. Starting up, even on a small scale, does wonders not only for women's confidence, but for interaction with the local community. I am in total agreement with him and thank him for his intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/2">I would like to make some suggestions about how the Government and employers can redress the unfairness. I have three main solutions. First, we need to develop cultural intelligence in the workplace; employers need to confront racism, sexism and anti-Muslim prejudice. That could be done by up-skilling managers to facilitate better awareness, understanding, confidence and competence in relating positively to employees from diverse backgrounds. Given the critical role of line managers in determining whether ethnic minority women thrive in an organisation, such cultural intelligence is essential.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/3">Cultural intelligence cannot be learned in a one-off diversity training course. It needs to be embedded in management practice and organisational values so that people can deal effectively with any incidents of racism, sexism or anti-Muslim prejudice by staff, customers or clients and adopt open and transparent recruitment practices for all job opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/4">The second method would be to improve careers advice and guidance. Careers staff need a better understanding of the specific barriers facing ethnic minority women, and advisers should be trained in cultural intelligence. Equality should be built into the new quality standards for careers information, advice and guidance in schools. The new careers service for adults proposed for England and Wales should have access points at community venues, and the marketing of the service should specifically target unemployed Bangladeshi and Pakistani women. Employers should be linked into careers advice services, to promote job opportunities more widely and to set up opportunities for work placements.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/5">The third strand is to improve support for working parents and carers. We should use Jobcentre Plus advisers to help women to find employment that fits with their child care responsibilities. I am sure that that is done to an extent at the moment. This year, I introduced a ten-minute Bill, the Flexible Working Bill, which deals with extending the right to request flexible working to parents with children under the age of 18. However, the issue is more the cultural attitude among employers towards employees. Employers who introduce such measures find that retention is improved, the absenteeism record is much better and employee loyalty is much enhanced.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/6">The community company initiative Women Like Us is fantastic. That organisation works exclusively to match the work needs of mothers returning to the workplace after having children with the needs of employers who are willing to offer flexible working in return for the huge talent, flexibility, loyalty and retention that they get in return. Let us have moreof that, please, and give Women Like Us and organisations like it the funding to develop throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/7">I am indebted to Stonewall for its research relating to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Lesbian, gay and bisexual people comprise about 6 per cent. of the population, according to Government estimates. That is roughly 1.7 million people in the UK work force. Stonewall found that 36 per cent. of gay employees say that they will change careers if discrimination continues. One third of gay staff conceal their sexual orientation from their employers and co-workers for fear of discrimination. Not surprisingly, at least 55 per cent. of gay employees facing discrimination report a direct negative work impact, so employers who do not deal with these problems will find their productivity decreasing. Most worryingly, approximately 20 per cent. of gay employees facing discrimination at work will consider suicide.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/8">Sexual orientation is not yet within the auspices of the discrimination law review in so far as it applies to the equality duties being recommended for employers. Under present legislation, there are three separate duties in respect of race, gender and disability. The discrimination law review has one solid proposal to integrate those three into one duty, which I have already mentioned. It is considering extending that approach to sexual orientation. We certainly urge the Government to include that arrangement, as has already been proposed in Lord Lester's Equality Bill of 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/9">Such a move would go a long way towards the measures that Stonewall is calling for. Will the Minister comment on what the Government have done so farto address the following solutions, proposed by Stonewall? It proposes measures to ensure that employers recruit and select fairly. Recruiters often have stereotyped notions of what LGB people are good or not good at. Stonewall proposes measures to ensure that recruiters understand fair selection criteria and apply them consistently.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/10">Stonewall also proposes measures to tackle issues of workplace bullying and harassment and to make staff feel confident about using complaints procedures, even if that means revealing their sexual orientation. It proposes the establishment of employee networks&mdash;forums for staff who share one or more aspects of their identity. Employers increasingly appreciate the benefits that such forums can bring to the whole organisation. Also proposed are monitoring and evaluation on whether an organisation's diversity policy is being implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/11">For as long as I have held a women and equalities portfolio, I have sought assurances that the Government will address the issue of transgender people, but despite that, in the equalities law review and indeed in all legislation relating to fair treatment in respect of sexual orientation, there remains absolutely no protection for transgender people unless they have had or are seeking gender reassignment surgery. The vast majority who do not want surgery&mdash;people such as transvestites and cross-dressers&mdash;will not be covered. Will the Minister please talk to his colleagues about that grave omission? Those people are not huge in number, but they are suffering and the Government are not listening.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/12">With all the groups that I have discussed today, there is a huge pool of talent, skill, dedication and loyalty there for the asking. It makes huge economic sense for any employer to go fishing in that pool. Will the Government encourage and cajole employers to take the plunge, for the sake of their own profits, the economic prosperity of this country and fairness itself?</p>
