<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/halltext/80715h0001.htm#08071578000455">
	<p pid="a.1.2/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to raise a vital issue. My intention in seeking the debate is not to pretend that nothing is being done; quite the contrary&mdash;I want to applaud the work that has been going on in the Department, particularly since the National Audit Office published its report on dementia last year. Consultation on the national dementia strategy and the direction of travel that that signals is very welcome. My interest in the issue does not come from personal family experience&mdash;and I would not wish that on anyone&mdash;but from the contact that I have had with families in my constituency who are living, perhaps I should say struggling, with the consequences of dementia. Those contacts have come about through opportunities provided for me by the local carers centre in Sutton and the local branch of the Alzheimer's Society; they have certainly done much to teach me about the impact of that terrible disease. I hope that the Minister will see today's debate as part of the consultation on the strategy and an opportunity to build the consensus that is necessary to deliver and sustain the long-term changes needed to make a difference to people with dementia.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">I want to raise three issues. First, I want to explore some of the lessons from past reports and initiatives to improve the quality of dementia care. Secondly, I want to raise some concerns about work force planning and research aspects of the emerging strategy. Thirdly, I want to pose some questions, and make some suggestions, about the review of anti-psychotic prescribing announced by the Minister. The Select Committee on Public Accounts produced a report in January that summed up the challenge:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Dementia affects over 560,000 people in England and costs some &pound;14 billion a year. Parallels can be drawn between attitudes towards dementia now and cancer in the 1950s, when there were few treatments and patients were commonly not told the diagnosis for fear of distress.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">For the UK as a whole, dementia costs &pound;17 billion a year&mdash;more than cancer, stroke and heart disease put together&mdash;and we are told that in the next 20 years the cost will more than double.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/5">The Public Accounts Committee and National Audit Office reports are not the first reports to turn the spotlight on dementia. There are plenty of reports, if one digs into the subject. Just eight years ago, the Audit Commission published the first of two reports called &quot;Forget Me Not&quot;. Those reports make salutary reading, because the lack of early diagnosis, the patchiness of provision, the need for better management of complexity and the importance of strategy were all set out in their pages. They show a sad truth about this area of public policy and many others&mdash;it is particularly so with respect to the NAO report: often there is nothing new to be said, but what there is to say must be said time and again.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/6">Shortly after the Audit Commission report appeared, the Department of Health published the national service framework for older people. Standard seven in that very welcome document covers older people's mental health. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/7" class="indent">&quot;Older people who have mental health problems have access to integrated mental health services, provided by the NHS and councils to ensure effective diagnosis, treatment and support, for them and their carers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/8">The NSF was widely welcomed at the time. It was all there: the benefit of early diagnosis; the need to refer to specialist services to confirm diagnosis; best practice advice on dementia care pathways; and the service model. That was in 2001, yet by the time the NAO took a look and published its report in 2007, little had changed substantially. Yes, there were, and are, beacons of good practice around the country; there is no doubt about the fact that some really good, dedicated staff are providing good services and bringing about good outcomes. However, for most of the country, dementia care remains firmly in the dark ages. As the NAO found, less than half of those with dementia receive a diagnosis. Even among those national health service organisations with agreed dementia care pathways, more than half admitted to the NAO that they are not using them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/9">The draft strategy rightly identifies the need for an integrated approach from diagnosis to end of life. Again, the NSF offered a tool for securing that integration: the single assessment process. Despite a deadline of April 2002 for its introduction, only a minority of NHS organisations are using it. The roll-out appears to have stalled, as it seems that the signals have not been getting through to local decision-makers, and that the incentives to change behaviour have been too subtle. The priority that the Minister and the Department of Health have now attached to dementia is essential to achieving the step change that we all want, but if the experience of the past is any indicator for the future it will not be sufficient. It will require national leadership, both political and clinical, so will the Minister take on board the proposal in the NAO report that a national director for dementia services should be appointed to provide national leadership, and that that should be underpinned by networks for dementia, in much the same way as happens for cancer care, to provide clinical leadership at regional level?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.3.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/halltext/80715h0001.htm#08071578000462">
	<p pid="a.3.4/1">Thank you, Mr. Hood. Again, that was a very good point, and I guess that I would respond to it by saying that I hope the Minister will tell us something about the read-across from the national carers strategy to the dementia strategy. That must obviously be tailored to the specific circumstances of families who are coping with dementia. The generic strategy, welcome though it certainly is, needs to be tailored in that way&mdash;the right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.4/2">I was going to say something about the Care Quality Commission which will replace the Commission for Social Care Inspection and the Healthcare Commission. It must ensure that all care homes train their staff in the needs of people with dementia. Indeed, it needs to provide training in other settings too&mdash;particularly domiciliary care.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.4/3">Inspection must be more than a response triggered by specific concerns. It must be seen as part of a continuous improvement process across all standards and should be regular. The CQC should also be required to measure routinely the experience and satisfaction of service users and carers in all settings, not just care homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.4/4">In December 2007, the Department of Health published its operating framework for this year. Among its local priorities was the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.3.4/5" class="indent">&quot;The Department will shortly be publishing details of the clinical and economic case for investing in services for early identification and intervention in dementia, which PCTs will want to consider when developing local services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.3.4/6">That was flagged up as a local priority, not a national requirement or even a national priority. Will the NHS operating framework for 2009-10 elevate dementia to the status of a national requirement, or at least to a national priority? Try as I might, I could not find any sign of the promised business case for investing in services. Has it been published?</p>
	<p pid="a.3.4/7">Getting the traction necessary across the whole health and social care system requires more than incentivising the Department of Health and the NHS to change their behaviour and practice. It also needs the buy-in of the Department for Communities and Local Government, so that local area agreements, the negotiations between agencies that are involved, and the new comprehensive area assessment process can be employed to lever change.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.4/8">The consultation document states that the proposed development requires work force growth if the new and improved services are to be delivered. Work force planning is a critical and complex matter. At the diagnosis end, is the Minister confident that enough people with the necessary training will be in place to undertake the necessary assessments? Will there be enough neurologists and geriatricians to deal with the huge increase in the number of referrals for specialist diagnosis? The earlier people are referred, the more critical those specialist services will be in achieving a successful diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="a.3.4/9">The NAO report found that community mental health teams have an average of 275 people with dementia on their books, compared with the 1,000 whom the prevalence data suggest have that condition. Many teams lack specialists in dementia. An early diagnosis may be made, but what happens afterwards, particularly to support the family, including those caring and coping at home? Information is critical. Signposting on its own, however, is not enough to support carers in particular. They need expert advocacy to help them access the support and services that they require, which are different at different stages of the disease. One model that I hope will be considered is Portage services, which have been developed in children's services. I am not suggesting that we equate people with dementia with children; Portage services simply provide a model for standing alongside carers and families to help them manage the complexities of all the agencies that they must deal with. I hope that that can be considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-14">14 May</phrase>, I introduced a ten-minute Bill on the management of dementia in care homes. One of its objectives on work force planning and training was to make dementia training, including the use of anti-psychotics, mandatory for care home staff, as it is not mandatory at the moment. That would be a straightforward and simple step for the Minister to take after the consultation process is complete. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.6.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="6"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/halltext/80715h0001.htm#08071578000466">
	<p pid="a.6.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The report, to which he put his name, says that such drugs should be a last resort. The problem is that in too many places&mdash;we do not know the precise numbers; we know only that it happens in too many places&mdash;it is often not a last resort but a first. We need to change that behaviour. That is critical to realising the good intentions behind the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/2">The European Medicines Agency review to harmonise regulation on Risperdal means that the drug will be licensed in the UK for the treatment of behavioural and psychological disturbance, but in a strictly defined subgroup of people with Alzheimer's disease. Until now, no anti-psychotic drug has been licensed in this country for the treatment of dementia. EU member states that license such drugs for the treatment of dementia stipulate that their use should be limited to a period of no more than three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/3">That will have important implications for prescribing and dementia care in this country. For the first time, clinicians will have a licensed drug that will significantly increase the burden of proof, in the context of the GMC's guidelines on off-licence prescribing. It will become necessary to justify prescribing other drugs than the one that is licensed. If fewer dementia suffers are routinely prescribed anti-psychotic drugs for periods in excess of three months, it will increase the pressure on families and care providers as dementia patients come off the drugs. Once Risperdal is licensed, NICE should undertake an appraisal to determine its clinical and cost-effectiveness. Indeed I hope that the Government will consider that it would be in the public interest if NICE undertook an appraisal of all the anti-psychotic drugs routinely prescribed to people with dementia.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/4">Another driver for change comes from the USA. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration exercised its powers to require manufacturers of traditional anti-psychotic drugs to make safety-related changes to prescribing information, or labelling, to warn about an increased risk of death associated with the off-licence use of these drugs to treat the behavioural problems associated with dementia. In 2005, it made a similar requirement for atypical anti-psychotic drugs. The pressure from Europe for a licensed drug, together with the review, and pressure from the United States, must make us question what the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency could do to ensure that we have good safety information on all anti-psychotic drugs in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/5">Although I welcome the review, it is my view, from all the information that I have seen and lobbying that I have received over the years, that there is a compelling body of evidence to justify action to tackle inappropriate and abusive prescribing. I understand that the review will concentrate on drawing up the action plan needed to change clinical practice, which is not as easy as it sounds. It is easy to say, &quot;Change clinical practice&quot;&mdash; and many people have been saying it for a long time&mdash;but practice remains the same. Elements of any plan should include: a role for the MHRA in requiring safety-related changes to all anti-psychotic drugs labelling; a contribution from the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Psychiatrists in drawing up and issuing clearer guidelines and driving behavioural change; the role of the GMC, not in waving a big stick, but in supporting behavioural change and, if necessary, policing unacceptable behaviour; the role of the Healthcare Commission, the Commission for Social Care Inspection and their successors in inspecting prescribing practice&mdash;for example by looking at the length of time anti-psychotic drugs are prescribed&mdash;and the contribution that clinical governance and audit in PCTs can make. I also hope that we can have a strategy setting out the support and information that families need so that they can ask pointed questions at medication reviews and other times about the appropriateness of the prescriptions offered to them. I think that the voluntary sector can make a huge contribution in raising awareness and by working with the Department of Health and others to move the agenda forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.1/6">I referred earlier to the role of the quality and outcomes framework in signalling change. I hope that as part of the dementia strategy it can be used to reward a change of practice away from pharmacological interventions towards psychological and social interventions. Inevitably, in a debate like this, I have concentrated on those areas where I have concerns, but my purpose today has been to pose some questions and make some suggestions based on past experience. There is much to welcome in the proposed national dementia strategy, and I hope that it becomes the basis for a national consensus that delivers the dignity and quality of life that people with dementia, and their carers, deserve.</p>

	<p pid="a.8.3/1">They are indeed the issues, but the debate is at an early stage, and it is right that we consider all such issues as we work through it.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/2">In care homes&mdash;the most intensive and costly part of the social care system&mdash;more than two thirds of residents have some form of dementia. However, given that only one third of dementia sufferers are cared for in a care home, a large number of people are left dependent on social care at home, much of which is provided by unpaid family carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/3">It is important to emphasise the limited and often variable quality of care services for people with dementia. I met a group of carers of people with dementia at an Age Concern drop-in centre in my constituency. Most of the people whom they cared for were still living at home, but using respite care. Those carers were experts on the standard of respite care available locally and were pretty scathing&mdash;sadly&mdash;about its quality. It is a reflection of the current state of care services that users and carers have low expectations of quality, and that must change. Like other hon. Members&mdash;I am sure&mdash;I am a firm believer in applying the test of whether we think that a care service would be good enough for our own parents, spouse or partner. We have some big issues to deal with on quality, and if we link them to funding, as has been discussed, I think that people would be more prepared to make a contribution to care costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/4">The consultation document for the national dementia strategy makes a commitment on the outcome of early diagnosis and intervention, which I believe is vital in transforming the future of dementia care. Many of the improvements in care for people with dementia are reliant on good quality early diagnosis, and with medical developments more could then be done at an early stage for those with dementia, which could mean that they can live independently at home for longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.3/5">The NICE guidelines for drug treatment for mild cases, which seem to have hampered NHS funding, need further review. We are talking about a cost of &pound;2.50 a day, which must be weighed against other costs that families incur&mdash;it is important that in our debates we weigh up the costs to families.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.9.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1943" speakername="Barbara Keeley" colnum="9"  time="009:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/halltext/80715h0002.htm#08071578000473">
	<p pid="a.9.1/1">Our strategies should not deal with the issues separately. I was making the point that we must start to weigh up the costs to unpaid family carers, resulting partly from their reduced work hours. We must also consider the outcome for those with dementia who will spend longer in care homes without that early care.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/2">On care services, a key question is whether we go for local flexibility in provision of services or for setting national standards for care. We had a debate in this Chamber on the future of care a few weeks ago, in which I argued strongly for setting national standards. There are two local authorities and two primary care trusts in my constituency, all of which set different criteria for levels of need and the allocation of care services. It is unacceptable to me, as the MP for Worsley, that local people face those differences. I want a national basic entitlement to care. It is important that our social and community care services develop so that we provide that care early and at lower levels of need, although it would have resource implications that need to be faced.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/3">It is estimated that 2,200 people in Salford have dementia, so there are about 1,000 such people in my constituency. With their carers, they are a significant group. If we want early diagnosis and intervention for people who have dementia, care must be provided earlier, and advice and support must be given both to them and their carers. The point has already been made that early intervention could and would prevent later costly treatment, as well as&mdash;this is important&mdash;preserving quality of life for people with dementia and their carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/4">There is concern about age discrimination in the provision of treatment and care. The national service framework for older people states that clinical need should be the basis for treatment, regardless of age, but many individuals and organisations in the field of dementia care have given examples that show that is not the case. The equalities Bill will contain a new equality duty that will cover age discrimination. The new law will ban unjustifiable age discrimination such as a doctor failing to investigate a health complaint raised by an older person or not providing treatment simply because of age. Work also needs to be done to tackle the culture of ageism that is built into health services and which affects decisions about paying for care. That difficult issue will need a fundamental change of attitude from health providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/5">Recent research commissioned by the Department of Health through the Centre for Policy on Ageing reported different types of ageism in the health care system. Examples include &quot;productivity ageism&quot;&mdash;giving priority to young adults because they are more productive&mdash;and &quot;health maximisation ageism&quot;, which is used in quality adjusted life years assessments; the greater life expectancy of younger people means that they benefit more. A third type is &quot;fair innings ageism&quot;, which, as the name suggests, compares remaining expected healthy life years to an average and gives a weighting that benefits younger people. Older people deserve good treatment too. If we were to apply the test of whether we think a service or treatment good enough for our parents, we would not apply ageist attitudes when deciding if older people should have the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/6">As has been said, it is crucial to recognise the vital role that unpaid family carers play in dementia services. The national carers strategy was launched recently, and carers' concerns are now considered in relation to health and social care in a new way. I have campaigned, through two private Member's Bills, for health professionals to identify and support carers, and I will continue to press that case. Early diagnosis of dementia is important, and at that point, the consultant or general practitioner should also identify the patient's carer and refer them to the support that they will need to cope with their growing caring responsibilities. I think that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said that there are only 20 quality of outcomes framework points for GPs identifying dementia patients, but there are only three QOF points for identifying carers. Surely that should be reviewed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.11.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" speakername="Greg Mulholland" colnum="11"  time="010:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/halltext/80715h0002.htm#08071578000476">
	<p pid="a.11.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> on securing this hugely important debate. As everyone in the House knows, he has been extremely active in this area. Indeed, before I took up my current role he used to perform it, and did so with real distinction. I pay tribute to his work; he has shown himself to be a real champion for older people, particularly those who are vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/2">The debate is particularly timely as it comes after last week's dementia awareness week. The issue is of ever greater and more pressing importance in society. Current estimates suggest that more than 700,000 people in the UK have dementia, and that number is expected to rise by more than 1 million by 2025 and 1.7 million by 2051.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/3">As we have heard, dementia affects not only the individuals concerned, but the millions of families involved, and the cost of dementia care is &pound;17 billion a year, of which &pound;14 billion is for England alone. That is more than the cost for cancer, heart disease and stroke combined, which is a shocking statistic. The figure is expected to double within two decades to &pound;35 billion as advances in health care lead to longer life expectancy. However, we are not investing enough in research at a time when more than a third of over-65s suffer from some form of dementia when they die.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/4">I echo my hon. Friend's comments welcoming the national dementia strategy, which is a big step forward. I think that we all wholeheartedly back the call to bring the issue out of the shadows. He made the useful suggestion that the debate should be part of the vital consultation process that we all believe to be important and welcome. I, too, attended last week's meeting of the all-party group on dementia, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>. On some issues, we all spoke with one voice, and we all paid tribute to the work of the all-party group, the Alzheimer's Society and other organisations that do so much to push the issue up the agenda. We also acknowledged that the Government have listened, which is creditable; the issue is very much on the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/5">The strategy has three core aims, the first of which is to address the lack of understanding about dementia. We have heard, particularly from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, who is no longer in the Chamber, about the need for more comprehensive staff training on how to deal with dementia and related issues. That is crucial, particularly for front-line staff in care homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam highlighted the need for early diagnosis and intervention in dementia cases. The Public Accounts Committee report revealed that two thirds of people with dementia never receive a specialist diagnosis, which is hardly surprising given that the National Audit Office showed that only 31 per cent. of GPs felt that they had received sufficient training to help them diagnose and manage dementia. The British Medical Association suggested that doctors had less confidence about diagnosing dementia in 2007 than they had in 2004, so the medical profession itself says that more needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/7">One problem that has been highlighted is in respect of who should take responsibility for the situation. The answer is unclear, and I echo my hon. Friend's suggestion that we must have specialist experts in dementia. They might be a geriatrician, a GP with a special interest, or a psychiatrist with a speciality in older age, but we all agree on the need for medical specialism in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/8">Improving the quality of care is another priority in the new national dementia strategy, and we all accept that there will be no quick fix. About 62 per cent. of care home residents are thought to have dementia, but less than 28 per cent. of care homes provide specialist dementia care. That issue goes back to training and to the need to introduce qualifications for care home workers&mdash;I am aware that has been suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/9">There are concerns about research funding, and I should like to ask the Minister for his thoughts on the current level of funding, because although costs continue to rise, we all accept that there is a huge burden on the system. Nevertheless, only 3 per cent. of the Department of Health's research budget is spent on finding new ways of preventing and treating dementia, while a quarter of it is spent on cancer research. No one suggests that those issues are not hugely important, but if we are to tackle the huge societal and economic burden of dementia, we must consider increasing the figure. Currently, in real terms, for every &pound;289 spent per cancer patient, only &pound;11 is spent on Alzheimer's sufferers, so when we consider the huge numbers of people who will suffer from dementia, and its effects on their families, on communities and on society, we see that the issue must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/10">It is vital that the work of the third sector&mdash;the voluntary sector&mdash;continues to be supported. It has done much to push the issue forward, but Rebecca Wood, the chief executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, warns quite bluntly that if the level of under-investment persists, the economic consequences arising from dementia care costs will be &quot;catastrophic&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/11">My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam mentioned anti-psychotic drugs&mdash;an issue on which he has campaigned tirelessly. Other Members mentioned it, too, but I know that the issue is dear to my hon. Friend's heart, and I pay tribute to him for highlighting the scandalous way in which those drugs have been used and, unfortunately, in too many circumstances, are still being used inappropriately as a chemical cosh to suppress rather than to treat. The chilling reality is that, in some cases, the use of those drugs shortens people's lives when they simply should not be used, or are not being used for an adequate medical purpose. I support his calls for a review by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&mdash;I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments&mdash;on Risperdal and on the general principle. It is extremely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/12">I also echo the comments, made particularly strongly by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1943" name="Barbara Keeley">the hon. Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley)</phrase>, and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase>, that we must ensure that there is joined-up thinking between the national dementia strategy and&mdash;something else that the Minister has championed&mdash;the national carers strategy. I sit on the Select Committee on Work and Pensions, which is examining carers' roles from the point of view of the responsibilities of the Department for Work and Pensions, and there clearly has to be joined-up thinking. In this debate, we have heard powerful accounts of the reality of life for families, carers and spouses&mdash;elderly spouses, who so often care for people with dementia. All of us who have witnessed such situations, either through families or through constituents, know that they are incredibly distressing. People have to care for their loved one while they are grieving for the loss of that person to dementia. It is tragic, and our society must do all it can to support them.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/13">We are all aware of the role that carers play in society, and I am pleased that their importance is being pushed up the agenda, and that their contribution to society is being increasingly recognised. We must acknowledge that carers for dementia sufferers save the social and health services about &pound;6 billion a year, and I hope that we all echo the calls of organisations such as Help the Aged, which want the everyday rights of carers throughout the country to be acknowledged and the care and support system to be fundamentally overhauled, particularly for people with dementia, who have specific needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/14">This debate has been very positive, and I look forward to the Minister's response to the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam made. We all agree about how pleasing it is that these issues are firmly on the agenda, that we are talking about them and that things are moving forward. All parts of the House want to be part of the process, and we have to ensure that the results of the consultation and the subsequent national carers strategy transform the lives of people who are affected by that most tragic of conditions, and help their families. I hope that as a society we will then stop brushing dementia under the carpet, and I applaud all the attempts to bring the condition out of the shadows. The fact that we are talking about it today is a very positive step.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.13.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="13"  time="010:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/halltext/80715h0003.htm#08071578000477">
	<p pid="a.13.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> on securing this important debate, which is timely, given the recent review by the all-party dementia group, ably chaired by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" name="Jeremy Wright">the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright)</phrase>, on the use of anti-psychotic drugs; the report on the dementia tax by the Alzheimer's Society; the consultation on the Government's national dementia strategy, including the focus on anti-psychotic drugs as a direct result of the work by the all-party group; and, embracing all that, the Government's consultation on the future of care and support.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/2">In addition, as the baby boomer generation becomes involved in long-term care for older people, and the demographic bulge brings bigger pressures to bear on our health and social care services, the issue is, and will remain, a key area of debate now and during any forthcoming general election, whenever it is called, although that does not necessarily mean that it must be an issue of dispute. Many of us who regularly take part in such debates recognise in our constituents the demand, as well as the hope and expectation, that we can find a consensual way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/3">Many Members fully understand that dementia is a collective term for a range of medical conditions. There are more than 100 different forms of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause, accounting for about 55 per cent. of cases, while vascular dementia accounts for about 20 per cent. The Alzheimer's Society says that there are about 700,000 people in the UK with dementia, and that about 163,000 new cases of dementia occur in England and Wales each year. It is a life-shortening illness, although another illness is often the main cause of death. However, average life expectancy is unpredictable: the disease can progress for up to 10 years, with average life expectancy being about six years.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/4">From a public policy point of view, that gives the disease particular complexity. About one in three or four people will need long-term care, and of that number about a fifth will have some form of dementia. Furthermore, about a third of those with dementia need institutional care and two thirds of the care home population either has, or will have, some form of dementia. Although the incidence of dementia increases significantly with age, particularly among those aged 85 and over, it is important to note that there are approximately 18,000 people under 65 in the UK who have dementia. I would be interested to hear from the Minister what account will be taken of those people in the dementia strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/5">As we know, in the next 20 years, the number of people aged 85 and over in England is set to increase by two thirds compared with a 10 per cent. growth in the overall population, according to Derek Wanless's 2006 predictions. That is expected to lead to an increase in dementia occurrence. In August 2005, results from the Medical Research Council's cognitive function and ageing study showed that improved health and mortality were not likely to guard people against the risk of developing dementia. Although there is no vaccination or cure, dementia is most common at an advanced age, so a fairly modest delay of a few years in the onset of the disease, or in its progression, could mean a significant reduction in the numbers suffering from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/6">Under Wanless's predictions on social care, an estimated &pound;14 billion gross spend in 2006-07 is forecast to double to between &pound;24 billion and &pound;31 billion by 2026, depending on the decisions that we make now. It is likely that the cost of dementia in 2026 will be about &pound;12 billion to &pound;14 billion. At a personal level, the Wanless review estimated that residential care for the elderly mentally infirm was 14.1 per cent. higher than for &quot;ordinary&quot; elderly residents, and that the cost of nursing care was 4.7 per cent. higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/7">The report, &quot;The Dementia Tax&quot;, by the Alzheimer's Society highlighted the unfairness of the situation for people who need care because of dementia, and for their families: dementia it is a medical condition, but invariably it requires social care. There are wider issues in dementia care than the actuarial estimations about current and future support. It is easy, as we consider the commitment of the British taxpayer to this issue, to forget that we are dealing with individuals such as ourselves and families similar to our own, with all the emotional, spiritual and physical needs that come with our humanity. It is right that we bear in mind those people that we know&mdash;friends and family&mdash;who have dementia, or who care for someone with it, as we debate these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/8">One big area of work, which has recently given rise to public outcry, is the use of antipsychotic drugs in care settings, which was touched on by all the contributors to the debate, and by those who intervened. I pay tribute to the work of the all-party group on dementia, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth for his chairmanship. In its report, &quot;Always a Last Resort&quot;, the group made a key point:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/9" class="indent">&quot;There are serious concerns that there is widespread inappropriate prescribing, for example, antipsychotics are being used for people with dementia who have mild behavioural symptoms and prescribing is often continued for long periods of time...This is despite the fact that antipsychotics have limited benefit for people with dementia, particularly when prescribed for long periods, and despite the serious side effects associated with their use...Side effects include excessive sedation, dizziness and unsteadiness, which can lead to increased falls and injuries, as well as body rigidity and tremors. Research shows that there is almost a doubling in the risk of mortality and an increase the risk of stroke by up to three times.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/10">I am therefore glad that the Government have taken up the report's criticisms in their consultation on the national dementia strategy, and I pay tribute to the Minister for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/11">Another concern is the closure across the country of care homes for the elderly mentally infirm. That is a concern not only about the provision of places to those who need them, but about the provision of places in locations that are convenient for friends, family and, in some cases, spouses, who might well be dependent on public transport to get there. We heard in an intervention about the vital need to emphasise ways in which we can best try to keep couples together. I have tabled parliamentary questions on the matter, but I was told that the Department of Health does not collect the relevant data centrally. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister would consider writing to me, and anybody else who is interested, to outline what information the Department does collect in this area. I was hoping that I might even get a quick nod of agreement from him, but I have not quite seen that happen so far. Maybe he will address this issue in his response, but it would be helpful if we could at least know what data are collected, or whether he thinks that the Department should start collecting this data centrally, to ensure that we look at the geographic spread of places for the elderly mentally infirm, and whether provision is being lost or maintained, so that we can start examining how we keep families and communities together.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/12">Another key area of policy is telecare, which enables individuals to live independent lives and carry on living in their own home even as their dementia progresses. That is clearly a very large and wide subject, and I think it may possibly be the subject for another debate. However, it is important to mention it briefly, as it is a key issue. Finally, there is the issue of drugs, particularly for the early stages of Alzheimer's. I pay tribute to all those who have campaigned on this issue, not least one of my own constituents, Leila Potter, who has been engaged for many decades with all the issues arising from caring and support for those with dementia. It is only right that NICE take into account as part of its criteria wider societal costs, such as the earlier requirement for care that would otherwise not be needed if drugs were prescribed at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/13">As the Minister knows, for more than a year, we have proposed as policy the fact that NICE should makes its judgments taking into account those wider costs. That is important, because it would require a change in NICE's statutory remit, and thus would require primary legislation. It is something to which my party is committed, and I was very pleased to hear the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam, and for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland), confirm their interest in, and support for, that policy. I just hope that the Government can tell us, either today or very shortly, that they, too, are minded to support that policy and will introduce the necessary legislative proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/14">The report, &quot;The Dementia Tax&quot;, highlights one of the key questions facing the Government; do they deal with dementia as part of the discussion on care and support, or do they deal with it separately? What is certain is that we would have been in a much stronger position to confront the growing issue of dementia if the Government, having waited for so many years, indicated how they propose to resolve the question of funding long-term care.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/15">I do not need to remind the Minister that the former leader of his party, Tony Blair, said in his 1997 conference speech:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/16" class="indent">&quot;I don't want to live in a country where the only way pensioners can get long term care is by selling their home&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/17">That promise has been around for more than a decade, but only a little has been done about the issue. I think that the Minister would have to admit that the take-up for what has been made available has been paltry. In fact, the present Prime Minister, in launching the consultation, said that</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/18" class="indent">&quot;younger adults are aware that much of their parents' hard earned housing wealth may disappear...at some point in the future they may have to sell a treasured home to pay for their own care...too many people fear the prospect of selling their homes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/19">He therefore continues to ape his predecessor, rather than take the requisite action.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/20">The Government rejected the proposals from their own royal commission; they rejected the requests made by Derek Wanless to conduct a review for the Treasury into long-term care; and they rejected his findings when he was able to conduct such a review through the King's Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/21">When <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase> was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, he announced a review group, which barely met, to introduce a policy following the comprehensive spending review. The Minister who is with us today gave countless assurances that he was winning his tussles with the Treasury, which was all to no avail when the CSR was actually published. We do not have as yet the results of those consultations, which we hoped would give the Treasury the competence it needs to deliver the &quot;new settlement&quot;, to quote the Minister, that he hoped to announce.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/22">We now have a consultation preceding a Green Paper&mdash;in his winding-up speech, the Minister might want to outline the difference between a consultation and a Green Paper. At best, the debate on the future of care and support shows that the Government are still searching for an idea; at worst, it is another attempt to dodge the issue until after the latest date for the next general election. Perhaps, therefore, I could invite the Minister to confirm the Government's intent to resolve this issue before 2010 or, if the polls are anything to go by, to leave it to others to do so after that date.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.17.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="17"  time="010:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/halltext/80715h0003.htm#08071578000478">
	<p pid="a.17.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> on securing this debate and, perhaps more importantly, on the work that he has done over many years to raise the importance of dementia care within and outside this place. It is now acknowledged as one of the big health and social care challenges of our time, and he deserves significant credit for our having reached the stage that we are at today.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/2">Before I address some of the substantive points made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, I would like to point out that we sit in debate after debate in which he simply reels out a narrative about the nature of the challenge, the statistics and the existing situation. He is a spokesman for Her Majesty's official Opposition, but he never knowingly comes up with a tangible policy solution to any of the major public policy challenges. I do not blame him, because we all know the situation. The shadow Chancellor has made it clear that there are to be absolutely no spending commitments from his party before a general election, but it is rich for the hon. Member for Eddisbury to lecture me when in fact the Opposition do not appear to have any credible policies whatsoever on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/3">Let me return to the substance of the debate, during which hon. Members discussed the context. Demographic change is one of the biggest challenges that now face our society. Arguably, it is every bit as much of a challenge as globalisation, climate change or fundamentalist terrorism, but rarely does it feature on the list of the top four or five priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/4">As people live longer, an increasing number will have long-term conditions. Alongside that, people's expectations about and aspirations for the quality of care and support that they will receive are radically different from those of the previous generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/5">As the hon. Member for Eddisbury rightly said, two thirds of people in care homes have dementia. It is estimated that over the next 20 years, one third of those over 65 at death will have the condition dementia. It is one of the biggest issues that the health and social care system faces. Last summer, I committed the Government to bringing it out of the shadows.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/6">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1943" name="Barbara Keeley">the Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley)</phrase> rightly said, it is important that we do not simply look for solutions to the challenge presented by dementia, or develop a dementia strategy in isolation. It is incredibly important that we look at the reform agenda in the round. Therefore, when the hon. Member for Eddisbury accuses the Government of a lack of action in such areas, it is because he seems blissfully unaware of the radical reform agenda that the Government have laid out in the past year for health and social care in this country. From <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year, the &quot;Putting People First&quot; transformation agenda, which is supported by more than &pound;500 million of investment, will be rolled out in every local authority area. We are shifting the system to prevention and early intervention, providing universal information and advice, and moving to a system in which the vast majority of people have personal budgets so that they can exercise maximum control and choice over their own care.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/7">Lord Darzi's report only last week&mdash;it coincided with the 60th anniversary of the national health service&mdash;has a strong emphasis on the working parties in each strategic health authority, and his national enabling report discusses the importance of mental health issues. The primary and community care strategy that we launched last week deals with the need to look again at the incentives, quality outcome framework&mdash;QOF&mdash;points and so on that inform the behaviour of general practitioners and other health care professionals involved in primary and community care.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/8">As hon. Members have said, we have also embarked on a national consultation on the review of the care and support system. What care and support do people have a right to expect in the 21st century, and what are the respective responsibilities of the state, the family and the individual in that context?</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/9">Within the past three or four weeks, we launched the national carers strategy, and, a couple of weeks ago, the consultation on the first ever dementia strategy. In the very near future, we will launch the first ever end-of-life care strategy. I would gently say to the hon. Member for Eddisbury that there has never been as much policy focus, investment of resources and facing up to big challenges as there has been during the most recent period.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/10">I shall respond directly to some of the points that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam raised. First, he and other hon. Members mentioned the impact on families. Unless one has met a family who are dealing with dementia, it is difficult to understand the scale of the trauma, anxiety and guilt that the condition causes. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley about the test that we should set for health and social care services. I have used it myself. If the care would not be good enough for my mother or father, why should it be good enough for somebody else's mother or father? That is the test that, over time, we should seek to establish.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/11">As the hon. Member for Eddisbury said, it is right that when we debate these issues, we keep in mind the fact that we are talking about real people and real families in our communities. Dementia no longer affects only a relatively small number of people at the margins. The ageing society and dementia are issues for a growing number of families in our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/12">I, too, wish to pay tribute to the Alzheimer's Society, which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam mentioned. It has done a tremendous amount of work to ensure that dementia care is at the fore in public debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/13">The hon. Gentleman raised several issues around quality of care. He will appreciate that, having put a document out for consultation, it would be slightly disingenuous for me to prejudge its outcome by directly answering all his questions&mdash;that would make a mockery of the consultation. However, I shall address some of his points. We are considering a clinical director of national dementia services. As part of Lord Darzi's review, the publication of the primary and community care strategy will deal with issues such as the balance of QOF points and primary care.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/14">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> discussed carer support. The carers strategy that we launched in the past three or four weeks commits a massive amount of additional investment to respite care over the next couple of years. It will be crucial not just to expand the amount of respite care in our country but to get the quality right. We know that for many carers of people with dementia, it is not only accessing respite that is an issue but feeling confident, secure and comfortable that the respite care that they use for their relatives is of sufficient quality.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.19.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" colnum="19"  time="010:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/halltext/80715h0004.htm#08071578000480">
	<p pid="a.19.1/1">I agree entirely. Respite care for people with dementia must be safe and secure, and the staff must be skilled and expert, but, like all respite care, it increasingly must be customised to and tailored around the needs of the individual and the family unit. We cannot expect families to fit into a one-size-fits-all offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/2">However, I would give a cautionary note about suggesting to the public that &quot;on demand&quot; is always realistic, given the context of available resources. The Government cannot make promises that they cannot deliver. Nevertheless, organising respite in a flexible way around the needs of families is crucial to the care that we want to develop for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/3">The hon. Gentleman asked about the NHS operating framework. His understanding is right: this year, primary care trusts are expected to prepare, build capacity and start thinking about the issues, based on the strategy. From next year, dementia will obviously receive a much greater focus and priority. I cannot predict the exact words in the NHS operating framework, but I can assure him that the commitments in the final strategy will be reflected in the operating framework. They will also be reflected in all the other measures that will influence local agencies to take dementia seriously. The hon. Gentleman rightly mentioned local area agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/4">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the work force. He was right to discuss the need to ensure that there are sufficiently skilled professionals, both for accessing universal services and then referral on to more specialist services. That clearly will be an important part of delivering the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/5">The hon. Gentleman mentioned continuity of care. We need to give serious consideration to the reference in the document to the possibility of creating a network of dementia care advisers in every community. Families want people alongside them who can help them navigate what can often be a complex, challenging system.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, who is no longer present in this Chamber, urges us to have mandatory training in care homes. Of course, we will consider how to improve considerably investment and quality with regard to training. It is crucial, in every care setting, that we improve both entry-level training for professionals and continual professional development.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/7">The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam mentioned anti-psychotic drugs, which he has done more than any parliamentarian to highlight. I assure him that I will share with him, and with anybody else who wants to see them, the terms of reference of the project that I have established in the Department, under the leadership of Dr. Sube Banerjee. Those terms of reference will be transparent. I urge the hon. Gentleman to work with us on this. It is important that we come up with solutions to this unacceptable situation involving the inappropriate prescribing of drugs or, in some cases, the prescribing of drugs that should not be prescribed for these purposes. That is unacceptable and we must do everything in our power to put a stop to it, but equally we have to get it right. It would be no good coming up with solutions that brought about a series of unintended consequences that led to worse circumstances both for people with dementia and their families and, indeed, for the professionals on the front line. We must ensure that our recommendations are right, but there can be no excuse for the inappropriate prescription of drugs to people with dementia. We would not tolerate it for any other group of people in our health care system. Therefore we cannot tolerate it where it is inappropriate&mdash;I say that deliberately&mdash;for people with dementia.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/8">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned research. We must have a new look at research and I am committed to doing that. We will have the round table and, when the final strategy is published, we will also be talking about where we go in future with our research investment and research strategy. It is difficult to start comparing the amount that we invest in dementia with the amount that we invest in cancer, because the insinuation is almost that some hon. Members would shift resources from cancer research to dementia research. I do not believe that any hon. Member is advocating for that.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.1/1">I cannot give a cast iron assurance today. The hon. Gentleman knows that we are in the middle of a comprehensive spending review. Some of the money comes from the Government and some comes from other sources. We have first to be clear about the following matters. What are we spending overall? How does that fit with what is being spent globally? How do we ensure that any expanded investment in research adds value? Where do we secure the resources from? All those issues will have to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Worsley has an impressive track record, since becoming a Member of Parliament, of championing the cause of carers and ensuring that social care has a much greater priority than in the past. She referred at length to the review of care and support. We have now had two high quality regional engagement, or consultation, events: one in Manchester and one in Leicestershire, where I was yesterday. We have some difficult, challenging issues to resolve. We have to be much clearer about what system people have a right to expect&mdash;not just now, but over the next 20 or 30 years, in terms of quality, as my hon. Friend said, flexibility, as the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said, and personalisation. Equally, we have to resolve issues, such as the one that my hon. Friend raised, for example, about the balance between what should be available as a national entitlement and what should be subject to local discretion. Unlike the health service, social care has always been a highly devolved service, in terms of its commissioning and so on. A lot of people forget that 75 per cent. to 80 per cent. of social care in England is provided through either the private or the voluntary sectors. My hon. Friend is right to say that the question to be addressed&mdash;one of the wicked issues that has to be resolved in terms of the future caring system&mdash;is, what should be national and what should be local?</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/3">My hon. Friend mentioned quality. Right at the heart of last week's recommendations by Lord Darzi of Denham was the suggestion that we need to move the health service towards a relentless focus on quality. As my good friend Lord Darzi says, quality should be the organising principle in the future of the NHS. Of course, we must have the same aspiration for social care. Equally, we must look increasingly at the joining up of social care and health care and the wider services that local authorities commission under the well-being banner, as well as at the primary and community health strategy. I am delighted that Lord Darzi's report reflected that.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/4">My hon. Friend has sponsored private Members' Bills on the question of the responsibility of general practitioners, not only to identify carers but to act on their needs. She is aware that that is referred to in the strategy that we have launched in terms of the future of primary and community care. We must have a renewed look at the role of carers, in the context of an ageing society with more people with long-term conditions. Surely, carers should be given a much greater priority at primary care level. It has to be said that, within the existing QOF framework, some GPs are already doing that in an impressive way. We have to ask some questions about why that is not happening everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/5">My hon. Friend also spoke about end-of-life care. We will be making announcements soon on the first ever national end-of-life strategy, which will support the fact that, as part of Lord Darzi's work, every strategic health authority area has now devised a pathway to be implemented in terms of best practice and end-of-life care. The national strategy will be about enabling and supporting that and ensuring that the right level of resources goes into end-of-life care, through a step change with regard to investment and commissioning. We all know that, from the point of view of a civilised society and with regard to a dignity and respect, there is nothing more important than getting end-of-life care right.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> made a constructive, fair contribution to the debate, for which I thank him. He rightly said that carers are one of the greatest family policy priorities that we face. Addressing the needs of carers is not simply the responsibility of the health and social care system or the Department of Health: there has to be a holistic, cross-Government approach. Let me give three examples of the changing nature of families and carers. First, the carer is usually a woman who is struggling to bring up a child and hold down a job while caring for an elderly parent or grandparent. Secondly, consider an older person having to deal with the early onset of dementia in their husband or wife, while being expected to be at the school gate at 3.30 pm on Monday to Friday to collect their grandchild whose mum and dad are at work. Thirdly, the fact that people with disabilities, particularly learning disabilities, not only have full lives, but long lives means that some people are now essentially lifetime carers. Those are examples of why the hon. Gentleman is right to say that we need to recognise and value carers as we have not done in the past. Our 10-year strategy is an important process. The outcomes and the journey are clear, as is the destination that we want to get to, but we have to facilitate an awful lot of changes on the ground so that carers get the two things that they said they want. They want a system that is on their side, rather than one against which they are constantly battling, and the right to a life of their own alongside their caring responsibilities, whether than be the right to work or the right to a decent leisure and social life.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/7">I join the hon. Member for Eddisbury in his tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1791" name="Jeremy Wright">the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright)</phrase> for the work he has done chairing the all-party group on dementia. Indeed, I pay tribute to the all-party group for, perhaps, doing more than most all-party groups in respect of undertaking more serious, substantive pieces of work in this area, which have triggered not only public debate, but policy advance as a consequence of that. The hon. Member is absolutely right, sadly, in saying that increasing numbers of people of less than pensionable age&mdash;people in their 40s and 50s&mdash;are being diagnosed with dementia. It is, of course, important that when the final strategy is published, it truly reflects that as a reality. None of us would want 40 and 50-year-olds to receive respite care in residential and nursing homes where the predominant population is people in their 80s and 90s. Some real issues arise. If there are problems with appropriate diagnosis of people in their 60s, 70s and 80s, we can imagine the undoubted difficulties of diagnosing much younger people who have the early symptoms of what will turn out to be dementia.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/8">The hon. Member for Eddisbury asked me to write to him because I cannot provide him with national information. I was puzzled because I was not sure what he was asking me to write to him about. I think he was talking about the provision of specialist mental health beds, but was he referring simply to geriatric mental health beds in inpatient hospitals, or more broadly to that?</p>

	<p pid="a.23.0/1">I am happy to provide clarification. The numbers seem to have been reducing, but that seems to have been on a local and regional basis. They are anecdotal, and written parliamentary answers have not been able to shed any light on the volume. The straight answer to the Minister's question is both: the specialist settings, as well as in hospitals. The main thing is for the elderly mentally infirm to have the capacity to be cared for.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.23.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15b.23.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.23.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" colnum="23"  time="010:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/halltext/80715h0004.htm#08071578000484">
	<p pid="a.23.1/1">We have made progress, but the problem with debates such as this is that they are always about the default mode and the negative. The sort of progress that we have made means that an increasing number of people are being cared for at home or in residential establishments, and are not being cared for on acute hospital wards, although there are still too may people on acute NHS wards. The correlation between the reduction in the number of acute beds and the needs of people with dementia not being met is not necessarily correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/2">I say genuinely that we cannot have political parties and parliamentarians demanding less and less red tape and bureaucracy, and more and more decisions taken by local commissioners responding to the needs of local communities, and then demanding national Government to keep information on everything. The two positions are entirely contradictory. That is why we have some difficulties in those areas. If the hon. Gentleman wants to write to some PCTs or strategic health authorities to see whether they have any hard data that would assist, I advise him to do so. We do not keep that information centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/3">The hon. Gentleman referred to the future of care and support. He continually misquotes me when he talks about wanting a new consensus for a new settlement. I have been saying that for a long time, but I always say that I want a new consensus for a new settlement in terms of the long-term resolution of the future care and support system. I did not use the term in the context of the current spending review period, but the money that has gone into local government, the money that has gone into health, the money that we announced as part of the massive expansion of respite care, and the money that has gone into the transformation agenda for social care is a significant investment. The hon. Gentleman chooses to use only the figure for the money that has gone through local government and is spent specifically by the adult social services department of the local authority. Many more resources are being spent on tacking these issues, and he is aware of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/4">In 1999, we introduced the deferred payment scheme, which should prevent many people from having to sell their homes when they go into care. That is something that the Government introduced, and was not available in the preceding 18 years. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is not clear how many people have used that opportunity, or whether local authorities have, as they should, offered people that option, and we must explore that.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/5">More fundamentally, the demographic challenges facing us, people's rising aspirations for what they expect from care and support, and the cost of dealing only with demographic changes means that there are no easy answers or solutions. The challenge is to define clearly what quality of care people have a right to expect, and then to be clear about the respective responsibilities of the state through general taxation, and what we expect from families, employers and communities in providing the care and support systems that people have a right to expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/6">This is not just about the work that Wanless did, which focused on the over-65s and mainly on the over-85s. It is about all adults from the age of 18, including disabled people who want the right to live independently, and people with mental health problems or with learning difficulties, who also want full lives and the opportunity to live independently. It is also about the increasing number of people who are not older but who have long-term conditions. Our consultation, the Green Paper and the process are very different from what has been spoken of over the past few years in terms of what is necessary for the future of care and support in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.1/1">I will not give way.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.1/2">It remains disappointing that when I constantly ask for a new consensus for a new settlement, Her Majesty's Opposition do not seem to have one contribution make to one of the most important public policy debates in this country. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Leader of the Opposition set up a working party to consider social care. How often has that working party met? We know the answer. It has met hardly ever, if at all. If he wants to correct me, he can write to me with the details of the group that the Leader of the Opposition has established.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.3/1">No, I will not agree to do that during this debate. The issue is ongoing, and one to which we must give serious consideration in the context, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley said, of the changing nature of families and the responsibilities that carers increasingly have in our communities. Of course, we must keep that under review, but when we set up an independent body to make incredibly difficult decisions on access to drugs and treatment, it is wrong that politicians seek to undermine it and to pander to short-term political considerations. That is not the way we should go, but I am delighted that Lord Darzi's report and the new draft constitution on the NHS make it clear that we will end the postcode lottery in access to drugs. When NICE approves drugs, they should be available in every PCT area in every part of the country to every NHS patient as a right. That is a major advance in the NHS constitution that we launched recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.3/2">In conclusion, there is all-party agreement that we must bring dementia out from the shadows. It is one of the greatest challenges facing families in our country, and one of the greatest challenges facing the health and social care system. The Government have demonstrated that they are up to that challenge. We have published a consultation paper on the first ever national dementia strategy, and we will publish the final document in the autumn. The challenge for all of us will then be to ensure that we deliver the strategy so that in every community people with dementia and their families have access to the high quality support that they deserve.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.1/1">I put on record our thanks to the staff of the House who have prepared the briefing&mdash;Greg Howard and his colleagues have done a first-class job and have saved us many hours of research.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/2">It is not often that I buy the <i>Racing Post</i>&mdash;in fact, I do not think I have ever done so before&mdash;but I bought it this morning. At &pound;1.50 it is nearly twice the price of <i>The Guardian&mdash;</i><i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>] </i>It is not quite as left wing as <i>The Guardian</i>, but I spoke to someone this morning who said that the subject we are discussing was going to be in the <i>Racing Post.</i> When I sat down on the tube, a guy saw that I had the <i>Racing Post</i>. He proceeded to tell me about a horse that will be running at Brighton and why. He told me about this great trainer&mdash;I cannot even remember the name now&mdash;and why they run horses at Brighton and run them on the flat late and so on. I just sat there in absolute amazement and did not think anything about it, but it shows that when someone buys the <i>Racing Post </i>people start a conversation.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/3">Last month, Alistair Osborne was quoted in <i>The Sunday Times</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Imagine this. The starting stalls open. Horses thunder down the course. The winning post looms. And then the whole field goes round again. And again. For seven flaming years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/5">To some extent, that is the situation we are debating and, before anybody gets up to make an intervention, I can tell them that I have been party to going round and round the course&mdash;I was probably the ringmaster. My hon. Friend the Minister&mdash;my very good friend&mdash;unfortunately drew the short straw and had to take the matter on from then.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.1/6">We are where we are and it is no good looking back. We must look to the future and I predicate a large part of my argument today on a certainty: Labour Governments were elected in the last two elections on the basis of manifestos that referred to the Tote and how the money from the Tote should go into racing. I believe we are committed to that and I hope that the Government, with the support of the House, can see it through.</p>

If we include other outstanding elements such as the ongoing legal battle about Turf TV, it might be better for the sale of the Tote to be set aside for a given period to allow those matters to settle down and the markets to recover. If 50 per cent. of the sale price is to go to racing, the amount might be higher than could be extracted at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.1/1">That is absolutely right, but I can tell my hon. Friend that in my view the status quo is not an option. If we are not careful, we will lose&mdash;indeed, we are losing&mdash;some of our best people in Wigan. If we are to take advantage of the international marketplace, we must do so now. The worst thing in business is uncertainty and we have massive uncertainty in Wigan. The Tote is a very good product, and it has proved itself time and time again. It has definitely proved itself in the international marketplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/2">From my discussions with people outside the UK, I believe that they would look to the UK to run the international Tote. We cannot leave things in the status quo position. We have to take decisive action. We can do one of two things. We can do what I suggest and flog the shops and set up the Tote; or we can make a clear statement that nothing will happen for X number of years. We cannot leave the Tote in its current position. The Tote is haemorrhaging, which is undermining it. At the end of the day, it will wither on the vine.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.1/3">I am as much to blame as anyone for what has happened, but not wholly so. Nelly Kroes of the European Commission was involved as a result of a challenge raised in Europe. The situation is also a result of our not being more constructive in trying to find a solution, so I take part of the blame. However, I have spoken to a lot of people over the last week or so, and I honestly believe that there is a will to move forward, and that everyone agrees with the basic formula, which includes decoupling the shops.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.0/1">I obviously have not explained myself clearly. We should put the shops into the for sale category and put Mr. Mike Smith in charge, as he is extremely skilled in taking such things to the marketplace. If his judgment is that we should not sell, we should not sell. However, that should not preclude us from decoupling the rest of the Tote from the sale.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/2">We can put the shops into a package and ask Mr. Smith to sell them when he thinks it right. That might be in 12 months, 18 months or whenever, but the only reality is that 50 per cent. of the profit will go into a racing trust at some stage. We can take the decision to decouple now, leaving the shops where they are if that is the judgment of the experts in the marketplace, which I am not. If they say, &quot;Do not sell&quot;, we should not sell.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/3">We should keep the present arrangements until those people decide that it is time to sell, but that should not preclude us from setting up the Tote, the credit line and the internet parts. That will stop the haemorrhaging, so we will be able to start building the Tote nationally, and we will be able to take advantage internationally, which is most important. The two are not mutually exclusive. We should set the shops apart, leaving them and not flogging them until they can achieve the best market return. It is for others to decide when that is; it will not be my judgment. However, it will bring stability back to the Tote.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/4">I predicate my argument on the basis that we should live up to commitments given in two manifestos. I do so because when I go to church club on a Sunday night I know that the people I represent believe that the Tote is an institution that should be kept within betting. It is the right product for the betting arena. It gives more competition, but it is a type of betting where people bet against themselves, because after a cut their return is the total pool.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.2/1">I can see why it would not get past Europe. I shall be honest about this hang-up over Europe. I think that a number of people hide behind Europe&mdash;their definition is that state aid distorts trade across international boundaries. Someone is saying that a Tote sold back to racing in this country will distort trade across Europe, but that is the biggest load of baloney I have ever heard. Civil servants and those in the Treasury want to duck and dive all the time. I have been on the inside track so I know what they are talking about. People are using Europe to fulfil their own objectives and blaming others.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.2/2">I have spoken to Nelly Kroes at length on the subject, and I believe that if the Commission could get shot of Tote UK it would do so. By no definition can the Tote distort trade over international boundaries. Let us put that on one side, and say that if we want to deal with Europe we can do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.2/1">On the point about giving various countries transitional arrangements, would my right hon.

	<p pid="a.33.3/1">That is where one can hit the European Union. The European Union has no responsibility at all for gambling. It tried to bring gambling under its influence during recent discussions on the services directive, but had to take it out for all sorts of reasons. I will not describe them now, because they are not particularly germane to the argument, other than to say that gambling is not part of the European Union's remit and that it does not have the power to bring gambling under its remit. Gambling, however, is brought under that remit in so far as it relates to competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/2">France has not tried to alter its Tote, so the reality is that the status quo prevails. If we want to keep the Tote nationalised and to be able to do what we want with it, the European Community will do nothing about that. It is only when we start changing the Tote that the EU will have a say on how it is changed. Otherwise, the status quo can and will prevail, and the Tote will continue to run as it does now. It is a nationalised organisation, fully funded by the state.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/3">The Tote is in a peculiar situation, but for the sake of the discussion I will respond on the issue of state aid, although I think it is a bogus argument. There would be a seven-year transitional period, and that would take the Tote into the market place once it was fit for purpose. In addition, the long-term profits of part of the Tote fund sport, which should be able to be funded and not brought under competition rules anyway. As part of the Nice protocol in 2000, the Heads of Government declared that sport should be defined separately from other commercial operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/4">What am I proposing this morning? I am saying that the status quo is not an option for the Tote, because it is haemorrhaging and we are losing good staff. Although it is important to get good returns for the taxpayer, it is highly debatable whether the Tote is actually an asset of the taxpayer. No one owned the Tote and it became a taxpayer concern only once we nationalised it. We paid nothing for it, so I do not know how the Treasury can sometimes argue that it belongs to the taxpayer. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> The hon. Member for Tewkesbury is laughing. I was the one who brought the Tote into public ownership, but we now need to look at how we can develop it in the interests of racing, the UK and the punter.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.3/5">As I have said, under my proposals, the Treasury would get its deal, and I have answered the issue on state aid. Racing would get a good income stream, both in the short and medium term, and we could continue to build jobs. I believe that, if we want to, we can resolve the issue of the levy and bring it into the new Tote trust. That would give clear funding streams for sport on the one hand, with good governance by the BHA on the other. I think that the sport would be fit for purpose. Considering that the UK horse racing sport and industry is revered around the world, there would be a major step forward, and I hope that the proposal will be taken seriously and that we can collectively put it together and deliver for sport.</p>

	<p pid="a.34.0/1">May I congratulate the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central on securing this most timely and important debate? Racing is certainly at a crossroads, particularly with regard to funding. I agree with his points on Europe and will return to that issue in a few minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/2">I should point out that I have the honour of representing the Cheltenham race course, although I also value the contributions made by smaller race courses. My involvement in racing is at the lowest level, at the point-to-point and hunter chase level, but I want to point out that the Tote is extremely important to the Cheltenham race course and the surrounding area in my constituency. The festival each March brings millions of pounds into the area, much of it from Ireland. An important point is that the Tote Cheltenham gold cup&mdash;now called the Totesport Cheltenham gold cup&mdash;has been running for many years and is one of the world's leading steeplechases, if not the greatest.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/3">The Tote also provides a great deal of prize money and sponsorship for many other races, not only at Cheltenham, but throughout the country. The Tote's contribution to racing, excluding its levy payments, was &pound;11.3 million last year. If we include the levy payments, its contribution was &pound;20 million last year. The most up-to-date figures are being laid before Parliament today. I do not know what they are, but my guess is that they will show a considerable improvement on what is already a good record for the Tote's contribution to racing.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/4">The Tote is the largest commercial sponsor of racing by a considerable margin: it sponsored 442 races last year and delivered 42 per cent. of the total prize money on offer through the sport. While we often hear that racing is the sport of kings, it is important to point out that the reality is different. Although royalty are involved in racing and make a welcome contribution, on many occasions the money for a race is as little as &pound;2,000. Given the cost of looking after horses, particularly with the current cost of feeding and transportation, prize money is important. The Tote also provides many other services. There are many betting shops, services on race courses and special low-cost bets that are attractive. The Tote is a national institution, so if it were lost, not only would racing lose out financially, but the racegoers would suffer.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/5">As has been said, the Tote was set up 80 years ago to benefit racing. As has also been pointed out, no Government have ever put any money into racing, so the taxpayer is not due any money from a sale or transfer of the Tote. When the then Home Secretary, the present Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, originally announced his intention to transfer or sell the Tote, a figure of &pound;50 million was mentioned. Some people, myself included, said that that was too much and that the taxpayer was due no return at all for the Tote because no taxpayer ever put any money into it.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.0/6">The original decision to transfer or sell the Tote was welcomed, but no one could have envisaged that it would take so long to get from there to where we are now, wherever that might be. During a debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November 2007</phrase>, after Europe stepped into the debate&mdash;I shall return to that point later&mdash;I called for the Government to allow an extra two or three months at least for the Tote to come to terms with the European judgment and look at its future options. Those two or three months were granted by the Government, but that is a short delay for coming to terms with the situation. It is a rather different situation from the 10-year delay that we have experienced.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.0/1">The Conservative Government in the 1980s were quick to justify their privatisation mania on the basis that they were sometimes getting rid of inefficient, loss-making state enterprises. The hon. Member for Tewkesbury portrays the Tote as never having been such an enterprise over an 80-year period. He was one of the more enthusiastic privatisers, although not in this place at the time, so does he believe that the sale of the Tote makes any sense whatever for the taxpayer, the racegoer or anyone else involved in the imbroglio?</p>

	<p pid="a.36.0/1">I was outside this place at the time, but I certainly supported turning British Steel's &pound;1.5 million a day loss into profit. I continue to support that kind of thing, but the Tote is a different situation altogether. It was set up for racing. The right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central, made the case that it is not so much a business as part of a sport, and I shall advance that argument in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/2">As I was saying, we have had a 10-year delay. In a previous debate initiated by Mr. Richard Page, then the Member for South-West Hertfordshire, I urged that the process be completed. The then Minister, who is now the Minister for Pensions Reform, rebuked me by saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Although the hon. Member for Tewkesbury thinks that the process has taken a long time, it has not taken longer than we planned.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2000-01-19.219"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 19 January 2000; Vol. 342, c. 219WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/4">Those words were spoken on <phrase class="date" code="2000-01-19">19 January 2000</phrase>, eight and a half years ago. We were being rebuked for trying to press the matter on. As we have heard, the result of the delay is that the staff at Wigan, whose jobs I believe should be protected, are unsettled, senior members of the Tote have been lost and it is very difficult for the Tote to recruit people. That has had a destabilising effect on it and can hardly be helping its finances. Importantly, it cannot be helping to enhance its value if it is to be sold commercially.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/5">At the risk of embarrassing the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central, who has admitted his culpability in the process to a degree, I add that when the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Bill was introduced in 2004, it was extraordinary that its very purpose, the sale or transfer of the Tote, was not mentioned in it. The only thing that was included in the Bill was the nationalisation of the Tote, as a number of us pointed out at the time. It was stated outside the House that the purpose was to transfer the Tote to the new trust, which was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Lipsey, but that was not stated in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/6">The late Robin Cook, who took an active role in racing, said in the debate on the 2004 Act:</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/7" class="indent">&quot;For the avoidance of doubt, will my right hon. Friend&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/8">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central, who was then the Minister&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/9" class="indent">&quot;confirm that it is the Government's clear intention to sell the Tote to the racing trust, and that there is no reason at the moment why that should not happen?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/10">The right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/11" class="indent">&quot;I can give my right hon. Friend that confirmation... I see no reason why the sale of the Tote to the racing trust should not go ahead&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/12">Rather ominously, he continued,</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/13" class="indent">&quot;but it would be wrong if the Government did not make provision for other eventualities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/14">That concerned me deeply, and I said that</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/15" class="indent">&quot;the Bill does not guarantee that the Tote will be sold to the racing trust. The Minister says that he cannot foresee any circumstances in which that would not happen, but one factor that might prevent such a sale would be if the Government asked for too much money.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-01-08.442"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 January 2004; Vol. 416, c.442-43</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/16">Later in the debate, I asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/17" class="indent">&quot;What guarantee do we have that it will not just be sold to the highest bidder? What guarantee do we have that the Government's finances at that time, which are deteriorating, will not dictate that the Tote is sold to the highest bidder?&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-01-08.482"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 January 2004; Vol. 416, c.482</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/18">I claim no particular insider foresight because I got it spot on, but the Tote is now to be sold to the highest bidder, which concerns me for a number of reasons.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, but may I guide him by saying that the use of the term &quot;fair price&quot; in the 2004 Act, instead of &quot;market price&quot;, was where the whole thing fell down with Europe? We tried to defend the word &quot;fair&quot; as against &quot;market&quot;, but Europe believed that that meant that we were giving a subsidy. Rightly or wrongly, that was the argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/2">We had a long debate and discussion with the EU about whether the price should be a fair price or a market price, and it demanded that it be a market price because of the distortion of trade. Whether we accept it or not, that was its argument. That was what Neelie Kroes, the Commissioner, insisted on, which was why we got into the long discussion about what the market price was. We paid millions to have assessments made by accountants' firms, and we found ourselves in difficulty. The process fundamentally broke down at the European Union at that time, and others hid behind that later on.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.2/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" name="Richard Caborn">the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn)</phrase> on securing this important and timely debate. I thank him and his successor, the current Minister, for keeping myself and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> up to date with all the twists and turns in the saga. They have done that well both formally and informally, which has helped both of us greatly.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.2/2">My interest in the Tote is unashamedly one-dimensional. I have only a passing interest in racing, which is not a sport that particularly attracts me. My interest is the fact that the Tote's headquarters are in my constituency. Its financial headquarters are in my right hon. Friend's constituency. The Tote came to Wigan some 20 years ago. It was not an easy shift. It is never easy prising southerners out of Harrods and sorting them out with woad and whippets, but we managed to get them up there and they work well with the local authority. The local authority felt that it was so important to the local economy to get the Tote to come to Wigan that it evicted members of its staff from their offices to put Tote staff in there, and make it a success. The fact that the Tote is still in Wigan, and is a success, proves that that was right.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.2/3">We have some 600 employees in Wigan. Working relationships are extremely good, with the management, trade unions and work force working well together. That is not only because the Tote a good employer, but the nature of the work is flexible as to the times when people work; mothers can work around school times, and so on. That makes the Tote a valuable employer in the Wigan economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.2/4">A few years ago we managed to get the rest of the Tote to come to Wigan&mdash;the senior staff. They are very important to the Wigan local economy, which like many local economies in the country is in transition, from heavy industry&mdash;the steel, mining, cotton and textiles on which it used to be based&mdash;to a more modern, service industry-based economy. Getting the staff headquarters to come to Wigan was very important. We had last-minute planning difficulties and again the council evicted some staff to move the Tote into their offices. That is more proof of the importance of the Tote to the local economy, and the council's view of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.2/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1708" name="Alan Meale">the Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale)</phrase> was profoundly wrong when he implied that the matter could be left over. It is very important to get a resolution now. I have learned from discussions with the Tote that senior management are already being lost, and in a service industry of this kind it is not infrastructure such as buildings that is the most important thing&mdash;it is senior management, and the way they run the organisation. When they are lost, not only does the value of the Tote go down, but the value with respect to whatever sale is made will go down too. It is not just that we need to take account of something in the outside market; it is also a question of the nature of the industry. If it loses its senior management it will lose market value as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.2/6">The Minister and his predecessor have been pressing strongly on the future of the Tote. The leader of Wigan council, my noble Friend Lord Smith of Leigh, my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield and I want a resolution in the interest of our constituents who work in Wigan. We have a meeting tomorrow at the highest level&mdash;with the Prime Minister. Our one aim will be to impress on him the need to ensure that whatever resolution is reached, it is decided on swiftly, with a guarantee for a number of years that the headquarters of the Tote and its successor will be in Wigan. We are confident that if that guarantee is given, for four, five or seven years, or whatever it may be, the successor will find that Wigan is such a good place for its headquarters that it will stay there and take the opportunities in the international betting field that my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central outlined, so that they can not only maintain job opportunities but expand them, and make Wigan a centre for the betting industry nationally and internationally. That is what we will be pressing for, and that is why it is so important and timely that we have had the debate, and that we reach a resolution as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Hood, for calling me in this important debate. It is always a great pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" name="Richard Caborn">the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn)</phrase>, and I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1925" name="Neil Turner">the Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner)</phrase> were singing from the same song sheet. I make my remarks not as a new Labour &quot;toshite&quot; but as chairman of the all-party group on racing and bloodstock.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/2">I do not want to repeat what has already been said, but a few historical points that have not yet been made fully need to come out. The onward sale of the Tote has been an issue for some time. In fact, it was the Select Committee on Home Affairs, which also brought about the formation of the British Horseracing Board, the forerunner of the British Horseracing Authority, that in 1991 recommended that the Tote should be passed to racing for free. The points that I am making are to underline and support the model put forward by my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/3">In 2001 the Labour party manifesto said:</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We are committed to sell the Tote to a racing trust to allow it to compete commercially, with all long-term profits invested in the sport.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/5">The Tote is making a &pound;20 million-a-year contribution and we would like it to continue in perpetuity, as it were. In 2005, after the European ruling, the Labour party manifesto said:</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Having now passed the necessary legislation&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/7">to bring the Tote under public ownership, as the hon. Member for Tewkesbury has said&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/8" class="indent">&quot;we remain committed to completing the sale of the Tote to a racing trust.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/9">Throughout the process with the changing conditions and environment, racing has been committed to helping the Government achieve their objective. However, it has also been made clear that any potential buyer will need to work closely with racing. The Government should pay tribute to the racing industry for its contribution to taking the issue forward. I know that we do not seem to have had much success so far, but we can only keep trying. As co-chair of the all-party group on racing and bloodstock I commend the Minister for asking us to get actively involved in many of the outstanding issues in racing, which include the onward sale of the Tote and the levy. It is important that we ask the Government to continue with the granting of the seven-year exclusive licence for the so-called transition period, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central referred. That must be part and parcel of the sale.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.40.1" nospeaker="true" colnum="40"  time="011:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/halltext/80715h0007.htm#08071578000008">
	<p pid="a.40.1/1">One implication that has not been mentioned so far, and another current problem affecting revenue streams into racing, is the number of offshore operators in the betting market. I am not just referring to the Tote but to other betting forms, exchanges and betting operators. I would like the Minister to try to give some assurance that any eventual purchaser of the Tote could not relocate its remote operations&mdash;call centre and internet operations&mdash;offshore. I should certainly like clarification of that, because it is a significant weakness of the sport's current funding arrangements that several companies are licensed overseas. There are operators in the Isle of Man, Gibraltar, Ireland, Malta and so on, who pay no levy and no tax to racing. We do not want to lose another whole income stream for racing and the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/2">I intervened on my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central about the onward 50 per cent. that will come to racing, hopefully, as quickly as possible, if the sale proceeds. There is some doubt; the difference between the gross and the net, of course, is in issues such as accounting for pensions deficits, the Government's professional fees, and all such money that might be sliced off instead of giving the 50 per cent. gross amount of the sale to racing. I would like the Minister to comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/3">What we might call the Dick Caborn or Cook model for the future onward sale of the Tote is a seductive and attractive option. I am attracted to it because I do not think that the Government should be committed to selling the Tote to racing. Decoupling the property estate of 540 shops&mdash;setting up a racing trust just for pool betting and selling off the betting shops&mdash;sounds attractive in theory, but I have my doubts about the value in practice of selling on the Tote pool or setting up a racing trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/4">It would be difficult to get all the race courses to agree to continue having the Tote. The on-course Tote pool is attractive at Cheltenham or Doncaster St. Leger, my local track, but it is not so attractive on a wet Monday afternoon at Great Leighs or Southwell. We can all come up with examples. I have some doubts. If racing cannot come up with a price for the whole estate, why can we not consider splitting the 540 shops? Perhaps 270 could be contained within the racing trust and the Tote, and the other 270 could be sold to the highest bidder. I have some doubts, although in theory I would like to support that proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/5">The other issue was combination, another attractive proposal to link the levy to the new Tote and bring in an arbitration mechanism similar to that used by the Copyright Tribunal. That is an attractive option as well, and I would certainly like to hear the Minister's comments on that model. My right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central said that, hopefully, it could become operational by <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-01">1 January 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/6">On the current credit crunch, the all-party group on racing and bloodstock industries held its annual dinner last night. The chairman of the British Horseracing Authority, Paul Roy, is an expert in the City; he makes his money doing deals on the stock exchange and so on. He said&mdash;I will use his exact expression, because I made a note of it&mdash;that the current valuation of the Tote was &quot;shot to pieces&quot;. Earlier this year, it was &pound;400 million or &pound;500 million. It started from a baseline of &pound;50 million, as the hon. Member for Tewkesbury said earlier. That is a difficult issue to get around, and I do not know the answer to it.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.1/1">I am trying to draw my remarks to a close, Mr. Gale. I thank my right hon. Friend for his intervention and his clarification of the model that he suggested. I hope that the Minister will respond specifically to it in summing up.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/2">I have not underlined the significance of the Tote to the local economy in Wigan. I speak as a former leader of Barnsley, which is in the same group of authorities and is similar in size to Wigan, another white working-class area. Barnsley is on the wrong side of the Pennines, but apart from that, it has many characteristics in common with Wigan. As a former leader of Barnsley, I would hate to lose a big company like that with an international reputation. I hope that that aspect will be uppermost in the Minister's deliberations if and when he comes to a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.1/3">I will finish on a couple of points that were raised earlier. The Minister mentioned the outstanding Turf TV case. I understand that the jury will deliberate on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-31">31 July</phrase>. I am sure that appeals will be made, which will drag out the case. It is probably a commercially sensitive situation, what with Goldman Sachs. Can he outline how many bids have been received and how many of those he feels are positive bids that ought to be considered rather than dismissed? How many are serious bids? One point on which I disagreed with the hon. Member for Tewkesbury involved referring the matter back to Europe. It took two years to bottom it the last time it was referred to Europe, and I can see it dragging out for a further two years. That is the last thing that the people of Wigan want. I will leave it there. The issue is important to the House, but it is particularly important to the people who work in Wigan.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.42.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="42"  time="012:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/halltext/80715h0007.htm#08071578000521">
	<p pid="a.42.2/1">I shall keep my remarks brief in order to allow the Minister to respond, hopefully in some detail. It has been clear from today's very welcome debate that some hon. Members here are much more familiar with the history of the Tote than I am. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" name="Richard Caborn">The right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn)</phrase> has played a central role in the painful, extended labour that is the debate about where the Tote will ultimately end up. I have never bought a copy of the <i>Racing Post</i>, although I confess to being an occasional purchaser of <i>The Guardian</i>; obviously, I need to change my purchasing habits, or I will not have access to insider tips about which horse to bet on at which racecourse.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/2">The Tote is a large employer, as a number of Members have made clear. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1925" name="Neil Turner">The hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner)</phrase> made a naked pitch for jobs&mdash;as good constituency Members, we all understand that he should&mdash;and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> made a strong point, which had not been debated until he raised it, about offshore betting and how it affects the industry as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/3">The Tote is a large employer, with 4,000 employees. Members have referred to its 450 shops, or 540&mdash;I am not quite sure what the number is&mdash;and its large presence throughout the country. It has significant employment implications. The Tote, along with the levy, makes a substantial contribution to the industry, so we need to resolve the issue. The policy has had a long gestation period; Members will have seen the time line helpfully provided by the British Horseracing Authority, which did not go back in any detail to 1928, when the original Act of Parliament was passed, but concentrated on more recent years, including the announcement in March 2000 of the intention to sell the Tote to a racing trust and two separate manifesto commitments that it would be appropriate for the Government to uphold.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/4">My final comments relate to the points made by the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central, who introduced the debate. He described clearly where we need to go from here: delivering on the manifesto commitment, which is a responsibility for the Minister to pick up; delivering for the Treasury, which is clearly seeking something out of the sale; delivering for racing, most importantly, and ensuring that the industry continues to receive the support that it needs; ensuring as far as possible that jobs are secure; and allowing the Tote to grow and take advantage of the many technological developments emerging with the internet and so on, to allow it to extend to other markets and ensure its long-term survivability.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/5">The right hon. Member made an interesting proposal about decoupling the Tote shops from the Tote. Other Members have rightly questioned the timing of that, in relation to where the market is nationally and internationally, and questioned whether now is the best time to secure the best possible value. I shall listen carefully to the Minister's response to see how he intends to address that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/6">I think that the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central said that the racehorses have been going around the course for the past seven years. I hope that the Minister can reassure us that they will not be going around it for another seven years.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.0/1">I do not want to cause even more division among Labour Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/2">I pay tribute to the horse racing fraternity. The one thing that unites us on both sides of the House is the importance of horse racing to British industry. We can be rightly proud of horse racing in the UK. We now have 60 race courses employing more than 88,000 people, and about 9,000 races a years. I understand that about &pound;10 billion is bet through off-course bookmakers, and a study by Deloitte last year suggested that it contributes well over &pound;3 billion to the economy&mdash;a significant sum of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/3">In a previous debate in this Chamber, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> suggested that it sometimes seems that there are as many bodies representing different parts of racing as there are races. I am sure that the Minister will agree that a little consolidation would be a small step in helping us to move forward. Sadly, however, on the matter before us there have been too many headlines on the front pages of our newspapers, not least in the <i>Racing Post</i><i>, </i>rather than on the back pages. It is grabbing the news for the wrong reasons, which is the background to today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/4">Three outstanding issues hover over the industry. The first, which has been mentioned, is the resolution of the levy&mdash;the annual lump sum agreed by the levy board and paid by the bookmakers to horse racing. The second issue is the on-course bookmakers dispute, their legal status and the charge that they pay to a race course, which has been thrown into disarray by drafting errors in the Gambling Act 2005. The third issue is the subject of today's debate&mdash;the future of the Tote itself, which was first mooted back in 1999, but still rumbles on.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/5">I pay tribute to hon. Members who have commented today. All spoke with passion, not least my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase>, who illustrated the Tote's importance to Cheltenham and the value that it brings not only to that race course, but to others around the country. I pay tribute to the all-party group on racing and bloodstock industries, which provides a wealth of experience. However, I find it bizarre that the Government, who are tasked to solve such problems, have handed over responsibility to a parliamentary group that does not have the clerical support or the finances to answer the questions. I wonder whether the Culture, Media and Sport Committee might have been a better source of scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/6">The battle scars of this saga are well documented, and they have been mentioned again today. The matter was first raised by Labour in 1999 and again in an election pledge in June 2001 to sell off the Tote. In 2004 there was the debacle with the European Union about a possible conflict with state aid. Another election pledge followed in May 2005, and although we did not actually have an election in 2007&mdash;of course we thought that we might&mdash;I am sure that if we look in the archives one day, we will see that it would have been in that election manifesto, too. We could place bets on whether it will be in the June 2010 election manifesto. Who knows? Perhaps the Glasgow, East by-election will have an influence on whether that date changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/7">Sadly, the question about the future of the Tote has rumbled on, as has repeatedly been mentioned today. Bids have been agreed, then scuppered, prices confirmed, then rebuffed, Government announcements made and retractions issued. The industry is calling for stability, but all we get from the Government is uncertainty by the barrel load.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/8">The Minister and I first crossed paths about one year ago when we were both appointed to our current posts, and it was in relation to a statutory instrument&mdash;the draft Gambling Act 2005 (Horserace Totalisator Board) Order 2007, which is quite a mouthful. It amended the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004. The Tote should have been sold off, for which the Act made provision, but because that was not going to happen when the Act came into fruition, an SI had to be introduced to allow the state to continue ownership. That was when we first raised the issue before us.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/9">At that time the Minister and I were pretty kind to each other because we were still trying to understand our briefs. We are now a little wiser and are more familiar with the issues. We are not as grey as the former Minister for Sport, although it is clear from the manner in which he gives his speeches that he has not lost any of his energy&mdash;clearly, he is still eating three Shredded Wheat in the morning. Long may his energy continue. I pay tribute to the fact that he still wants to participate in the debate, long after he hung up his ministerial boots.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/10">The SI was a chance for the Minister to understand the issues and to spell out what he was going to do, now that he had responsibility for the situation. When asked how much time it would take, he replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/11" class="indent">&quot;I am aware of the length of time that has been taken... The latest bid is being considered and I hope that an announcement can be made very shortly on the decision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/12">I jumped up and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/13" class="indent">&quot;You were not the Minister then&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/14">which is why it was not his fault. The reply came:</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/15" class="indent">&quot;And it was not my fault. I fully understand the concern that a decision be taken. I hope that that can be done very quickly after proper evaluation of the bid.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Fifth Delegated Legislation Committee,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-10">10 July 2007</phrase>; c. 5.]</p>
	<p pid="a.44.0/16">A year later, we are none the wiser about what is going on and many questions remain in the air.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.4/1">The point is that the right hon. Gentleman was the Minister, and the industry has suffered because no decision was made. &quot;Sorry, guv, but it's not my fault&quot;, does not wash. We need action. I do not want to be talking to the Minister in seven years and hearing his big idea after he has been moved on to another job. We need action today&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i>The right hon. Gentleman points to his notes and says, &quot;This is the answer&quot;, but where was it seven years ago? Why did he not come up with those ideas back then? Why does he wait until he has retired from his post before saying, &quot;I have finally woken up and thought of something that I can put forward&quot;? It is very late in the day indeed. That is why the industry is fed up and frustrated with the Government&mdash;nothing has come forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.4/2">We need a conclusion to the saga. I remind the Minister what he said in November in response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.46.4/3" class="indent">&quot;I can give the assurance that the hon. Member for Bath was looking for regarding what will happen if we do not sell the Tote to racing and it goes on the open market. The agreement was that 50 per cent. would go to the horse racing industry, and I am happy to put that on the record.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2007-11-21.134"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 21 November 2007; Vol. 467, c. 134WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.46.4/4">I hope that he will confirm today that that will continue to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.4/5">I conclude by asking the Minister some questions. What is the current value of the Tote? He has already been asked that. What is the timetable for its sale? What advice has he received from Goldman Sachs? I understand that Goldman Sachs has produced an internal report, and we would very much like a copy of it. What impact will a review of fixed odds betting terminals have? They have not been mentioned, but they provide a phenomenal amount of money for bookies. Will a review affect the price, and how will it fit in with any timetable? Does the Minister endorse any of the proposals suggested, six years late, by the former Minister for Sport?</p>
	<p pid="a.46.4/6">I congratulate the former Minister on what has been a unique experience. He put his hands up and said, &quot;I got it wrong.&quot; I hope that is a new trend for the Government and former Ministers. I pay tribute to the right hon. Gentleman's continued involvement in the industry. Many Ministers and hon. Members think, &quot;That's it, my portfolio has finished,&quot; and do not bother looking back. We should recognise that that is not the case with the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.4/7">As has been said again and again&mdash;I say this as the spokesman for the official Opposition&mdash;we share the goal of bringing the matter to a conclusion. However, I fear that with only 24 months left until the general election, it might not be a priority for the Prime Minister. I mention him because I do not believe that it will be left to the Minister to take the decision. The issue is similar to that of arcades. I know the Minister wanted a result with stakes and prizes, but it was the Prime Minister's Office that scuppered the final announcement. I hope that that will not be the case with this issue. Racing is said to be the sport of kings but, unfortunately, it has had a right royal kicking from the Government, as have the Tote, the levy and on-course bookies. I hope the Minister has some good news for us today.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.0/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Gale, and I am grateful to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" name="Richard Caborn">the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn)</phrase> for securing such a timely debate. I do not accept any of the charges against the Government about trying to resolve the matter of the Tote. We have tried to work with the complexity of racing and betting organisations to resolve the three issues that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/2">Before I go into detail, in the little time available, I pay tribute to the work of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1925" name="Neil Turner">the Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner)</phrase>, who have consistently supported the work force of the Tote. The likely impact on jobs and the economy in the north-west is an important consideration for me, and I hope that they have a fruitful meeting with m right hon. Friend the Prime Minister tomorrow. I shall certainly make him aware of the issues that they have raised over some time.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/3">Since becoming the Minister with responsibility for sport, I have not been short of advice about different sectors, but particularly racing. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central for admitting his responsibility for the matter over many years, which he tried to resolve in the best interests of racing. He has been a friend of racing and the Tote for many years. Indeed, he still is. It is right that he should try to come up with a solution, and I shall address the detail of his proposals. However, I am slightly concerned that he dismissed Europe rather lightly. Given that he was an architect of the European White Paper on sport, I am not sure that he has taken a consistent approach in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/4">My right hon. Friend will know better than anyone that the Government have tried to secure a sale of the Tote to racing interests. Their original intention to sell the Tote to a racing trust foundered in 2006 on the state aid ground. There were two subsequent attempts to sell it, first to a racing consortium, and then to a consortium of racing and Tote staff in 2007, but those attempts failed because we could not meet the independently assessed market value needed to allow a sale to proceed lawfully under state aid rules. As a former Minister with responsibility for competition, like my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield, I know that we face competition issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/5">It was with great reluctance that I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-05">5 March</phrase> that we had exhausted all practical options for the sale of racing, and that we would prepare for an open market sale with the aim of maximising taxpayer value. I make no apology for wanting to maximise that value. The Government had previously recognised, during the passage through the House of Lords of the paving legislation for the sale of the Tote&mdash;the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004&mdash;that a sale to racing in line with policy intentions might not prove possible. My noble Friend, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/6" class="indent">&quot;If for some reason a sale to the trust cannot be completed, then it remains the Government's intention to sell all the securities to a third party, with half the proceeds being paid into the Consolidated Fund and half paid, under the authority of the Appropriation Act, to a body or bodies representing the interests of British horseracing. Any sale and payment will have to comply with European Union rules on state aid.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-10-11.37"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 11 October 2004; Vol. 665, c. WA37</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/7">I stand by that commitment, and we will bring forward proposals if the Government decide to proceed with a sale on the open market. The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East chided me for the length of time that the matter has taken, but I want to get it right. I want to ensure that racing benefits and that we do the right thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/8">I was struck by the point that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1708" name="Alan Meale">the Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale)</phrase> made about current economic conditions. As for our intentions, I have the Goldman Sachs report, which we will consider, and we hope to take a decision&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.50.1/1">I thank Mr. Speaker for granting me this Adjournment debate despite the application of the sub judice rule. This case is of the utmost importance to the Hill family in my constituency, and I am pleased to see the Minister in his place to listen again to the story of Laura Michelle Hill and the events surrounding her tragic death in Argentina. I shall concentrate my remarks on the provision of consular services by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; I certainly shall not seek to pre-empt the coroner's findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/2">Laura Hill was an independent and vibrant 25-year-old woman. She worked as a dental nurse and, having saved enough money, embarked, like so many young people, on a South American adventure with some friends. I have spoken to her GP, who confirmed that Laura was in good health. She was the much-loved daughter of Alison and Kevin Hill. Laura arrived in Argentina last summer, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-19">19 August 2007</phrase>, and kept in regular contact with her family in Eastbourne until <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-14">14 September</phrase>, when the phone calls stopped. Her parents had no reason to suspect that anything was amiss until, to their horror, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-02">2 October</phrase>, the police arrived at their door to inform them of their daughter's death. The following day, the Foreign Office contacted the Hills and appointed a family liaison officer from Sussex police. The initial reports from Argentina indicated that Laura had been found dead on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October</phrase>, sitting alone on a park bench in Buenos Aires. Her parents were told that Laura had died of natural causes, but that terrible tragedy has been made even worse&mdash;if that is possible&mdash;by the lack of accurate or timely information about the circumstances of Laura's death, the lack of understanding and support from the FCO for Laura's family and, in particular, the failings of the consular service in Argentina. Since Laura's death last October, her parents have struggled to uncover the truth of her death, and for almost 10 months, they have been given conflicting information through the consulate and the FCO. Even the cause of death is still unclear.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/3">Whatever the risks that an individual assumes when travelling abroad, the Foreign Office should demonstrate a greater concern for the unexplained death of a British national in a foreign country. I shall go into detail about the events following Laura's death to put on the record the entire story. It has not been easy to piece those events together&mdash;only by pressing the UK consular officials in Argentina, the Foreign Office in the UK and, finally, the Minister himself, were we able to gather what little information we have.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/4">I shall start at the beginning. On the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-02">2 October 2007</phrase>, Mr. and Mrs. Hill were interrupted by a visit from the police, giving them the worst news of their lives. They then contacted the Foreign Office, and were told that Laura had died of pulmonary oedema&mdash;of natural causes&mdash;and was said to have been found the day before on a park bench. Despite the Hills' distressing situation, they decided to remain in the UK. They had no reason to suspect that Laura had died of anything other than natural causes, especially since the toxicology reports were not expected until December. The Argentine authorities were not treating the case as suspicious, and they seemed to make no attempt to trace Laura's travelling companions, her belongings or where she was staying at the time. However, was it not obvious from the outset that there was something suspicious about the circumstances? Laura was healthy, young and did not have any significant health problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/5">Like all parents in such a situation, Alison and Kevin Hill could sense that something was not right, and they were concerned that the investigation was being delayed. When they came to my advice surgery on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-31">31 October</phrase>, they still had not seen the results of the autopsy that had been carried out in Argentina, and they also feared that Laura's organs would not return with her body, as Argentine law does not require any consent for their removal. I immediately wrote to the Minister expressing those concerns. Three weeks later, and before the Minister's response arrived, the autopsy report came through, and only then did the actual circumstances surrounding Laura's death begin to emerge.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/6">I remind the Chamber of the initial reports. The Foreign Office told the Hills that Laura had been found on a park bench and had died of natural causes. The autopsy report, however, could not have been more contradictory. She had been found not on a park bench but in the first-floor hallway of an apartment building. She had suffered extensive bruising on various parts of her body, and other tests suggest that she may have been interfered with sexually. She had fluid in her lungs, but the question is, what caused it? Three days later, the Minister's reply arrived, but I am afraid it offered little in the way of support or new information. In fact, the only comfort to the Hills was the part of the Minister's letter that stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The Argentine authorities have informed us that small samples of Laura's organs have been removed in order to carry out toxicology tests but they confirmed that the organs would be returned with Laura's body.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/8">It mentioned nothing about the autopsy reports or the conflicting information from Argentina. Even though the report strongly suggested that Laura did not die from natural causes, the Foreign Office, as far as I am aware, did nothing to press for a more thorough investigation in Argentina.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/9">In the letter, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/10" class="indent">&quot;We cannot seek a speedier investigation for a British national than would be the norm for an Argentine national.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/11">With respect, I do not think that that is the point. Whatever the nationality of the deceased, the FCO should press throughout for an expeditious, thorough and efficient investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/12">As you can imagine, Mr. Gale, the situation caused Mr. and Mrs. Hill a great deal of anguish. The Argentine authorities then indicated that they were prepared to release Laura's body, but what were Mr and Mrs Hill to do? They wanted their daughter back in the UK, because they wanted to bury her, but they also wanted to find out who, if anyone, was responsible for her death. Given the lack of information from the Foreign Office, I pressed Sussex police for a meeting about the progress of the investigation. Sussex police will not, I hope, mind if I describe their attitude as one of frustration. They would in principle be delighted to assist in any proper investigation, but of course they have no jurisdiction. It was, and still is, open to the Argentine authorities to invite them to participate in an investigation, and if the coroner were to return a particular verdict, that would give the police some jurisdiction, but no such invitation has been received. Again, the FCO could and should have raised that issue with the Argentine authorities. When I made the suggestion, the FCO took the view that it would not be appropriate and suggested an approach by Sussex police via Interpol.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/13">At times during this case, it has escaped me why we bother to have diplomatic representation at all. It was decided that it would be appropriate for Laura to be returned to the UK for a second post-mortem, provided her organs were returned with the body. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-23">23 November 2007</phrase>, Mr. and Mrs. Hill received an e-mail from the embassy in Argentina, confirming that it was standard procedure for the organs to be returned, so at great expense, they engaged the services of Rowland Brothers to repatriate the body, thinking that a second post-mortem in the UK would produce more answers than a prolonged investigation in Argentina. That decision was based on the assurances the Hills had received that Laura would be returned with her organs. They would not have repatriated her if they had had any reason to believe otherwise. Laura's body was officially repatriated on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-20">20 December</phrase> and arrived back in England on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-21">21 December</phrase>. It was agreed with Sussex police that a Home Office forensic pathologist would conduct a second post-mortem, which was arranged for early in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/14">The Hills were informed some days later that, despite constant reassurances from all sides, Laura's organs had been retained in Argentina. That was, of course, largely the fault of the Argentine authorities, but both the funeral directors and the consulate could have taken greater care to check the position. To make matters worse, the toxicology reports finally arrived&mdash;coincidentally, after Laura's repatriation&mdash;and indicated that Laura had a lethal dose of cocaine in her body when she died. I am told that the dose was so high that it was unlikely that Laura could have administered it herself, but without the organs that could not be confirmed by the coroner in Sussex.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/15">I continued to press the FCO. The Minister was good enough to meet me, and he conceded that this was &quot;a dreadful case&quot;. He said that he would contact our ambassador in Argentina, but in a further letter he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The FCO has limited funding for helping those in general need of Consular assistance and this regrettably does not extend to repatriating those who have died abroad.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/17">That may be true, but it entirely misses the point. By that stage, Laura's body&mdash;minus the organs&mdash;had already been repatriated at the family's expense. The FCO made the position very clear in a further response to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/18" class="indent">&quot;We remain unable to provide financial assistance for the repatriation of the fragments of Laura Michelle Hill's organs from Argentina to the UK.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/19">It then turned out that the Argentine authorities were no longer willing to communicate with consular staff. Mr. and Mrs Hill were told that they would have to employ a lawyer if they wanted to receive any more information about their daughter.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/20">More recently, it has belatedly come to light that there was an Argentine police report on Laura's death, which apparently stated that there was an investigation into Laura's death and that she died in suspicious circumstances. As yet, I have not seen that report, but its conclusions are clearly very much at odds with what the family were originally told. Without Laura's organs, the coroner cannot complete the post-mortem. Mr. and Mrs Hill are no closer to finding out the whole truth about their daughter's death than they were on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-02">2 October</phrase> last year. They do not know who to turn to now. In short, they are in a hopelessly circular situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/21">When I originally applied for this debate, it was out of total frustration as the Hills' constituency Member of Parliament. I was initially advised that the debate could not be granted because of the sub judice rule. In short, because the Sussex coroner had opened the inquest, then immediately adjourned it, we could not debate it in the House. However, the coroner cannot hold a meaningful inquest unless and until Laura's vital organs are available for a proper autopsy. In his letter to me of <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-04">4 February</phrase>, the coroner's own frustration is almost palpable:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/22" class="indent">&quot;The situation with regard to the retention of the deceased's internal organs by the Argentinian authorities is most regrettable and I can readily see not only the anguish this must cause to Laura's parents but also the frustration felt by them and the investigating officers because of the way their absence hampers the full autopsy I would wish to have carried out in this country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/23">I am therefore really grateful, as are Laura's family, that the Speaker has been willing to use his discretion in this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/24">I do not believe that the Foreign Office has been as helpful as it could have been. It has not pressed for a meaningful investigation into Laura's death in Argentina and it has left the most important questions surrounding Laura's death unanswered. Perhaps the concerns are best expressed in Mrs. Hill's own words. She wrote this to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/25" class="indent">&quot;The FCO have taken no responsibility for all of the information they gave us, which was mostly wrong; we do not understand how they readily accepted this without making proper enquiries...We were constantly told that we would not get any help because there was no investigation; this was not true. Surely their job should be to make sure they have as much information as possible to pass on to families when a British citizen dies abroad? We feel we have been treated without any kind of compassion, with no support at all; and what makes it worse is that we put our complete faith in them and believed they were doing everything they could for Laura and her family. How wrong we were.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/26">I am sure that the consular service has many dedicated people working for it, who help thousands of British citizens who get into difficulties across the globe every year, whether it is because of a lost passport or something more serious. However, let me end by pointing out a supreme irony. By coincidence, there landed on my desk a couple of days ago a letter from the FCO, which was presumably sent to all hon. Members. It said that the FCO was proposing to republish its booklet, &quot;Support for British Nationals Abroad: A Guide&quot;. The letter said that the guide sets out</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/27" class="indent">&quot;the full range of consular assistance available to British nationals in distress abroad.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/28">The letter then invited me to contribute ideas for inclusion in the new version of the guide. Well, I hope that those drafting the guide will find this debate to be of assistance in their task.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/29">Even at this late stage, I hope that the Minister will agree to arrange the repatriation of Laura's organs so that a proper post-mortem can now take place, followed by an inquest. Laura's funeral finally took place on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-28">28 April</phrase>, but her family still desperately need to achieve closure in this matter. I hope that today the Minister can help them to do that.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.0/1">First, I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1564" name="Nigel Waterson">the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson)</phrase> for securing this debate. I am grateful to him for raising the case of Laura Hill and I welcome the opportunity to outline our consular services and the assistance that we have provided to Mr. and Mrs. Hill.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/2">As the East Sussex coroner may decide to hold an inquest into Laura's death, and as I would certainly not wish to prejudice the outcome of such an inquest, there are aspects of this case that I am not able to discuss at this time. Nevertheless, I would like to extend my deepest condolences to Laura's family for the loss that they have suffered. Laura Hill first came to the attention of consular staff on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>, when the Argentine police notified the British embassy in Buenos Aires of her death. The embassy was informed that she had died on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-01">1 October</phrase> in the common area of an apartment block, where it is believed that she was visiting a friend of her boyfriend. The sad news of Laura's death was passed to our consular staff in London. After confirming her address in the United Kingdom, consular staff asked Sussex police to attend the address. Officers went to the address and passed the sad news to Laura's parents, Kevin and Alison Hill, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-02">2 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/3">Mr. and Mrs. Hill telephoned consular staff at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London the next day. We offered our condolences on the tragic loss of their daughter and provided them with information on options for repatriating Laura's body, including details of international funeral directors who would be able to repatriate Laura's remains. Consular staff confirmed this information in writing later that day. Sussex police quickly appointed a family liaison officer to assist Mr. and Mrs. Hill and to act as a point of contact between them and consular staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/4">The post-mortem carried out by the Argentine authorities on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-05">5 October</phrase> indicated that Laura died of pulmonary congestion and acute oedema, but it stated that further toxicology and histopathology examinations needed to be carried out. We were informed that those examinations would take 15 to 20 days. That information was conveyed to Mr. and Mrs. Hill on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-05">5 October</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-30">30 October</phrase>, we informed the family that the full post-mortem results and police report would not be ready until mid-December. We also advised Mrs. Hill to appoint a local lawyer&mdash;that is, a lawyer in Argentina&mdash;but she declined a copy of our list of English-speaking lawyers in the Buenos Aires area.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-09">9 November</phrase>, we were advised that Laura's body could be released to the care of a funeral director to begin the administrative process in preparation for repatriation. We advised Mr. and Mrs. Hill of this, and advised them that Laura's body could be moved from the municipal mortuary to a funeral home, but we understood that the family had concerns that the investigation into Laura's death would not be completed in a satisfactory way once her body had left the care of the authorities, so they chose to leave her body at the municipal mortuary.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-05">5 December</phrase>, the presiding judge authorised the release of Laura's body for repatriation to the United Kingdom, but Mr. and Mrs. Hill had yet to instruct an international funeral director to act on their behalf. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-06">6 December</phrase>, consular staff in London and the FCO police adviser met members of Sussex police and advised them that delaying repatriation would not assist the Argentine investigation but might be detrimental to any investigation by the UK coroner. Sussex police conveyed that information to the hon. Gentleman, who confirmed on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-07">7 December</phrase> that the family were ready to authorise the repatriation of Laura's body.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/7">The toxicology results were issued on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-12">12 December</phrase>. They indicated that Laura had died of pulmonary congestion and acute oedema resulting from ingestion of a quantity of cocaine. We faxed a copy of the original document in Spanish to the family on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-13">13 December</phrase> and, exceptionally for us, provided them with an unofficial translation on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-21">21 December</phrase>. Following completion of the administrative processes, Laura was repatriated on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-21">21 December</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-18">18 January</phrase>, nearly a month after her return, consular staff in Buenos Aires were informed by the international funeral director's local agent that Laura's body had been returned with a large proportion of her organs missing. I appreciate, as all of us readily can, that that must have been a distressing blow for Laura's parents, as they had expressly requested that her entire body be repatriated. We had relayed that message to the authorities in Buenos Aires, who had assured us that that would be the case. As removal and destruction of organs had not been an issue that we had encountered in Argentina before to this case, consular staff had no reason to question whether Laura's organs would be returned with her body.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/8">It is not the role of consular staff to check the status of a body before it is repatriated&mdash;and they do not have the means to do so&mdash;but only to be satisfied that a correct identification has been made. One can understand the scale of the problem if consular staff were required to do so, given that no fewer than 4,527 Britons died abroad in 2006-07. As soon as the family notified us that Laura's organs had not been returned with her body, we raised the issue of the missing organs with the fiscal&mdash;the prosecutor&mdash;in Buenos Aires on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-22">22 January</phrase>. The fiscal informed the embassy that it is normal Argentine practice in such cases for organs to be removed for testing. That information was relayed to the family liaison officer appointed by the Sussex police. To avoid any further confusion, we have since amended our Argentina death information sheet to explain the Argentine practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/9">The embassy remained in contact with the Argentine authorities, but it was not given any more information because the Argentine authorities wanted to deal directly with the family, which is normal in such circumstances in Argentina and throughout the world. Nevertheless, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-27">27 February</phrase>, in the light of the continuing concern, the British ambassador in Buenos Aires exceptionally requested and obtained an assurance from the presiding judge, Dr. Pagano Mata, that the remaining fragments of Laura's organs could be released. For that to be done, all that was needed was an application to, and authorisation from, the fiscal. We relayed that information to Mr. and Mrs. Hill on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-28">28 February</phrase>, and they confirmed the family's desire for the return of the remains. On behalf of the family, consular staff in Buenos Aires lodged a formal request and, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-03">3 March</phrase>, the Argentine authorities authorised the release of the remaining fragments of Laura's organs. The family were informed, but as yet they have not appointed an undertaker. The fragments of the organs therefore remain in the custody of the Argentine authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/10">The hon. Gentleman contacted London consular staff on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase> to raise the family's distress at the situation and to request that the FCO pay the &pound;3,500 that the family had told him was the cost of repatriating the remains of the organs, as we had given our assurances that the organs would be returned with Laura. We have explained to the hon. Gentleman and to the family that at no time did consular staff give such assurances, and that we had only been passing on information given to us. We have also made it clear that the FCO does not fund repatriations; the cost must be borne by the family, or their insurance company, and it is for them to approach an international funeral director to make the necessary arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/11">We were surprised that such a high sum was being for the repatriation of fragments of organs, so consular staff contacted Rowland Brothers, the international funeral directors appointed by Mr. and Mrs. Hill to repatriate Laura's body, for clarification. They confirmed that they had not been contacted by Mr. and Mrs. Hill about repatriating the organs, but they estimated that the cost would be in the region of &pound;800 to &pound;850. Rowland Brothers contacted Mr. and Mrs. Hill and said that they would be happy to provide them with a quotation if and when they were appointed to handle the matter. I understand that Mr. and Mrs. Hill requested a quote from Rowland Brothers, who quoted the sum of &pound;850 on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-22">22 April</phrase>, but Mr. and Mrs. Hill have not been in contact with them since then.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/12">The hon. Gentleman contacted my office on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-01">1 May</phrase> for confirmation that the FCO would not pay for the repatriation of the organs. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-09">9 May</phrase>, we confirmed that our position remained unchanged and that we could not provide financial assistance to Mr. and Mrs. Hill. Consular staff emphasised both that the Argentine authorities were under no obligation to communicate details of the investigation into Laura's death for us to pass on to the family, and that communication is normally either directly with the family or through a legal representative.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/13">I want to assure the hon. Gentleman that I am satisfied that consular staff have provided Mr. and Mrs. Hill with all the assistance they properly could during this very difficult time. They have provided information to Mr. and Mrs. Hill so they can make their own decisions, they have relayed information to Mr. and Mrs. Hill, and between the Hills and the Argentine authorities, in a timely manner, and they have never sought to impede matters or mislead in any way. We can convey to the family what information we are given, but it is not for us to request that a foreign Government invite British police to participate in an investigation into the death of a British national, nor can we seek a speedier investigation for a British national than would be available to a local person or any other national. We would certainly not countenance such requests made by a foreign Government to our Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.54.0/14">I have taken a close interest in this case, and I have provided the hon. Gentleman with full responses to his letters. I have spoken with our ambassador to Argentina, who is a very fine ambassador, to be sure that we have done all that we properly can do. I remain satisfied that that is the case. I am extremely sorry that Mr. and Mrs. Hill have suffered such a tragic loss. The death of one's child is an unimaginable trauma. I hope that they will be able to come to terms with their loss and the circumstances of Laura's death. I also hope that during the course of this debate I have managed to make the FCO's position as clear as possible.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-15a.58.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" speakername="Hugo Swire" colnum="58"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/halltext/80715h0009.htm#08071578000540">
	<p pid="a.58.2/1">I am grateful to have secured the debate and for the Minister's attendance. The future of the Rolle college campus in Exmouth has become an extremely contentious and important issue, not only for the people of Exmouth but for East Devon as a whole. The university campus has been providing vocational skills and further educational opportunities for more than 60 years. Throughout that time, the college has played an extremely important part in the economic and community life of Exmouth. Rolle college, which is primarily a teacher training college, has a fantastic academic reputation and an excellent relationship with the local community and schools. It has played an integral part in the life of Exmouth as a town, not only contributing to the local economy but placing students in local schools, many of whom stay on to become teachers in the local area.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/2">Exmouth has a high number of elderly residents, and the town has two of the most deprived wards in Devon&mdash;Littleham and Town&mdash;which are in the upper quartile of social deprivation in the country, with 46.9 per cent. of households having an annual income of less than &pound;20,000. Over the years, the presence of Rolle in the town has contributed a substantial amount, not least by giving the town university status.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/3">In November 2005, the university of Plymouth made the controversial decision to close the Rolle college campus in Exmouth and move the teaching facility with its 3,000 pupils and 400 staff to its main Plymouth base. Professor Roland Levinsky, who had been appointed the university of Plymouth's second vice-chancellor in September 2002, set himself the aim of lifting the university from its position as one of the leading post-1992 universities to rival much older and more research-intensive institutions. To do that, he was willing to take unpopular decisions, such as concentrating the university's teaching in Plymouth, with the closure of three campuses, including Rolle. Those moves, while undoubtedly giving Plymouth more the structure of longer established UK universities, will have a devastating impact on Exmouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/4">The decision to relocate the Rolle campus will create an economic void in Exmouth, resulting in the estimated loss between &pound;4 million and &pound;5 million per annum to the town's economy. In addition to the monetary loss, the students have made an enormous contribution to the vitality of the town. The campus is in good condition and is closely connected to a growing community. It benefits from and supports additional educational, sporting and social events. Apart from losing an excellent established college, the town will become much more of a retirement area, without the life and employment opportunities that the college embodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/5">Surely the Minister will agree that it is appropriate for the university to work towards compensating the town in some manner for the loss that will be incurred. It came as some relief that Professor Roland Levinsky pledged to work with the local community to mitigate the loss to the town. Following the vice-chancellor's untimely death in January 2007, the university authorities reiterated their desire to honour his pledge to offer the site for education at a discounted price and made</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/6" class="indent">&quot;a commitment not to sell to the highest bidder.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/7">With legislation to extend education up to the age of 18 beginning to take effect within the next five years, the matter of school capacity has become all the more important. In East Devon, that will mean having to find approximately 450 extra places by 2015&mdash;a feat that may prove particularly difficult, as all seven secondary schools in the constituency are full and, with no land to build on, temporary classrooms will be needed for at least the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/8">Devon county council and the Learning and Skills Council both agree that there is a real need for additional 14-to-19 education capacity in East Devon, although no real provision has yet been made for post-16 education. In fact, I was shocked and appalled to discover that the Liberal Democrat-led county council was attempting to sell off land adjacent and belonging to the community college at Withycombe Village road to the tune of approximately &pound;500,000. Now is not the time to start selling off ground belonging to community colleges, but to examine ways of acquiring land to accommodate students. That land is used by 90 children a day. If it was sold, classes for next year would have to be cancelled. When contacted by the school, Devon county council was, amazingly, unaware of the school's use of buildings on the land, despite providing funding for two of them. I simply cannot understand what the county council thought that it was doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/9">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-25">25 June</phrase>, during Prime Minister's questions, I was told by the Prime Minister that in my local authority area,</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/10" class="indent">&quot;there are two new schools; 19 schools have been rebuilt; 390 additional classrooms have been provided; and funding per pupil has risen substantially. There are also 600 more teachers and 1,800 more teaching assistants.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-06-25.284"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 June 2008; Vol. 478, c. 284</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/11">Not for the first or last time, the Prime Minister was slightly missing the point. East Devon has been unfortunate in receiving very little of what has been allocated to Devon as a whole. In the past 10 years, only one school has been rebuilt and only 44 additional classrooms provided, and there are only 103 more teachers and only 127 more teaching assistants. That is an extremely small proportion of what has been allocated to Devon as a whole. Why?</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/12">In the light of all that, the logical solution appears to be for the Owen building on the Rolle College campus to be retained for educational use, as it could house a greatly expanded post-16 centre, accommodating up to 1,000 students. Not only does that accord with the stated wishes of the late Professor Levinsky, but the Owen building can provide immediate good-quality, purpose-built accommodation for a large number of young people from 14 to 19 and already includes facilities such as a library. Use of the site will provide opportunities to work collaboratively with other organisations to offer a range of educational qualifications. That may include opportunities for the development of training and education for adults, as well as the provision of services to the wider community of Exmouth and East Devon.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/13">Almost a year ago, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-18">18 July 2007</phrase>, in response to the Leitch review of skills, the Government published &quot;World Class Skills: Implementing the Leitch Review of Skills in England&quot; to introduce new legislation to strengthen the current funding entitlement for adults. The Prime Minister stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/14" class="indent">&quot;we need a major drive to upskill our workforce, investing in training to boost the employability of millions of adults, help employers harness the skills they need to build successful British businesses, and create a more prosperous society.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/15">One hopes that, having recognised that need for training and education, the Government are actively seeking ways to implement their legislation. We propose that if the Owen building is successfully secured for educational purposes, adult learning could also take place on the Rolle campus. Firms in Devon have been experiencing difficulty in hiring adults with appropriate skills and training. Acquiring the Owen building for educational purposes could work towards successfully addressing that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/16">In addition to more direct educational uses of the site, a broader range of community uses could be established. If the council is attempting to sell off community college land, it is all the more essential to purchase the Owen building to house increased student numbers. Aside from legislation that will necessitate an increase in capacity for 14-to-19 education, the new town of Cranbrook and the regional spatial strategy resulting in an increase in the population within travelling distance of Exmouth provide the potential to sustain post-16 and adult training in the future. The main study report for the Exeter, Torbay, Mid Devon and East Devon housing market assessment, launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-24">24 July 2007</phrase>, has found that 19,000 additional properties are required to be built in the area over the next five years to meet an acute shortage, substantially increasing the amount of housing in the area and, subsequently, the need for more educational capacity. Surely the Minister agrees that with the increased pressure put on local authorities by new education legislation and an increase in housing in the area, the Government should be doing all they can to assist.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/17">The county council was apparently prepared to take a leading role in securing the site. In December 2007, when pledging &pound;3 million, the leader of the county council, Councillor Brian Greenslade, said,</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/18" class="indent">&quot;Devon county council recognises what a body blow losing Rolle college will be for Exmouth and we are therefore pleased to be working with other stakeholders to give what support we can to help deliver further education in Exmouth.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/19">The county council is working in partnership with the Learning and Skills Council, East Devon district council, the South West of England Regional Development Agency, Exeter college and Exmouth community college to ensure the long-term viability of this facility. That cross-party consortium has the express aim of assisting Government plans to retain British teenagers in either education or training until the age of 18.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/20">Despite meetings with the university prior to the site being placed on the open market, the consortium's efforts to purchase the Owen building and surrounding campus for educational purposes suffered a setback with Plymouth university's unexpected announcement that it was pulling out of exclusive negotiations and putting the site for sale on the open market. Surely the Minister must agree that that was an act of bad faith on the part of the university.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/21">The university initially received a substantial offer from a property developer, a sale that I believe would have expressly contravened the university's previously stated wishes and intentions. However, in light of the current economic climate and the developer's desire to incorporate the consortium's wishes, it revised the offer to a smaller sum. That was rejected by the university, which is now planning to sell the land in smaller plots. I hope that that is not being done to avoid a section106 agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/22">In July 2007, I led a local cross-party delegation to meet Lord Triesman, then Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. At that meeting, Lord Triesman was shown a letter from Debbie Pritchard of Devon county council, clearly stating that all secondary schools in East Devon are currently full. The meeting appeared to be constructive, and Lord Triesman agreed to consider the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/23">However, in a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-13">13 September 2007</phrase>, the Minister said that as the funding from the sale would be reinvested in educational provision on the Plymouth campus, it was to his way of thinking satisfactory regardless of the acknowledged need for education provision in Exmouth. Although it is true that that money may be invested in educational provision in Plymouth, does he really believe that that was a constructive answer? Surely he must concede that it does not begin to solve the multitude of problems caused by the lack of educational provision in Exmouth?</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/24">The Minister overlooks the loss of revenue to Exmouth, and the amount of public money that will be wasted if the new college building is flattened to make way for more housing. The Owen building was constructed only three years ago, at a cost of &pound;2 million, financed by the Higher Funding Educational Council. To demolish it to make way for housing would surely not be an appropriate use of public money. Is he suggesting that a purpose-built educational faculty, recently paid for with taxpayer's money, should be levelled by bulldozers to make way for yet more housing?</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/25">At a time of economic crisis, with the cost of living continually rising, does the Minister honestly believe that taxpayers would see that as an acceptable and rational way to spend their money? That money was spent on education in Exmouth, not Plymouth, and as such the town should not be forced to suffer through the university's decision to move its campus.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/26">In October 2007, I led the same cross-party delegation to meet the Minister for the South West, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>. He pointed out, as previously mentioned, that Devon county council and the Learning and Skills Council agree that there is a real need for additional 14-19 educational capacity. On one hand, that observation gives credence to the consortium's efforts to purchase the site; but on the other, it demonstrates contradictions among Ministers and shows their inability to work within a joined-up Government. If the Minister for the South West can appreciate the situation and support the consortium's work to secure the site for further education, why is he being directly opposed by his colleague, the Minister here today?</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/27">Plymouth university originally received the land for free from Devon county council, and the strong feeling locally is that the public good rather than the price should be the key determinant of the future use of the site. The Exmouth Community Association, a watchdog group formed to oversee the future development and well-being of the town is backing the consortium's plans. In a report on the proposals, an association spokesman said:</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/28" class="indent">&quot;It is our view that the campus should not be used for residential apartments or housing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/29">Many Exmouth residents hope that the site does not end up in the hands of developers, as they are acutely aware of the lack of available space in Exmouth or the surrounding area to build a facility from scratch as suitable as the Owen building. Instead, a new school would have to be provided at a cost of about &pound;25 million, and there is no obvious site for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/30">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-20">20 May 2008</phrase>, I wrote to the Minister to point out that true long-term value for money for public funds would be gained for the local community and economy only by establishing a post-16-year-old college, and not by razing an outstanding facility to the ground. I requested a meeting with him and the Minister for the South West. The response that I received simply stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/31" class="indent">&quot;less funding for schools and further education in Exmouth would mean more funding for higher education in Plymouth&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/32">That naively neglects the very real and pressing need for education provision in the Exmouth area, which has already been recognised by the Minister for the South West. It is yet another example of the impact that central and regional policies are having on small coastal and rural communities in the south-west. It is time for the Government to step in to resolve the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/33">The strategy that says that we should create main centres of economic, cultural and academic excellence takes no account of the special conditions that exist in coastal and rural areas like the south-west, as the communities there also need to be sustained. How does the response make Exmouth a more sustainable community? The town has already lost a vital economic asset; all stakeholders, including Ministers, should be working together to ensure that something of worth is put in its place.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/34">One of the schools hoping to move onto the newly vacated site is Exmouth community college. It is the largest secondary school in Europe, and its facilities are among the best in the country. The school received a good rating in its latest Ofsted report, and it now has a considerable waiting list. At present, the sixth form has 389 pupils, but the school will have to accommodate another 350 extra pupils by 2015, when education up to the age of 18 becomes compulsory. However, the school has no room to expand or to build new facilities. If the Minister is satisfied with less funding for schools and further education in Exmouth, where does he propose housing those students?</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/35">Exmouth community college is the only secondary school in this expanding seaside town, and a large percentage of learners stay on into the sixth form. The school has a year 11 stay-on rate of 82 per cent., which is considerably higher than the national average; in addition, this year it accommodated 20 new students from surrounding schools, who were attracted by the courses and facilities available. There has been a significant increase in results over the last three years; and students' progress, which was inadequate three years ago, is now good throughout the college. Despite those impressive results, the college loses a number of potential students and there is a significant post-16 drop out level in East Devon due to certain courses being available only at Exeter college or East Devon college. The acquisition of Rolle would enable those courses to be provided locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/36">It almost beggars belief that such a real need is being ignored by a Government that like to pride themselves on believing that education is important. In November 2007, during topical questions the Minister for Schools and Learners, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" name="Jim Knight">the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight)</phrase>, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/37" class="indent">&quot;I remember visiting Exmouth community college last summer with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families. The issues with that site were pointed out to us, and I have sympathy with the college's plans.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-11-12.395"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 November 2007; Vol. 467, c. 395</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/38">He praised the good work of the college, and hoped that it would continue. If the Minister for Schools and Learners and the Minister for the South West are both able to see sense and support the plans of the community college, why does the Minister remain so blinkered in his view?</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/39">Unless the school receives proper support, in the form of increased space and facilities, there is a real possibility that the good work that has been achieved will suffer. Surely the Minister must agree that that is in no way a desirable outcome?</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/40">With the impact of the new specialised diplomas for young people, there is a genuine need for schools and colleges to set up partnerships with other institutions in order to provide the wide range of resources required to teach the new courses. If the community college were to collaborate with Exeter college and Devon county council by sharing facilities and staffing at the Rolle site, the young people of Exmouth and the surrounding area, including Exeter, would have access to the very best curricula and qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/41">The future of Rolle college campus in Exmouth can no longer be overlooked or brushed under the carpet. It is imperative that Brian Greenslade, the leader of the Liberal Democrat-led county council, puts a formal offer to Plymouth university for the purchase of the Owen building. The university has no formal bid on the table. It is struggling with debt; and by selling the land in small parcels, it would appear that the consortium is in an excellent position to purchase the Owen building.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/42">The consortium, a cross-party group, is attempting to comply with Government policy in an area of the country with an outstanding school that is struggling to provide for its pupils. If the campus goes to the highest bidder for redevelopment, the town will be left with nothing. Although the consortium continues to work towards achieving a positive outcome for Exmouth from the Rolle closure, it is receiving little assistance from the university, the Learning and Skills Council or the SWRDA, which has refused to give any funding to the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.58.2/43">I raised the matter at Prime Minister's questions and was told that he would look into the matter. I subsequently sent the right hon. Gentleman a detailed letter, yet I have heard nothing. Ministers must realise that it is a real and pressing matter. Unless measures are taken quickly, it will have a detrimental impact on the young people of Exmouth and East Devon as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> on securing this debate. As he rightly said, it is an important subject. It is appropriate to debate it in this Chamber, as it genuinely involves a balance, which the House has to strive to maintain, between local needs and discretion on the one hand and national policies and priorities on the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/2">I assure the hon. Gentleman that the quality and quantity of education available to young people and adults in East Devon is of equal significance to the Government as it is to him. That was made apparent in the answer that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister gave in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-25">25 June</phrase>. I hope that it will be made evidence also by what I have to say this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/3">The closure of Rolle college campus raises two main issues. Both are important, but I stress that they are distinct. The first is the decision to transfer the University of Plymouth's faculty of education from Exmouth to the university's main campus in Plymouth. As the hon. Gentleman has indicated, that decision was taken by the university's board of governors in the autumn of 2005. In announcing the change, the late&mdash;and very much missed&mdash;vice-chancellor, Professor Roland Lewinsky, described the reasons for that decision as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/4" class="indent">&quot;This is a necessary development to help us achieve the mission of becoming an international centre of learning and research excellence, serving the whole of the South West peninsula.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/5">Along with many other people in the Exmouth area, the hon. Gentleman protested against the board of governors' decision at the time, as was his right. The reasons for doing so were, frankly, entirely understandable. They included concern for the future of teacher training at the University of Plymouth and for the staff and students of the faculty of education. Notably, in view of the fact that most newly qualified teachers take up their first posts near the institutions where they trained, their concerns also included, quite properly, the possible effects of relocation on the supply of teachers to schools in the Exmouth area.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/6">I want to emphasise that the university authorities attempted to give reassurance on those issues from the start and made it clear that the relocation from Exmouth did not signal the end of teacher training at the university. Most importantly, a new faculty of education building on the main campus was promised at a cost of &pound;25 million. We have since heard that the building has been named after the Rolle family, in recognition of their long-standing connections with the institution and the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/7">Teacher training at Plymouth is in a healthy and robust state, and with almost &pound;4 million of grant from the Training and Development Agency for Schools to support 321 training places in the next academic year, the success that it enjoyed at Rolle college is set to continue in its new home. That was the process by which the decision to close Rolle college was taken, the reasons for it and its effects.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/8">It might well be asked, however, what the Government were doing while that was happening. That is where we come to the crux and heart of the matter. Over the past three years, unlike my predecessors as Ministers for Higher Education, from the party opposite as well as my own, I have reminded the House many times of the limitations of the Government's powers to intervene in university management decisions. To a significant extent, those are limitations that Parliament has put in place by enacting, for example, the Education Reform Act 1988, the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 and the Higher Education Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/9">It was entirely right for Parliament to have acted in that way. I strongly believe that the historic autonomy of universities is part and parcel of their academic freedom and the strength of our higher education system in this country. It allows them to contribute fully to the well-being of their local areas and identify and pursue their unique institutional missions. If one compares the state and performance of our higher education institutions to many of those overseas, one will see that university autonomy is one of the factors that lead to the strength of our performance. Indeed, I can do no better on that point than quote <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1623" name="David Willetts">the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts.)</phrase> This is one of the areas in which, party politics aside, I am bound to agree with him. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Our universities are recognised internationally. But we limit their potential if we have too much regulation or the wrong sort of regulation...Now that we have a Department for Universities for the first time ever&mdash;a welcome change in many ways&mdash;there is a clear risk that ministers will be tempted to meddle more and consult less. We need a new approach that recognises that universities are grown-up institutions that should be able to set their own priorities and speak to Government on an equal basis.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/11">So, were a Conservative Minister standing here, I am not sure that the hon. Member for East Devon would get an answer that was different to the one that I am giving him.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/12">It follows from that line of reasoning that there is no basis in law on which the Government could, or indeed should, have sought to obstruct the relocation of the faculty of education from Exmouth to Plymouth. It would not be appropriate for me or the hon. Gentleman to criticise a decision that the university authorities believed to be in the best interests of their institution, its staff and its students.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/13">That brings me to the second issue that the closure of Rolle college campus raises, which is about the use to which the Rolle college site should be put now that it is no longer needed for teacher training. The hon. Gentleman asked about that issue on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-25">25 June</phrase> during Prime Minister's questions and claimed that my view was that the site should simply be sold to the highest bidder. That is not my view, and I have been at pains to make that clear during our discussions, communications and correspondence. My view is that to whom and for how much the site should be sold is a matter not for this House, but for the university's board of governors, provided that it acts in accordance with the statutes of the university and the law of the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/14">The hon. Gentleman's opinion is that the Rolle college site should be given over to providing post-16 education, which is a perfectly valid opinion, and I welcome any measure that would provide improved education and training facilities for the young people of Devon. The answer that the Prime Minister gave to the hon. Gentleman on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-25">25 June</phrase> set out clearly the huge improvements that have taken place within Devon as a local authority area within the past 10 years, and those have been replicated within East Devon. I will be happy, following the debate, to write in detail to the hon. Gentleman, setting out some of the improvements that have taken place, which compare enormously favourably with what took place prior to 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/15">Should the Government now decide to intervene to secure the Rolle site for educational use? I will answer that question with another. By what right and under what power would the hon. Gentleman suggest that we do so? We are neither unsympathetic nor unwilling to use our good offices to help the parties involved reach an agreement. The Prime Minister has offered to consider any proposal that the hon. Gentleman wishes to make. My former colleague at the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, Lord Triesman, as the hon. Gentleman said, met a delegation led by himself to discuss that issue towards the end of last year, as did the Minister for the South West. The hon. Member for East Devon has corresponded on the issue with me on a number of occasion, and also with the Minister for Schools and Learners. I know that the Learning and Skills Council, which is sponsored by my Department, has also been actively involved in trying to find a mutually satisfactory solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/16">I need to be clear that we are not and cannot be talking about a fire sale. In today's real estate market, the Rolle college campus still has a substantial value. The proceeds of its eventual sale will undoubtedly benefit the university of Plymouth, and that in turn will mean a better standard of higher education for the people of the south-west. In those circumstances, it would be difficult for university authorities to justify a decision to sell off the campus at a knock-down price. It is therefore a matter for the university, East Devon district council and Devon county council to work together to find a solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/17">I shall be clear that this is not a matter over which I, as the Minister for Higher Education, have authority, and perhaps this is where I can indicate a potentially constructive way forward. Even if I wanted to, I cannot dictate to the university how it should act in these circumstances. Nevertheless, I understand the case that the hon. Gentleman is putting forward for a desired outcome from an educational perspective within his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/18">Although I can give no guarantees and have no control over the outcome, I am prepares to talk once again to the university authorities, the Learning and Skills Council, the local education authority and the district council to see whether there is some way that the matter can be taken forward. I cannot guarantee the outcome of that discussion, because ultimately the university of Plymouth has an absolute right to make that decision. Nevertheless, given the concern, I am willing to engage in those discussions and happy to report back to the hon. Gentleman on the outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/19" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/20" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Two o'clock.</p>
