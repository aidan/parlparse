<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-13a.340.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1703" speakername="John Whittingdale" colnum="340"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081113/halltext/81113h0001.htm#08111392000318">
	<p pid="a.340.1/1">My hon. Friend raises an interesting question. It is fair to say that I have had discussions on a number of subjects with the BBC in the past few weeks and that is one of them. He makes an important point, because it demonstrates why the watershed itself is becoming less and less meaningful. Now that we have video on demand, the iPlayer and personal video recorders in many homes, the idea that children cannot access material because it was originally transmitted at 10 pm is becoming ridiculous. That is not to say that we should abandon the watershed; I do not think that we should. However, we should be realistic and accept that it is not going to prove a particularly effective means of protecting children. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/2">We talked to various content providers that are responsible for online video content. Obviously, the most well known of all is YouTube, and I think that it is fair to say that we had a vigorous discussion with YouTube. YouTube is responsible; it has a clear view that its site should not be used for material that shows sexual content or very violent content. However, we had a slight discussion with YouTube&mdash;indeed, an argument&mdash;about how it dealt with that type of material and whether it could do more to identify it before it was made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/3">The issue of pre-screening is very difficult and two concerns were raised with us about it. The first was the sheer volume of material. YouTube argued that 10 hours of video content are uploaded to its site every minute; in fact, I think that that figure has now gone up to 12 hours a minute. YouTube argued that that made it impossible for its employees to sit and look at all that material before it went online. The second concern that YouTube had was a legal concern about the effect of the e-commerce directive. It was concerned that if it attempted to identify potentially illegal material before it was shown, then it would become liable if it failed to spot something that was subsequently put online.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/4">The Committee was not wholly convinced on either of those counts. It seemed extraordinary to us that the law could possibly suggest that an attempt to remove inappropriate content could lead to a liability for prosecution whereas standing aside and doing absolutely nothing about such content left YouTube protected and not liable to prosecution. That seemed utterly perverse and I find it hard to believe that that really is the case. If it is the case, it needs to be tested rather quickly and addressed, so that it is not the consequence of the e-commerce directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/5">Equally, there is the question of whether a company can screen all the material that is uploaded. I accept that it is plainly impossible to sit and look at the 12 hours of material that are uploaded every minute. However, we felt that that did not mean that YouTube should not make an attempt at least to identify material that was likely to contain unacceptable content, or material that would possibly contain unacceptable content.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/6">In particular, we were alarmed by the report of a video of a gang rape that was uploaded on to YouTube and viewed 600 times before it was taken down. We were even more concerned when we discovered, in the course of taking evidence, that the video had been flagged by a user as inappropriate and that YouTube had failed on the first occasion to take it down. Therefore, although the YouTube method of relying on its users to tell it when they come across inappropriate material is undoubtedly effective and results in the vast majority of such material being taken down, we felt that more could be done. We were impressed by one or two other companies, particularly MySpace, which told us that it pre-screened material before it was made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/7">Obviously, there are other concerns. I had a meeting with some Finnish MPs two days ago who raised the serious issue of the man who murdered a number of children, having been shown brandishing a gun on YouTube just a few days before. I understand that YouTube is now changing its rules about showing videos of people brandishing guns. However, this is a difficult issue because, of course, nobody was to know that that man was going to do what he did. In retrospect, it is very shocking to look at his video, but the video itself is relatively harmless. What is shocking is what he went on to do after uploading the video. I do not in any way dismiss the problems attached to the issue of pre-screening.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/8">There are possible technical solutions. For instance, computer software can now identify large quantities of flesh tones in a video. That is not to say that such videos are necessarily pornographic, but if they are identified they can perhaps be quarantined until somebody looks at them and decides whether or not it is permissible to show them.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/9">I know that a lot of these companies are devoting resources to this area. However, we were slightly concerned to learn that the industry standard for the take-down time of inappropriate material is 24 hours, which seemed to us to be too long. Again, that is an issue that the UK council should look at.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/10">One area of the internet that is growing in usage, particularly among young people, is social networking sites. Virtually every teenager in Britain is now a member of Bebo or Facebook and that is a part of their way of life. In the main, social networking is of great benefit: it is a means of communication; it saves parents a huge amount of money on telephone bills, as children can have instant messaging conversations that are entirely free; and children can make friends. All of those things are very valuable, educational and part of the process of growing up, and they are to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/11">However, one of the concerns&mdash;perhaps the major concern&mdash;about social networking sites is that a lot of the users are unaware that when they post information on them it may not be visible just to the people whom they want to see it. In many cases, it is visible to anybody. It is very alarming to discover the extent to which young people are putting up details about themselves&mdash;where they go to school, their mobile telephone number, their interests, the name of their dog and all of these things&mdash;on a social networking site and not restricting that information to the people whom they want to see it. The person who was identified on &quot;Panorama&quot;, for instance, had been able to strike up a conversation and talk about favourite pop groups or dogs and make friends because that person had used a social networking site to access to that information about the person with whom they were communicating.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/12">One thing that we felt very strongly was that, rather than waiting for the user to decide to restrict such information, the default setting for social networking sites should be set so that, at the very least, information is available only to the user's nominated friends. If users want to make that information made available more widely, it would be a matter for them. The assumption should be that people use social networking sites to tell their friends, not the entire world, about what they are doing. It would be easy to change default settings in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/13">There is an issue with the direct reporting of abuse. We were particularly impressed by Microsoft's Messenger service, through which the user can click a single button to be taken directly to CEOP to report a potentially abusive contact. There was argument among other providers as to whether it is necessary to go directly to CEOP via one click, or whether it is better to offer a range of bodies that might assist. We received evidence from CEOP that that service is valuable, and we think that it should be commended.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/14">Providers such as Microsoft told us about the parental controls that they have installed into products such as the Xbox. There is not just the facility to apply filters. In the latest version of Windows, parents can obtain a record of every site that their child has visited. They can block not only individual sites, but sites that are classified under headings to do with sex or violence, for example. A range of parental controls are available, but it is part of the problem that most parents are blissfully unaware of them. Even if they did know about those controls, they probably are not capable of setting them. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> suggested, a large part of the problem is helping parents to understand how to use the technological solutions that are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/15">We were impressed by the commitment that almost every major industry body, including internet service providers, social networking sites and hardware manufacturers, has shown regarding the protection of young people, but there is no commonality. Each has its own standards, some of which are tougher than others, and there is no agreement on the minimum take-down times that should be required. We feel that a self-regulatory industry body is still needed in that case. We were told time and again that the answer to the problem is self-regulation, not Government regulation, and I agree. If at all possible, I prefer self-regulation, and I think that a lot of good work is being done.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/16">There is a single, self-regulatory body for advertising and the press to which all of the industry's players sign up as members and accept a code of conduct that applies across the board. Such bodies provide a highly visible place for people to go to if they wish to register a complaint or raise an issue. Those bodies can adjudicate when there are complaints, publish their findings and publish statistics on performance, so that people know how different companies compare. That is the common approach in most self-regulatory systems, but not in this area, in which every company does its own thing. In order to increase consumer confidence, there is a strong case for having an industry body to implement the recommendations of the UK council, with agreement, across the industry. That part of the structure is missing, and we feel strongly that that should be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/17">We also feel that more needs to be done on media literacy and the education of children and parents. There is a case for having a single site, possibly on the Directgov network, to which people can go to learn about the various available options. There is also a case for drawing up a single leaflet to be supplied with every piece of equipment, be it a new PC, a new computer programme or any other component part, so that the same message is put across to parents and young people. Those recommendations could all be addressed by the UK council, and would increase child protection in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/18">I am conscious that others wish to speak, so I shall not speak about the final part of the report for too long.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-13a.349.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1728" speakername="Paul Farrelly" colnum="349"  time="015:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081113/halltext/81113h0003.htm#08111392000337">
	<p pid="a.349.3/1">Life is too short.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/2">We interviewed many people, and Dr. Tanya Byron was certainly one of the most impressive witnesses to have given evidence in my three years on the Committee. She certainly disarmed me when she said, following a particularly hard and robust session of questioning representatives of YouTube and Google, that she found me scary. I have rarely been silenced so effectively and comprehensively. I did not know what to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/3">Like you, Mr. Bercow, I have three young children. They are aged nine and a half, seven and two and a half. When we started our inquiry, like many parents I was rather wary of displaying my ignorance about the internet, social networking and gaming. When it comes to video games and consoles, my wife is tantamount to being the Taliban&mdash;they are banned, because of the time that she fears they will take away from reading, learning music and other activities. I am very much one of those parents who, as Dr. Byron put it, do not necessarily</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/4" class="indent">&quot;feel equipped to help their children&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/5">in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/6">Over the summer, I became aware of certain things following our report. The growth of video-sharing sites such as YouTube spans video and what we traditionally call the internet. I was watching the funny series of excerpts along the lines of the German film &quot;Downfall&quot; on that site. They picture a number of characters, from Alex Ferguson complaining about the impending loss of Ronaldo, to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister trying to find voters in Glasgow, East. Frankly, it is the really bad language that makes them funny to adults, but I do not necessarily want my children to be exposed to that. That is a real issue in terms of classification for the safety council to take on as it proceeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/7">My ignorance was reinforced last night after a discussion about the very innocent children's Christmas party that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> is organising again this year. In the course of my children's strict rations of &quot;Club Penguins&quot;, &quot;Super Mario&quot;, &quot;RuneScape&quot; or &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; online, and their sourcing of endless cheat engines for video games such as &quot;Age of Empires&quot;, my laptop screen at home had become clogged with all sorts of icons and programmes that had appeared from the internet. Most pernicious was a purported anti-virus programme called &quot;Virus Recovery 2008&quot;&mdash;I hope that the authorities take note of that name&mdash;which was paralysing the computer. It is a particularly stubborn piece of what is technically termed &quot;adware&quot;, which tries to sell a programme. It is probably a complete con. It implied that my laptop was stuffed full of trojans, worms, viruses&mdash;all fictitious, no doubt.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/8">Until last night I had never deleted a programme in my life, so after lecturing my son I was run through the process by a castigated nine-year-old: toolbar, settings, control panel, Add/Remove&mdash;and we could not find it. I then got a lecture that it was probably a ghost programme hiding somewhere else, and so it was. It was duly deleted and my son was out of the dog house, and I certainly learned much more than he did. My awareness of my ignorance was deepened. That experience and this inquiry have made me only too aware of the importance of knowing what our children are doing on the internet, particularly when we are much less computer savvy than they are.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/9">I want to focus on a few main issues that are outstanding with regard to the inquiry report and the Government's response. As the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford has stated, we were all shocked at the complacency of Google and YouTube in particular. They pleaded that pre-screening was simply uneconomic and impractical, and that it did not work to pre-screen content that was uploaded, or to screen it in any way for harmful content before responding to complaints by users who flagged up that content. We did not find that persuasive because other firms, including MySpace, which has been mentioned, certainly do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/10">It was discouraging to find companies such as Google and YouTube hiding behind the e-commerce directive as an excuse for not undertaking that activity. I am sure that it is more a question of profitability than it is of being unviable. We were impressed by many of the companies that gave evidence, but certainly not by the company that recently showed a video, which the hon. Gentleman outlined, that purported to be a gang rape. We also had the experience of the company that showed the young child on Merseyside who was shot dead, and the sites that glorify gang violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/11">There is also the issue of that small tail of internet service providers that are failing to co-operate in blocking illegal content from the internet, which the Government and the new council will make it a priority to address. We were certainly impressed by the facility that Microsoft had afforded UK users, of having one clear button to report harmful content and problems. We hope that the council and the Government will urge the industry to come to an agreement to follow that model in the UK, which has been adopted by the local management of Microsoft in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/12">I welcome the Government's response that the issues relating to the e-commerce directive need to be clarified so that it does not have the unintended consequence of making it more difficult for internet-based companies to remove content or to edit their sites, for fear of being complicit and of being held to account. That would be a nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/13">Like other colleagues, during the investigation I was impressed by the work and dedication of the CEOP Centre, headed by Jim Gamble. The Government have accepted its importance as a body with expertise from the voluntary sector, as well as from the industry and regulators, and that it is making great strides towards getting to those people who would harm our children and vulnerable people. It appeared that some questions about funding and the way in which CEOP can push its agenda compared with other countries were outstanding. Australia was a notable example where television advertising is funded and regularly seen. I hope that questions about CEOP's funding are addressed urgently.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/14">With respect to video games, which are banned in my household, except when they are streamed over the internet in the hour that my children are allowed, I would like the Government and the council to resolve the issue of dual classification, as it is confusing. We went for classification by the British Board of Film Classification because we felt it was more familiar, although that is perhaps a reflection of our age and of having gone to the Wrexham Rio when we were growing up. It is important that any confusion is resolved as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.352.0/1">I take that point and the points made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1462" name="Nick Palmer">the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> about the prevalence of downloading games from the internet and not buying them in hard copy, which may move us more towards a PEGI system than the one with which we are more familiar. The point is that we need to have the matter clarified, so that the single classification can be taken up and become more familiar, and so that parents can be more confident in how it works.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.0/2">I conclude with two questions for the Minister. As the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said, we recommended that alongside the new council, as part of the jigsaw, there should be a body to enforce standards, in a self-regulatory way, in the model of the Advertising Standards Authority. The Government did not accept that, and I hope that she will say more about why. I urge the council in particular, as it develops its child internet safety strategy next year, to consider that suggestion, which does not reflect any criticism of the council's role or its work.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.0/3">We also recommended that for clarity a single Minister should be responsible for this matter. The Government have not accepted that and the reason they have given&mdash;that it is up to the Prime Minister to decide on appointments&mdash;is the traditional politician's way of side-stepping an issue when asked if they would like a particular job. Perhaps the Minister could say a few words about why the Government have not suggested that recommendation, or why a Minister from her Department, either herself or Lord Carter, the impressively titled Minister for Communications, Technology and Broadcasting, does not sit on the executive board of the council.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.0/4">I reiterate that all on the inquiry felt that the Government deserved plaudits for the serious way in which they have taken this issue, and for setting up the Byron review and pursuing its conclusions with the new UK council. I hope that some of the further issues will be addressed in due course, and I hope that the Minister will make it part of her new role to ensure that there is effective joined-up government that includes the involvement of her Department.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-13a.352.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" speakername="John Hayes" colnum="352"  time="015:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081113/halltext/81113h0003.htm#08111392000340">
	<p pid="a.352.1/1">I intend to speak very briefly for three reasons: first, because I was not able to be here at the beginning, for which I apologise; secondly, because I know much less about the subject than almost every other Member in the Chamber, judging from what has been said already; and, thirdly, because I have only a few things of import to offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.1/2">However, I speak with the benefit of being the father of two small children, rather like you, Mr. Bercow, and I have just as much concern for their welfare as I know you have for yours. As such, I am intimately and personally involved in and, frankly, worried about, these matters as all parents are concerned about the future of their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.1/3">I want to make three points. First, the technology is highly interactive. The difference between it and other media&mdash;I speak as someone who spent his time before coming here in the world of information technology&mdash;is that it is interactive. Film, video and the whole games network are merging with other technologies and media, and that makes the task of trying to put in place adequate control extremely difficult. Indeed, it is much more difficult than when we were looking largely at printed material or even film and TV alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.1/4">Secondly, the situation is highly dynamic. Video games and their like are, by their nature, rapidly changing. Providers are always anxious to take the next step, to go to the next level and to push the boundaries still further, and that dynamism requires a public policy response which itself is highly flexible and responsive. It is not enough simply to make judgments and then assume their worth. They must be regularly formally reviewed. The self-regulation that came out of the Byron review needs to be examined in some detail to test its effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.1/5">The third thing about these media is that they are pervasive and intrusive, and, for that reason, hard to self-regulate. It is hard to make parental choices that stick, or to know at all times to what children are exposed. When my son goes to visit his friends, I do not know in detail what their parents' views are on such things. They may be somewhat different from mine. Those are difficult things to make judgments about, because I cannot stop my young son visiting perfectly respectable and decent family friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.1/6">There are some arguments that I hope we will not hear in the winding-up speeches. I do not think that we will hear them from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">the Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase>, who has a distinguished history on this subject. He looks at such matters in considerable detail and takes his responsibility seriously. He is a prince among shadow Ministers, if I might put it that way. Nevertheless, I hope that we will not hear the tired old argument about freedom. Civilised life is characterised not by our capacity to do as we will, which, by the way, we share with the apes, but by our ability to choose to do what we should. That is what civilises us, and trailing the old argument about liberty will not be not helpful to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.1/7">The second argument that we might hear from the Minister is about information, as though exposure to more and more data is of itself a good thing. Children are now exposed to all kinds of stimuli, influences and information to which previous generations of young people were not. But as T. S. Eliot asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.352.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.352.1/9">We are drowning in a sea of data, but I suspect that the comprehension, understanding and simple wisdom which transcends the ages are no greater but are, as that great poet observed, being lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.1/10">Thirdly, I hope that we will not hear anything about how desirable it is that people are made aware of what is explicit, that somehow that will protect them, and that their knowledge and exposure to such things will allow them to make choices to avoid them. Generally speaking, that which is implicit is preferable.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.1/11">With those few thoughts, and mindful of the greater wisdom of the shadow Minister and the Minister, I draw my remarks to a conclusion and look forward to hearing from them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-13a.354.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" speakername="Keith Vaz" colnum="354"  time="015:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081113/halltext/81113h0004.htm#08111392000343">
	<p pid="a.354.1/1">No, it was not my hon. Friend's WeeMee.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/2">I was once voted the third most unpopular person in the world, after Hillary Clinton and Arnold Schwarzenegger, by the readers of one of the video game magazines. I suppose that I should take that as a compliment, but it points to the almost hysterical approach that the video games industry and the newspapers that support it sometimes take to anyone who manages to raise such matters in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/3">What we need first of all from the industry is responsibility and partnership. We are all on the same side. We are saying clearly that for someone who is over 18, there should be no censorship or attempt to stop them seeing or doing whatever they want as far as video games are concerned. My interest has always been to protect those who are under 18. Some are our children, of course, but it goes beyond protecting our own children. That is my only concern&mdash;not to stop adults buying games but to ensure that harmful games do not fall into the hands of young people and children.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/4">There are three ways in which that could be done. The first is to ensure that there is a clear statement of the age limit on the video game itself. Unfortunately, it is still far too small. When we first started this campaign some years ago, it was the size of a 1p piece, and now it is the size of a 50p piece; but I saw and still see no reason why an indication that something has an 18 certificate and is unsuitable for children and young people under 18 should not be splashed across an 18-plus video game, as it is on other material with adult content.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/5">One problem in dealing with the Government on this issue is that so many Departments have a vested interest in protecting their own territory. The DCMS wants to protect the industry, because, as the hon. Member for Wantage reminds us, it is a multi-million pound&mdash;perhaps multi-billion pound&mdash;industry based in London. The fear is that if we get any tougher on the industry, it will go off and start operating from Frankfurt, so we have an interest in making sure that the industry stays here, and we should be careful what we do about controlling the content of video games.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/6">I say to the Minister&mdash;I know it is not her responsibility but the Attorney-General's&mdash;let us ensure that retailers that sell these games to under-18s are prosecuted. I would be interested to know from the Minister how many prosecutions there have been of retailers who have sold&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> She is looking around, but I do not think the answer will come. This is one of the problems with how the Attorney-General's office operates: it simply does not give us these figures, and we would like to know. I am not sure whether the Committee considered that point, but prosecuting those who sell adult video games to under-18s is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/7">The retailers have a responsibility. Sir Trevor McDonald, on his television programme a few years ago, sent some people aged under 18 to try to buy video games from some of the big supermarkets. They returned with the video games in their hands, which was proof that the retailers were not taking responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/8">The distinguished Chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee said that he did not think that there was sufficient evidence to show a link between the content of video games and subsequent actions by people as a result of watching them. We now have research on that from the university of Iowa, and previously there was research from the university of Missouri. One thing that the Minister can do is ensure that she commissions more research, although not necessarily from those who have a view one way or the other&mdash;it should be independent research. I hope that that will be done, because that is a good way to take the Select Committee report further. If it could be done, it would be of great importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/9">As the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings says, games are interactive. The industry says to us, &quot;But sometimes young people go in to see an 18-plus film by mistake, or an 11-year-old or a 10-year-old is taken into a 12A.&quot; The new Batman film, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, although it had a 12A certificate, was really a 15, so that happens. My point, however, is that games are interactive&mdash;one is expected to do something as a result of seeing the violence on the screen. It is not the same as going to watch something at the cinema.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/10">I remind hon. Members that, when I mentioned the Pakeerah case, the industry representatives said to me that the judge and the police made it clear that they did not think that &quot;Manhunt&quot; and the actions in that game had an impact on Warren Leblanc. They said that, yes, the video was in his house, but they did not think it had any effect. However, just last week, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-07">7 November</phrase>, to quote <i>The Sun</i>,</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/11" class="indent">&quot;A teenage sex beast who attacked women in an imitation of Grand Theft Auto was locked up yesterday. Ryan Chinnery, 19, struck after obsessively playing the violent computer game, a court heard. He drove around at night targeting women he wrongly thought were prostitutes. Judge Philip Statman said Grand Theft Auto showed 'scant respect for women' and Chinnery's vile acts 'mirrored' the game.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/12">Even the prosecutor in that case, Eleanor Laws, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Chinnery's love of the 18-rated game 'may go some way to explaining his attitude towards women'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/14">In &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, the player assumes the identity of a criminal carrying out operations for his mobster bosses. To move up the food chain, characters drive around carrying out increasingly brutal missions, typically robbing banks, drug dealing or gunning down members of rival gangs. Violence is central to all the tasks and, when not busy on a mission, players are free to roam the streets to strike at people in a sadistic way. That is fine if players are over 18&mdash;well, it is not fine, but I can understand why those over 18 may want to buy and play such a game&mdash;but I am concerned about the effect of such games on young people if they fall into their hands. That is why I urge the Minister to accept what is in the report, but take it further, because it is not the end of the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/15">I was impressed by Tanya Byron. She met Mrs. Pakeerah in my office as part of her review and was all the things that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1728" name="Paul Farrelly">the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly)</phrase> said of her. Her report was excellent and was clearly conducted by someone who knows what she is talking about. She made some specific points about children, which need to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/16">I welcome the report and I congratulate the Chairman of the Committee and its members. Their report will be a useful tool in our future discussions. Whether we support or do not support what is going on, it will be useful for us to be able to read the report. I thank the Committee for its hard work.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-13a.356.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1450" speakername="Madeleine Moon" colnum="356"  time="015:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081113/halltext/81113h0004.htm#08111392000344">
	<p pid="a.356.0/1">Although I am not a member of the Committee and I played no part in its compilation of the report, I am grateful for the opportunity to raise some of the issues that have been directly affecting my constituents and that, perhaps, reflect some of its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.0/2">I first became aware of many of the issues when the deaths were taking place in Bridgend and media coverage suggested that an internet-based death cult was operating and influencing some of the young people in my constituency. I examined that claim and found no basis in fact for an internet death cult in operation, but that took me along a line of exploration that has had myriad repercussions for me. It took me to the so-called suicide recipe sites, which do more than give people advice on how to take their life. Some of those sites are so truly pernicious and evil that they actively seek to persuade those who enter them to take their own life.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.0/3">I have been working with the Ministry of Justice on how we can use the review of the Suicide Act 1961 to look at drawing the activities such sites into the classification of assisting a suicide. I have also been seeking meetings with the internet service providers to persuade them to actively bury such sites, so that they are made more difficult to access, and that, as an alternative, where people are looking for information in relation to suicide, the ISPs promote information, advice and guidance to help people who are potentially suicidal to access supportive information and supportive sites. I commend those ISPs that are taking those steps, although not all are.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.0/4">The internet can be used successfully. An Australian website called Reachout.com.au, which is now looking to expand into Ireland and the United States&mdash;I hope that it would be looked at positively here in the United Kingdom&mdash;cut the number of young people's deaths, because young people had a website they could go to for confidential information, where they could test whether they needed help and support in respect of their feelings and confusion&mdash;relating to self-harm, for example&mdash;and which could help them find out where to go for such support. Positive information can be accessed on websites and it is imperative that we direct vulnerable people to them. I have found the Samaritans and YoungMinds sites to be particularly helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.0/5">That led me to look at social networking sites. Many of the youngsters in Bridgend who died had been using such sites. I have been impressed at how often the front pages of such sites immediately provide hyperlinks to supportive information, and we must work with those sites to promote that more proactively. Areas that we have not looked at but need to look at include advice to young people on the risks of providing not just information that may allow them to be targeted by people who may want to gained access to them and to hurt them, but photographs and comments that may be utilised elsewhere. I hope to reveal some details later.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.0/6">A great deal of distress was caused to many of the families in my constituency by the print media and their websites, which took some of the comments and photographs from social networking sites and used them in multiple press reports. In fairness to our print media and thanks to the work of the Press Complaints Commission and its willingness to collaborate and to work with me and families, it was possible to issue desist notices, and such photographs are no longer constantly used whenever there is a story. However, it is not possible to issue similar desist notices for online use of such photographs.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.0/7">That led me to issue two internet safety leaflets: one for parents and one for youngsters. I had a lot of help from Dr. Tanya Byron when putting them together. She agreed to look at them and to check the content to ensure that they complied with her recommendations. They are on my website if hon. Members want to use them in their constituencies. I took them into all my primary schools.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-13a.358.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1450" speakername="Madeleine Moon" colnum="358"  time="015:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081113/halltext/81113h0004.htm#08111392000348">
	<p pid="a.358.3/1">Indeed they are, because youngsters lie about their ages. The problem is how to prove their age. They are so savvy&mdash;far more so than we are.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/2">I am not the mother of a young child; I have a 24-year-old son who is extremely savvy about the internet. However, I remember when, many years ago, he was in a chat room and was talking to what he thought was a young girl. When I saw him drawing a map of the inside of our home, showing where the doors and windows were, and what equipment was in the house, I asked him what he was doing, and he said, &quot;Well she sent me a description of her house.&quot; I then asked him how he knew that she was not a burglar seeking access to our house and finding out where the easy pickings were. He had not thought of that. Sometimes, as parents, we must put nasty thoughts into our children's minds about how to keep safe on the streets. We all talk about stranger danger and about people approaching our youngsters in the street, but we must now teach them about internet stranger danger as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1863" name="Siân James">the Member for Swansea, East (Mrs. James)</phrase> came to me about accessing someone on Facebook whom she could talk to. One of her constituents had come to her following the death of her baby. She had gone on to Facebook looking for a support group, which the social networking sites are excellent at providing. She was extremely distressed when she came across a group on dead babies, which had posted comments such as, &quot;Dead babies make me laugh&quot; and, &quot;I like licking chocolate off dead babies.&quot; Despite a complaint being made, that group still exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/4">In our discussions, the PCC agreed to look at the management of online newspaper sites, where there is little regulation. I had a meeting with some of the editors of <i>The Sun</i> to express the families' distress at its online site, which enabled people to click for a video show of the faces of all the young people who had died in my constituency. When I pointed out the bad taste of that, it was quickly taken down, and I commend <i>The Sun</i> on that action. Often different people work in the newsrooms and on the online site. That is a matter we need to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/5">More recently, I was introduced to YouTube. I was absolutely horrified by what I found there. It was brought to my attention by an e-mail from a relative of one of the youngsters who died in my constituency that a number of videos had been posted on YouTube that highlighted the deaths of young people in Bridgend. I looked at some of those videos, and I have to say that I wonder what goes through the minds of some people. Despite the fact that my constituent had tried to contact YouTube several times, she could not get the material removed. I have had one of the sites taken down&mdash;in fairness to YouTube it did take it down&mdash;but others are still there. The one that is particularly distressing to the relative I have been contacted by is still there.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/6">Briefly, I would like to read some of the comments posted by people on the site. One of the comments suggested that the deaths in Bridgend were okay because the people were all Welsh. It was alright for Welsh people to die&mdash;in fact, the world was a better place for the death of these Welsh people. That comment has now been taken down. I will censor the comments from the site because no decent person writes such things and uses some of the language used. The person who posted the video referred to the sister of one of the young men who died as a retard and went on to state:</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/7" class="indent">&quot;who cares if your brother committed suicide? why do you have family that kill themselves to start all this...and to get found dead&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/8">Further comments state that it is</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/9" class="indent">&quot;not my fault your family is retarded and shooting themselves, who do you blame usually? god? people from outside Bridgend?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/10">and</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/11" class="indent">&quot;its retarded failures like you who are thankfully killing themselves off because they realised they are useless&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.3/12">As hon. Members can imagine, I have had to keep to just some of the repeatable comments posted alongside these videos.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-13a.364.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" speakername="Don Foster" colnum="364"  time="016:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081113/halltext/81113h0005.htm#08111392000355">
	<p pid="a.364.1/1">We can debate statistics, but for the record the latest figures that I have show that of the 50 games that PEGI rated at 18-plus over the past 12 months, the film rating board downgraded 22&mdash;almost half. Twenty were rated at 15, and two were given a 12 rating&mdash;including &quot;Mass Effect&quot;, the game that boasts impalement and burning bodies among other things.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/2">I genuinely believe that PEGI ratings are more informative, as they rate games by age and by content. Overall, my view is that that is the better bet. However, I accept the argument made by in the Committee's report that</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/3" class="indent">&quot;the widespread recognition of the BBFC's classification categories in the UK and their statutory backing offer significant advantages which the PEGI system lacks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/4">As I said earlier, widespread recognition, but not with statutory backing, could be achieved with an appropriate campaign. Given that the industry has come up with a traffic light system, I believe the issue can be resolved quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/5">The rest of the report deals with internet regulation, and I am largely content with its recommendations and with the Government's positive response. Self-regulation seems to be working well; at this stage, I would not want to see us going down the route of introducing strict legislation. Self-regulation is helped through a range of bodies. For instance, the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford praised the Internet Watch Foundation for its work, and I join him in that. It has been successful in getting the ISPs to work together in taking down sites of the sort that he described. I agree that we need a body that brings them together in a self-regulatory way, so that there is some uniformity in how things are done&mdash;for instance, in the time necessary for takedown and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/6">Other bodies have been mentioned. I mentioned the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre&mdash;CEOP. Like the Committee, I am concerned about funding for that body. On that subject, the Government's response was somewhat disappointing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-13a.366.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" speakername="Edward Vaizey" colnum="366"  time="016:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081113/halltext/81113h0006.htm#08111392000360">
	<p pid="a.366.1/1">Effectively, that is what I am saying. My hon. Friend will be delighted to know that, when I move on to the regulation of the internet, freedom will not necessarily be my watchword, although it is an important element of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/2">The Government have done some extensive work in this area and have rightly received plaudits from hon. Members, and certainly I do not seek to create any artificial party-political divide between ourselves and the Government. In March 2007, the then Chancellor, the Prime Minister, asked Ofcom to consider certain matters, including an information campaign, software blocking, assistance to parents in restricting access and getting internet service providers to provide parents with access to blocking software. Then came the well-received and well-publicised Byron review, which was commissioned in September 2007 and reported in March.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/3">After that came the report by the Select Committee of my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, which rightly praised the Home Office task force on child protection on the internet. It brought together in the same room the relevant parties to get them to talk about the issues&mdash;that sounds like a trite way of describing the taskforce, but as I have discovered in my political career, bringing parties together in the same room is probably the most valuable thing that can be done when trying to get any initiative off the ground. As a result of the Byron review, the Government brought forward&mdash;this is another cause for congratulations&mdash;the introduction of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety, which effectively is a beefed-up version of the Home Office taskforce.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/4">I agree completely with my hon. Friend&mdash;I think that the Minister does, too, judging by her reaction to his remarks&mdash;that we should have one Minister with clear responsibility for the issues before us. I understand, of course, why different Departments want to have a say in this debate. There are four relevant Departments: the Home Office and the Departments for Children, Schools and Families, for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, and for Culture, Media and Sport&mdash;but just saying that exhausts me! As hon. Members have mentioned, people want a hotline that they can ring to get through to an internet service provider. Similarly, however, policy makers need to know that they can go to one Minister and that their concerns and interests will be followed up.</p>

	<p pid="a.370.1/1">I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman, and I am now into the territory of making up policy on the hoof. Internet providers will come back and say that such a system will cost too much and that it is bureaucratic and so on. None the less, the Government are in a position to put out the information, and it is up to the internet service providers to react to it. If they are happy to be 55th in a league table of take-down times, so be it, but it should be something that they consider. It is part of their brand and part of the way in which they can sell their services to parents to show that they are socially responsible providers that help to protect children from harmful content.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/2">As I have been progressing in my speech, I have noticed a lot of raised eyebrows, so it is clearly time to bring my remarks to an end. I want to turn briefly to video game classification. This is where I bring in my mild criticism of the Chairman of the Select Committee. As has been pointed out by the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, I am a strong supporter of the UK video games industry. The title of the Select Committee report, &quot;Harmful content on the Internet and in video games&quot; continues to promote the myth that all video games are harmful. Clearly, that is nonsense. Most video games are not harmful; nor do they contain inappropriate content. Most kids play football video games, which are extraordinarily realistic. As I pointed out earlier, my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings can introduce himself to video games by playing &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/3">I suggest that there should have been a separate report, pointing out what a pea soup the current system for classifying video games is. The system is a perfectly legitimate issue to consider and one that needs to be sorted out. I echo and support a lot of the comments made by the hon. Member for Bath. He pointed out how important the video games industry is to the UK economy. The Government continue to sit completely on their hands, as Canada mounts an extremely aggressive campaign to attract video games companies to Canada. I have no doubt that the Chairman of the Homes Affairs Committee will be paying their air fares. The fact is that they contribute to the UK economy. The Government's excuse for inaction is that they are taking up the matter with the World Trade Organisation. However, by the time it gets a hearing there, our video games industry could well be on the floor.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/4">There are some strong merits to the argument that the British Board of Film Classification should take over the classification of video games. It already classifies 18-plus films. The BBFC says that, if the role were extended to 12 and over, as it wants, it would have to deal with 300 to 500 extra games over and above the 270 that it already monitors. Similarly, PEGI has some strong advantages. By its very nature, it is a pan-European system. One of the advantages of playing legitimate online video games&mdash;I do not include &quot;Kaboom&quot; in that group, as I said earlier&mdash;is that one can play with people from across Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.375.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that suggestion. I must say that, although targets and similar things are very unpopular, name and shame can sometimes work very well indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.1/2">We also want levels of search to be locked in, so that that is where users go each time&mdash;that is the default setting. Like my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, we also want prominently displayed safety information on video games.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme spoke about pre-screening of user-generated internet content. I am very glad to see that MySpace is doing that. It is that kind of responsible action that we are looking for, as it means that people can trust a company.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.1/4">Many people have said that the internet is like the wild west in the gold rush, and that sooner or later it will be regulated. Obviously, what we need is for it to be regulated sooner rather than later. We need the service providers themselves to come forward and show that they are the sort of responsible organisation whose services we can trust our children and vulnerable adults&mdash;they should not be left out of this picture&mdash;and even some adults who are not so vulnerable, like myself, to use. I myself have been quite shocked to find that I can accidentally put in a search parameter that will produce something that was certainly not what I, a boring MP, was looking for.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.1/5">We must ensure that the search engines have a clear link to child safety information and safe search settings on the front page of their website. I very much like the &quot;stranger danger&quot; analogy that my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend used, because we must teach children the dangers of the internet. It is sad to make children more scared than interested, but fortunately, the internet is so interesting that children tend to overcome their fear.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.1/6">We must also work on developing parental control software. As the Chairman of the Select Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1703" name="John Whittingdale">the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale)</phrase>, rightly said, the watershed is terribly porous. In fact, it is like a sieve. People can get straight though it, or straight by it. We need that control software to communicate automatically with websites' age verification systems, to prevent children from signing up to sites with false dates of birth.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.1/7">I know that the question of identity cards is one that divides this House, and not on party lines. However, one can see the value of some form of age verification, some sort of card. It is useful when it comes to alcohol and cigarettes, and it is certainly useful when it comes to buying video games and other material on the internet.</p>

	<p pid="a.377.1/1">What Minister just listed is identical to what Dr. Tanya Byron recommended, and would obviously lead to the BBFC system being used because, as the Chairman of the Select Committee has rightly said, the BBFC system is statutory and PEGI is not. Is the Minister saying that the Government are not open to having a non-statutory code and they have already decided on BBFC? That is what she has just said she is looking for.</p>
