	<p pid="a.375.3/1">I am pleased to have secured this Adjournment debate. It is pertinent, particularly as it comes after what I describe as the sacking of the chief executive of the NHS, and after the announcement only last week that the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust faces an &pound;8.1 million deficit this year and is engaged in a financial recovery programme that will involve the sacking of 300 staff and the loss of vital services to the trust at three hospitals that cover Cornwall, two of which are in my constituency. I also raised the issue of acute hospital funding on <phrase class="date" code="">6 April</phrase> last year&mdash;the debate can be found in columns 1545 to 1554 of <i>Hansard</i>.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.3/2">I should declare an interest, as my wife is a nurse in the local trust. I should also say by way of background that I welcome the increase in NHS resources. I am not mealy-mouthed about the substantial resources that the Government have put into the NHS since 1999. However, many of us are asking what those resources have achieved. There have been cuts in some of the headline figures in respect of waiting lists, but serious questions must be asked about the effectiveness of the use of resources in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.3/3">The sacking of Sir Nigel Crisp last week demonstrated the seriousness of the situation that many hundreds of trusts will face towards the end of this financial year. Arguably, Ministers are more exposed now that he is gone than they were before, and his departure raises questions about why so many primary care trusts, and acute trusts in particular, are facing such high deficits.</p>

	<p pid="a.375.5/1">Given the hon. Gentleman's last remark, one could say that his question is rhetorical. The fact is that the Secretary of State appoints all the boards and sets the targets, guidelines and parameters in which each trust operates. I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman that trusts are, in effect, agents of the Government&mdash;they are not separate from the Government in any way. The Government cannot pretend that they are remote bodies over which they have little control, or simply pass the buck and not accept responsibility. I shall further embellish that point later. I do not take the view of those who would like to secure a ministerial scalp before lunch that somehow Ministers must be accountable for the loss of a paper clip in some distant outpost, but they must be accountable for important matters such as the fundamental management of NHS finance. The chief executive lost his job over that issue, and, as Ministers are now exposed, it is the Minister's duty to be accountable.</p>

	<p pid="a.376.3/1">Of course it was welcome, but one could set a benchmark against which pay increases would be assessed. GPs work nine-to-five, five days a week yet get five times as much as hospital nurses, who deal with stressful situations and work antisocial hours&mdash;weekends, nights and so on. Whether they should receive one fifth of what GPs do is a matter of parity within the NHS, which obviously needs to be sorted out. There is also the question of regrading, which happens whenever pay increases come along. Nurses are often downgraded rather than given a salary increase. The picture is not quite as rosy as the hon. Gentleman describes, although I agree that the general increase&mdash;the general trend&mdash;is welcome. I thought that I had welcomed it earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.3/2">The situation is dire indeed in Cornwall, which I mentioned earlier. Right hon. and hon. Members would be surprised if I did not mention it a few times. There are significant overspends this year, but that is not new: the PCTs inherited deficits from their predecessor organisations. The question is whether the services provided in Cornwall as a result of all this extra money being spent&mdash;more than the Government had in fact budgeted for&mdash;are better than in other parts of the country, or whether there is some other explanation. Also, what future opportunities will there be to review the appropriateness of the Government's funding formula for NHS trusts?</p>
	<p pid="a.376.3/3">The situation in Cornwall is serious. There are concerns about how things are being managed, and there is a lack of confidence in the local NHS. Last year, I was at Helston protesting with the local community about the cutting of 10 of 34 beds in that vital community hospital, which serves the remote Lizard peninsula. On Tuesday last week, I was complaining to the chief executive of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust that there were 14 ambulances, nearly the whole provision for Cornwall, queued up outside the front door of accident and emergency at Treliske in Truro, and there were no beds available within the trust to admit patients, yet a day later the trust was talking about a deficit and the need to sack staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.3/4">It is clear that the situation is untenable. It demonstrates that the service is in crisis. Managers go through an admirable coping process and say that everything is under control, but it is not. There are some very serious questions about the future financing of hospital services in places such as Cornwall which need to be addressed. I do not bear any criticism of front-line clinical staff, who are clearly hard-working, dedicated professionals, but local people worry that their service is not being run in the best interest of patients. What is the problem? Is it a failure of staff, of management, of funding or of the Government? We need to understand how funds are allocated to PCTs, and I know that for many this is a rather turgid subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.3/5">Since the national health service was established in 1948, a variety of formulae have been employed to attempt to achieve fair and equitable funding. The present system can be traced back to the resource allocation working party created by the then Department of Health and Social Security in 1976. The working party introduced the concept of weighted capitation, and current allocations in England are weighted in respect of four separate components in NHS funding: hospital and community health services, drugs and prescriptions, general practice infrastructure and HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.3/6">Hospital and community health services account for 82 per cent. of the overall spend, and a population head count is weighted for each PCT, according to age, emergency ambulance cost adjustment, need and market forces. Some, like the emergency ambulance cost adjustment, account for just 0.5 per cent. of the overall allocation. Need indices are not favourable to rural areas. For example, Cornwall, which is the poorest objective 1 area in the country, has significantly less funds according to its need index than the two other, wealthier objective 1 areas&mdash;Merseyside and South Yorkshire&mdash;and those regions are far more urban than Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.3/7">I will not go into detail about all the factors that go into weighing the matter up, but rural matters tend to lose out on the need index. The biggest impact is the higher weighting given to the market forces factor. The three Cornwall PCTs collectively tend to be at the bottom of the market forces factor league table, which contains 303 PCTs across the country. At present, Torbay is at the bottom, with the West of Cornwall PCT in my constituency second to bottom. However, the table is supposed to reflect local wage rates and other market factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.3/8">I fully accept that all Members engage in a certain amount of special pleading with the Minister for the formula to be skewed in a direction that would benefit their own constituency, and I suppose that I am guilty of that. However, there is a fundamental issue of parity in this case. The market forces factor has a heavy influence on the overall funding allocation and it seems bizarre that the consideration that seems to have the greatest impact on the overall allocation of the market forces factor applies in circumstances w<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">here, as the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> said, the majority of the funds are spent according to national pay structures.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.3/9">In any case, there is a lower staff turnover in areas such as Cornwall. The National Audit Office report in 2004, which examined the cause of deficits in Cornwall's PCTs, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.376.3/10" class="indent">&quot;There is low staff turnover, with many staff at the top of their payscale.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.376.3/11">In fact, in circumstances where Cornwall is at the bottom of the earnings league table for both the public and the private sector, those employed in the NHS tend to be found at the upper end of their pay scale. If anything, we should be getting more money to reflect that, rather than less.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.3/12">Of course, that still does not justify the abnormality of the heavy weight placed on the market forces factor at the expense of all other factors. For example, the geography of Cornwall means that it cannot call on emergency services from the north, west or south at times of crisis, which should be factored into its emergency service planning, its ambulance service, its accident and emergency services and the vital casualty service at West Cornwall hospital in Penzance. Regarding access to services, Cornwall's geography means that it is bordered by only one authority to the east, so the capacity to share resources and achieve economies of scale in that way is very limited. The acute trust's provision of services has to operate at 13 different sites, as well as running the three other services.</p>

	<p pid="a.378.1/1">It is certainly true that there has been enormous surprise and concern about the loss of the contract from KernowDoc. Serco, a company that does not have a tremendous track record so far&mdash;I understand it has just started running an out-of-hours service in the Cardiff area&mdash;has successfully bid for the out-of-hours contract. I understand the concerns regarding how streamlining or joint working with other out-of-hours services, such as NHS Direct, will be co-ordinated under the new regime, but many GPs who will be called on to support that service have yet to be convinced that the new arrangements are adequate. In fact, they may add further to the administrative complexity of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/2">To return to the issue of the market forces factor, the King's Fund report in 2004 cites its chief economist John Appleby, who, in issue 114 of the <i>Health Service Journal, </i>said:</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/3" class="indent">&quot;While the principle of adjusting purchasers' allocations and providers' prices to take account of unavoidable differences in cost is clearly sound, there is a question of how to do it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/4">He went on to say that the market forces factor</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/5" class="indent">&quot;is not the perfect solution to the issue of unavoidable cost variations&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/6">That is why I am rather surprised that the Government have not taken into account other geographical factors of the type that I described. There are issues of economies of scale because it is clear that in areas such as Cornwall which have problems of remote rurality one cannot sacrifice accessibility by putting all services into one major centre. The unit costs are inevitably going to be higher if there are more smaller community hospitals and other services of the type that I described. There are bound to be higher travel costs. Research has shown that rural staff tend to travel two and a half times further than urban-based staff&mdash;that seems rather a low figure&mdash;and higher levels of unproductive time as well as cost prevail as a result. Therefore, staff-to-patient rations need to be higher.</p>

	<p pid="a.380.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I was not going to cover the frankly diversionary issue of choose and book, and the expensive computer and administrative system that will need to be put in place for what is a fatuous choice for people in remote areas. It is quite absurd. Most people in my area want to be treated, and treated well, in their local hospital, for which they have enormous loyalty and respect. Instead of the resources going into administrative procedures, they want them to be spent in their local hospital, which is often struggling because of the lack of those resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/2">What numerical impact does the market forces factor have on a place such as Cornwall? According to the table I mentioned earlier, on which Cornwall is 11 per cent. below the national average as far as the market forces factor is concerned, the calculation made by the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust showed that if Cornwall were just 4 per cent. below the national average, the trust would earn an extra &pound;10 million and the primary care trust would earn &pound;4 million. At a stroke, it would remove the deficit and put the NHS trust into credit. It demonstrates just how important the market forces factor is.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/3">In a debate last year, the then Under-Secretary of State for Health with responsibility for community, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, said in response to me that</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/4" class="indent">&quot;if it is clear that the formula allocation is not working for some reason, it will be reviewed.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>; Vol. 432, c. 1554.]</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/5">I hope that the Minister accepts that there are serious concerns today about how the allocation operates.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/6">In the national context, we must consider more widely why funding crises affect a' quarter or more of NHS trusts. There is bureaucracy, and there is a large number of chief executives. Even allowing for Sir Nigel Crisp's intervention last summer, when he sought to amalgamate many PCTs, 13 chief executives still need to come together to obtain a strategic view of health services in Cornwall. That includes social services, all PCTs and the various trusts that serve the Isles of Scilly and Cornwall. At the end of the PCT amalgamation process, all we have ended up with is too few chief executives&mdash;not a big change at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.381.4/1">I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will not mind that, having taken so many interventions, I have taken so long. It is important to tease out the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.4/2">It is true that as the Government, through the Secretary of State, appoint the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust board and chief executive, they are responsible for the climate in which the board operates and the decisions that it takes. The Secretary of State should face those 300 people to explain to them that they are losing their jobs because of the direct relationship between that extremely bad news and the decisions that she takes.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.4/3">If I had time, I could explain why payment by results has a distorting effect, adds to trusts' administrative costs and does not help with greater efficiencies. The target culture also has a distorting impact. I understand that we must seek incentives to meet the need for desirable outcomes, but hitting targets often means missing the point. Although performance against targets seems okay, actions taken have been at variance with the intention of those goals. Ambulance waiting times outside accident and emergency units show that patients are not brought inside because of the fear that they will reach the four-hour waiting time limit. An admissions netherworld has been created in which people are taken out of accident and emergency units and put into clinical decisions units before they are eventually admitted. I am not sure that those situations are entirely clinically acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.4/4">The target culture also distorts clinical priorities and patient safety. Ambulance response time targets are met by co-responders and volunteers. That is fine, and we appreciate the efforts of those volunteers, but often that is simply a ploy by which to address the need to meet ambulance response time targets. Targets also encourage a culture of cynicism and manipulation of data, as shown in the article by Gwyn Bevan and Christopher Hood in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-18">18 February</phrase> this year. The target culture creates additional bureaucracy, as shown by a consultant in my constituency, Alastair Paterson. He treated all his serious cancer patients immediately, without a waiting list, but he was told last year that he had to create a waiting list&mdash;more unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.4/5">All that raises questions, and I have given the Minister notice of some of the issues that I shall raise. In my view, local authorities, because of the budgetary constraints and strictures on them, are, in effect, agents of Government. If that is true, certainly primary care trusts and acute trusts are agents of Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.381.4/6">How can we explain the overspend in Cornwall? What assessment have the Government and the Minister made of the appropriateness of the funding formula for places such as Cornwall? What opportunity will there be to vary the formula? If the problem is management incompetence, the Secretary of State should step in, but if the problem is not incompetence or bad management, there must be another explanation, which must include questions of formula funding. Does the Minister accept that some of the largest proportionate deficits are experienced in the poorest regions? Does she accept that targets in respect of the new so-called private sector disciplines have an impact in terms of increased management costs?</p>
	<p pid="a.381.4/7">The situation in Cornwall is extremely serious. I am sure that the Minister understands that 300 people will lose their jobs. Patients in Cornwall, who need better services and better access to services, need proper answers. The mayor's parlour campaign team in Cornwall is asking for a review of health spending in Cornwall. I hope that the Minister will consider these questions seriously. The problem is not only national; in some areas, there is a particular focus and a particular acute need. The acute need in Cornwall needs to be addressed by the Government undertaking a review of funding and spending and of the provision of hospital and acute services.</p>

	<p pid="a.383.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">The hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> has done us all a great service today. The Minister will go through her Division Lobby and talk to her colleagues, but she needs to note the fact that, on the Labour Benches generally, there is not enormous concern about the NHS, as is evidenced by the fact that there are very few Labour Members in this Chamber today. That is not because they are uninterested in the subject, but because of the way in which the Government have skewed the formulas and the fact that we now live in two Englands. That so many colleagues are present from the south, the centre, the west and the east of England shows that the NHS, in parts of the country, is in serious difficulties. In Oxfordshire, for example, we received only 85 per cent. of the average of national spending on the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.0/2">I shall ask the Minister specific questions. The Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust faces a &pound;15 million deficit for this financial year. The strategic health authority, at the behest of the Secretary of State, sent in the accountants, the turnaround team. That team concluded that there was no financial mismanagement at the trust&mdash;indeed, no incompetence whatever&mdash;but that the deficit arose because of &quot;over-trading&quot;. The deficit did not become apparent until halfway through the financial year. If it was caused by over-trading, that over-trading did not become apparent until halfway through the financial year. Who is responsible for that? Is it the PCTs, which are the commissioners? Is it the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust? Should it have known that it was over-trading, should the Thames Valley strategic health authority have had mechanisms in place to see what was going on in a key trust, or should the Department itself have known that something untoward was going on?</p>
	<p pid="a.383.0/3">What do Ministers and their financial advisers mean by &quot;over-trading&quot;? Surely it means simply that GPs have been referring patients on the waiting list to the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust list for perfectly legitimate treatment and operations. How will Ministers deal with such &quot;over-trading&quot;? We have seen that, in part, they are dealing with it through the rather bizarre system called the clinical liaison advisory service, which is, in effect, second-guessing GPs' referrals. That means that the system is trying to limit the number of people who can have access to hospital treatment in Oxfordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.383.0/4">Today is <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-14">Tuesday 14 March</phrase>. The end of the financial year is only days away, but we still do not know how the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust will save &pound;15 million&mdash;we have absolutely no idea. I wrote to the chief executive, Trevor Campbell Davis, some two weeks ago, asking whether he could give some indication as to how, between now and the end of the financial year, he intended to save that money. As of yet, I do not have a response. I think that that indicates that the sum is so significant that the savings can be made only through large-scale closure of wards, large-scale reductions in services and very considerable postponement of operations. Whose responsibility is it to ensure that the books of the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust are brought back into balance? Is it the responsibility of the chief executive of the trust or is it the responsibility of the chief executive of the Thames Valley strategic health authority?</p>

	<p pid="a.384.1/1">I will not give way because quite a lot of colleagues want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.1/2">We experience hit after hit in Oxfordshire. Only this week we were told that, under the purchasing parity formula in the NHS, we will lose &pound;4.5 million. That presumably means that the single PCT that will emerge in Oxfordshire in the summer will have &pound;4.5 million less to spend next year. Some Labour Members consider such sums to be trivial. Actually, for a trust that is having to save &pound;15 million of unplanned spending, these slash-and-burn cuts always happen not in the most rational way but in such a way that the largest amount of money can be saved in the shortest time, which often damages health care considerably.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.1/3">We have yet to see the worst in Oxfordshire, because we have yet to know where the cuts will fall. My real concern is that, in a sense, this issue has nothing to do with the total sum of money going into the NHS. The Minister should reflect on this. The failures that occurred in Oxfordshire were failures of mechanisms. How was it that it took until halfway through the financial year for anyone to realise that anything untoward was happening? What was happening was not really untoward. The Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust was simply doing what it was meant to be doing: treating lots of patients. It is a major teaching hospital and research centre of excellence and it will always treat a large number of people. We all need to know from the Minister what mechanisms will be put in place to stop the type of crisis that I have described recurring year after year.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.1/4">My final point is that the Thames Valley strategic health authority this year had to find, quite justifiably, an extra &pound;15 million for Milton Keynes because the census did not take account of the fact that Milton Keynes had grown so fast. If the authority had had that extra &pound;15 million, it would not have had to raid its reserves and borrowings to bail out Milton Keynes. It would have had some money that it could legitimately have used to help the Oxfordshire health economy to get back into balance this year. Of course, it must get back into balance, but perhaps it could have done so from a position of stability, rather than going into next year with &pound;15 million of cuts from this year to sort out, as well as having to make substantial reductions in activity next year to avoid the &quot;over-trading&quot; position that we are in this year. I should be grateful if the Minister could answer those points today or write to me.</p>

	<p pid="a.384.2/1">Like other hon. Members, I welcome the debate and congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/2">The background to the current deficits in the NHS is Britain's transformation as an economic power. The previous Conservative Administration took this country from its status as the sick man of Europe and an economic basket case to, in 1997, the status of the most powerful economy in Europe&mdash;more powerful than any other in the area. That provided an unprecedented opportunity to transform not only health outcomes but outcomes in a welter of policy areas that would affect the most vulnerable and the weakest in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/3">The health opportunity&mdash;the opportunity to transform our health care&mdash;was, I think, particularly great. To give the Government credit, as other hon. Members have, it could be said that perhaps it has taken a Labour Government to make the record investments in the NHS that have been made, notwithstanding the large increases in spending above inflation that took place under the Conservative Government; but how has the opportunity been used? How has the transformation of the British economy that was brought about by the previous Conservative Government and inherited by the present Government been used to improve health outcomes? Unfortunately, despite their being one of the Government's key targets, health inequalities have in many cases widened and worsened despite the record sums that have been available thanks to the transformation of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/4">The Government's report, &quot;Tackling Health Inequalities&quot;, said that the gap in life expectancy between the bottom fifth and the population as a whole widened by 2 per cent. for males and by 5 per cent. for females between 1997&ndash;99 and 2001&ndash;03. It goes on to deal with the gap in the infant mortality rate between the poorest and the general population, which was 19 per cent. higher for the poorest in 2001&ndash;03 compared to 13 per cent. in 1997&ndash;99.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/5">The NHS, which is now going into crisis, has had record spending put into it, but the very group for which one would have thought the Labour Government would most make a difference&mdash;and indeed they promised that they would make a difference to that group&mdash;has been let down. In fact, Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the university of Sheffield, has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/6" class="indent">&quot;This is the first Labour government that has failed to narrow the gap. It is astonishing after eight years and making reducing health inequality a key target that we are in this position.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/7">Not only is the health service now in financial crisis, with the chief executive forced out ahead of his own timetable, and not only is it recognised that there are hundreds of job losses around the country, but we actually have wider health inequalities at a time of record spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.2/8">This is a true financial crisis. Arguments that it is less than 1 per cent. of the spend are not matched by the reality on the ground, or by the top-slicing that hon. Members have already referred to, which has effectively punished those who have managed to balance their books. That is a direct result of the way in which the Government have interfered, using target culture and central interference in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.385.1/1">I am always delighted to give way to the hon. Gentleman, but just before I do perhaps I may quote the chairman of the British Medical Association's consultants committee. The Minister may find it harder to dismiss his comments than she does to suggest that Opposition Members are trying to score points for no purpose. The chairman, Dr. Paul Miller, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/2" class="indent">&quot;It is hard to understand why at a time when the government has invested unprecedented funding in the health service, trusts may have to lay off staff and close wards . . . Something is going terribly wrong&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/3">I can understand why the Minister does not want to listen when she hears this from the chairman of the consultants committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Something is going terribly wrong when patients pay the price for these financial problems and the government's lack of joined-up thinking&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.386.0/1">I did not recognise that description, but I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I want to challenge the suggestion by his Front-Bench colleague that I described the current position as trivial for the trusts involved. The key point that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members are bringing out is not the burgeoning of an NHS bureaucracy, which is often the butt of attacks by Opposition Members, but the chronic under-management, over many years, of parts of the NHS and, indeed, the dire need for talented public sector accountants and others involved in information and communications technology. I declare an interest as a member of both professions. Is not that the issue, rather than the construct that the hon. Gentleman is trying to sell to the House at the moment?</p>

	<p pid="a.387.2/1">I realise that time is marching on, so I shall keep my contribution as brief as possible. I simply want to put on record some of the specific challenges facing my primary care trust in Milton Keynes, and I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> for setting out some of the special problems that we face.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.2/2">I start by paying tribute to the primary care trusts' hard-working staff. All too often, the focus is on doctors and nurses, and little credit seems to be given to the support staff, so I would like to sort that out today.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.2/3">Like virtually every trust in the country, Milton Keynes primary care trust faces a difficult financial year in 2006&ndash;07. I can, however, praise the Government&mdash;this is one thing I can praise them for&mdash;because, for first time in many years, due recognition will be given to the fact that the population of my city has increased rapidly. That has helped to relieve some of the pressure, because the old funding formula was based on out-of-date population figures, which made life difficult for trusts such as Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.2/4">Although I am always happy to give the Government credit where credit is due, I would probably struggle to go any further, and I apologise for that. One of the principal problems facing the trust is that although it has extra cash to take the population increase into account, it feels that it has much less control over that cash. Given the current NHS crisis, it does not understand why the Government are retreating into centralised control, rather than allowing it to have total control over its cash.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.2/5">With that issue to one side, it is clear that this will be yet another difficult year for the health service in Milton Keynes. However, one of the things that impresses me most about Milton Keynes PCT is that it has a clear strategy, despite the financial constraints, of developing services. It is not simply retreating. At the heart of that strategy is the start of a major change, with the trust moving from being an illness service to a health service, and I am sure that all of us would support that. Two key priorities will be to start moving more services closer to where people live and to change the pattern of emergency care. The hope is that that will be achieved by experimenting with emergency care practitioners visiting people at home, opening a walk-in centre and reducing the need for emergency care.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.2/6">That, however, is where I begin to have a problem. Although those are innovative ideas, which should be applauded, the primary care trust admits that part of its motivation comes from the fact that emergency care costs are spiralling and that reducing emergency admissions is a key target in the trust's effort to contain costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.2/7">Other factors also mean that the trust's scope for manoeuvre in the next financial year will be extremely restricted. First, the strategic health authority has charged the trust a one-off levy of &pound;5.5 million to pay off debts from the current financial year across the region and meet the cost of reorganising the health service&mdash;an issue to which my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury referred. The idea is that some of that money will be returned to the trust at an unknown date in the future, but that is the key point&mdash;the date is unknown. My question is whether the financial crisis in the NHS has reached such a point that we now have to rob Peter to pay Paul? When will that money be returned? How can people plan?</p>
	<p pid="a.387.2/8">Secondly, virtually all the &pound;2.5 million that the trust has been told that it can use to provide extra services is already committed to the running of the new walk-in centre and paying for the new electronic care records system&mdash;there is simply no room for manoeuvre. An added problem is that the tariff and rules associated with payment by results are still being revised, and the final figures have not been released. Combined with the fact that the trust simply does not know when the money that it has to pay to meet the one-off levy will be returned to it, such problems make budgeting for the future very difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.2/9">I have a message for the Minister. As she may be aware, Milton Keynes is an unusual city in that it has a Labour MP, a Conservative MP and a Liberal Democrat council. However, all three political parties are united in their belief that the only future for Milton Keynes primary care trust is for its boundaries to be coterminous with those of a unitary authority. We have a great history of working closely with our great council, and not a single person believes that we should move to a wider primary care trust, which would share the north of Buckinghamshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.2/10">My final point is about the Two Shires Ambulance NHS trust, which is an excellent three-star trust based in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire. It has a budget of just &pound;30 million, and although there might be financial incentives for creating a larger trust, there is great unease locally that a super-trust that stretched all the way down to the Isle of Wight would be too large and that much local knowledge would be lost. There is great cynicism locally when the Government say that they are consulting on the reorganisation of the Two Shires trust. Will the Minister explain why, if the consultation period is still open, the jobs of chief executive and chairman in the proposed new super-trust were advertised in <i>The Times</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January</phrase>? Is that really what consultation is all about, with decisions being made long before consultation periods are closed?</p>

	<p pid="a.389.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> for arranging this debate. I also thank you, Mr. Amess, for calling me to speak, and I know that I have to end at half-past 10. I had not intended to speak, but when I saw how few Members were intending to participate, I thought that I could perhaps get in.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/2">I particularly congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> on identifying all the key points that are causing a major crisis in the finances of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the health service. The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> mentioned purchaser protection adjustment, and there is also the top-slicing of primary care trusts and the fact that we do not yet know what the tariffs will be. It is important to understand what impact that can have on hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/3">There are certain ways in which trusts can press a button and get money from their PCTs. Some PCTs are finding that unusual things are being diagnosed and that that benefits the trusts. We cannot complain when trusts do that&mdash;they are simply using the processes that exist&mdash;but it puts other PCTs under financial pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/4">The top-slicing varies. The initial figures were between 2 per cent. and 6 per cent. and will perhaps end up at 1.5 per cent. or 2 per cent. The purchaser protection adjustment may be 2 per cent. For my trust, it is 2 per cent. this year, 3 per cent. the year after and 4 per cent.&mdash;compared with the current financial year, of course&mdash;in the subsequent year.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/5">The big problem is that things are done at the last minute. Anyone who does financial planning in the public sector needs time to plan. In that respect, Ministers have responsibility for the shambles that they are creating in the health service because they are signing off last-minute changes to the finances. A large part of those finances are difficult to change, so those parts that can be changed suffer greater changes, and emergency care is one of them. Obviously, certain people put a greater demand on emergency resources, so a lot of effort will go into them.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/6">It has recently been argued that managers should be sacked without compensation if they fail to manage finances&mdash;that is, they will not get a peerage. However, we really have to ask whether Ministers should be sacked without compensation for putting us in the current situation, because this is the calm before the storm. It is no good the Government saying, &quot;It's all about local decisions,&quot; because it is not. The Government claim credit for putting lots of money into health services and say, &quot;Isn't it brilliant?&quot; They then cut the amount available and say, &quot;It's nothing to do with us, guv&mdash;it's all to do with local decisions. You've closed the hospital. You've got to balance the books.&quot; However, the fact is that last-minute changes are causing the crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/7">Payment by results is turning into a massive shambles across the country. There are last-minute changes, there is no co-ordination and people have no time to plan. Frankly, we have to look very carefully at top-slicing and payment by activity, which is about &pound;320 million across the country. If we reverse that, there is a better chance of doing something over the next year. Otherwise, everything will be a total mess.</p>

	<p pid="a.390.0/1">May I begin by joining o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">thers in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing the debate? He is known across the House as a doughty fighter for Cornwall, and he has demonstrated that again this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/2">Let me pick up from w<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1420" name="John Hemming">here my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming)</phrase> left off. In a typically terse and effective contribution, he highlighted the kernel of the problem, namely that nobody objects to financial discipline and rigour when huge amounts of taxpayers' money are being spent, but that those on the front line and the people who manage our hospital finances are faced with permanent revolution. As many colleagues know, there is an attempt in local government to give longer-term stability through two or three-year budgets. The way things are going, the NHS would like three-week budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/3">To expand on the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley, a letter went out to PCT finance directors on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase> to say that the purchaser parity adjustment&mdash;the adjustment made in cases in which the amount paid is different from the tariff&mdash;will be halved next year. So at six or seven weeks' notice, trusts suddenly have millions of pounds more or less than they expected. To pick two cases at random, at about six weeks' notice, South Gloucestershire PCT will lose &pound;3.8 million and Oxford City PCT will lose nearly &pound;10 million. How is the front line, which is accused of being causing the deficits by mismanagement, expected to manage against a backdrop of permanent change? We are told that the system is designed to reward well managed trusts&mdash;those that get their deficits under control&mdash;yet those that have done so now find that their budgets are to be top-sliced to try to bail out other parts of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/4">In the midst of all that, the kernel of a good idea is trying to get out. That is to say that, given that the NHS has been shockingly unaware of its costs under Governments of both of the two larger parties for a protracted period, the move to sort out the situation, identify what the costs are and reflect them more accurately is a move in the right direction. However, we should not try to sort out in 10 weeks structural imbalances that have been built up over 10 years or more. What have the Government done? Instead of recognising that there are imbalances and developing a long-term strategy to sort them out, they are hastening the process of reform by bringing in and standardising the tariff prices more quickly. That is a strange reaction to the imbalances.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, in an unusual display of loyalty, said, essentially, &quot;What is &pound;800 million among friends? It is not a big percentage.&quot; However, it is a mistake to net off the surpluses against the deficits, because the fact that there is a surplus somewhere in the country does not make life any better for the place that has the deficit. The gross deficit is, therefore, bigger than the figure that he cited. We have heard from my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives about the front-line impact of the imbalances.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/6">It is possible to get hysterical about all this, and I accept that it is important to keep the issue in context. However, we have to accept that there is a serious problem if front-line services have to be cut, and local people cannot plan because they do not know from one week to the next what their budget is going to be next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, mentioned over-trading. The situation is surreal: the NHS is being driven to be more efficient, do more operations and get waiting lists down, but when it does so, it is told that it is working too hard, doing too much and causing problems and needs to slow down. We have all heard of examples. Through the Liberal Democrat website, libdemnhswatch.com, we have heard of instances that occurred earlier in the year of sessions being cancelled and people being told that they could not run their clinics. Waiting time maxima are turning into waiting time minima. In other words, people who could be seen quicker because there is capacity in the system are being turned away and NHS facilities are lying idle because the money has gone and more cannot be spent until <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase>. That is mismanagement on a grand scale. However, it is not happening at a local level predominantly; it is happening at central level.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-14a.392.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="392"  time="010:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060314/halltext/60314h01.htm#60314h01_spnew41">
	<p pid="a.392.2/1">I knew that I could get the hon. Gentleman off the path of loyalty if I tried. Yes, my heart would, indeed, have sunk had I read that article. That is another example of national Government policy, driven from the top, causing local NHS bodies to spend money less effectively than they might. Of course, one can always spend more money, but that is not always the answer. The answer is to spend the huge amount of money that has been provided more effectively. In many of the examples of which we have heard, that is not being done.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.2/2">That is a classic Government response. Take the example of winter pressures. When there is a problem in winter, money is suddenly found. If that money had been in the budget at the start of the year, it could have been carefully planned and carefully spent. What tends to happen is that central Government panic and throw money at a problem. That is a much more expensive way of doing things. One has to hire people at short notice and drag in extra capacity. Yes, waiting lists have come down, but at great cost. The Government have bought in extra capacity at a high price, when the NHS has capacity at a lower price. However, because of dogma, the Government are determined to spend the money and they have not got the bang for their buck. That is the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.2/3">People keep asking, &quot;How can they have spent all that money but ended up in this situation?&quot; Part of the answer is that a lot of the spending has been unsustainable. Money has been spent on one-off gimmicks and long-term expensive financial contracts. We need long-term financial stability, so that local trusts have freedom, local accountability and the ability to plan. Any rational business would run on that basis. Central Government must take a share of the responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase>, who makes thoughtful contributions to debates such as this and has campaigned effectively on community hospitals, raised the interesting question of how we can have spent all that money but see health inequalities growing. The problem is that deficits tend to be in places where life expectancy is, on average, better&mdash;central London is a different issue. Unfortunately, it would not necessarily help health inequalities if one were to equalise the financing and if money were to go to the deficit areas and away from the surplus areas; we are trying to tackle a double problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.2/5">I have one further point. We have heard about the deficits that roll over to the following year. That is not well understood&mdash;meaning that I did not understand it until relatively recently when I went to see a PCT and was told that the problem was like a double ball and chain. The PCT was going to be &pound;20 million in deficit at the end of the financial year, and that money was going to be knocked off its income for the following year. Therefore, if it has a structural deficit of &pound;20 million and if it does exactly the same next year as it did this year, it will be &pound;20 million down next year. However, because its income has been cut by &pound;20 million to pay back last year's debt, it will be as though it is &pound;40 million down. How is it expected to recover from that? There needs to be a more measured transition to sorting out the underlying structural deficits and imbalances. However, the Government engage in constant revolution and helter-skelter reform. They do not give a chance to phased, managed transition, which has to be the best way of using taxpayers' money.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.2/6">My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives has done the House a great service in bringing the topic before us. I hope that the Minister will tell us that she is going to put in place structures that will allow local managers to manage and to plan, and not to be subject to constant meddling.</p>

	<p pid="a.395.0/1">This is the first time that I have heard the hon. Gentleman say that, but is not there an issue about GP lists being incomplete in urban areas? Is it not the case that the middle classes always register, but the urban poor do not? Might not funding be skewed away from those who are most in need?</p>

	<p pid="a.395.1/1">Of course. I do not pretend that that is the only measure, but it is clear that some aspects of morbidity in communities are not being captured by the demographic figures presented by the ONS. In so far as there are mismatches between GP practice lists and what ONS data tell us about the number of people and the nature of the population, that must, of course, be adjusted for. As we have discovered with local government and health financing, getting allocations right is never a simple matter, but it is perfectly clear that it is wrong at the moment and needs to be changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.1/2">The hon. Member for Northavon seems to be saying that the only way to deal with the current situation is to stop reform and hold everything up. In truth, there are two considerations. The first is that the Government have put a great deal of additional money into the NHS in the absence of reform, and are now in a hurry because they did not sort many of those things out earlier. The NHS plan in 2000 should have been just that, an NHS plan that began in 2000, but many of the changes, such as PBR, or payment by results, and the tariff, are being introduced in 2006 and 2007&mdash;that is how far behind the plan is.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.1/3">The second consideration is, frankly, incompetence. At the end of the last financial year, the Government did not know what the deficit was. Three months after the end of the financial year the Secretary of State was telling the House that it was a net &pound;140 million; it turned out to be &pound;250 million. As the hon. Member for Northavon said, that &pound;250 million disguised the fact that there were gross deficits of over &pound;600 million. In the debate that we had on the Floor of the House in November, we told the Government that it looked as though net deficits would be in the order of &pound;700 million and that gross deficits would be &pound;1 billion. The Secretary of State said, &quot;Oh, it will be fine. We are actually planning. All the recovery plans are in place and the net deficit this year will be lower than it was last year.&quot; However, we know from what the late, lamented Sir Nigel Crisp told the Health Committee a week or so later that a &pound;200 million net deficit was being targeted for this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.395.3/1">Sometimes, that is how the recovery plans are put together. In some instances, that is an acceptable way of dealing with things in a local health economy. What is unacceptable&mdash;I was going to come to this&mdash;is to go to the point at which the whole direction of reform in the NHS is being perverted. Taking one third of the addition to PCT allocations next year, which is what a 3 per cent. top-slicing on PCT allocations is, effectively says to PCTs across the country, &quot;You can't plan on the basis of the cash increases you were anticipating for next year. All the growth money that might have been available for you next year is going to be taken away from you.&quot; In effect, all the decisions about system improvement and growth in the NHS next year will be determined by strategic health authorities, and probably taken away in order to use deficits, so there will be no growth next year as a consequence.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.3/2">The incompetence has, I am afraid, extended to the tariff. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-22">22 February</phrase>, the Department of Health told PCTs and trusts across the country that there is a severe and deteriorating position, while also telling them that the underlying errors in the tariff mean that they have no basis on which to calculate their business plans for the forthcoming year. It is a sorry tale of incompetence on the part of the Government, for which Ministers are accountable. Lord Warner at least had the grace to say, in another place, last Thursday, that he was responsible, and to apologise unreservedly. I hope that the Minister will do the same today.</p>

	<p pid="a.396.0/3">In my firmly held view, having known the party for such a long time, hypocrisy on the subject abounds among the Liberal Democrats.

Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> discusses the central proposals of the break-up of the NHS and a move to a system of social insurance. There was not one word about any of that in today's important debate. It is interesting that all those who espoused and were involved in drawing up &quot;The Orange Book&quot; have been promoted.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.0/4">The hon. Member for Yeovil went on to argue for a switch from a monopoly NHS system to a national health insurance system, with the heath service remaining in place but as only one of the options available to all citizens. He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.396.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Additional charges could be paid by those people willing to pay for higher quality non-clinical services, such as private rooms. Such 'enhancement' charges would be set by each health insurance provider.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.400.1/1">It is a delight to serve under your informal, friendly chairmanship, Mr. Bayley. I am pleased to see the Minister here, and I applied for a 30-minute debate rather than a 90-minute one because I wanted her all to myself. That is not because I want to score political points, but because I want to help tackle the appallingly difficult subject of acute hospital reconfigurations. The debate gives us a splendid opportunity to reflect on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/2">Given NHS deficits, the European working time directive and ever-increasing demands for better and more expensive treatments, the NHS must make economies. On an entirely separate issue, I would love to have an open, wide-ranging debate about health care rationing. On this subject, however, there is pretty much agreement across the country that there will have to be further reconfigurations of acute hospital services. Given the changes in practice and the Government White Paper, many of those services are probably not affordable or necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February</phrase>, Nick Timmins, an excellent reporter with the <i>Financial Times</i>, wrote an article headed &quot;Financial mayhem exposes structural problems that beset the NHS&quot;. In it, he says that</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/4" class="indent">&quot;the changing nature of medicine means bigger reconfigurations are needed that will see more towns lose their accident and emergency departments and some other services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/5">NHS managers are crying out for the politics to be taken out of such decisions. Fairly recently, in the <i>Health Service Journal</i>, the Prime Minister was reported as saying that the Government would back managers over difficult decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/6">It might appear odd that someone who stood on the platform of saving a hospital should be speaking in that way, but I am uniquely qualified to tell the Minister, and thus the Secretary of State, exactly how not to carry out a reconfiguration exercise and how the Government have already put in place several mechanisms to take the politics out of the issue. If the Government used those mechanisms, they would have a good chance of success.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/7">As I am sure that the Minister is aware, the Kidderminster effect has been spoken of with bated breath in certain quarters since my election and it actually achieved the honour of a cartoon in this week's <i>Health Service Journal</i>. People now refer not to the Kidderminster effect, but to being Kidderminstered. The cartoon compared that to being Scunthorped, although I really cannot imagine what is happening in Scunthorpe. None the less, we have achieved cartoon status.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/8">I should make it clear that I am talking purely and simply about acute general hospitals, not community hospitals, which are entirely different. Community hospitals can be seen as absolutely in line with the White Paper and necessary for keeping work away from acute hospitals. With few exceptions, they deserve to be retained and used more and more.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/9">What, then, happened in Kidderminster and why was it a disaster? A drastic downgrading took away the accident and emergency department and all acute in-patient services. People could no longer go to the hospital with a heart attack, acute appendicitis or a broken leg. Everything that makes an acute hospital an acute hospital was taken away. It was a total robbery, which was carried out simply to benefit two other hospitals and two other communities. How was that possible?</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/10">The health authority at the time used the marvellous divide-and-rule tactic and gave the other communities benefits so that they would support the change. It gave the project the euphemistic title &quot;Investing in Excellence&quot;, and other reconfigurations have titles such as &quot;Making Things Better&quot;. Everybody can see through those titles and they know that the reconfigurations are probably not making things better for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/11">I wrote a saga on spin, although I shall not give hon. Members the whole thing. Here, however, are two examples. In Kidderminster, the health authority at the time said:</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Under the preferred proposal, a comprehensive hospital will remain (in Kidderminster), dealing with the majority of both elective and emergency services, for the people in its catchment area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/13">How could the hospital deal with the majority of elective and emergency services when it does not have an A and E or any acute beds? Then, there is a classic misuse of statistics:</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Out of 3.5 million contacts between Worcestershire patients and the NHS each year, less than 1 per cent. (around 12,000) would have to travel further in future for in-patient treatment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/15">Every one of the patients from the Kidderminster area had to travel further for in-patient treatment. We must avoid euphemistic titles and spin because people are sensible and can see through them&mdash;they are not fools.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/16">Responses to consultation must also be used sensibly. In the case of Kidderminster hospital, the responses from three community health councils, two county councils, four district councils and 11 parish and town councils were completely disregarded, as were innumerable responses from churches, medical groups and patient groups. To make matters worse, the outcome was decided on the basis of a weird pseudo-statistical option appraisal in which people had to give weightings and scores to the options. Twenty weighting sheets were sent out, but only 16 were returned, although that, at least, is understandable. However, 24 score sheets were also returned, even though there were only 21 scorers. One can therefore see why there was absolute resistance at the time to this total robbery, which was carried out with no fairness and as a result of a classic non-consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/17">What have the Government done since my election? Several things. First, health overview and scrutiny committees were established at county council level with the right to refer contested decisions to the Secretary of State for Health. With the demise of community health councils, primary care trust patient forums were given the right to refer issues to overview and scrutiny committees. In April 2002, a report in the <i>Health Service Journal</i>, headed &quot;Powers of observation&quot;, stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/18" class="indent">&quot;it is interesting to speculate whether some major NHS changes would have been handled differently if the new arrangements for local authority scrutiny had been in place. Would the reconfiguration of acute services in Worcestershire, or the strategic changes in Manchester, have gone ahead in the same way? Almost certainly, the NHS organisations involved would have been forced to tackle the process of consultation differently&mdash;and the resulting changes might well have been different, too.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/19">Overview and scrutiny committees are therefore incredibly valuable.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/20">Next, there is the independent reconfiguration panel, which was established in 2003 to advise the Secretary of State independently and with no political input about the merits of contested reconfiguration decisions. The panel contains clinicians, managers and members of the public and draws in other groups to review particular reconfiguration decisions. The advice will be made public; there for all to see and understand, so that there is no chance of political influence, spin or obfuscation. The organisation has tremendous potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/21">What has happened to the panel? We asked another Minister at a Health Committee meeting a few weeks ago. The answer was that eight cases had been referred by overview and scrutiny committees to the Secretary of State, and at that time only one of them had been passed on to the panel. One had been withdrawn, one awaited decision and five had been decided by the Secretary of State without reference to the advice of the panel. The situation was brought into sharp relief in a recent debate in the main Chamber, when a Labour Back Bench Member was very pleased that the Secretary of State had decided to site a new hospital in her constituency and an Opposition Member was livid that it had not been placed in his. The process had obviously led to political bias and a huge opportunity had been lost. The decision should have been made not by the Secretary of State but by the independent, non-political panel, which is sitting there waiting for referrals.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/22">I spoke to the independent reconfiguration panel's chief executive today, just to ensure that I was up to date. The panel has received two more referrals, so the total is now 10. To my amazement and pleasure, the one that was waiting to be decided or referred has been referred by the Secretary of State to the IRP with the extremely sensible suggestion that the panel get round the table with the overview and scrutiny committee and the health trusts involved and thrash out the way forward. I hope that that means that the Secretary of State has received the message that the IRP is there and that if it makes its decisions openly and independently, without political bias, MPs might argue, but they will not have a case to make because the decision will not ultimately be made by a political party in the interests of that political party.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/23">The annex to the letter that I received following the Health Committee meeting contained at least one inaccuracy&mdash;I shall come back to inaccuracies later. It said of one referral that the Secretary of State had decided to support the local NHS decision. In fact, exactly the opposite was true; she had decided to go against the local NHS recommendation in favour of the Labour-held constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/24">I have mentioned overview and scrutiny committees and the independent reconfiguration panel. In February 2003, the document &quot;Keeping the NHS local: a new direction of travel&quot; came out, and it was followed by a further paper in July 2004. Since the downgrading of Kidderminster, no hospital or community has been treated as unfairly, severely or badly, but several have been downgraded successfully. Consider Hexham, which has a tiny hospital, serving only 70,000 patients. That has been changed, but it has retained cover for medical emergencies, a lot of surgery and an urgent care centre. The hospital at Bishop Auckland is also smaller than Kidderminster was. It has lost emergency surgery but has retained medical admissions, elective surgery and an urgent care centre. Those changes have met with acceptance.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/25">A great deal of work has gone on in various organisations to work out how to maintain local access for straightforward emergencies. That is the critical thing that communities want. I draw the Minister's attention to the acute hospitals review in Northern Ireland, which took place as long ago as June 2001. For the first time, that split accident and emergency departments into three groups: the major, all-singing, all-dancing ones where patients could go with head and chest injuries, an intermediate group and a level three, which it envisaged would be</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/26" class="indent">&quot;a centre serving a smaller catchment population, operating in a managed clinical network with a level two service. The range of services available in each centre will vary according to local circumstances. They would have physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists available during the day and a full A&amp;E service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/27">That sort of compromise would be much more acceptable than losing an A and E and ending up with a minor injuries unit without a doctor on site.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/28">I shall conclude by listing the lessons that I should like the Minister to take on board. First, proper consultation means honesty, no euphemisms, no spin, no pseudo-statistics and, finally, a vote by local people. Obviously, one must comply with section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, and the mandatory referral to overview and scrutiny committees. As an aside, I am rather worried about the PCT merger consultations that are not going through section 11. They could be challenged.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/29">Secondly, there must be total accuracy. A rather distressing example of inaccuracy came to my attention last week. The Health Committee is undertaking an inquiry into independent sector treatment centres. A large submission was received from the Department of Health about the existing ones, so I looked up my own centre. The information is not right. It says that we have a local emergency centre. We have not; we have a minor injuries unit. It says that we have back-up in the form of telemedicine links between us and A and E departments. Those links were taken out some years ago, because nobody used them because there was nobody to answer them. It says that we have a midwifery-led maternity unit. That was closed in 2003. The bed numbers do not tally with my understanding. All those inaccuracies throw a dubious light on the entire submission. I do not know the details of other treatment centres so I cannot check whether they are correct, but it is crucial for a Minister to have the right information. If the Department were right that we in Kidderminster have a local emergency centre, what would we be making the fuss about? It is because we have not that we have made a fuss. The third lesson, which I shall not labour now, is that we should use the independent reconfiguration panel that was set up to do just what it says.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/30">The Kidderminster consultation failed and became political because it was a robbery and unfair. People saw through the spin and all the pain was borne by one community. Changes have to come in many parts of the country, including Yorkshire, the north-east, Shropshire and Gloucestershire. To succeed, they have to be seen to be fair, based on networking and sharing. The disadvantages have to be shared as well. We cannot send everybody from one area to another; people have to go both ways. Services must be built up in one place if they are removed from the other so that it can be seen that the disadvantages are being borne by both places. We all want all-singing, all-dancing acute hospitals, but we cannot have them; that is not possible. Therefore, there must be sharing and when decisions are contested, the IRP must be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/31">I shall leave the Minister with three proverbs, because fairness is a part of our way of life: from the 14th century, &quot;Fair and softly goes far in a day&quot;; one we all know from the 16th century, &quot;A fair exchange is no robbery&quot;; and from the 19th century, &quot;Fair play is a jewel.&quot; The independent reconfiguration panel could be a referee and take things out of the political equation to see fair play for all concerned.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-14a.404.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" speakername="Jane Kennedy" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="404"  time="012:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060314/halltext/60314h02.htm#60314h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.404.0/1">It is a pleasure to be here this afternoon with you in the Chair, Mr. Bayley.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> on securing the debate on NHS reconfiguration, and thank him for his contribution to the recent Select Committee on Health report on changes to primary care trusts. The report has provided a helpful contribution to the debate. We carefully considered the Committee's recommendations, and published our response last week. He argued cogently, and I do not disagree with a lot of what he said; in fact, I strongly agree with much of it. There are some suggestions to take on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/3">It is fair to say that all the changes being made in the national health service are designed to achieve even better NHS services for patients. That is the goal, and the test, of everything that we do, including our asking the health service to engage in increasing financial transparency, which is causing the current high level of public debate about the future of health services. PCTs need to become the focal point for planning, designing and shaping local health services, but in a way that best meets the needs of local communities and delivers value for money from allocated resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/4">The hon. Gentleman rightly says that there is agreement across England that there will have to be reconfiguration of acute hospital services. Waiting lists are at their lowest level for generations. Under previous Governments, patients were corralled into waiting lists. Patients were managed to suit the chronic shortage of available resources, or, in some circumstances, the way in which the health service was configured in any locality. The Government have addressed that problem by providing extra resources and better pay to health service staff, which has encouraged more flexibility in the way in which services are delivered. The consequence of that is that the backlog of people waiting for urgent, acute in-patient treatment is clearing.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/5">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we must ask our acute hospitals what their future role should be. We are providing more support for people with long-term conditions and are managing their conditions differently. Even cancer is becoming considered more as a long-term condition and less as the absolutely appalling critical and acute illness that it used to be seen as. Therefore, it is managed differently. The improvement of screening services and the better monitoring of people's general health mean that we can intervene at an earlier stage to prevent people from getting to the stage of having the acute health needs that require the acute response that we have traditionally built into the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/6">The management of a range of acute conditions has changed. The provision of cardiology services is an example of that. A strong debate is going on in the west of Cheshire, where Halton hospital is facing its services being moved to Warrington hospital. The strong local debate there has been couched very much in the terms described by the hon. Gentleman when he talked about the strong attachment that local communities have to their local hospitals, their fears about services being changed and their need to be reassured that changes are being made for the sake of providing better services that are clinically safer and that will provide better outcomes for patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/7">Cardiology is one area in which treatment is being transformed by advancements and innovations. It is being delivered by the better management of people with heart conditions, so that open-heart surgery is performed much less often than it was. Management of patients is organised differently. Indeed, the kind of patient is changing, so the pressures faced by acute services is also changing.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/8">The hon. Gentleman invites us to take politics out of service configuration. Would that it were possible. He rightly advocates the structures that we have put in place to do that. He uses the example of Wyre Forest and his constituents' experiences, and describes the consultation as being not the best-handled consultation ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/9">The hon. Gentleman may not know that I cut my parliamentary political teeth in Liverpool, Broadgreen, where the then Government, or the then local NHS, sought to close the accident and emergency unit in the local district general hospital that served the constituency that I sought to represent. The then Liberal Democrat candidate&mdash;she is now a Lab<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" name="Rosie Cooper">our Member, my hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper)</phrase>&mdash;and I fought a vigorous local campaign against each other to see who could save the hospital the quickest. The problem in that case was that, although there were anxieties about the A and E, I believed that a coherent argument was being presented that the A and E services there were clinically less sound than the services that would be provided in the proposed bigger A and E department, which would be only three or four miles away, and which would have 24-hour consultant provision. That campaign was in the context of wholesale hospital closures across Merseyside, and local communities genuinely feared that they would lose the whole hospital, not just the A and E.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/10">I know only too well how deeply attached people are to their hospitals. If people were to visit my constituency today and see the hospital that has been retained on the site, they would see a unit that provides some of the best cardiology services in the north-west of England through the cardiothoracic centre. Other services on that site are continually being developed and invested in, and local people can have confidence that those developments are genuinely being made in the interests of better local services.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/11">The hon. Gentleman strongly recommends that we support the oversight and scrutiny process, which we do. As he rightly says, the consultations must be genuine and open, and command ongoing public support. He expressed his concern that the consultation on the primary care trust and strategic health authority configuration is not a section 11 consultation. He is right that, because reconfiguration proposals amount to managerial and administrative change only, there is no duty to consult under section 11. However, it is a full public consultation involving a wide variety of local stakeholders, including patient and public representative bodies. I know that in his area, the west midlands, the SHA has gone beyond the regulations to consult with a wider variety of people, including local MPs, professional executive committee chairs, the police and fire services and the general public.</p>
	<p pid="a.404.0/12">We have made it clear in guidance and correspondence to all SHAs that the consultation must be conducted fairly and properly. I came to the debate prepared for discussion about the &quot;Commissioning a patient-led NHS&quot; consultation. I have given an open and honest response, taking on board the hon. Gentleman's helpful contribution. I know that I can look to him for support and encouragement as I take forward some of these difficult configuration issues and as we develop the health service further, always to the benefit of our patients.</p>

	<p pid="a.409.0/1">There was a Land Rover parked near the lure. What explanation did the owner of the Land Rover give for the lure being there?</p>
	<p pid="a.409.0/2">I also want to tell the hon. Lady that gamekeepers often shoot pigeons on moors. Pigeons compete for the foodstuffs and berries that the grouse live on. It could be perfectly sensible game management to lure and shoot pigeons, which is a perfectly legal activity.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-14a.409.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1814" speakername="Angela Smith" colnum="409"  time="012:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060314/halltext/60314h02.htm#60314h02_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.409.1/1">The Land Rover and the people in question had gone by the time that the RSPB had been called to the site. Bilberries, which are the berries that I believe the hon. Gentleman refers to, are often garnered and gathered by the people of Bolsterstone and Midhope before any game birds get to them. Many a breakfast table in the Bolsterstone area is graced with a jar of jam very soon after the bilberries have ripened. I find it hard to believe that bilberries are in need of protection with pigeon lures.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/2">At the end of 2002, a member of the public watched two men dressed in camouflage gear and carrying shotguns emerge from a wood known to be a goshawk roost site. They had been playing a tape of goshawk calls. There is an ongoing problem with the deliberate and illegal targeting of birds of prey. I am sure that all responsible landowners would deplore that. The problem is magnified by the fact that there are also many examples of goshawk and peregrine nests having inexplicably failed.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/3">In the 1990s, there was a well-established nesting population of seven to 11 pairs of goshawks in the north-east Peak, but the species was lost as a breeding bird from the woodlands in that area by 2002. It is important to point out that the area is a wonderful mix of woodland and moor, and that goshawks find such areas attractive for breeding. In the 1970s and 1980s, the moors and woodlands between Sheffield and Holmfirth were well known as the place to see goshawks, but no young have been raised on the north-east moors since 2000, when just one chick was reared from four occupied territories. The suitability of nest sites and the food supply for this bird has not changed. Red grouse and songbirds are on the increase. Therefore, why has the goshawk disappeared from the north-east moors of the Dark Peak?</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/4">There has been a similar decline in peregrine falcons. There were three pairs on the north-east moors as recently as 1996, but they have not even appeared at breeding sites since 2000. There is no indication that there is less food or that fewer nest sites are available, which might prevent the peregrine from being more successful. I am familiar with one of the nesting sites, a remote crag that is not particularly popular with the hordes of weekend walkers who tend to stick to the grander landscapes of the Hope and Edale valleys. I know that nothing has changed in relation to that nesting site; it is still there, as forbidding and secretive as it ever was, a vegetated cliff edge located amidst a plentiful food supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/5">These declines are of great concern. They have happened despite the high degree of protection enjoyed by the north-east Peak. The moors are a special protection area, a special area of conservation and a site of special scientific interest. Although it is important to stress that the RSPB report does not lay the blame for the declines in these birds at the door of any individual, it is true that there are numerous examples of deliberate destruction of birds of prey on grouse-shooting estates throughout Scotland and England. I hope that the Minister agrees that it is up to the landowners in the Dark Peak to work with the statutory nature conservation organisations and enforcement authorities to ensure that the area does not become a no-go zone for protected wildlife.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/6">Government action is needed too. The Government's record so far is not to be dismissed. They introduced the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, and the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill is currently going through Parliament. My constituents have embraced the right to roam; they now enjoy access to the moors of the north-east Peak for the first time, and they celebrate that. The NERC Bill includes some important new measures to protect vulnerable wildlife, such as further restrictions on the possession of pesticides that are harmful to wildlife and further protection of nests of certain birds which re-use those nests. However, given the ongoing concerns about the illegal use of pesticides to poison protected wildlife, the Government should make sure that the list of proscribed pesticides under the NERC Bill is as long as possible. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/7">The Government should also consult as soon as possible on adding species to the list of those whose nests will be given year-round protection. &quot;Peak Malpractice&quot; highlights the problem of the nests of peregrines and ravens being disturbed or destroyed. They are species that re-use their nests, and they could benefit from being added to the list. In answer to a parliamentary written question of mine, the Minister denied that there was a need to list those birds for year-round nest protection, but the events taking place in the north-east Peak suggest that there is a need to take proactive action to prevent decline elsewhere, and to help in the process of re-establishing healthy populations of these raptors in the areas under discussion in our debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/8">The Government's announcement two weeks ago of &pound;250,000 of funding for a national wildlife crime unit is welcome. That unit will have a key role to play in ensuring that the police are given support and advice when they investigate wildlife crime. However, it is vital that other Departments, including the Home Office and the Treasury, recognise the key part that they have to play, both in supporting long-term funding, and in giving a steer that wildlife crime must be a key priority for the enforcement agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.1/9">I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments and hope to receive a positive response for the sake of wildlife, of the north-east Peak, and of all the individuals and communities inhabiting the area; I speak as one such individual. We cannot afford to lose permanently the raptor populations that traditionally have helped characterise the Dark Peak. I ask the Minister to recognise that the Dark Peak environment is losing one of its richest and most thrilling ingredients&mdash;the sight of a goshawk exhibiting its sky-dance display.</p>

	<p pid="a.411.6/1">I rise to support <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1814" name="Angela Smith">my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith)</phrase> in what she is calling for. My constituency also covers the Dark Peak and shares similar characteristics to those that my hon. Friend has described. Indeed, the north-east moors, which are the subject of her debate, are immediately adjacent to the High Peak boundary, and it is therefore possible to compare the wildlife characteristics of the two areas. On reading the report of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, I was delighted to discover that the problem that has been mentioned does not exist within the area of High Peak that is immediately adjacent to the north-east moors. The problem is confined to a relatively small area of my hon. Friend's constituency, where there is a track record of disturbance of birds of prey.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.6/2">Last weekend, in preparation for this debate, I had a conversation with a Peak district farmer in my constituency whose area shares the Dark Peak characteristics and on whose farm grouse shooting regularly takes place. He was very proud that there were birds of prey on his farm and enhancing his environment, and he believed that it was perfectly possible for grouse-shooting interests and birds of prey to exist side by side. That makes it all the more odd that these things appear to be happening just outside High Peak, on land with similar characteristics.</p>

	<p pid="a.414.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a useful point. Certainly, we are not complacent about the possible activity of those few individuals and its effect on important species.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/2">For many years now, all wild birds have been afforded strict protection under UK legislation. That protection refers to illegal activities such as killing or poisoning. Section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 gives wild birds protection from being killed, injured or taken, and their nests and eggs are protected from being taken, damaged or destroyed.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/3">As my hon. Friend pointed out, through the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill we seek to enhance protection of our native wildlife and to address some of the issues that the RSPB has rightly raised. Two clauses in that Bill introduce greater protection for birds of prey. They provide for the protection, at any time of year, of the nests of certain birds that reuse their nests, and deal with the possession of pesticides that are harmful to wildlife. The clause on protection of nests will make it an offence, at any time of year, to take, damage or destroy the nest of a wild bird species included in a new schedule. The new schedule covers golden eagles, white-tailed eagles and osprey, all of which are subject to reintroduction or re-establishment programmes. The provision is aimed at supporting their long-term breeding success by protecting their nests all year round.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/4">A number of amendments were tabled during the Commons and Lords stages of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill. My hon. Friend referred to her written question, in which she suggested that we extend the list of species in the schedule. We have decided to focus on the most endangered species&mdash;those whose populations would be severely threatened by the loss of just one nest&mdash;and differentiate between a single nest and nesting sites. Peregrine falcons and barn owls do not build nests, but instead use ledges; they will use man-made structures if they are available. If Natural England is of the opinion that an area is important for other rare birds of special interest, it can designate the area a site of special scientific interest, thereby bringing legislative protection to the area. My hon. Friend may want to dwell on that. Obviously, if she wants to correspond with me further, I would welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/5">The clause on the possession of pesticides that are harmful to wildlife will enable the Secretary of State to list those ingredients of pesticides that she believes could cause harm to wild birds and/or animals. The clause will make it an offence to possess a pesticide containing a proscribed ingredient, unless it can be shown that possession was for lawful use in accordance with relevant pesticide, biocide or poisons legislation. My hon. Friend suggested that I might want to ensure that there is a long list of pesticides when we introduce the relevant regulations. She will be aware, as an assiduous member of the Standing Committee considering the Bill, that no pesticides will be banned by the Bill itself, although it will provide the Secretary of State with the power to make an order on which the proscribed pesticide ingredients are listed. A full consultation will be carried out before any ingredient is listed on the order, and as yet we have not put that list together. However, I will bear in mind my hon. Friend's comments when I see the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/6">The Government are taking a number of positive steps in the Peak district, in partnership with a range of organisations, to enhance the wildlife of the area. Those steps include the &quot;Moors for the Future&quot; project, an ambitious project tackling the restoration of significant areas of upland habitat across the Peak district. There are many other projects, including the biodiversity action plan and the Peak district vision project. There is also the important work by various agencies on the Dark Peak site of special scientific interest. Major surveys were made of the Peak district's moorlands in 1990 and 2004. We note carefully the changes that we find through such surveys.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/7">Finally, I shall just touch on the extra commitment that we have made to tackling wildlife crime through investment in the wildlife crime unit, which my hon. Friend mentioned. I announced that investment last month. I have had positive discussions with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on the importance of that unit, and assure my hon. Friend that the Home Secretary is keen to ensure that the unit prospers.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/8">In conclusion, I hope that hon. Members will agree that the picture is not always as gloomy as is sometimes suggested; however, we should not rest on our laurels or be complacent about our wild birds and issues affecting them. Instead, we should build on the introduction of the new offences in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill and the setting up of the reinforced wildlife crime unit by continuing to work proactively to protect our precious biodiversity, which is such an attractive feature of one of the most precious areas of English landscape, the Peak district.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-14a.418.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" speakername="Andrew Selous" colnum="418"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060314/halltext/60314h03.htm#60314h03_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.418.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend because I do not for a moment believe that what has happened in my constituency is an isolated case. I am explaining some of the public spending in my constituency, but if what has happened there is reflected around the country to the extent that my hon. Friend says it is reflected in his constituency, the sums become very serious, and that really worries me. The important issue is that roads that desperately need to be built are not being built because money is being wasted and not being properly supervised.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.1/2">Another massive concern for my constituents is the fact that we are looking at a six-year delay in the building of the Dunstable northern bypass, announced in the Commons in 2003 by the Minister's boss, the Secretary of State for Transport. He said that the bypass would be open to traffic in 2010&ndash;11, and that is the time plan to which the Highways Agency is working. However, we know from the regional planning panel of the East of England regional assembly that there will not be the money to build the road until 2015&ndash;16.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.1/3">That worries my constituents hugely because an additional 43,000 houses are due to be built in my constituency. I hope that no one loses sight of the fact that the Dunstable northern bypass is being built to remedy an infrastructure deficit. We have been waiting for it for 80 years, but it is to deal with problems as they are now. The prospect of another 43,000 houses without that road is too bleak for any of my constituents to contemplate.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.1/4">What really concerns me is a matter that came to my attention just a few weeks ago. As I understand the situation, the plans to widen the M1 will be carried out without putting in the necessary connecting junction for the Dunstable northern bypass. I understand that that will mean the loss of a &pound;10 million saving; the cost of the bypass will therefore be &pound;10 million more. Currently, the bypass is scheduled to cost &pound;77 million. It is not a cheap scheme, and my worry is that that extra cost&mdash;or the lack of the saving&mdash;could delay it still further.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.1/5">It seems that there is no joined-up thinking on this issue. What is the point of widening the M1 if that bypass junction, which we accept cannot be built immediately, is not put in? I hope that I have been misinformed and that no final decisions have been made. However, to waste &pound;10 million, or to cause an extra &pound;10 million to be spent to build a road that is going to be built anyway, would be extraordinary and cause me further worries about the operation of the Highways Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.1/6">When I was preparing for this debate yesterday evening, I was contacted unexpectedly by the North East chamber of commerce, which expressed great concern about how the Highways Agency is imposing section 14 notices. There is a lack of co-ordination between the Department for Transport and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Section 14 notices allow the Highways Agency to ban development if it thinks that the roads would not be able to cope. That is sensible; none of us wants to see roads built that are so congested that they cannot cope. However, if the ODPM is planning for major jobs growth and housing expansion and the Highways Agency at the Department for Transport is working against that, that is a concern and needs to be looked at. There are strong similarities in my own area in Bedfordshire, where a large amount of housing is planned but the roads issues are unresolved.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-14a.419.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for Transport"  colnum="419"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060314/halltext/60314h03.htm#60314h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.419.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bayley. This has been my first opportunity to do so since you joined the Chairmen's Panel.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> on securing this debate. I shall deal with the issues in respect of Dunstable last, after I have cleared away the others.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.2/3">Article 14 notices are the Highways Agency's mechanism for gathering the information that it needs from people applying for planning permission for development. When somebody applies for planning permission, the notices are effectively the agency's only tool for saying, &quot;We have some highways concerns and we expect them to be addressed&quot;. Such concerns are addressed usually by providing information, but sometimes by providing the resources to carry out a piece of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.2/4">The article 14 notice is the Highways Agency's legal mechanism for saying, &quot;We do not have all the information we need&quot;, or, &quot;We are not happy with this planning proposal&quot;. There is nothing underhand about such notices; they are given very publicly. In the north-east of England, there has been a great deal of fuss about them, and it has been almost entirely unfair as far as the Highways Agency is concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.2/5">The developments that we are talking about are very large and would impinge greatly on the trunk road network. Before it gives the go-ahead, the Highways Agency has an absolute duty to make the developers work to provide information about what the impact of their development would be on the trunk road. In almost every case, the developer does the work after the article 14 notices have been placed. One could argue that it ought to have done that before making its planning application, but sometimes developers do not because they hope to save a bit of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.2/6">The developers do the work and the article 14 notice is lifted. Sometimes what is required is not information, but a green travel plan that needs to be put in to minimise the impact on the trunk road network; sometimes the notice is served to stump up money for a junction improvement. However, article 14 notices are almost always lifted.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.2/7">I hope that that puts the issue of article 14 notices into perspective. Such a notice may well have been used in respect of the roundabout mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase>, although I am not certain about that. If he wants to give me further details about that particular scheme, I shall be happy to look into it for him.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.2/8">Likewise, I suspect that there has been some misunderstanding on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the part of the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> about how the article 14 notice was used on the occasion that he mentioned. A major housing development will always have an impact on the trunk road network and some work will always have to be done to understand that impact and come up with a strategy for dealing with it. I have no doubt that the article 14 notice there will be lifted when everybody understands what issues have to be addressed. However, if the hon. Gentleman wants to write to me on the matter, I shall be happy to look into it.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.2/9">I turn to the issue of the A5 and M1. The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire is right to say that we asked the regions for advice about their spending priorities. We do not have enough money to implement all the transport schemes that people want undertaken all at once. Usually, Ministers have to prioritise them; sitting in London, we are not very good at making priorities for regions that are many miles from our constituencies, so we have asked the regions to give us that advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.2/10">I shall not comment on the advice that we have received in respect of the A5 and M1, because we shall make the relevant announcements shortly. However, if the road scheme that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about has been put back in the priorities, as he suggested, and if, as a result of that, we were to lose synergy with a parallel project on, for example, the M1, I would have to take that into consideration when I decide on the priorities. The advice is from the regions, but Ministers make the decisions. The Secretary of State and I will make the decision, and, if we find that there would be a major cost disbenefit in delaying the project, we would have to think about bringing it forward. We may decide that we have to delay it, but we would look for other ways to deal with the cost implications.</p>

	<p pid="a.422.1/1">Various processes of consultation take place. To some extent, they are determined by the size and location of the scheme. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of nationally important, high-profile schemes. For example, we are doing early work to decide on new capacity for the M6 between the midlands and the north-west. We will engage in high-profile consultations with stakeholders from an early stage in the process to try to come up with design strategies that people will support. Another scheme that he will be aware of is the current consultation, which has probably been going on even longer than the one for Dunstable, to find a solution to the issues around Stonehenge. That is one level of consultation to try to find a solution. It begins at an early stage, even before design work has been done.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/2">With local schemes, there is active effort to engage local councils, local business representatives and Members of Parliament. I insist that the Highways Agency keep MPs informed so that they can provide feedback. Regional development agencies and the regional assemblies are also important stakeholders in such issues. There is a wide-ranging attempt to try to agree objectives, to come up with designs that meet those objectives and then to share the designs with the local community before the agency gets to the firm planning and public inquiry stages. Of course, all those things increase the time that it takes to develop schemes. I often find myself facing criticism from Members that the process is taking too long, not that the consultation has not been thorough enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/3">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with the assurance that we are trying to develop better ways of consulting local communities, and the admission that the agency got it wrong on this occasion and will do better next time.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/4" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/5" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Two o'clock.</p>
