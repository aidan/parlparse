<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-25a.69.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" speakername="Hugh Bayley" colnum="69"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090225/halltext/90225h0001.htm#09022570000482">
	<p pid="a.69.2/1">Let me begin by thanking Mr. Speaker for granting this important debate. Three weeks ago, in business questions, I called for an advertising campaign to promote inbound tourism to the UK and take advantage of the fall in the pound's value against other currencies. I called for the launch of an advertising campaign in the eurozone and the United States along the lines, &quot;Come to Britain for your holidays at 30 per cent. off last year's price.&quot; The Leader of the House encouraged me to apply for a Westminster Hall debate, which I did, and Mr. Speaker granted it immediately&mdash;a good thing too.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">We need to debate this issue now because the recession that we are going through will be severe, but if we market the UK's tourist attractions intelligently, tourism could do a lot to reduce its impact. In times of economic downturn, most people become nervous about their job or concerned about the future of their business, but the vast majority do not lose their job or business, and they still go on holiday. A recent VisitBritain survey on the attitudes of the British public on taking holidays in the current economic conditions has found that the majority see a holiday as a necessity, not a luxury. With the exchange rate being what it is, there are opportunities to attract more tourism from people in other countries&mdash;I hope that that will be the primary focus of the debate. Changes in the exchange rate have made Britain much cheaper to visit now than it has been in recent years. Similarly, there are also opportunities to persuade more British people to holiday in this country, because holidays in Europe will cost some 30 per cent. more this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3">The recession is not a home-grown one, like those in the '70s, '80s and 90s, which were linked to runaway inflation or the lack of competitiveness of British businesses, particularly old-style industry. This is a truly global recession that affects people in all countries, certainly in the developed world. I spent last week, during the parliamentary recess, attending meetings of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly's economics and security committee, which I chair, so I know that the problems that we face in the UK, and the sort of policy responses that we are developing, are mirrored in north America&mdash;in the United States and Canada&mdash;and in Europe. Our colleagues in those countries are doing similar things to us, and we all face similar problems. In a downturn, most people, even those who keep their jobs and whose income does not fall, look for ways of economising. That creates opportunities to promote the UK as a tourist destination for people in Europe and north America.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/4">I shall go on to talk about international marketing, but first I should like to talk about my own city, because tourism is about the local tourist experience. When people remember a good holiday or day out, they think about having attended a football match or a brilliant concert, having gone to a memorable museum, or having visited a fantastic market, book fair or shopping centre. They think about a great pub or restaurant, or a particularly good hotel. Those are the things that people remember. The tourist experience takes place on the streets of my city and in the cities, towns, villages and areas of the countryside represented by other hon. Members.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-25a.71.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" speakername="Hugh Bayley" colnum="71"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090225/halltext/90225h0001.htm#09022570000488">
	<p pid="a.71.0/1">I should like to underline the importance of continuing investment and of having a high-quality product, because the most important marketing opportunity for tourism business is word of mouth. If people have good experiences, they will come back, and they will tell their friends about it. Some 80 per cent. of visitors to the City of York are return visitors. People do not return to places if they have had a poor time there or if they suspect that they would have had a better time elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/2">York is a special city, and is one of the great global must-visit destinations. We get 4 million visitors a year, 600,000 of whom come from abroad. Those visitors spend &pound;360 million in the local economy, which is an increase in real terms of 77 per cent. since 1993. Tourism supports more than 10,000 jobs in York and, since 1993, there has been a growth of 27 per cent in that figure. Our top inbound markets are the United States of America and Germany, as well as the Netherlands and Belgium, because in North and East Yorkshire we are particularly well served by direct ferries from the low countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/3">It is no coincidence that European countries with low-cost airline flights connecting them to the UK are places in which we market UK tourism; indeed, we need to market breaks in the UK in every region in Europe that is connected to the UK by low-cost airlines. For a long time, we have considered low-cost airlines to be a way in which British people can get a cheap break abroad, but aircraft can, of course, take people in two directions. We need to concentrate on marketing in the cities and regions served by those airlines, and doing so is particularly important to tourism in the regions because, although our scheduled airlines predominantly land in London, low-cost airlines serve regional airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/4">Twenty years ago, tourism was not always universally popular in York. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase> will know that people sent letters to the local paper in which they would moan that although the state of the streets was wonderful in the city centre and the tourist areas around High Petergate, the Shambles and the Minster, it was dreadful in residential areas. There is much less of that sort of criticism now and there is a better understanding that tourism brings jobs to York and boosts the local economy. Investment in tourism has made it more upmarket and wages have risen, in part because of the minimum wage, but also because of the commitment of employers in tourism to retaining staff whom they have trained.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/5">Tourism is important to York not just because it brings in visitors who bring in the money that creates jobs, but because it improves the amenities that are available to local people. We in York now have better restaurants and pubs than 20 years ago. We have two theatres rather than one, two new cinemas, and more and better shops. Those improvements have been made possible in part because of the number of visitors to the city of York, but they also provide benefits to local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/6">Tourism brings investment. I had a debate in Westminster Hall not long ago in which I sought to persuade the Minister's predecessor, the Minister of State, Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1882" name="David Lammy">the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy)</phrase>, that we ought to receive some lottery funding to help with the cost of renovating York Minster's great east window, which is a fabulous mediaeval work of stained glass. It is the biggest mediaeval stained glass window in the world and cost &pound;52 to make 500 years ago&mdash;it was going to cost &pound;42, but the craftsman completed the contract within budget and on time and got a &pound;10 bonus. It will cost &pound;30 million to restore, and I am pleased that the lottery provided a &pound;12 million grant, which is one of the biggest grants that it has given in Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/7">That &pound;30 million creates local jobs for stone masons, glaziers, building contractors and scaffolders. Whenever money is invested in the tourist economy, jobs are created not only in the tourism sector, but in the local economy as a whole. Every meeting at York race course brings thousands of visitors to York. When Ascot race course was being redeveloped, York won the competition to host Royal Ascot and that earned an extra &pound;29 million for the region from visitors who came to that event.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/8">When the Minister is listening, I would like to put on the record my thanks to Yorkshire Forward and to the Government, who fund that organisation, for giving the promotion of tourism a particularly high priority. Yorkshire Forward recently decided to invest &pound;30 million in the sector, which it has calculated will generate an additional &pound;300 million increase in visitor spend in the region. My own city of York has benefited directly over the past six years from a number of tourism-related investments made by Yorkshire Forward. The tourism investment fund has paid for lighting schemes in York, interpretation of the bar walls&mdash;the city walls&mdash;and Patrice Warrener's lighting of York Minster. Yorkshire Forward has also paid for the new visitor information centre at York station and is contributing to the cost of the new visitor information centre in Museum street in the city centre, which will open later this year. The support of Yorkshire Forward helped York to win the title of European tourism city of the year in 2007, and, of course, that organisation has supported tourism in other cities and parts of the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/9">It is important to recognise that, as a tourism destination, Yorkshire as a whole is more important than the sum of its parts. York is a great city&mdash;and a great city to visit&mdash;but it is also a great base for visiting the north York moors, the Yorkshire coast, the dales or, for example, Pickering, which is represented by the hon. Member for Ryedale.</p>

	<p pid="a.74.3/1">Let us be positive and work together on this. Given current economic conditions, it is time to look at the regulatory regime surrounding the pub trade. That is important, and if we do not do it, we will continue to lose pubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.3/2">This will be my final point to the Minister, because I know that other hon. Members want to contribute. I understand that she has to fight a battle with the Treasury to gain money for the tourist authorities in the UK, whether national, English, regional or local and that there are always competing demands for cash. I put this on the record, because I do mean it when I say that I thank the Government. Because of their stewardship, regional development agencies and the policy framework under which they operate were established. The RDAs consider tourism to be an important part of the local economy and are investing more in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.3/3">Because of the change in exchange rates we will have a window of opportunity over the next year to attract more people to the UK and, hopefully, to establish long-term patterns of more people from other countries visiting the UK, and we will miss that opportunity unless Visit England and, in particular, Visit Britain, with its external marketing responsibility, have the resources to exploit it. I hope that the Minister will take a message from me and the others who contribute to this debate to the Treasury, so that when it considers measures to stimulate the economy in difficult circumstances, it will see tourism as a sector that ought to be stimulated.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-25a.76.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="76"  time="009:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090225/halltext/90225h0002.htm#09022570000497">
	<p pid="a.76.1/1">I know London very well and love it very much, and not for nothing is the main road into Down called Single street. It is a rather small street, so I hope that not too many tourists will take their cars into Down from Orpington, otherwise there will be problems afoot, I suspect.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/2">Amid all that, there is little doubt that 2009 will be a relatively tough year, so I am keen to know what the Minister will say about the contributions that she will hear from Members representing various parts of the UK. For a start, it is likely that corporate entertainment and international business travel will be pared back. There is an especial concern also about the capital's exposure to the US market, which remains far and away the UK's biggest source of visitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/3">Visits from north America in 2008 were down 13 per cent. compared with 2007, and a sharp downturn in the US economy, rising unemployment there and the lowest recorded levels of US consumer confidence are likely, I fear, to ensure that the number of visits continues to fall. There is also concern about the exchange rate. There has been a depreciation during the past year, but the situation may change through 2009, and there could be a large reduction not just in visitor numbers, but in absolute spend.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/4">The Minister will appreciate, and Members from all parts of the House will know, that we live in volatile times, so it is hard to tell whether more domestic visitors will in the coming months spend time in London and the UK, rather than going abroad. Preliminary research indicates that most UK residents regard their main summer holiday&mdash;normally abroad&mdash;as sacrosanct, in which case domestic visitors may choose to drop their breaks in London or, indeed, other parts of the UK to preserve what they regard as their main holiday.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/5">Visit London&mdash;the official visitor organisation for the capital, and part-funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Mayor of London, the London Development Agency and London's councils&mdash;has been undertaking some quite aggressive marketing campaigns to promote the capital internationally. In December, a four-month drive was launched to stimulate visits to London. At a cost of &pound;3.25 million, the campaign is expected to deliver &pound;70 million in economic benefit to the capital. Money assigned to promoting tourism traditionally provides good value, and tourism is one of the industries in which a relatively modest investment can provide solid economic returns in a short period. As part of the Mayor's recovery plan, alongside that of central Government, Visit London has tried to capitalise on the opportunity of the favourable exchange rate as a valuable promotional tool, and, if there is any new Government funding, it should be concentrated on responsive campaigns. I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/6">In the longer term, Visit London looks towards the London Olympics, which are now only three and a half years away, of the summer of 2012. Surprisingly, when one considers that the Government sold the games to the public as a way to draw money into the capital from international visitors, there seem to be no specific plans to provide funds to help to realise the tourism benefits of the games. It is estimated that such benefits could be worth &pound;2 billion, with the games representing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to market and promote London and the UK to emerging markets, such as China and India.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/7">There is also great enthusiasm among those in the tourism sector for a re-examination of immigration arrangements. There have been recent increases in visa fees, and some visitors are aggravated by having to purchase a separate visa to the Schengen area. Visit London also believes that a capital investment in an international convention centre, which has been in the offing for many years, would create jobs and benefit London's economy in the long term, particularly as the organisation believes that, on tourism, one of London's saving graces could be its hosting of many conferences, fixed-term annual congresses and sporting events.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/8">In an economic climate that is undoubtedly worsening rapidly, it is essential that we continue robustly to promote our capital city. London drives the UK's visitor economy to a large extent, and, where it succeeds in attracting visitors, the rest of the country will, I hope, benefit. But, while the picture is mixed in the capital, with some areas of the industry upbeat about their prospects, there is no room for complacency. In this sector, over many others, a little investment can go a long way, and we should play on London's myriad advantages as a fantastic, diverse and exciting city to keep it as the jewel in the crown of a thriving British tourism industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" name="Hugh Bayley">the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> on having prompted this important debate. My remarks will be slightly polemical and may contrast sharply with those of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase>, although I agree with both hon. Members that inbound tourism is essentially a good thing. The balance of payments is helped enormously. It is one of the few real exports that we have left and it is helped by the falling pound. However, I want to make a general point about the marketing of UK plc. Many of the brochures and films that I have seen, especially abroad, have overwhelmingly been London-centric. &quot;Come to the UK&quot; has been synonymous with &quot;Come to London&quot;, with Edinburgh thrown in because they have quaint Scottish ways up there, along with Stratford-upon-Avon, because everybody abroad knows about Shakespeare, so it is thought important to include that town, too. Much of the rest of the country, however, misses out on any international promotion.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/2">The pressure, which has been evident today, is to get people to visit London. Most of the resources go to marketing the London offering, and the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster laid out very well how successful it has been. The evidence is there: people tend to visit London in very large volumes. London is a fantastic place, however; I am not saying that it is not. It has history galore and architecture&mdash;a fantastic number of great buildings, so many that, in some cases, they do not have even have names. It also has royalty, entertainment, the west end, culture, museums, galleries and sport. It has famous football teams such as Chelsea, Arsenal and Leyton Orient, although I must note that they have not yet achieved the same level of international success as certain teams in the north-west have. London also has a superb transport system and access, so I do not deny that London is a world-class destination, because it is. However, it is not the UK, just as Madrid is not Spain, Paris is not France and New York is not the USA. The UK has other gems, but they are undersold.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/3">I accept that other cities do not compare with London's scale, resource and range of attractions. Manchester, Liverpool and York all have very good points, but, criterion by criterion, they are not in the same league as London. But, the UK is not all about cities. For example, it has a fantastic coast, which was brilliantly depicted in a recent BBC series&mdash;such a good series that it is doing a second series. I must say, however, that the BBC's metropolitan elite needed some persuading to embark on the first series, because they did not think that it would achieve the success that it has. It also has a varied countryside. It is not often recognised that the one thing people notice when they come to this country, particularly if they come from the Mediterranean area, is how green and pleasant it is and how varied it is. But that is not given much coverage in the brochures advertising this country. The UK also has cheaper places to stay than London. We have to take on board that not every person thinking of tourism in the UK can afford London prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/4">There is an imbalance in the promotion of inbound tourism in this country. Let me tell a little anecdote as an example. My constituency is a fine Victorian resort, as I think hon. Members would agree, with better golf courses than London, healthier air and less snow. It is also the recipient of much recent investment and it has an exceptional coastline. In a foreign embassy a while ago, I picked up a VisitBritain pamphlet which was about the north-west, not generally about the UK, but I looked in vain on the map for my resort. The squirrel reserve down the road was there, as was a place called Oswaldtwistle, which has a loom of some note, but Southport was not there, which led me to believe that people in VisitBritain are not as clued up as they might be about the attractions of the wider country.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.2/1">Every plane flying from Britain to North America takes off in London and flies over the north of England, probably almost directly over John Lennon airport. If they landed at that airport, half an hour of flying time and 400 miles-worth of fuel and pollution on the round trip would be saved. If a fast 200 mph railway line were built, people could still be in London within an hour. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that we have to think of a national airport strategy, not just one for London and the south-east?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-25a.80.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" speakername="John Greenway" colnum="80"  time="010:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090225/halltext/90225h0002.htm#09022570000505">
	<p pid="a.80.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" name="Hugh Bayley">the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> on securing this debate. He is right on a number of counts. York is one of the great treasures of the United Kingdom, both in respect of its historic buildings and its tourist industry. In some ways, it is complemented by what is on offer in my constituency of Ryedale. People can seek solitude in York Minster, but they can do so just as easily in Rievaulx.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/2">The hon. Gentleman is right to identify the fall in the value of sterling as an opportunity that Government ought to grasp. He is also right to say that some further investment in and marketing of the UK as a whole would pay huge dividends, not just for the tourism business but for many other businesses and for the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/3">The hon. Gentleman mentioned shopping in York in his constituency, where I live. I was shopping in January during the sales with my wife, who is Dutch, and we could not believe the number of Dutch people buying stuff in the sales. Those people come over on the North sea ferries into Hull, spend a day shopping in York, spend all their money and then go back. I was told yesterday by my wife, who runs a successful inbound tourism operating business, which I will mention in a moment, that at a conference she attended yesterday she found out that the number of North sea ferry crossings from the near continent&mdash;Holland and Belgium&mdash;had already been cut by half because of the recession. That is a real problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/4">I want to mention a couple of other interests that I have. For a number of years I have been a consultant to an organisation that is now called Eventia, which is the trade association for the meetings, events and incentive travel industry and, for some years, I have helped organise a major international politicians' forum on this subject in Frankfurt, which has focused on ensuring that governments, both at local, regional and national level, understand the huge potential economic value of the meetings sector. My wife Hanneke runs a successful inbound tour operating business, mostly bringing business, events and meetings into London&mdash;and into other parts of Britain, including York and Scotland&mdash;from the near continent, including Germany and Holland, and, we hope, increasingly from America.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/5">I have to tell the Minister and say to the interested hon. Members present that the impact of the recession on this sector is becoming all too clear, as is obvious. Many events and meetings are being cancelled because people do not want to be seen having a good time. This is really stupid and short-sighted. The idea is that such events should be cancelled because there is a recession on, but that just makes it worse. There is a phenomenal infrastructure dependent on the inbound tourism industry and it is not just based in London, although it is particularly acute there. The infrastructure is also in York and Southport. For example, many of our universities market themselves as potential and real sites for meetings, and this happens. People hold meetings and events at university campuses during the university summer break. All of this applies, whether we are talking about Lancaster, Durham or London.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/6">I have just been in the USA, hence my slightly darker colour. I am not sure if the Minister is aware that the US Congress is developing a policy that will inhibit companies in receipt of emergency funding from holding meetings and event activities to communicate with and motivate staff, as has been prevalent before. That is ridiculous. The sector's professional associations in America have started a campaign called Keep America Meeting. I suggest that we should keep the world meeting, because tourism is a vibrant element of the real economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/7">The hon. Member for City of York mentioned the problem with pubs, and the truth is that the hospitality industry in north Yorkshire is probably the area's biggest employer. Even in my constituency, which is recognised as being one of the main agricultural parts of Britain, more people are employed in hospitality than in agriculture or even food manufacturing. It is vital to understand the impact of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/8">Most Americans do not know what has happened to the exchange rate. I do not know how to get that message across in a marketing campaign, but they do not realise that the pound is now down to $1.40 or $1.35, and that there is an exchange rate boost for the dollar.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/9">What do we need from the Government? First, we need renewed recognition of the sector's value, and the opportunity that it creates for jobs, training, education and economic growth. Secondly, we must recognise that the sector is under threat. The Minister's facial expressions show that she responds positively to the points that I have made. The hospitality industry across the board is under real threat from the recession, as is everyone else, but we must understand that it is no good having a beggar-my-neighbour approach and making an already difficult situation worse, because it is one of the sectors that can help to bring us out of recession. I have no doubt about that. We need more cohesion in policy-setting across Departments. Transport has been mentioned, and I would add the role of local government, and a greater understanding that the sector needs to work in partnership with local and regional government to deliver better facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/10">I take this opportunity to make a particular point about the necessity for a greater understanding of the impact of taxation. I do not expect the Minister to reply to this now, but she will be aware that many tourist operators make VAT payments under the tour operators' margin scheme. However, thanks to the usual ham-fisted intervention of the European Commission, TOMS will change. The Treasury has sensibly postponed the change to January 2010, but when it comes in it will have a huge impact on the sector because, understandably, when businesses use hotels, transport and conference venues for meetings and events, they expect to get their VAT back, but they will do so only if they do not use agents or the organising sector. That needs attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/11">I entirely support what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> said about London's need for a convention centre. I have made many speeches about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/12">I turn my attention to what we need from the sector, and what it should do. It must recognise that even in these difficult times, the importance of investment remains critical. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> talked about the wonderful places that people may go to in Italy and France when they have been to Rome or Paris, but when they go to such places, they find extremely high standards. The American market will not tolerate low standards. Americans want five-star hotels and the sort of luxury that hotels in Las Vegas and Florida provide. We must ensure that money is available to the sector for such investment, but it must continue to invest in training and facilities. The Minister may speak about the importance of training people to proper standards. I am a member of the Sector Skills Council for Active Leisure and Learning, which is aware of the opportunities for training and upskilling of workers. That is critical, and we must encourage young people to consider the sector as a real career opportunity. Far too many of them think it is the last possible career, but that attitude does not prevail in other parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/13">I again congratulate the hon. Member for City of York on securing this debate. We must be positive and constructive, but the sector is under severe threat as a result of the attitude that people involved in hospitality and events are having a good time when others are being made redundant. That attitude only increases the number of people losing their jobs. We must reverse that, and I look forward with interest to hearing what the Minister says. This is the first time that I have had the opportunity of debating the matter with her. I also look forward to hearing what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> has to say, because he has the job of shadow tourism Minister, which I enjoyed for several years. It is one of the best Opposition jobs, and I hope that he will have the opportunity of doing it in Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-25a.83.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" speakername="Richard Younger-Ross" colnum="83"  time="010:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090225/halltext/90225h0003.htm#09022570000506">
	<p pid="a.83.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" name="Hugh Bayley">the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> on securing this debate. He made some excellent points, and I agree with what he said about the pub industry and the airport strategy, which should be broader. He promoted City of York, as one would expect. Hon. Members also promoted Oxford, the City of London, outer London and the grandeur of Southport, which I know well. My mother was born there, and I spent many summers there as a child visiting relatives, but although it is said that there is sea there, I never saw it.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/2">It would be improper not to mention my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase>, for whom I am standing in, because he would probably never forgive me if I did not give Bath a plug. It is, of course, a world heritage site, and a splendid city. Having mentioned that, it would be my own ruin if I did not mention glorious Devon, where I come from. Teignmouth, the small town that I live in, is a small part of my constituency and is famed for Keats and the computer designer, Babbage, and for being the home of Hornblower and Admiral Pellew. Very few hon. Members here will know that, and that is part of our problem in promoting tourism in the UK. We have opportunities, but we do not exploit them. I shall come to the reasons for needing extra investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/3">The tourism industry has a turnover of &pound;86 billion. It is the sixth largest industry in Britain, and approximately four times the size of farming. It employs 1.4 million people throughout the country, which equates to 4.3 per cent. of the work force. The overall industry, with the jobs that rely on it, represented a massive 8.2 per cent. of GDP in 2007. However, despite the tourism sector's invaluable contribution, both present and past, the Government's commitment to investment and support has been disappointing and has lacked consistency. The portfolio for tourism has been moved from one Department to another, and there have been eight Tourism Ministers in the past 10 years. I hope that the present Minister will remain in post for a long time.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/4">In 2007, spending by domestic residents amounted to &pound;67.6 billion, whereas spending by international visitors was &pound;18.7 billion. Domestic tourism is responsible for nearly four-fifths of our national visitor economy, and we must not forget that when we promote our tourism industry. Many sectors of society benefit from tourism, apart from people who work directly in the industry, ranging from hoteliers to tour guides, and the benefits extend to our cultural and heritage sites inside and outside the capital city. We have superb cultural assets, some of the world's best museums and galleries, and world famous heritage sites with spectacular and diverse landscapes, all of which create a sense of fulfilment and educational enrichment for visitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/5">In a global economy dominated by multinational business, tourism is one of the few industries that can easily accommodate start-up businesses, allowing people to step on that first vital rung on the ladder to entrepreneurial success. However, British tourism can thrive only if the Government are prepared to invest more money in the industry, and VisitBritain, the body responsible for marketing Britain abroad as a tourist destination, has seen its funding drastically cut by more than &pound;15 million for the period 2003 to 2010&mdash;I understand that that is at 2007-08 prices. That body needs greater investment, not less.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/6">Britain's share of the global market has declined from 7 per cent. of international tourist arrivals in 1990 to less than 4 per cent. in the past few years, and from 4.5 per cent. of international tourist receipts in 1990 to less than 3.5 per cent. last year. In the past 10 years, the UK's tourism growth has continually under-performed against the global average, with the UK's tourism deficit spiralling from &pound;5 billion to &pound;20 billion per annum and the UK's share of global tourism falling by almost 20 per cent. and revenue falling by more than 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/7">A world tourism and travel study has forecast that in the next 10 years, the UK tourism industry will be one of the worst performing in the world. The study predicts that out of 174 countries, the UK will experience the 10th worst level of tourism revenue growth. However, Britain is in a position whereby it can attract many more visitors if it adopts sound marketing strategies publicising our many attractions&mdash;whether in York, Oxford, Southport, Devon or the City of London&mdash;and emphasising that British tourism offers good value. One outcome of the credit crunch is the weakness of the pound, which makes Britain affordable to overseas visitors. That presents us with an opportunity to demonstrate to the world's travellers that Britain is no longer an expensive destination and to reverse the trend that has seen Britain experience a 27 per cent. decrease in the number of north American visitors from 2007 to 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/8">VisitBritain can help to achieve that, but it needs sufficient funds to be able to exploit the opportunity. It is the main voice for promoting British tourism, and I urge the Government to reverse the funding cut to VisitBritain so that it can grasp the opportunity and in turn mitigate some of the worst effects of the recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/9">The Olympic games will present London with a unique opportunity to market the city around the world as a tourist destination. So far, the games are estimated to be costing &pound;9.3 billion. What are the Government doing to ensure that the full potential from hosting the games is realised with respect to promoting the tourism industry?</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/10">Christopher Rodrigues, the chair of VisitBritain, has already spoken of his concern regarding the lack of funding for the tourism legacy:</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/11" class="indent">&quot;We were guided by Government not to focus on the case for additional funding, but rather on identifying ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the industry...We have respected that guidance, though we must point out that the plan for achieving the tourism legacy benefits of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games remains largely unfunded.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/12">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport 2012 tourism strategy, &quot;Winning: a Tourism Strategy for 2012 and Beyond&quot;, published in 2007, is as yet unfunded. It must be fully implemented and adequately funded as a priority. The strategy claimed that the Olympics could generate an estimated &pound;2.1 billion in additional tourism benefits for the UK over the period from 2007 to 2017 and stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/13" class="indent">&quot;We must use the 2012 Games as an opportunity to upgrade facilities and give tourists a first-class experience.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/14">The strategy seemed to suggest that the Government would put extra money towards marketing Britain as a tourist destination in the run-up to the games. That now appears extremely unlikely. Even when the former Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport&mdash;the current Secretary of State for Work and Pensions&mdash;announced the 18 per cent. reduction in funding for VisitBritain as part of the 2007 comprehensive spending review, he held the door open on the Olympics with this announcement:</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/15" class="indent">&quot;I recognise VisitBritain's key role in delivering the 2012 tourism legacy and will review available resources for VisitBritain to work with the private sector as we get closer to the 2012 Games.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/16">That door seemed to be firmly slammed shut by this Minister when she told the House:</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/17" class="indent">&quot;I have no plans to provide additional funding for tourism in respect of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in this comprehensive spending round.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-01-26.60"><i>Official Report</i>, 26 January 2009; Vol. 487, c. 60W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/18">That was reported in the Tourism Alliance January newsletter.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/19">There is also cause for concern about the lack of preparation regarding applications for tickets, which I understand will go on the market in spring 2011. Little thought appears to have been given to how we promote Britain for when the tickets are on sale. There is little point in our having a big promotion in 2011. The promotion has to take place in 2010, so that when people are buying tickets, they buy the whole package and they do not just think that they will come to London, do the easy options and then go back again, or go to Weymouth and then go back again. If they are in Weymouth, how about going to Dorset? If they are in another part of the country, how about going to York, Oxford or some of the other places?</p>

	<p pid="a.86.4/2">We have a confusing, overlapping and conflicting tourism structure. We have had 10 years of jobs for the boys because there has been no leadership in Parliament. The regional development agencies and others bodies that are, from the Government's perspective, responsible for tourism have been able to introduce their own initiatives, which are not necessarily in tune, do not necessarily follow the same agenda and certainly do not spend money wisely. Under a Conservative Government, however, that will be no more&mdash;things will certainly change.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.1/1">Not at the moment, because time is against me, and it is Minister who needs to respond on these issues, not the hon. Gentleman. However, I will give way in a little while, because this is his debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/2">Let me cite a couple of examples. In Boston, Massachusetts, we had six different offices representing RDAs promoting different corners of the UK, which is just madness. We have an overlapping, inconsistent approach to getting people to come to the UK and decide where they want to go. I am glad to hear that that has now stopped and that some of those offices have been closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/3">Closer to home, another example came to my attention last week. Stonehenge is our premier outdoor attraction, but anyone who has visited it recently will be aware of the mess and misery at the visitors' centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/4">What are we doing to harness to the opportunity of the Olympics, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> so eloquently described? We are building a temporary site just for the duration of the Olympics at a cost of &pound;20 million. That is after a &pound;15 million feasibility study&mdash;a paper exercise&mdash;to work out what to do. So, &pound;20 million is being spent on something that will simply be torn down after the Olympics. That is not a good strategy or a good approach to co-ordinating jobs. Where is the leadership from the Government to ensure that the agencies responsible for putting things together create something permanent so that we can celebrate our premier outdoor attraction?</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/5">I will not reiterate hon. Members' praise for the tourism industry, although I agree with them. However, those in the industry look to us not just to praise them, but for support. They know that they are doing well, but they know, too, that they could do better if they had better support from us. It is we who have to provide that support.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/6">It has been reiterated that the industry is worth &pound;90 billion a year. It is also responsible for one in four new jobs created in the UK. In global terms, 30 million visitors come to the UK every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster makes the important point that London is an important attraction, but only one tenth of visitors to France and Germany go to Paris and Berlin, whereas half of our visitors come to London. We have to ask how we can not only continue to encourage people to come to London, but spread the wealth and tourism opportunities so that people visit other places across the country. We can put only so many people in Oxford street before it is no longer a pleasant place to be, and we need to address that.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/8">As we have heard, tourism in Britain is unique, and we cannot replace it. Oxford is Oxford, and Bournemouth is Bournemouth, and we cannot replicate them in the far east, because they are special to the UK. That is why we can be proud of what we offer.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.1/1">Okay. I agree with you, Mr. O'Hara&mdash;I do not want to be downwind of the smell that has been created.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/2">Officials who took the right decision and did the right planning said, &quot;Chorley, Accrington and other offices are in the right place, providing the right business with high quality.&quot; Those officials got it right, so what has changed? If the office costs less to run and has the best staff, what could have changed anybody's mind? It is logical not to close the award winning, purpose built office that officials say should remain open.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/3">We come back to what I said earlier: something about this is very questionable. What influence and undue influence was exerted to close Chorley and Hyndburn, and to allow Blackburn and St. Helens to remain open? How much will the Minister have to spend on those offices to make them fit for purpose? They were not fit for purpose, and they are still not. I say to him: please go away, take another look at the matter and come back to us. We will not go away. We will quite rightly pursue the Treasury for the truth, openness and transparency that we deserve. We expect to see all the letters, notes and e-mails that have been sent over the closures. It is only right that we should.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/4">I would take the better option, which would keep everybody happy and put some of the spare capacity work&mdash;tax credits and other things&mdash;into the offices. Finally, we should start with Chorley and look at the other offices after.</p>

	<p pid="a.106.2/1">I agree entirely, and I am happy to know that a representative of one of the receiving authorities is keen enough on this matter to say just that. We need change, which leads me to the issue of what we want. Our key aims are to achieve a fair and locally controlled system of housing finance, and doing so would require the following action: the abolition of the housing revenue account subsidy system; the abolition of the rent rebate subsidy limitation arrangements; all receipts from right-to-buy sales retained by the local authority; rents controlled locally; and all rents retained by, in our case, Portsmouth city council and the housing revenue account. If those changes were to happen with effect from April 2010, it would be of dramatic benefit to those on the waiting list and to existing council tenants. If we do not make those changes, the situation will simply get worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/2">How would those changes help the Government meet their aims? They would lead to the poor and vulnerable in our society being treated fairer and better, which I think everyone would agree is important. There would also be savings for the Department for Work and Pensions and better employment prospects for tenants, because they would not be forced into the benefits system by higher rents. The city council itself could finance the building of 1,700 to 1,900 homes over the next five years, which would help meet the desperate need for social housing at affordable rents and help to offset the effects of the recession by maintaining local jobs in building and related industries. Local decision making would empower councils to tailor solutions to local problems and enable them to work with tenants to plan long-term investment in council homes. In addition, devolving power to local councils would stimulate and strengthen local democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/3">Is that too much to ask? Is it really too much to ask from a Government who claim that they care about people on council waiting lists? Is it too much to expect a Government to respond to the known needs of a huge number of people in this country? Is it too much to want to have better and newer homes for people to live in and for children not to be condemned to live on the 20th floor of a high-rise building with nowhere to play and no safe spot, except the corridor in the hall where their flat is? Is it not right to want older people who under-occupy properties to be given a viable alternative so that they can move out of a three-bedroomed home into a decent property? We would love to be able do that in Portsmouth. We have a large number of under-occupied properties, but we face a problem if we expect someone to move out of a three-bedroomed house when we offer them a tenement that does not even have a lift?</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/4">If we want people to cease to under-occupy properties, we must use our imagination and deliver for those people the sort of properties in which we would want to live if we had to give up a home with a garden to go elsewhere. These are challenges for all of us, and they are big challenges for local authorities. Local authorities&mdash;mine included&mdash;could do a lot more if we were able to use the money that we collect from our tenants in the local area. That would satisfy many of the Government's ambitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.2/5">I am disappointed and dispirited. As someone who is still a member of a local authority after 38 years, despite the worst of the Thatcher era when Mrs. Thatcher did her best to deliver the killer blow to local authorities, in my experience it has never been more difficult to try to bring council properties up to a higher standard. The opportunity to build council houses should be given to local authorities again, so that they can actually do it.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1767" name="Mike Hancock">the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock)</phrase> on instigating this debate. The subject is important and affects many people who, as he rightly said, are on the lowest incomes and sometimes live in the poorest housing conditions. Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase>, I straightaway make the caveat that council tenants now live in much better conditions than they did in 1997 because of the great success of the decent homes programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/2">I want to say from the start that when I asked my hon. Friend the Minister about the matter in the House a few weeks ago, I had the clear answer that the Government are now, in principle, in favour of changing what I think everyone now accepts is a flawed housing revenue accounts and housing subsidy system. I welcome the working group that has been set up and that will, I hope, report shortly. This problem does not merely affect those tenants whose houses are directly managed by local authorities; it also affects tenants of arm's length management organisations. Their houses are managed by an arm's length company, but the housing funding still essentially rests with the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/3">If all we were doing today was agreeing that the Treasury should not make a profit out of council house tenants, we could have a simple system&mdash;we could alter the figures in the current arrangements and that would be that&mdash;but that is not the difficulty. The Treasury certainly should not be making a profit out of council house tenants, but there are other problems. I want to go through the problems as I see them and explain how they affect my constituents, particularly tenants in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/4">Historically&mdash;certainly when I was chairman of housing in Sheffield back in the 1980s&mdash;one could relate services to rents and explain to tenants on a yearly basis how much their rents were going up and what impact on services that would have. There were options: one could consult tenants and ask for their opinions and, hopefully, reflect those opinions in decisions. That cannot be done now because we have separated the delivery of service from the charging of rents. That is fundamentally unhelpful in a democratic society.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/5">In the past, one could even relate individual tenant's services to the rents that they paid. We had a system of points-based rents in Sheffield, where points were given for certain attributes of a house. If the tenant asked the authority for a new central heating system, the authority put it in and charged extra rent on the points-based system. Tenants thought that that was great, because there was individual choice. The Government are, in essence, in favour of choice for consumers in the health service and in education. That kind of choice ought to be available to council tenants as well, but it cannot be provided under the current system.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/6">As has rightly been said, the current system is inexplicable. It is inexplicable to tenants&mdash;they cannot understand it. I would guess that most councillors and MPs, and probably even some Ministers, do not understand it either. Any system that is inexplicable is a bad system.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/7">Organisations cannot plan. Sheffield Homes is looking to the future and is having to take precautionary steps towards making people redundant because it cannot be sure what its financial position will be in one, two or three years' time. It is essential to plan ahead for investment in housing. That is fundamental to a successful housing service and delivering quality for tenants, but it cannot be done easily.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/8">It must be nonsense that rents are in any way determined from the centre. I can just about understand the principle of bringing rents of different organisations in an area into line, but if there is a principle here&mdash;I am not sure that there is&mdash;surely it pales into insignificance compared with the complications of trying to enforce it. Therefore, we must get away from that idea and accept that rents may be different in different areas for similar houses, where one is managed by a registered social landlord and another is managed by an arm's length management organisation or a local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/9">I accept that guidelines are used to try to fix rents from the centre&mdash;the figure this year is 6 per cent.&mdash;but the reality is that those guidelines, which are based on finances dictated from the centre, certainly push organisations, councils and ALMOs in that direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/10">I will briefly throw in a party-political point. It is disappointing that Sheffield council has pushed Sheffield Homes into a 6 per cent. rent increase but given it only a 2 per cent. increase in its revenue this year, which is half what the ALMO needs to keep services going. It is also disappointing that the council began with a commitment that decent homes work carried out to properties in Sheffield would be done to the same standard throughout the programme, from beginning to end. The new Liberal Democrat council has just cut back on those standards, so many people who get work done in the last two years of the programme will have it done to a lower standard. That is a party-political point to match some of the ones that were made earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/11">Of course, there is new build&mdash;I accept that. The current arrangements in the housing revenue account mean that councils can actually lose grant for building homes. I accept that the Government have gone some way towards redressing that and have said that if organisations come forward and request a social housing grant, the funding can be kept outside the housing revenue account system so that there will not be that impact if they seek to build new homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/12">However, this is not just a Government issue. Given the effects of the current financial circumstances on housing generally, we will not get new building of council homes off the ground, even if the social housing grant is increased to a much higher percentage, unless local authorities are prepared to put land in for free to make the system work. That goes right across the board, but some councils clearly are reluctant to do that. They have a role to play as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/13">There are clearly problems with the current system, and a system that has that many problems really is not fit for purpose in any shape or form. Perhaps that is why the Government's working party has been going on for so long: the real difficulty is that we can all say what the problems are&mdash;they are easy to define&mdash;and we can have aspirations as to how things might change, but it is not as easy to say exactly what kind of system can be developed for the future that will meet the various needs that we can all identify. We will not solve the problems in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.2/14">The hon. Member for Portsmouth, South highlighted the problem of authorities receiving subsidy through the system, perhaps from other councils. Perhaps that is unfair, but the fact is that they do. If we were simply to tear up the system and say that money would not be transferred from one authority to another, some tenants would find themselves in difficult circumstances. It is not the authorities that I am particularly concerned about, but the tenants.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.0/1">I share with enthusiasm many of the points that the hon. Gentleman has made, but I would be grateful if told me why&mdash;in his opinion as a former housing chairman and someone who knows this subject, like others in the Chamber&mdash;it has taken so long for people to recognise the stranglehold that the policy has had on local authorities' ability to deliver what the Government and their citizens want, which is better and more affordable housing. Why has it taken so long to get to this point?</p>

	<p pid="a.110.1/1">As I cannot answer that question, I will wait for the Minister to respond to it. The Government have acknowledged for the past two years that there is a problem. Perhaps they were a little late in coming to that view. Other people have been campaigning on the issue for slightly longer&mdash;I have raised it on many occasions, privately with Ministers and in debates and questions&mdash;but at least we have got to a point where the Government recognise the problem. We now have to try to shape the debate and influence the final outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/2">Dealing with the problems of authorities that are in subsidy will be very difficult, but we are on the Minister's side in the negotiations that he will have to have with the Treasury. Certainly a situation in which subsidy goes to the Treasury from council tenants collectively is unacceptable, but to introduce a new system and make it work, some Treasury subsidy will have to go into housing at a fairly early stage. I know that that will be difficult, but I am not sure that we will be able to make any new system work otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/3">I know that other Members want to speak, Mr. O'Hara, so I shall conclude, as the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South did, by trying to develop four principles that I would like to see in any new system. First, there must be that essential link between an ALMO or a local housing authority and their tenants. They must be able to have meaningful negotiations about the rent and services in an area. It is essential that the two are related, and any system that does not allow that to happen cannot be correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/4">We have to accept that it is fundamentally wrong that the Treasury should receive subsidy from council tenants collectively. That cannot be right, and the Treasury will have to accept that there is an enormous feeling of resentment across the board, across all political parties and, quite rightly, from council tenants who feel that they are subsidising other services on a national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/5">However, I also ask the Minister&mdash;this relates to individual local authorities that do not always behave very well in this regard&mdash;please, will he tighten the guidelines for local authorities so that they say that money collected from rents has to be spent on services received by tenants, not on subsidising community services in general, which benefit everyone? That happens up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/6">In my authority, community wardens are very popular. They are funded by Sheffield Homes, but they do not benefit council tenants only&mdash;they benefit the whole community. The maintenance of grass verges and open spaces, and the cutting of shrubs on what were council estates, benefit many people who are not now council tenants, but the funding often comes just from tenants' rents. We must tighten up on the guidelines to ensure not only that the Treasury nationally does not get subsidy from council tenants, but that local services that benefit the whole community are not subsidised by council tenants alone. I would like the Minister to have a look at that as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/7">Finally, there probably will have to be a short-term transitional arrangement to change from the current system to a new one, but, please, do not allow that arrangement, with all the normal damping and tapers that are associated with two systems, go on for a long time. The current system is complicated enough. To put transitional arrangements from that system on to a new one will make things so complicated that even the two people who understand the current system will not understand the new one. Yes, we probably will have to have transitional arrangements, but they should be kept very brief so that we can get to a new system based on the principles that I outlined.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1767" name="Mike Hancock">the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock)</phrase> on securing this debate. I hope that he will forgive me if I focus most of my comments specifically on my area, in the way that he did in respect of Hampshire, although he strayed across to the Surrey border in some of his early comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1809" name="Clive Betts">The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)</phrase> summed up one of the core problems: there is a sense of injustice about how the system works. One of the difficulties with trying to draw a line under the past and bring in an entirely new system is that, almost inevitably, there will be significant losers as well as gainers. For those losers, if there are to be transition and damping arrangements, much of the good that comes into place is undermined. There are some big concerns about how precisely we should go forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/3">The hon. Gentleman was a leader of a local council. I suspect that he was being modest when he suggested that many of us do not have too much of an understanding of the system. As he will know, however, there is all too often a system to be played not only in relation to housing, but across the range of council services. There are individuals at the highest levels of local authorities who understand exactly how those mechanisms work and can ensure that they operate in the best interests of their local authority, and that is nowhere more apparent than in the housing sphere.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/4">The issues that I hope to raise in the few minutes during which I will address hon. Members are slightly different from some of those that have been raised, and they obviously focus very much on my own local authority in the city of Westminster. For some months, news coverage of the housing market has been dominated by talk of falling&mdash;falling house prices, falling mortgage rates, falling levels of interest for prospective buyers&mdash;but that has not been the case with social housing. While the Government appear to be throwing everything but the kitchen sink at helping the often hapless home owner, they have quietly pushed through some quite significant rent increases. Come <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April</phrase>, those increases will hit many tens of thousands of council tenants in London, at the very time when they are being squeezed hardest by the recession.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-25a.112.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="112"  time="015:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090225/halltext/90225h0007.htm#09022570000580">
	<p pid="a.112.1/1">The issue of council rents goes back to the point about how we ensure that we have a fair system. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe talked about the Treasury giving subsidies, and some phenomenal subsidies are given to the council rented sector. That has been the case since time immemorial, and it is very difficult to row back from that position.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/2">I accept&mdash;this relates to some of the issues in my constituency that I want to discuss&mdash;that central London is in an exceptional situation in many ways. However, the difference between the rent for those who live in social housing and council housing, or arm's length management organisation housing in the case of CityWest Homes, and any market rent is colossal. Understandably, that causes dismay and irritation among those who are not particularly well paid, but who are none the less well paid enough and in stable enough employment that they cannot get into social housing, even though they cannot begin to think about getting on the housing ladder or paying anything like a market rent to live in the centre of London.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/3">In many ways, as we can see from the interest in the Chamber today, some of the Government's proposals for rents have the makings of a repeat of the 10p tax band fiasco. For those with short memories, the Government hoped to grab the headlines through populist handouts in the 2007 Budget and conveniently to disguise the fact that the abolition of a 10p tax band would mean that the poorest were worst off.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/4">As has been said, the formula for calculating social housing rents is set by central Government. As a result of linking that formula to the retail prices index figure from September 2008, when inflation was at a peak of 5 per cent., the Government are intent on imposing rent increases of 6 to 9 per cent.&mdash;by any measure, well over double the current rate of inflation. That works out at a rise of at least &pound;300 a year in the rental bill of the average tenant&mdash;at least in Westminster. What is more, tenants in such properties tend to be on fixed incomes because they are pensioners, disabled&mdash;either in full-time or part-time work&mdash;or just above the benefit threshold. They will be the people who have to find the money by taking their already stretched household budgets back to the drawing board.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/5">It has often been complained&mdash;I have some sympathy with the Minister's situation in this regard&mdash;that councils have no flexibility to set their own rents under the current system. I can see that it would be difficult to have a free-for-all. To be absolutely candid, the fact that there are now considerably more Conservative and Liberal Democrat councils than there were perhaps 10 years ago means that we hear this klaxon voice in a way that we did not then. However, as the Minister is aware, London's local authorities will be forced to impose rises on their tenants or suffer the financial consequences if the formula is not adhered to.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/6">Eight local authorities in the capital&mdash;Westminster, Kingston, Southwark, Harrow, Hillingdon, Camden, Brent and Hounslow&mdash;oppose the proposed rise and have lobbied the Minister for Housing by sending her a cross-party letter to try to change her mind. My own local authority in the city of Westminster has spearheaded the campaign and would like the Government to take a more reasoned approach, keeping any rent rises to an absolute minimum. It believes that the Government should look again at the formula that they use to calculate rent or consider further Government assistance for tenants to mitigate the impact on local authority budgets if Ministers insist on pressing ahead with these inflation-busting increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/7">At this point, it is worth mentioning the fact that, should the housing revenue account subsidy system remain unreformed, a 6.2 per cent. minimum increase has already been allocated for the financial year 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/8">It is clear that inflexible, centralised control of the rental system is not working, particularly here in the capital. Aside from imposing rent increases on vulnerable tenants in the most difficult of times, it fails to cater for a significant number of people who are, as I said, too poor to buy, but too rich to rent socially.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/9">Earlier this year, I secured a debate in this Chamber on the problems facing London's housing associations during the economic downturn, as the Minister will know because he responded to it. One of their complaints, which came through loud and clear, was about the inflexibility of the social rent structure, and I want to highlight that concern again.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/10">I accept that wealth disparity has afflicted London since time immemorial. Other London Members in the Chamber&mdash;whether from Brent or Kensington&mdash;will know that there has been much more polarisation in the relatively short time that we have been Members of Parliament than there was before, and I have certainly seen that in my eight years in the House. There continues to be huge demographic change, and those on middle and low incomes&mdash;in the capital, that can mean those who earn well over double the national average wage&mdash;get pushed out of area. That includes many families who have lived in our vicinities for generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/11">My local housing associations are eager to use their resources to cater for that low-to-middle income group, but the rigidity of the rental system means that they cannot get the most out of their housing stock. In exchanges in the House, I mentioned the example of the housing arrangements of an elderly constituent who passed away last year. She had lived as a secure tenant in her home on the Peabody estate on Wild street in Convent Garden since 1986 for a rent of &pound;75.50 a week, which included services. The estate is moments away from the glitz and glamour of the Covent Garden piazza, and the market rent for the flat would be about &pound;320 a week, which is roughly four times the amount that she was paying. The flat is now being re-let at &pound;116 per week, including services, to a tenant with support needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/12">So, the typical difference between the social and market rents in my constituency is often &pound;200 a week, or &pound;10,000 a year. Although that is an extreme example, there will be similar examples of that huge disparity throughout London. What happens to those who fall between the two extremes&mdash;those who do not qualify for social housing, but who cannot realistically afford the cost of market rents in central London? At two thirds of that cost, the gap is huge and getting bigger, and we need to find some middle ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/13">Housing associations are frustrated that the income that they receive from renting a property in London often barely covers the maintenance costs and that the rental income from a four-bedroomed house is only slightly more than that from a two-bedroomed flat. The same applies when we look at the differences in rent for a zero-carbon home and an old, inefficient property. None of that makes sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/14">I appreciate that other hon. Members wish to speak, so I will bring my comments to a conclusion. The current centrally imposed national rental system simply does not and cannot work for London tenants. I suspect that that is an issue not just for the capital, and we have seen it in Portsmouth and other parts of the country. If the proposed rent rises go ahead, they will serve only adversely to affect tens of thousands of council tenants at a time when the Government purport to be doing all they can to mitigate the impact of recession.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.1/1">I am delighted to take part in the debate and strongly congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1767" name="Mike Hancock">the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock)</phrase> on securing it. I also congratulate him on choosing today for the debate, because some of us on the all-party group on council housing have been listening for several hours to evidence from tenants from different parts of the country, including Birmingham, Norwich and Reading, and also from Stroud, and some of my constituents are here to listen to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/2">Had the Minister managed to pop in to that meeting, he would have heard tenants express a mixture of mystification and anger over the rent situation that they face. There is one thing worse than hearing from me today, and that is hearing from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>, who chairs that all-party group and is stuck in that meeting taking evidence to the very end, and I pay tribute to him for what he has done.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/3">The campaign is not recent and has been running for more than a decade. Alan Walter and all those who support Defend Council Housing deserve our support and congratulations for keeping on with the campaign. We think that we are beginning to win not only the arguments, but the outcome, because there needs to be change. I will not speak for long because I want to hear the excellent things that the Minister has to say about solving the problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/4">I wish to make three underlying statements on the essence of where we need to go on that. First, I wish to warn against disaggregating the housing revenue account, which Defend Council Housing is also against. It is tempting to say to the councils that are in surplus that they can keep the surplus and that the Government must somehow, magically, find solutions for those that are not in surplus, but there are two problems with that: as a socialist, that is not how I would like to see things go, because those mainly urban authorities deserve support; and more particularly, there is a danger if that does not work out that those involved will be picked off one by one. I have experience in that area and led the campaign, with the tenants who were present today, against the large-scale voluntary transfer, which I though was the wrong approach at the wrong time, and we won that ballot overwhelmingly, as several others have done. We should not, however, be penalised because we saw the genuine, democratic right of those authorities to choose what they wanted, which is local authority housing. The good point that came out from our meeting today was that we saw how much people want to remain with the local authority. That is not a negative, but a positive.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/5">Secondly, there will have to be a write-off of debts, and I make that point loud and clear because the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury has just entered the Chamber. There is no way of avoiding that, but would it really be a write-off of historical debt, because many of us&mdash;although not all&mdash;would argue that council housing has paid for itself many times over? That is the only group being asked to pay off historical debts, as we do not ask for payback from housing associations, or from those in the private rented sector, even though the money ends up with the landlords, or from owner-occupiers who have received subsidies to pay off historical debts. Why then are council tenants being picked on? It is grossly unfair and unjust and we need to do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/6">Thirdly, we need total transparency, and we must always argue for that. If it does nothing else, it will explain what really goes on. I can make accusations about the local authority in Stroud, which has filched about &pound;5.8 million by taking it out. It could be argued that that was for the benefit of tenants, but it was of course for the benefit of everyone else as well. How is it that we really do not know what the figures mean? That might be because some of us are not so bright or good at calculating those things, or perhaps it is because the matter is so complex that we do not know whether the audit trail leads to central Government, local government or, as many of us presume, a mixture of the two? We need to have clarity, because we will not sort the mess out until the figures are explained to everyone completely overtly.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/7">I will make several other points quickly because we will soon move on to the winding-up speeches. I am worried about the way in which we handle this in relation to older residents living in sheltered accommodation. There is now even less clarity about that, in part because we now have two different finance streams, the normal housing revenue account and the supporting people budgets. As we know, sheltered housing is changing the fundamental basis of what it is there to do, so I appeal to the Minister that we need not only to solve the big problem, but to solve the problem at a micro level. We do not want to disadvantage one group of tenants, even if we can solve the bigger picture. I am aware of the anger over that, and the Minister will have to take my word on that because I, like him, have been meeting tenants over decades. The Government cannot ignore that any longer, and they cannot pretend that a review is the answer until such a review comes up with radical solutions on how to deal with today's problem. Today's problem is multi-faceted and is not only about those people in council accommodation whom we want to look after.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/8">I pay tribute to the Government for the decent homes standard, which has dramatically improved the stock, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1809" name="Clive Betts">the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)</phrase> has said. However, we know that the money is beginning to run out and is certainly getting caught up in the argument over rent increases. It is no good saying to people that a 6 per cent. rent increase can be justified, even if some of the money is being used to improve the standard of housing, and too often it is not. As the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South has said, it is a double bind, because tenants are not only paying more, but getting less for their money. That is not fair and we cannot allow it to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/9">With regard to knowing where we go to from here, we need to understand that the reality of the situation is that if we do not fix what we have at the moment, we can never talk about building again. A Damascene conversion would not be a moment too soon. If the Government are saying that part of the solution to our housing problems is that we have to build local authority housing again, despite those who ask why we went through all the arguments of why that was not the right way to go, let us congratulate them and get behind it.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/10">This issue transcends party politics, because if we do not do that, today's crisis will become tomorrow's catastrophe. I welcome the fact that we are now seeing that as a solution, rather than as a problem, but we need total transparency on the figure and we need to ensure that the will is translated into action. More particularly, we must recognise that the people who have suffered have done so for too long and that it is about time that we listened to them and dealt with what they are saying to us, because what they are saying to us is right.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1767" name="Mike Hancock">the Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock)</phrase> on securing this debate. It is timely, because, in the past two weeks, most council tenants will have received next year's bill and realised that their rent is going up. This is a time when most people are thinking hard about the services that they receive from their local authority. The figures that my hon. Friend gave were stark, with &pound;4.6 million lost this year to the Treasury, and he spoke about how it will have an impact on the ability to refurbish stock as well as to build. I congratulate him on being able to collect 5,500 signatures, which is a great achievement and testament to the strong feeling in many areas of the country. People think that the money they are spending is going to their own housing, but it is going into Treasury coffers or to fund refurbishment elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/2">My hon. Friend also made the point that, if authorities were able to keep that &pound;4.6 million, they would be able to build 1,000 new homes by 2013. If we were to apply that throughout the country, it would go some way to meeting the targets that the Government have set councils. Currently, they are simply unable to meet them. The hon. Members for Guildford (Anne Milton) and for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt), who represent the Waverley area, are not in their places, but I, too, was lobbied by Waverley council yesterday, and it is doing a good job of bringing the issue to people's attention. It is worth repeating that for every pound spent, 49p goes to the Treasury, which is an incredible rate of taxation. There are very few other areas in which one would expect poor people to pay such a high marginal tax rate, yet poor tenants pay 49p in every pound of rent straight to the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/3">Several hon. Members mentioned the perverse incentives of the current housing revenue account system, and that was a point well made. My hon. Friend also noted that the issue is not just about rent, but about receipts from right to buy, and, when we add the money up, we find that a large amount leaves local housing finance every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/4">Many hon. Members made the point that the current system is complex, as I did when I intervened on my hon. Friend. Part of the problem is that many subsidy issues are based on historic debt and on a complicated calculation of what the Government think an area may need. For many councils, the notional debt that is used to calculate the formula for housing revenue bears no relation to the actual debt, so the financial model is very complicated. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1809" name="Clive Betts">The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)</phrase> made the point that, as a first principle, the Treasury should never make a profit out of poor tenants. The Government's review seems to have been going on for absolutely ages, and I hope that the Minister will say when it will finally report. When it does, I hope that the second point that the Minister will accept is that poor tenants in one area should not subsidise poor tenants in another. Poor tenants who are in council property are poor wherever they live. It does not matter whether they live in Brent, Portsmouth, Kingston or Cambridge, they are all in the same position, and the people who should subsidise local repairs and rebuilding out of general taxation are people like me, who can afford to pay their taxes, not people who live in social housing.</p>

Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> made the point well that the Government are forcing rents up. The guideline rent formula sets rents at RPI plus 1 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.6/1">The hon. Gentleman must wait with baited breath for the housing Green Paper that the Conservative party will produce soon. He must contain his excitement, but I have no doubt that he will give that Green Paper a robust analysis when the time comes.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.6/2">Obviously, there is great unhappiness at local level&mdash;that has been reflected in hon. Members' comments today&mdash;about the operation of the housing revenue account. There is consensus that there should be clarity, transparency and, above all, alacrity. The Government have had a huge amount of time to get it right. They originally said that would happen in 2010, and they are now saying that it will be in 2009. It is important that local people make local decisions, because what is appropriate for one group of people in Portsmouth will not be appropriate for another group in Sheffield, Attercliffe, Hartlepool and other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.6/3">This has been a useful debate. The mood of the House is such that I think the Minister will take away our request that the review be concluded quickly, and I hope that he will answer the specific points that have been made by hon. Members today.</p>

	<p pid="a.124.1/1">I disagree with the hon. Gentleman, and I am pleased that he has given me the opportunity to clarify a matter of debate between him and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase>, who pressed him on Westminster city council's subsidy to other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/2">I shall talk about the determination of general subsidy that local authorities provide to the Treasury and which flows back and forth, but first I want to highlight for the hon. Gentleman an answer that I gave to my hon. Friend two weeks ago. She asked</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/3" class="indent">&quot;how much (a) Westminster City Council and (b) CityWest Homes contributed to the housing revenue account in each of the last 10 years; and how much they are expected to contribute to it in (a) 2008-09 and (b) 2009-10&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/4">My answer was:</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Westminster city council has been a net recipient of housing revenue account subsidy in each of the last 10 years. The authority does not contribute surpluses for redistribution elsewhere and we expect this to continue to be the case in 2009-10.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-02-10.1839"><i>Official Report</i>, 10 February 2009; Vol. 487, c. 1839W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/6">In the remaining time, I want to respond to the important point about how council housing is financed. The hon. Member for Portsmouth, South used words such as &quot;mugged&quot; and &quot;robbed&quot;. I tend to use more balanced language, but he is right and more than &pound;200 million this year has flowed from local authorities' housing revenue account subsidy to the Treasury, although that must be set in a slightly wider context and I am conscious that an excellent Treasury Minister, the Exchequer Secretary, is sitting beside me.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/7">First&mdash;this is important&mdash;the Treasury is spending around &pound;5.9 billion on housing this year, which far exceeds the amounts that are going back to the Treasury through the HRA subsidy system. Secondly, and also importantly, in recent years, the Treasury has pumped considerable amounts of money into the HRA system: around &pound;54 million in 2007-08, around &pound;42 million in 2006-07, and almost &pound;208 million in 2005-06. One narrow year cannot be used to provide a definitive statement or a comprehensive view.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/8">I understand that it is necessary to review how council house funding is provided and I shall describe what the Government are doing, but first I give way to the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-25a.126.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1420" speakername="John Hemming" colnum="126"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090225/halltext/90225h0009.htm#09022570000611">
	<p pid="a.126.1/1">I am pleased to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara. I thank Mr. Speaker for the opportunity to debate bingo taxation. I know that other hon. Members are concerned about the issue, as they have bingo clubs in their constituencies, and I will be happy to take interventions later, but I want to make some progress with my speech first, if they do not mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/2">Danny La Rue 52, two fat ladies 88 and legs 11 could be a thing of the past if Her Majesty's Treasury gets its way. Almost time for tea, some 83,000 people are members of Mecca bingo club in Acocks Green, which is in Yardley. It is one of one little duck two bingo clubs in Yardley and man alive five bingo clubs in Birmingham. The problem is that the Government uniquely hit bingo with rugby team 15 per cent. VAT and 15 per cent. gross profits tax&mdash;a cumulative tax rate of buckle my shoe 32 and a quarter per cent. That compares with only one 15 per cent. tax on other forms of gambling. Bingo is uniquely hit by extra taxation.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/3">The Budd report in 2001&mdash;the gambling review report&mdash;identified bingo as the softest form of gambling. After all, who has heard of gangsters sending out enforcers to get payment of bingo debts? However, in the past six years, more than 100 clubs have closed and more than 3,500 jobs have been lost, and hundreds of thousands of people no longer have a local bingo club. The taxation seems to me and many others a deeply unfair system and, if it is allowed to continue, it will lead to the threat of further job losses, the closure of more clubs and the loss of an important social amenity for millions of people throughout the country. That would be a tragedy, as bingo clubs are more than just a soft gambling pastime. They are a meeting place for friends in a safe and secure environment and a community hall or club for many elderly people&mdash;but not just elderly people; there are many younger people as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/4">Politicians on both sides of the House&mdash;more than 200 MPs have a bingo club in their constituency&mdash;support the scrapping of double taxation. During the past year and a half, MPs have signalled their dismay at the continuation of double taxation by signing a number of early-day motions in support of the bingo industry, two of which I tabled. It is for those reasons and more that I believe that VAT should be removed from bingo, as that will help to secure the future of one of the most popular indoor leisure pastimes. Interestingly, I have received more communications on this issue than on any other in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/5">In the past few years, many hon. Members on both sides of the House have tabled written questions asking the Chancellor of the Exchequer to explain his fiscal policy on licensed bingo clubs and the basis for his decision. I could happily list the many replies that the Minister and her predecessor have given, but they are all similar in one respect&mdash;as is usual for the Government, they fail to answer the question. For example, I asked the Chancellor about removing VAT from bingo. The Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The Government take all relevant factors into consideration when establishing and maintaining fair gambling tax regimes.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-02-12.2140"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 February 2009; Vol. 487, c. 2140W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/7">I suppose that that is better than saying that it is too expensive to answer the question. The phrases &quot;relevant factors&quot;, &quot;specific circumstances&quot; and &quot;specific factors&quot; are the most commonly used defence by the Treasury, but it never explains what it means. Will the Minister take the opportunity presented by this debate to tell me what the &quot;relevant factors&quot; are? Will she explain why she thinks that it is a &quot;fair gambling tax regime&quot; and why bingo has to be subject to double taxation? I would also like to know why after six years of protest from MPs on all sides, the Government refuse to accept that bingo is taxed too heavily.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/8">Another issue that is raised time and again by the Treasury is that the root of bingo's problems is not fiscal and that other factors such as the smoking ban have had a significant impact on bingo. It is worth noting that it has never been claimed that double taxation is the industry's only problem. I agree that the smoking ban has had an impact on the industry, as it has in other areas, but the ban was not opposed by the industry, which actively supported the Government. However, the key point is that although the smoking ban had a negative effect on our nation's bingo clubs, it has no bearing on the fact that those clubs remain subject to a burdensome system of taxation that is more severe than that applied to betting shops, casinos, online bingo, online casinos and poker, online betting, football pools and gaming machines.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/9">Indeed, if one examines the changes made to the football pools in 1995, 1999 and 2002, one sees that the tax burden was reduced through changes to the rates of duty. The Government's stated motivation for making those tax cuts was not that tax was &quot;at the root&quot; of the pools industry's problems, but that it was necessary to help the pools to recover from external factors. Let us compare that with the situation in which bingo clubs are closing over time, with a number of job losses. The Minister may remember that she was instrumental in bringing about those changes, but she appears to have changed her tune now that she is in office. Will she explain why the football pools qualified, yet the bingo industry does not?</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/10">One important factor that needs to be addressed is the Government's assertion that changes in pay-as-you-earn or corporation tax within bingo are assumed to be offset elsewhere in the economy, as recorded in a letter to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" name="Chris Mullin">the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)</phrase> from the Minister. In other words, the Treasury believes that any loss of employment as a result of the closure of bingo clubs&mdash;because of double taxation&mdash;is automatically compensated for by job creation elsewhere. I am shocked by that assertion. Surely in these difficult economic times, we need to help our businesses. To assume that more jobs will be created is extremely naive.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.1/1">I would understand the Government's position if they continually had to provide a subsidy, but their policy on bingo is likely to undermine their revenue take. By maintaining excessive taxation on bingo, they are shutting bingo halls and thus losing the business. Either consciously or unconsciously, Government policy is closing an important sector. The sector does not have many voices speaking for them in government, because it provides services to the working people of this country, and those people are generally not heard by the Government. The Government have decided to go in hard against an essentially harmless form of gambling that is predominantly enjoyed by the working classes. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is a relatively small sum of money, and it is counterproductive for the Government to maintain dual taxation.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/2">Finally, I thank my Liberal Democrat parliamentary colleagues for trying to amend last year's Finance Bill and calling for a review of bingo tax. Unfortunately, that was not forthcoming. I hope that the Minister now recognises the political support and valuable contribution that bingo makes to communities across the country. I look forward to her response. I hope that she realises the great support for the bingo industry on both sides of the House, and that she will impress on her ministerial colleagues and the Prime Minister the valuable commodity we have in bingo, both socially and financially. I thank Mr. Speaker again for allowing me the opportunity to speak on a subject that is important to many of our constituents. It should be remembered that 200 Members of Parliament have bingo clubs in their constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.0/1">The point of using taxation as a fiscal stimulus is an important one, especially at this time. The Chancellor felt it worthwhile to cut VAT generally by 2.5 per cent., which costs about &pound;12 billion. Does the Minister agree that if it would boost the bingo industry&mdash;she might not be convinced that it would&mdash;it would be worth while cutting VAT on bingo? It would cost relatively little and help bingo clubs.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.0/1">I thank the Minister. Something along those lines would be a very good wary forward. In the meantime, it might be worthwhile for me to meet up with HMRC civil servants to check some of the figures and identify where the discrepancies lie.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.1/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise this issue today. Such a debate is timely not only because of the current situation but because of the information that I bring following the all-party group visit to Gaza last week.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/2">For the sake of clarity and the avoidance of doubt, let me explain the trip. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-15">15 February</phrase>, I was part of an all-party group that entered Gaza via the Erez crossing at the north-east of the strip. The attempt to enter began at 9 am and was eventually successful in the late afternoon. We left on the afternoon of <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-17">17 February</phrase>, having spent two nights in the area. I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase>, who led the delegation, and to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase>. I am sure that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase> would be here in the Chamber today if they could because we were all so profoundly shocked by the things that we saw.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/3">The trip was funded by the Welfare Association, which is a respected non-governmental organisation and charity that is in receipt of Government funds, including &pound;300,000 under the current emergency aid programme. It was efficiently organised by the Council for Arab-British Understanding. Our tours in Gaza were supervised by the Welfare Association or the UN. I want to be as clear as possible about the brief of the visit, which was exclusively humanitarian. We were there, in part, to see the aid projects that the British Government have funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/4">I am aware that my hon. Friend the Minister also made a visit to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-18">18 January</phrase>, on the day of the ceasefire, and that a substantial aid package of some &pound;27 million has been announced by the Government. I do not wish to assume a lack of knowledge by the Minister, but I hope that, at least in my preliminary comments, I can talk about the situation in Gaza from the point of view of an eye witness. I can also talk about the testimonies of eye witnesses to the bombardment of Gaza. Such testimonies may indicate the scale of the problems and the difficulties that present themselves to the delivery of aid. The first and most obvious of those is that it is still difficult to get in and out of Gaza, because of the border restrictions imposed by the Israelis, let alone to bring relief to a 1.5 million people.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/5">At the time of my hon. Friend's visit, it was the end of 23 days of the worst violence that has been seen in the Gaza strip since 1967. By conservative estimates, it left 1,285 people dead, 82 per cent. of whom were civilians. If one excludes police officers from that figure&mdash;and I do not see why we should&mdash;civilians accounted for 70 per cent. of that number, 22 per cent. of whom were children. Some 4,336 people were wounded in the attacks, 43 per cent. of whom were women and children. Most of those injuries were not minor. They were serious injuries that require, in some cases, amputations and long and complex medical treatment. That is leaving aside the trauma and the psychological effect that many have suffered as a result of living in a very confined position. Many people describe Gaza as &quot;the world's largest prison&quot;, and there was no route of escape during the intensive bombardment. About 2,500 homes were destroyed.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/6">We visited Beit Hanoun and Izbet Abd Rabo and saw for ourselves entire villages that had been destroyed. At Abd Rabo, 5,000 people had been made homeless in one village and 200 killed. The whole civil apparatus of Gazan society has been destroyed: 60 police stations, 30 mosques and 29 schools. More than 120 commercial buildings have been completely destroyed and 200 partially destroyed. I stood in the ruins of the Parliament building&mdash;the Legislative Council&mdash;and wondered what the purpose was of destroying Gaza's newly democratic institution. When we asked why such acts of wanton destruction had taken place, we always heard that it was for the Israelis to explain.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/7">We visited four hospitals, which had come under varying degrees of attack, at al-Quds, al-Wafa, al-Hilal and al-Awada. I do not wish to go into detail about the degree of criminality involved because it is perhaps not a matter for this debate, but it may be for another debate. None the less, it is important to bear in mind the enormity of the offences that have been committed by the Israeli defence force&mdash;or Israeli occupation force&mdash;during this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/8">According to the human rights organisations that we spoke to, including the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, which is a widely respected organisation, such actions may well amount not only to war crimes but to crimes against humanity and to ethnic cleansing. The organisations spoke about the targeting of civilians in their homes, the use of civilians as human shields, the killing of people in cold blood and the targeting of medical staff. I have already said that the overwhelming majority of people killed during the attack were civilian, and also that entire areas were razed to the ground. I raise such points, because they emphasise the difficulty that the Government will face when they have to deal with the Israeli authorities over the supply of humanitarian aid. Moreover, such points are relevant because although we have no new Government in Israel at the moment, we are anticipating a Government that is far to the right of the Government who led the invasion and who may, unfortunately, include racist and fascist elements.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-25a.136.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" speakername="Andrew Slaughter" colnum="136"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090225/halltext/90225h0011.htm#09022570000635">
	<p pid="a.136.1/1">My hon. Friend anticipates what I was about to say and the questions that I was going to pose for the Minister at the end of my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/2">The political context is inseparable from the humanitarian context in that sense. We were privileged when we reached the west bank to meet the Prime Minister, Salam Fayyed, and the chief of staff to President Abbas, Rafiq Husseini. The clear message from the Palestinian Authority is that it is difficult to negotiate with the Israelis at all at the moment, because of the Israeli attitude and the Authority's weakness and disorganisation. The Palestinians are concentrating on Palestinian unity, which is long overdue, and external aid, both material and in terms of pressure on the Israeli Government, to achieve what my hon. Friend suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/3">I shall give two examples of the problems with aid, although I do not imaging that my hon. Friend the Minister underestimates them. We visited is al-Wafa hospital. It is not an emergency hospital, but a hospital for elderly people and for rehabilitating people with long-term problems arising from strokes, comas and so on. It is an extremely impressive institution. Two new blocks costing $5 million had just been built&mdash;one by the Welfare Association and one by the Kuwaiti Government&mdash;and were due to open on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-01">1 January</phrase>. However, they were shelled almost into destruction. Certainly, they will need $2 million or $3 million to renew the buildings. Part of the hospital was funded by the Department for International Development. The gardens around the hospital, which were well laid out as part of the rehabilitation features, were paid for by DFID&mdash;there is a plaque proudly displayed on the wall to that effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/4">We were in the surreal position of being shown around the gardens by local people, who pointed out where white phosphorous had landed and burnt into the ground. They showed us lumps of it. Four weeks after they landed on the hospital, those lumps were still smoking, and they would still burst into flames when poked or prodded. The Government ought to take up with the Israeli authorities the arrogance and disregard shown in that action.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/5">We also visited the United Nations Relief and Works Agency warehouses in the centre of Gaza city. As was well documented, the warehouses were bombed by the Israelis, who must have known from their global positioning system co-ordinates exactly where they were. Phosphorous bombs and heavy ordnance&mdash;fortunately, in one case, the ordnance did not explode&mdash;were landing next to fuel tankers that were there to supply fuel to the people of Gaza. The fact that the Israeli defence force and the Israeli Government are prepared to do that says more about the scale of the task we face in dealing with them than I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.1/6">As my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea said, the problem of access is not new&mdash;it does not date from <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-27">27 December</phrase>, but at least from the election of the Hamas Government. The response to years of telling the Palestinians that they had to adopt democratic standards seems to be to bomb their Parliament building. There have been two years of an almost complete blockade in which, ironically, the only way that Gaza continued to function, if it did at all, was through the tunnels under the Egyptian border. The tunnels are now not only being bombed, but policed by the Royal Navy to ensure that materials do not get through. Of course, the policing is designed to stop arms supplies, and that is a necessary pre-requisite to peace, but disarming both sides, too, is a pre-requisite to peace. However, that puts the cart before the horse, which is an apposite analogy, given that a lot of the transport in Gaza is horse and cart because of the lack of fuel&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.139.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" name="Andrew Slaughter">the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter)</phrase> and thank him for bringing us together to debate UK aid to Gaza, and for his extremely valuable insights on the humanitarian situation there, following his recent visit along with our hon. Friends. I enjoy reading his blog and the Gaza diary on his website, which gave an accurate reflection of his visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/2">I welcome the other colleagues who were also present at the last Westminster Hall debate on aid to Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories, which took place in January. I pay tribute to their commitment and dedication to the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/3">I am pleased to have the opportunity to update the House on this important subject and on the events that have taken place since that debate. As my hon. Friend so graphically described, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains extremely grave. Some 1.4 million people&mdash;that is, nearly the entire population&mdash;still depend on some form of humanitarian aid. Scheduled power cuts of six to eight hours occur in most of Gaza every few days, and unscheduled power cuts continue. Some 50,000 people are without running water, and a further 100,000 receive running water in their homes only every seven to 10 days. About 21,000 homes were destroyed or badly damaged during the conflict. The United Kingdom focuses on alleviating suffering and helping to rebuild the lives of those devastated by the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/4">As hon. Members will be aware, the UK has pledged nearly &pound;27 million for the relief effort in Gaza. Of that, we have spent more than &pound;15 million. When I last spoke to the House on the issue, I explained how the UK was rapidly spending the money that it had pledged, including funding for the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organisations, which are providing food, shelter, safe drinking water and medical treatment, as well as providing for the clearance of unexploded ordnance.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/5">Since that debate, new commitments have included almost &pound;1 million to Mercy Corps to provide shelter and emotional support to children and young people traumatised by the conflict; more than &pound;660,000 to Islamic Relief for psychosocial support, house repair and emergency school rehabilitation; more than &pound;420,000 to Handicap International to provide emergency medical care for 21,000 extremely vulnerable people; &pound;340,000 to UNICEF to co-ordinate the effective provision of emergency water and sanitation; and &pound;15 million to the World Food Programme for distribution of food vouchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/6">I am pleased to report that the money provided by the UK is having an impact on the ground. For example, our funding to Oxfam has helped to provide tens of thousands of ordinary people in Gaza with essentials. Every day, Oxfam water tankers distribute drinking water to as many as 60,000 people in the worst affected parts of north Gaza, and since the end of January, Oxfam has provided hygiene kits to 2,100 families.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/7">Our funding has helped Handicap International to open three new support centres in Gaza where people with injuries and disabilities can go for treatment. Handicap International has also provided four hospitals with 71 pieces of equipment&mdash;including wheelchairs, crutches and walking frames&mdash;to help those with injuries. The contribution of the Department for International Development to the Mines Advisory Group has helped it to clear unexploded ordnance from all United Nations Relief and Works Agency schools, allowing 220,000 children to return to school.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/8">Those are only a few examples of the difference that UK aid is making to the lives of ordinary Gazans. None the less, there are still many more people to reach. If humanitarian workers do not have adequate relief items, safety and access to those whom they need to reach, they cannot do their job. The issue of access was raised in the previous debate and by my hon. Friend in this debate. I remind the House that it was a problem long before the current crisis. It is imperative that action be taken. The borders must be opened. We need to find a solution urgently so that Palestinians living in Gaza can get the help that they need in a way that also addresses Israel's security concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/9">Access for people and humanitarian supplies must be increased to meet the genuine humanitarian needs of the people in Gaza. The UN has said that only 20 to 25 types of relief item are getting into Gaza, out of 4,000 different items needed. Items turned away include school textbooks, dates, plastic bags used by the UN to distribute food aid and even equipment used to store medical vaccines. In addition, the UN estimates that 450,000 litres of fuel are needed daily to operate the Gaza power plant at full capacity. The Israeli Supreme Court has ruled the daily humanitarian minimum to be 314,000 litres, yet since the ceasefire, only about 260,000 litres have entered Gaza, resulting in continuing scheduled and unscheduled power cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/10">Access for humanitarian personnel is also problematic, as my hon. Friend has highlighted in his comments and on his blog, although there is some anecdotal evidence that the situation is improving. However, since the cessation of hostilities, the Israeli authorities have allowed only limited numbers of international aid workers into Gaza. Of 178 requests to enter Gaza submitted by international NGO staff members in January, only 18 staff members were allowed in by the end of the month.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/11">We are continuing to press at the highest levels for increased access. During my visit to the region last month, I spoke with Isaac Herzog, the Israeli Minister responsible for co-ordinating the relief effort, and pressed for increased access. That led to a public Israeli commitment to facilitate access for 500 aid trucks a day in the near future. The Foreign Secretary has also discussed access with Israeli Foreign Minister Livni, and our Prime Minister has written to the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, on the same matter. We are in regular discussions with our partners in the US and UN on how access can be improved. It will be vital to see progress on the issue before the international conference on Gaza reconstruction takes place next week in Sharm el-Sheikh.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/12">To address my hon. Friend's point about tunnels and access, we have made it clear to Israel that closing the tunnels without opening the crossings will do nothing to help Israel's security concerns about arms smuggling through the tunnel regions. We have also made it clear that the opening of the Karni crossing point, with its conveyor facility, is vital to allowing wheat flour across in sufficient volumes to meet the staple food requirements of the people in Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/13">How we take forward the reconstruction of Gaza is critical. Fully rebuilding Gaza will take time, money and commitment from everyone involved. It will also take courage on the part of the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships. The first stage of the process is early recovery, which includes rehabilitating water supplies and sewage facilities, repairing and reopening schools, and moving people from tents to permanent housing. The Palestinian Authority estimates that that will cost $1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/14">The international conference that I mentioned will be a first and welcome chance for donors to discuss the opportunities and challenges for an early recovery programme and, importantly, to make their pledges. In the longer term, full reconstruction will be needed. The World Bank, the European Community and the UN will take the lead on a full needs assessment in Gaza, working closely with the Palestinian Authority. Donors will need to provide funding. We would, of course, welcome an Israeli contribution to reconstruction in Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.0/15">On the breach of international humanitarian law, I remind my hon. Friend that the UN Human Rights Council, in its resolution of <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-12">12 January</phrase>, decided to send an international fact-finding mission to investigate violations of human rights law and international humanitarian law by Israel in Gaza. We will consider the results carefully&mdash;</p>
