<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.75.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" speakername="Glenda Jackson" colnum="75"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h01.htm#50615h01_spnew0">
	<p pid=".75.3/1">I am grateful to have been afforded the opportunity to debate a matter of crisis proportions in London: the lack of affordable housing and, most markedly, the lack of affordable housing within the rented sector. Such a pan-London problem is borne out by the number of colleagues who are present this morning&mdash;despite the intemperate weather&mdash;hoping to catch your eye, Mr. Cummings. The problem is further borne out by the amount of unsolicited briefings that I and colleagues received from several organisations at almost the same time that the debate was publicly announced.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/2">I now come to what are sometimes boring statistics, for which I am grateful, in particular to Shelter. The key facts are that, in London at the end of last year, 61,670 statutorily homeless households were trapped in temporary accommodation. The average wait in temporary accommodation has shifted from the average 91 days that families experienced in 1997 to 391 days. In 2003&ndash;04, 31,530 households were accepted as homeless and in priority need, including almost 30,000 children and 3,900 expectant mothers; 279,730 households were registered on council housing waiting lists; 174,200 households, including 261,000 children, were in overcrowded homes.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/3">Those are stark facts, but before I draw attention to more facts, I wish to say that Shelter, the London Housing Federation and the Greater London authority paid unstinting tribute in their briefings to what the Government have done already and are in the process of doing to deal with the serious housing crisis in London. They paid tribute to the additional funding from central Government, to the five-year strategy of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and to the innovative use of land, which is surplus to the needs of the Ministry of Defence and the national health service, to be used for building. The organisations paid tribute to the plans that have facilitated key workers to get on to the housing ladder. However, my argument is not aimed at the situation of those who are desperate to get on to the housing ladder by virtue of being able to buy, but at the thousands of people who will never be able to buy property and who are still excluded from decent housing because of the lack of housing with affordable rents.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/4">I wish to draw attention to what is happening in my borough of Camden, as set out in the briefing forwarded to me by the London Housing Federation. The cost of an average home is more than &pound;388,000. The average gross income for a full-time employee in the borough is just more than &pound;34,000. In the private rented sector, an average weekly rent for a one-bedroom property is more than &pound;215. The rent for a three-bedroom house is more than &pound;356 and the average net weekly income for someone working in the borough is just more than &pound;472. I hope that these statistics kill the canard that still has certain popularity among the tabloid press that the only people who live in my constituency are multimillionaires.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/5">Two other issues that were raised in all the briefings that I am sure all right hon. and hon. Members received are the shortage of affordable rented housing and, as Shelter puts it, the Dickensian approach to what constitutes overcrowding. I am sure that we all regularly receive complaints about overcrowding at our advice surgeries. We all welcome what the Government have done in reconsidering what constitutes overcrowding, but it will be of little benefit to any housing authority to be able to afford more points for overcrowding in its necessary definition of who has priority need if, as in my borough, it has virtually no three or four-bedroom houses.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/6">I shall not go into the argument about whether the right to buy was right or wrong. That is water under the bridge and there have been changes to the right to buy, which I welcome, but we are failing to build a sufficient number of houses in London. We are not meeting the recommendation on the number of houses in the Barker report&mdash;a report that all those who submitted briefings to me welcomed. Even if we do manage to meet the target of 50 per cent. of all properties being affordable, there is still an imbalance, with those affordable properties being apportioned to people who can afford only to rent. The ratio should be 70:30. In some instances, the relevant figure is only 6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/7">As well as examination of what constitutes overcrowding, there must be a shift to ensure that in the new build coming along, there are more houses that can accommodate larger families. We all read of middle-class families in which parents are still burdened with their grown-up children because they cannot afford to get on the housing ladder. I sometimes find such cases surprising. A case was recounted to me in which the grown-up child works in the City. I did not think that anyone working in the City could not afford to get on the housing ladder, but it just shows that the longer we live, the more we learn.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/8">It is accepted that middle-class families should not have to endure such situations, yet if we move further down the socio-economic scale, society is expected to accept or endure large families having very low mean incomes. That is unacceptable, which is why I am attempting to reinforce my argument to the Government that we must examine the possibility of building more houses for larger families. Pray God we never return to the Dickensian days when there were families of 13, 14 and 15 and child deaths were almost accepted as the norm under the age of three, but we must begin to acknowledge the changes taking place in society and, most markedly and most particularly, in London. Everyone knows that no Government have a bottomless purse, but I am arguing that the Government should re-examine the amount of money that they apportion to new house build in London. I am not a mathematician, financier or accountant, but one possible way of making the case for more funding for London is by asking the Government to consider, using accepted accountability criteria, the cost to London and our society of the inadequate housing that is inflicted on families.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/9">The figures on children in temporary accommodation are particularly shocking. One knows from first-hand experience from one's constituency of children who are not in secure accommodation and who may be moved throughout London in some instances. They may spend 391 days in temporary accommodation, which sounds a long time to me, and that can happen more than once. There will be clearly be an impact on that child's education and sense of security, and the capacity of the family to create the elements of the secure environment that we are all told are the basic building blocks of a healthy functioning society will be entirely eroded. There are clear implications for the further breakdown of families, in some ways one of the constituent factors in the need for further housing in London.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/10">Also, the employment capacity of such families is reduced. If we could equate that to pounds, shillings and pence on the balance sheet, perhaps that would strengthen the argument that London should have more money to build more houses, most markedly houses earmarked for affordable rents. I know that hon. Members who do not represent London seats take umbrage at the argument that London should be a primary cause for concern, but we are told that London is the engine room of the national economy. I see no reason to discount that. For every job created in the City of London, two are created in the hinterland of the United Kingdom. We have to maintain our primacy, not only as one of the great capital cities of the world, but also as one of the great financial centres of the world, one of the great centres for service industries. We are a benchmark for inward investment in many ways, as far as the wider European Union is concerned. However, although I am happy to put forward that argument, that is not, essentially, the argument that I am advancing today.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/11">I began by pointing out the number of extremely helpful briefings that had been furnished to me and, I am sure, to all hon. Members. Of course, the most potent and powerful briefings submitted to me come from the direct experience of my constituents. I will give two recent examples.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/12">First, a single-parent family with four children live in a two-bedroom flat, where a 12-year-old brother and a nine-year-old sister have to share the same bedroom and the mother has to share her sleeping accommodation with a three-year-old child and a nine-and-a-half-month-old baby. Do not ask me where dad is. We can all imagine what has happened there. Going back to my point, severe overcrowding&mdash;a lack of affordable rented accommodation&mdash;can be a constituent part in the breakdown of families, with the implications that no one in this Room needs me to detail.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/13">Another situation that came to me only two weeks ago was where an attempted suicide had been occasioned because of overcrowding. These are real, genuine, human tragedies, and we can do something about them. Again, I would argue that it must be a primary concern for our Government. They have done so much to examine how the services that government is justifiably expected to provide to our citizens can be delivered in an infinitely more joined-up manner. We are quite rightly pouring so much money into Sure Start, which is attempting to incorporate what local authorities provide&mdash;have to provide&mdash;in services to children. Yet I find it bizarre that we still have a huge, gaping hole that will negate all that excellent work, simply by impacting upon those children's ability to learn, to make friends and to participate in a society by virtue of not being in permanent, decent, affordable accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/14">As I said, all the briefings that I have received are mindful of the immensely good work that the Government have already done in this area, but they are equally detailed in pointing out that there is a great deal more that has to be done.From my own constituency I see that the issue has a wider impact than on just the immediate family. I am sure that we all have direct experience of serious neighbourhood disputes and of neighbours from hell, which stem quite simply from severe overcrowding. As in a case that came to me quite recently, a mother finds it virtually impossible to maintain a level of quietude in her overcrowded flat that does not impact upon her elderly neighbour. Her children&mdash;some at school, some at pre-school&mdash;have no garden in which to play. They live in a tower block where the lift does not always function, and it is virtually impossible to prevent those children from making a noise.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/15">It may seem that much of what I have used for my contribution this morning is critical of local authorities, but I would not wish that interpretation to be made. I have immense admiration for what Camden has done and is doing in attempting to provide affordable housing for its council tax payers. It is innovative, and its housing benefit department has two charter marks for the excellence of its service. It was at the forefront of the local authorities that joined the scheme whereby someone who lives in Camden can be moved to another part of the country if they so wish. Again, I pay tribute to the Government, who are, I understand, examining the scheme so that if a family want to take the opportunity of moving out of London, they can get more detailed information on matters such as the job opportunities and educational facilities that are available to them.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/16">I pay tribute to what my local authority has done, but I must say that my borough is not one in which any land will be available for building. We have serious problems even with repairs and refurbishment. There could be an argument&mdash;although I will not take time today on it&mdash;for re-examining the possibility of a pan-London scheme for lettings and, most markedly, for renting.</p>
	<p pid=".75.3/17">I am on record as saying that any Member who cannot say what they have to say within 10 minutes should not get to their feet. I see that I have broken my own rule, so I draw my remarks to a conclusion by once again saying how grateful I am for the opportunity of raising what is a problem of truly crisis proportions in London. It has its most marked impact on some of our most vulnerable people, for example children.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.78.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1571" speakername="Clive Efford" colnum="78"  time="09:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h01.htm#50615h01_spnew1">
	<p pid=".78.0/1">First, I congratulate you, Mr. Cummings; this is the first meeting that I have attended with you in the Chair. I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. This is my first opportunity to do that, and I am pleased to see him in that position, particularly in today's debate, as I know that he will have a lot of relevant experience from his constituency just across the water from my borough. I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase> on her success in securing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the debate. I know that my hon. Friends the Members for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> and for Edmonton (Mr. Love) have been applying for a similar debate, and we are pleased to have this opportunity.</p>
	<p pid=".78.0/2">During the last general election the issue of housing was, remarkably, overlooked. There is a great deal that the Government have done and not received enough credit for. For example, delivering on the decent homes initiative, which will improve the quality of life of millions when it is finally completed, was long overdue and is very welcome. The Government have made it clear that they also want to tackle the problem of social and affordable housing, but I believe that one area is being left behind: the affordable rented sector, particularly in council housing.</p>
	<p pid=".78.0/3">I am sure that I am no different from any other Member in that every week my surgeries are full of young people with young children who are living at home with their parents. They are looking for the start in family life that their parents were given by their local authority, which provided decent quality housing where they could bring up their family. Young people today are denied that opportunity because of the shortage of affordable rented accommodation. This year, 12,200 people have sought housing from my local authority. More than 4,500 of those are council tenants seeking a move, and just over 7,500 are seeking to become council tenants.</p>
	<p pid=".78.0/4">Comparing the figures for 1999 and this year for the number of people applying on the grounds of being homeless tells the story of how we are not addressing the core problem of housing need. This year, 3,332 people applied on the grounds of being homeless. In 1999, that figure was 3,700&mdash;a very similar figure. The accepted figures were 1,305 this year and 1,302 in 1999. Yet this year 970 people were still waiting to be housed, whereas in 1999 there were 599. The problem is supply rather than a growth in numbers. There is no dramatic growth in numbers exacerbating the problem. The people that I see in surgeries cannot afford to buy a property, even through the schemes that the Government have come up with. We need to address that problem in our future housing policy.</p>
	<p pid=".78.0/5">Throughout the country, 280,000 people are waiting for affordable housing and 61,000 are in temporary accommodation. Since 1979, 244,000 homes have been sold under the right to buy. Figures from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on the supply of homes over a similar period tell a sorry tale. For example, in 1979, 16,200 properties were built by tenure for registered social landlords or housing associations, and nearly 75,000 for local authorities. Since 1979, the local authority figure has gradually fallen, and it has tumbled since the mid-1980s. At the time of the election in 1983, local authorities were building nearly 30,000 properties and registered social landlords were building 14,000. That trend continued up to last year, when only 131 local authority properties were built. However, remarkably, the number of registered social landlord or housing association properties was almost exactly the same as in 1979.</p>
	<p pid=".78.0/6">There is a serious shortage in the supply of affordable rented accommodation. I have figures supplied by the ODPM for the starts and builds for local authorities and housing associations in London over the past two years. One column of figures shows the number of properties started and the other shows the number completed. With the exceptions of Hillingdon and Wandsworth, which somehow managed to build six properties each, the columns are filled with noughts&mdash;apart from those exceptions, local authorities started to build no new homes.</p>
	<p pid=".78.0/7">In the area covered by me and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase>, Kidbrooke is being regenerated. That is very welcome and will improve the quality of properties in that area enormously. About 2,000 properties are covered by the regeneration, and completion of the regeneration will create 4,400 properties. Of those 2,000 council properties, there are about 200 leaseholders, so there are roughly 1,800 council rented properties. When the scheme is complete there will be 1,900 affordable properties. However, that figure includes part own-part buy, assisted ownership and all forms of affordable housing, including the rented sector. There has been a significant net reduction in the availability of affordable rented accommodation as a part of the regeneration programme. Much as I welcome the regeneration of the area, I think that that is a problem.</p>
	<p pid=".78.0/8">There is also the question of the number of bedrooms. What types of property will there be in the rented sector? How large will they be, and will they be targeted at local need? Those issues have not yet been addressed. I do not oppose the regeneration programme&mdash;I welcome it very much&mdash;but let me stress that future programmes must address the issues of affordability and the availability of rented accommodation. The net reduction must not continue while there is clearly a problem for people who are trying to access affordable rented accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".78.0/9">In our manifesto, we said that we would allow local authorities to build council properties. I do not suggest that we should just say to local authorities, &quot;Build council houses again and that will solve all the problems.&quot; We could have another debate about the problems of large council estates. However, we need to think of ways in which we can assist local authorities, possibly in partnership with the private sector or with housing associations, to release their capital assets and to turn them into buildings. For example, a large part of the Kidbrooke regeneration area is local authority land. Some of it has been handed over to English Partnerships as a managing agent. It is not impossible for us to allow a registered social landlord to manage the building element of that regeneration programme, to sell homes to the private sector and take the capital receipts, to sell affordable homes at discounted rates under all the schemes that the Government have promoted, and to use the capital to reinvest in social housing.</p>
	<p pid=".78.0/10">At the moment, because of the shortage of resources, when we want to develop a piece of local authority land we sell it to the private sector and then, under section 106, try to negotiate back a proportion of affordable housing. However, the amount of affordable housing for rent is minimal, and we end up with small pockets of poorly managed housing association property. Their managers might look after the fabric of the buildings, but there are other issues about the social realm&mdash;the area outside the properties. I am sure that we all have such pockets&mdash;housing association developments that have been poked in at the end of a development and which are a problem. They are not properly managed or overseen because they are at arm's length from the local authority. That problem has been created by our current housing policy.</p>
	<p pid=".78.0/11">We need to think of local authorities as a vehicle for regeneration, and as a means of providing more rented accommodation. We can provide the resources if we are creative in the way in which we use the assets that we already hold in order to make provision for investment. I welcome what the Government are attempting to do in respect of affordable housing, but I fear that we are not getting it right with regard to affordable rented accommodation and social housing. Local authorities can play a major part in addressing that problem.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.81.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="81"  time="09:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h01.htm#50615h01_spnew2">
	<p pid=".81.0/1">I will not go over the ground that colleagues have covered, but I should like to set the scene for my constituency, where there are three key issues in respect of housing. One of them is improvements to council housing stock, which have made a great jump since this Government came to power in 1997. May I flag up for the Minister the transfer of the Haggerston West and Kingsland estate, details of which are possibly on his desk at the moment? I shall lobby him about that separately.</p>
	<p pid=".81.0/2">There is a shortage of affordable rented accommodation in Hackney, and a great need for intermediate housing. However, today I shall focus on the shortage of rented accommodation, and how that is leading to severe overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid=".81.0/3">It is worth emphasising, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase>, that many people have a stereotypical image of Hackney; it may be the opposite of their view of Hampstead and Highgate. Nestling among the council estates of Hackney are properties worth &pound;1 million that are well out of the reach of people living there. We talk a lot about stock and transfer, and the formulas of the Housing Corporation, but the human side is that many of those who work hard to keep their families together and who contribute to London's economy live in severely overcrowded housing and are unable to move, cannot think of purchasing a house and cannot be transferred to other properties.</p>
	<p pid=".81.0/4">Only this week, a woman came to my surgery who had had to wait seven years to be housed in her present property but who now needs an extra bedroom. That is one of the concerns that I wanted to raise today. Housing associations and registered social landlords are still building properties that are too small. There are too many one and two-bedroom units and not enough three or four-bedroom units.</p>
	<p pid=".81.0/5">Hackney is the third most severely overcrowded area in the country. It is important to tackle the problem. As many as 9.1 per cent. of homes in Hackney are overcrowded&mdash;8,000 households. The vast majority are in social housing, 12.3 per cent. are in registered social landlord properties, and nearly 5 per cent. of that overcrowding is severe.</p>
	<p pid=".81.0/6">I shall not rehearse the arguments outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate on the impact of overcrowding on family life. All hon. Members know of it. However, I raise directly with the Minister the matter of the efficiency of Housing Corporation funding, which is based on the cost per home rather than on the number of people living in those homes. I am delighted to see the changes made to the bidding round of 2006&ndash;08, but I would like the Minister to look further into the matter, in order to encourage RSLs to build larger family housing. Perversely, under the current rules, they have no incentive to do so, which causes severe problems in my constituency. The London housing strategy must reflect that fact.</p>
	<p pid=".81.0/7">We need to increase the supply of large homes with more than three bedrooms. In my constituency, three bedrooms are not always enough. Surveys show a great need for larger houses in London; 40 per cent. of new social housing should have four or more bedrooms, but only 6 per cent. of housing built in the past 10 years has that. I rest my argument there, and I hope that the Minister will respond fully to those points.</p>

	<p pid=".82.0/1">Before I call the next speaker, I should tell the House that I intend to start winding up at 10.30 am. If hon. Members bear that in mind, I am sure that all who wish to will get to speak.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.82.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" speakername="Sadiq Khan" colnum="82"  time="10:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h01.htm#50615h01_spnew4">
	<p pid=".82.1/1">I am conscious of the 10-minute dictum mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase>; as she is sitting next to me, Mr. Cummings, I am keen not to fall foul of it. . Instead, I shall speak of my experience as a councillor in the London borough of Wandsworth over the past 11 years.</p>
	<p pid=".82.1/2">Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate, I am critical of my local authority. Wandsworth has been a Conservative borough since 1978; it immediately starting flogging the council housing stock, and it has not stopped since. No new council housing has been built since then, and registered social landlords have been given little encouragement to build. At the same time, the council has a specific planning policy of not asking developers to provide affordable housing, and the laissez-faire policy of the planning department has perversely meant that luxury developments are being built in Tooting despite the chronic need for affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid=".82.1/3">Two years ago, we fortunately managed to persuade the public inspector to change the council's unitary development plan, so it now includes a requirement to provide 25 per cent. of affordable housing on developments of 15 units and above. The problem is that the units being provided for affordable housing are studio flats, not family homes. Developers have got around the UDP by building studio flats that still meet the definition of 15 per cent. but are not suitable for local housing.</p>
	<p pid=".82.1/4">During my 11 years as a councillor, during the election campaign and in the six weeks since becoming a Member of Parliament, I have come across a number of problems. First there is the problem of three generations of a family living in one household, including teenage brothers and sisters who have to share a bedroom not only with each other but with parents and sometimes grandparents.</p>
	<p pid=".82.1/5">Secondly, some nurses at St. George's hospital, Tooting, and some teachers at local schools live many miles away, have to travel long distances to work and query what commitment they can give to their local public services. Historically, nurses lived locally to their hospitals and were committed to them; the same went for teachers and their schools.</p>
	<p pid=".82.1/6">Thirdly, waiting lists continue to get longer and longer and they do not reflect the true position. Residents have given up hope of registering with the local council because, as was mentioned, the points system is defective. They are also well aware that even if they were on the waiting list, there would be no realistic prospect of being rehoused in the imminent future.</p>
	<p pid=".82.1/7">Fourthly, there are residents in their 20s, 30s and 40s living in private rented accommodation who know that they might move on in six or 12 months' time, at the end of their assured shorthold tenancies. They have no community ties or loyalties to the area. I query what commitment their children can have to their local areas, given that they could be moved from their primary schools in the next six to 12 months.</p>
	<p pid=".82.1/8">I have already talked about the luxury developments being built; unfortunately, the Mayor's power to stop those is limited. Recently, I have seen examples of tenants in private rented accommodation being charged astronomical rents. They need housing benefit to pay them; they have no prospect of getting employment with sufficient pay to cover that rent, to which they have been directed by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid=".82.1/9">Our sixth concern is the lack of a definition of affordable housing. Local authorities such as Wandsworth, which are not given proper advice about how to provide affordable housing, have a huge amount of wiggle room, which has led to their not meeting the needs of local residents. I agree with the Government's view, set out in the manifesto and elsewhere, that many people have aspirations to be owner-occupiers, but many people in London and elsewhere also need rented property. I genuinely and sincerely believe that the affordable-housing crisis is a powder keg ready to explode at any time in the imminent future.</p>
	<p pid=".82.1/10">What needs to be done? First, we need a definition of affordable housing with a particular focus on rent, not only owner-occupation. Secondly, we need to ensure that any percentage requirements for new builds in local authorities' unitary development plans include family sized houses. There also needs to be a review of the private rented sector and its relationship with housing benefit and the so-called benefit trap.</p>
	<p pid=".82.1/11">Clearly, even more new housing needs to be built in London. Consideration needs to be given to the hidden homes initiative; the six hidden homes in Wandsworth mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1571" name="Clive Efford">my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford)</phrase> were, frankly, garages in council estates that had been turned back into accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".82.1/12">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate for raising this matter and am grateful for the time that we have been given to discuss this important London issue.</p>

	<p pid=".84.0/1">I recognise that there is a shortage of time, so I shall be brief. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase> on securing this debate and I welcome the Minister to his new post. Even I can use the parlance of new Labour: I invite him to take a step change on housing policy in London.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/2">I recognise that the Government have put enormous amounts of money into improving existing stock in council estates. That is very welcome, and I welcome the new roofs, windows, lifts and other things in estates in my constituency every time I see them. It would be nice if the Liberal Democrat-controlled council in Islington recognised that all that money has come from a Labour Government. It has not come from the sky, which the Liberal Democrats seem to love so much.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/3">In London, however, there is a terrible housing shortage. Whatever aspirations my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has that 70 per cent. of the population should own their homes, that will not happen in London and cannot unless we continue the policy that simply exports the poor out of London because there is no affordable rented accommodation where they can live. I hope that the Minister will turn his attention towards persuading local authorities to use the very large amounts of money that they receive from central Government to continue the improvements, but also to invest in new buildings for rental by local authorities and to continue putting money into housing associations so that they can increase their number of properties.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/4">The cost of not investing is enormous in a social sense. All London Members present hold regular advice bureaux. We go through the pain with the families of teenage boys and girls having to share a room. They have nowhere to do their homework, be at home, socialise or invite friends round. They feel like second-class citizens. Their middle-class friends go to each other's houses for weekend sleepovers, parties and all the rest of it. The teenagers in council houses cannot do that because there is no space. It builds up a series of experiences that leads them to feel inferior and they are then forced to spend their time socialising on the street. Someone then suggests that they should not be allowed to wear hoods on the street and so on and so on. We end up with a process of social isolation and social deprivation that we are responsible for because we are not investing the money necessary to ensure that everyone has somewhere decent to live.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/5">All this costs money, but I invite the Minister to examine carefully the current London figures. The number of people on housing registers in London is 279,729. In my borough, nearly 7,000 people are on the housing waiting list, and it is not easy to get on it. People do not just walk into the office and give their name; they must prove a degree of need in order to be on the list. For the last year for which statistics are available, the number of new properties completed was a tiny proportion of what is needed. The number of new lettings across London last year was a small proportion of the total; 51,000 new lettings were achieved but that includes lettings to people who are on the transfer list as well within the local authority. I ask the Government to think seriously about these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/6">The sale of council property was promoted by the Conservatives in the late 1970s when thousands of new council homes were being built each year. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> and I were both in Haringey at that time. I think that in 1979, Haringey's Labour-controlled council built 1,000 new properties. We could see a real improvement. The argument for the right to buy was strong and politically powerful. The right to buy is now rampant and local authorities cannot keep pace with it. The result of right to buy is not that the houses stay in the local authority's orbit or indeed necessarily in that of people in social housing need, but that they become investment opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/7">I will give an example of a former local authority flat. I picked up the information from an estate agent last week. It is a three-bedroom, purpose-built, local-authority, second-floor flat that is currently fully let to a housing association. The vendor informs us that he receives &pound;1,380 a calendar month. The property is on sale for &pound;240,000. I suspect that he managed to buy it for much less than half that price and that it is bringing in probably three times the rent level that was achieved by the local authority. Who has benefited from that, other than people who have managed to loan some money, probably at a high rate of interest? We are just creating a management problem on the estates and a greedy atmosphere. We are not solving the housing problem that goes with it.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/8">I want to ensure that as many of my colleagues as possible get a chance to say something but I want to make a final point. I ask the Minister to examine closely the definition of &quot;affordable&quot; as used by local authority planning departments when they approve planning applications. Tomorrow evening there will be a large public meeting in my constituency concerning the proposed housing development on the Arsenal stadium site. Arsenal football club is moving to a new, expensive stadium and its existing stadium will be turned into a housing area. Unfortunately, it will become a gated community and what is now the pitch will not be accessible to the public. The tiny number of social housing units will be deemed affordable&mdash;but by whom? I suspect that those who can get a fairly well-paid job and be defined as a key worker might manage to get on to the property ladder by getting a part-purchase of a property, but for those in desperate housing need this will be an entirely closed book. We should get away from a definition of &quot;affordable&quot; that includes both part rent and part purchase; instead, we should insist on renting at local authority rent levels from either a local authority or a housing association, and follow the Mayor of London's strategy that 50 per cent. of all new developments should be for those in desperate housing and social need.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/9">We must deal with this problem, otherwise London will become a more divided city; the poor will be exported out of London, and social isolation and deprivation will increase.</p>

	<p pid=".86.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase> on securing this debate, and I join with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> in welcoming the Minister to his new position.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/2">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1571" name="Clive Efford">my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford)</phrase>, I was disappointed that housing did not play a more prominent role in the general election, but it is important to remember that housing is a much more important issue in the Greater London context than it is nationally; if we do not understand that, we do not understand why this debate is taking place.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/3">I shall make two brief points. First, I welcome the Government's overall objective to halve the number of people in temporary accommodation, and I hope that they succeed. However, I suggest that the priority in achieving that must be an increase in socially rented accommodation that is greater than currently planned.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/4">Other hon. Members have congratulated the Government, so let me join them by applauding the recent announcement of an 18 per cent. reduction in temporary accommodation or homelessness acceptances. That is to be welcomed, but we must not forget that there are still more than 100,000 people in temporary accommodation in our country, and that that figure for London has increased from about 25,000 in 1997 to more than 61,000 last year.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/5">I am pleased, however, that the Government have a strategy to reduce the number of people in temporary accommodation, and several of their measures are achieving some success. There is a need for advice and support to be given to people who are threatened with homelessness, and the provision of that is having an impact. There are also measures to prevent homelessness, such as taking action on rent deposits and helping to ensure that marriage breakdown does not cause homelessness; they are having some success, too. There is also talk of using our existing housing stock more effectively. Although I accept that we can always do better, only limited steps can be taken in that regard to assist in reducing homelessness numbers.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/6">The key issue that we need to confront in relation to the strategy that the Government want to introduce to reduce the numbers in temporary accommodation is achieving a greater volume of socially rented property in London. That is crucial. The strategy suggests a figure of 10,000 units by 2007&ndash;08, and that is what the Government are projecting in their current spending review. However, there are several reasons why that figure might not be achieved. Land costs and construction costs in London have gone through the roof, especially in the past couple of years; it is now more expensive to build new accommodation, and we must include that factor in our calculations. There has also been a shift in priorities in the overall mix of accommodation that the Government are currently planning, from socially rented accommodation to low-cost home ownership initiatives. In the Greater London context, it is essential to maintain key workers, but we must be concerned about this matter. In 1997, about 20 per cent. of overall new accommodation was for low-cost home ownership. It is now 40 per cent., which reduces the number of new rented units that will be built.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/7">My major concern is the difference in the number of units that are coming forward compared to what the Government are planning. For example, the Barker report which was produced last year&mdash;commissioned by the Treasury and accepted by it and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;suggests much higher figures of affordable rented accommodation than are currently planned. The Mayor of London's London Plan suggests that 10,500 socially rented units should be built. Yet in 2003&ndash;2004, only 5,000 units were actually completed. The London Housing Board's proposals for the future suggest that there will be about 7,000, a figure that is well short of the London Plan proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/8">If I go even further into some of the independent research commissioned by various housing bodies, Shelter is projecting a build of less than half of the real need in Greater London. We need again carefully to examine what we are proposing for socially rented accommodation. If we continue to build only the 7,000 or so projected units, it seems difficult to predict that we will halve the numbers of those in temporary accommodation by 2010. We all know the impact that that will have in our constituencies. Almost 50 per cent. of the cases that come before my surgery are housing related issues&mdash;almost all to do with finding affordable accommodation in London. I am sure that is reflected everywhere else.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/9">The other issue that I touch upon before I conclude is that the mix of accommodation is currently entirely wrong. We need much larger accommodation. As has already been quoted, surveys show that 40 per cent. of housing should be four bedroom and above. Yet we know that one of the reasons why accommodation has been built with much smaller units is that it is constrained by the overall costs of building larger accommodation. So we have to recognise that if we do move to a mix with a larger number of four and five bedroom units, there will be a cost implication associated with that. It is necessary, however, because the failure to be able to move larger families is silting the local authority and housing association lettings programme. Unless we can move people, we will not be able to provide housing solutions to those in need.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/10">The plea that I make to the Minister is to recognise the importance of housing in a London context. It is a critical issue. I welcome the objective of halving the numbers of those in temporary accommodation by 2010, but the only way that we will be able to do that&mdash;even taking into account all the other measures that have been suggested in the strategy&mdash;is to build more units, and a better mix of units, for socially-rented, affordable accommodation.</p>

	<p pid=".87.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase> on securing this debate, and welcome my hon. Friend the Minister to his role and wish him every success for what I know will be a challenging and successful period.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/2">The provision of affordable housing in London is crucial to the future health and well-being of the capital. Putting it in the economic context, we know that some of the problems that have been described in this debate are the products of the success of London in recent years, showing the dynamism and growth which have very much been its hallmark in the past, after a period of setbacks and decline in the 1980s and early 1990s. Some of these problems&mdash;rising house prices and increasing demand for accommodation&mdash;are the consequences of economic success, and we obviously have to respond to that. Equally, we must recognise that some of the problems are to do with past mistakes, such as unsatisfactory housing, which the Government inherited in 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> highlighted the huge investment that has rightly gone into the backlog of substandard council housing, with which there has been good progress. The figures show that about 145,000 local authority homes in London that did not meet the decent homes standard have been brought up to that standard in the past eight years, an achievement of which the Government should be proud.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/4">In my constituency, the Ferrier estate&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1571" name="Clive Efford">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford)</phrase>, just abuts that area&mdash;is in the early stages of a comprehensive regeneration scheme, designed to create a high-quality, mixed environment in place of the grim and stigmatised environment that was inherited, which was not a decent environment for people to live in. Similarly, with the challenge to provide more new homes, there are encouraging signs of progress. In 2004&ndash;05, in London, about 24,000 new homes were started and the same number completed. About 6,000 of those new starts and completions were provided by registered social landlords. Those figures are the highest recorded for many years, for new starts and completions and for the affordable housing component. In 1997&ndash;98, 14,000 new homes only were completed, of which about 4,000 only were affordable. So, as a result of the increased investment and more energetic policies pursued by the Government, we are seeing increases of between 50 and 70 per cent. in the output of new homes compared with the situation that we inherited from the Conservatives. The Opposition should take heed and remember just how poor their record was when they were in government.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/5">The task is not only to provide more homes for general and affordable housing needs. We have learned from experience that playing the numbers game is unwise. Too many housing estates built in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and later&mdash;sadly, in some parts of the country, even some of the housing built in the 1990s&mdash;is having to be demolished or substantially remodelled because it failed to provide a decent environment for people to live in.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/6">The challenge is to ensure that new homes are provided in a sustainable way, and that they create attractive communities with options to buy and to rent without the corrosive tenure divisions that scoured much 20th century housing. There are many good examples of that: the Greenwich Millennium village and the regeneration of the Woolwich Arsenal in my constituency are both exemplars of high-quality environments with options to buy, to rent and for shared ownership; there is real interest in ensuring that they remain vibrant and attractive places in which to live for many years to come.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/7">We must also continue to drive up environmental standards by improving energy efficiency and avoiding the profligate use of land. Again, the Government have a good record on that with two successive increases in the standards required by part L of the building regulations; some splendid exemplars in the highly efficient and attractive housing of the Peabody Trust BedZED development in Sutton, which has high environmental standards; and with a move to higher density development to maximise the use of brownfield sites. Before anyone suggests that that move may compromise quality, I remind right hon. and hon. Members that new homes are being built at densities less than those of the Georgian terraces of mid-18th century London, which are still seen as highly attractive and desirable places in which to live two and a half centuries after they were built. Let us not hear the argument that high density is incompatible with good quality.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/8">One of the most important messages that needs to come out of this debate is the importance of providing housing for a range of needs. Most people, particularly young people, aspire to own their own home, so it is vital that we provide low-cost home ownership options, including options for key workers, on whom London's economy and social well-being is dependent. It is not sensible simply to try to replicate tenure patterns of 30 or 40 years ago. We need to continue to explore innovative schemes that allow people to acquire an equity share and which make it possible for them to increase their equity as circumstances permit. That would respond to aspirations and help to generate mixed-tenure communities rather than mono-tenure estates.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/9">I welcome the Government's initiatives to further those objectives, including the &pound;60,000 homes concept and the social-home-buy concept. Equally, there is a need for more good-quality rented housing for those with no immediate prospect of home ownership. Decent-quality rented housing provided by councils or registered housing associations can make a world of difference to the lives and prospects of people who would otherwise have no opportunity of obtaining secure and decent homes.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/10">I shall briefly address the issue of homelessness, which has rightly been raised. It is important to put it into context. The figure so often quoted as evidence of the problem&mdash;30,000 homeless households accepted by local authorities last year&mdash;is in fact evidence of a positive response to the problem. Those households have not been left without anywhere to live but have been accepted by local authorities and accommodation has been provided. That is partly the product of decisions taken by this Government, like the Labour Government of the 1970s, who legislated to extend the responsibilities of local authorities towards the homeless. Those decisions have led to an increase in the figures.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/11">There is also the issue of temporary accommodation. Again, to put the subject in context, although 67,000 households are in temporary accommodation, almost 11,000 of them live in local authority and housing association homes, and 34,000 are accommodated in private sector lettings, generally by housing associations. That accommodation is usually much better than bed and breakfasts, and we should welcome the fact that the Government have moved to reduce dependence on bed and breakfasts and improve alternatives for homeless people. That is not to say that there is not a great deal more to be done, but the Government have a good record. I congratulate the Minister on what has been achieved and I hope that he will be committed to doing more over the coming years.</p>

	<p pid=".90.0/1">First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase> on securing this debate on an issue of enormous importance and interest to all London Members. I also welcome the Minister to his new post. It is with some trepidation that I speak after <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase>, whose knowledge of local government was widely respected and a little feared in his previous post. I will seek to emulate him rather more slowly in the post that I have moved to in recent weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/2">The difficulty in obtaining affordable housing dominates all surgeries for London MPs and affects people at all levels, from middle to low incomes. On my way home late last night, I spoke to a young teacher who was married to another teacher and has two young children. He told me that he would have to move out of Brent because of the difficulty of affording accommodation for his family as it grows. I meet many young people living in poor quality rented accommodation. Brent has among the highest levels of houses in multiple occupation anywhere in the country.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/3">The poorest are affected most acutely by the problems of obtaining housing, and it is to them that I now turn. As the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate said at the outset, although it is important to address people's housing aspirations and their need to own a home, that must not be at the expense of addressing housing need, because inability to get any house is a driver for social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/4">Brent is typical of most inner-London areas. About 20,000 households are on the housing list waiting to be transferred. One in 10 people living in my constituency live in overcrowded conditions&mdash;that figure includes the private sector and owner-occupied accommodation, but the number is one in six for local authority or registered social landlord properties. As other Members have said, the situation is just as bleak across London with some 280,000 households on the housing list, and 174,000 in overcrowded conditions, including a staggering 261,000 children.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/5">As the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate said, about 62,000 households are stuck in temporary accommodation. The average wait to move from temporary to more permanent accommodation in London is just over a year, but that masks a huge variation. In Brent, the wait can often be two to three years, and I suspect that that is similar for other inner-London constituencies.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/6">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> said, we hear incredibly distressing stories week after week. Mum is depressed; Dad is angry. The children do not thrive at school and often suffer from asthma because they live in overcrowded accommodation that is also damp because too many people are in too small a house. I see many households in which one member of the family had TB, but because the house was overcrowded and damp, the whole family contracted it. They may be in temporary accommodation&mdash;perhaps moving from one hostel to another&mdash;and so have lost touch with their GP and drugs regime, meaning that the whole family has resistant TB.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/7">Lack of housing breaks up families, destroys lives and ruins people's potential. The sacrifice that such families make is enormous and cannot be overestimated.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/8">Shelter has examined the impact on families of being in temporary accommodation for lengthy periods. Around half said that their health suffered. Many children missed about a quarter of their schooling, and three quarters of families found that nobody was working, often because of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the poverty trap to which the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase> and others referred. I was interested to hear about the pilot scheme run with the East Thames housing group, in which a top-slicing of housing benefit is given as a grant to registered social landlords. That brings down the housing benefit required by each tenant in an effort to release people from the poverty trap, because there is no way that people can return to work and afford high rents. I will be interested to see the results of that pilot scheme, and if it is useful, I hope that the Government will consider pushing it further.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/9">As all hon. Members have said, the real problem with overcrowding is not just the lack of social housing being built but the fact that much of the build is one or two-bedroom units or even smaller. It is estimated that some 40 per cent. of social housing is required to have four bedrooms or more, but only 6 per cent. in the past 10 years has done so. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> eloquently said, we must encourage RSLs and local authorities to build large properties.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/10">The stress on councils that results is enormous. We have heard in the past week about the possible impact of councils acting as gatekeepers and preventing people from applying to be homeless and get access to housing. I have experienced that on an anecdotal level in Brent, and I have raised those concerns with the local housing department. I doubt that such action is directed from the top. Instead, I think that it is poor practice and the result of the extreme exasperation and stress that housing officers have to cope with, knowing that there is limited resource and struggling to prioritise. However, it is an extremely worrying trend.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/11">Against that backdrop, the Government have introduced a number of schemes to make it easier for people to buy their own home. Until we tackle the problem of supply, all that we will do, if we are not careful, is inflate the market for everybody. In particular, we will fail to tackle the problem for those people who so desperately need social rented accommodation and who will never afford their own home. I am particularly concerned to hear that Ministers interfered with recommendations by the London Housing Board on the mix of affordable housing to buy and social housing to be built. I hope that that pattern will not be repeated.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/12">If we going to tackle supply, one of the first things that the Government must do is to honour their pledge to introduce the secondary legislation required to tackle empty homes. There are around 100,000 empty homes across London. When we have more than 60,000 people in temporary accommodation, introducing that legislation would go some way to tackle the crisis. We also need to tackle the inequity in VAT. I have heard from talking to engineers and architects that it is often cheaper to knock down a property than to renovate it. That is a ridiculous situation both environmentally and because it prevents many empty properties in a poor state of repair from being brought back into use.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/13">We need to release far more land for building. There have been some welcome announcements from the Government, but the benefit is only trickling down. Rather than just looking at surplus and brownfield land, why do we not consider how appropriate the land's current use is? I know of an example in my constituency in which a primary care trust is holding a property to store medical equipment in one of the most expensive areas in the borough. That is nonsense: such land should be used for rebuilding. It is no good for Government Departments to hold on to land and speculate on its price. As other hon. Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1571" name="Clive Efford">the hon. Member for Eltham (Clive Efford)</phrase>, have said, we must allow local authorities more freedom to borrow in order to build.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/14">Finally, if we are going to look at the costs of construction, we must put more investment into training construction workers. In most of west London, the further education sector is under extreme strain and cannot meet the demand for people who want and need that training. We must address that.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/15">I thank the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate for securing the debate. It has been very useful, and I hope that the Minister will respond to the issues that have been raised.</p>

	<p pid=".92.0/1">I add my congratulations to those of others to the Minister on his new post. I do not know whether this is his maiden speech as a Minister, but I think that we have had a couple of other maiden speeches today, and I congratulate those Members. I hope that they have enjoyed the time that they have spent so far in the House of Commons. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase> on having set out the problem so clearly. Perhaps it will surprise her when I say that her analysis chimes with mine, and with that of everybody here. It is spot on. There is a problem.</p>
	<p pid=".92.0/2">We will probably differ on the prescription for the answer. I was interested that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase>, having had a good go at the Conservative Government, ignored the fact that when I became the Member of Parliament for Beckenham, the Groves estate&mdash;part of the Broomleigh housing association, which he advised when it became one of the earliest housing associations&mdash;was being renovated with money provided by the Conservative Government. Perhaps a touch of humility might be helpful if this debate is to remain as friendly as it might be. However, we have to address the problem; there is no argument about that.</p>
	<p pid=".92.0/3">Every hon. Member who has spoken this morning has used statistics. Unlike many statistics, we agree with them&mdash;they are hard facts. The Shelter briefing was first class, and it made clear the amount of hidden homelessness. Many speakers&mdash;I think that they all represent inner London constituencies&mdash;have mentioned that in terms of overcrowding. That is another problem that I share with every right hon. and hon. Member. I speak for an outer London borough, but between a third and a half of my constituency cases are also about housing. They are to do with issues such as overcrowding and lack of larger homes, so I share the problems of other hon. Members, and I feel for my constituents who are suffering in exactly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the way indicated by the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase>. We all see problems such as the prevalence of asthma in children, and the distress, stress and break-ups that families suffer.</p>
	<p pid=".92.0/4">What was most interesting was that, although the analysis of the problems in London was clear, further consideration was needed if there is to be a broader understanding of the need for flexibility in the whole of the housing sector. For instance, there were passing references to people coming in to London, as opposed to the poor having to move out. One of the problems with the Government's analysis is that it is assumed that there will be a net influx into London. It was ever thus. There is another Scottish accent here as well as mine, which is that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase>. We represent the influx from, dare I say, a few decades ago.</p>

	<p pid=".93.0/1">Not too many.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.93.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1395" speakername="Jacqui Lait" colnum="93"  time="10:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h01.htm#50615h01_spnew11">
	<p pid=".93.1/1">No, just a few. However, we accept that there is potentially a net increase. That prompts the question, which is why there is not a more dynamic regional policy to encourage highly-paid, high-quality jobs in the areas in which the Government are planning to knock down viable Victorian terraces in cities in the north? Interestingly, nobody has mentioned the Thames Gateway. That development could have a significant impact on London housing in that it might release the pressure on many of our constituents. We have to ensure that it is a real development.</p>
	<p pid=".93.1/2">I do not know whether the hon. Member for Edmonton comes from Glasgow, but I am sure that he has heard of Easterhouse. Those of us who are old enough to remember the building of Easterhouse, among whom I put myself, will know that that monumental estate was built on the outskirts of Glasgow for all the right reasons, but that no infrastructure was built with it. There were no churches, there were no pubs and there were no shops.There was the bus in and the bus out. We are still dealing with the social problems from that building half a century ago. There have been wonderful, charitable efforts to create communities. Subsequently, money was poured in to build community halls and to try to create a community, but the society had already fractured.</p>
	<p pid=".93.1/3">What worries me about developments like the Thames Gateway is that, however mixed the housing pattern might be, the social infrastructure might not be included. One of the concerns that we are picking up is that the Government are not planning to ensure that there will be the GP services, the health services and the schools, that there will be the social infrastructure to create the community. What we cannot afford to have on the outskirts of London is a new, potential Easterhouse. If the Minister can assure us that that infrastructure will be part of the development, which the Government are planning to pay for, then I think we will be reassured. I am sure that all our constituents will also feel the pressure coming off as that development proceeds.</p>
	<p pid=".93.1/4">On the pan-London letting system, asking my constituents who find themselves homeless or in bed-and-breakfast or overcrowded accommodation where in the borough of Bromley they want to go, nine times out of 10 they want to stay in the same street in which they are living. They will not even readily move to other parts of the borough of Bromley. I do not think that we can assume that a pan-London letting scheme would be the panacea for all ills.</p>
	<p pid=".93.1/5">Returning to some of the more practical and immediate problems, I agree with those who want to see more three- and four-bedroom houses being built. To do that, we need to free up the housing association sector, in order to access more private money, not necessarily so that the associations can sell houses&mdash;even on a shared equity or any other basis&mdash;but so that they can have access to the capital that they need. Then they can build more readily than when just relying on the Housing Corporation.</p>
	<p pid=".93.1/6">We need to extend the key worker purchasing scheme, not just to key workers, but to anyone who wishes to buy. As the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said, people aspire to own their own homes and we must not put barriers in the way of them doing so. By limiting people's ability to get on a shared equity scheme, we are setting a barrier. While I accept the analysis that has so readily come out and that we all share, we have to ensure that the Government do not put barriers in the way of people.</p>
	<p pid=".93.1/7">We should be looking at more brownfield site development, as the hon. Member for Brent, East said. So often the pressure in the outer London boroughs is coming on greenfield sites. Green belt is significantly under threat. We must work with the tenure of the housing market and not impose on it. We have seen and suffered from the problem where government has dictated to rather than worked with the housing market. I hope to hear from the Minister that that is the reform that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be bringing forward, to ensure that we have a flexible market that will allow those people who wish to buy to buy, and those people who wish to rent to rent, either privately or in the social rented sector. However, at present, as we can all see, there is a crisis in the social rented market. I look forward to hearing how the Minister plans to solve it.</p>

	<p pid=".94.0/1">I welcome you to the Chair this morning, Mr. Cummings. I also thank colleagues for their contributions to this important debate.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/2">I shall try to answer some of the questions asked and to respond to points raised by hon. Members. If I do not cover matters adequately, I will naturally write. I will try to fit some closing remarks into the brief time that is left, if there is any.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/3">I will begin by expressing gratitude to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase> for securing this debate on such an important issue. The Government attach considerable importance to increasing the supply of affordable housing, particularly in the capital. I therefore welcome the opportunity to listen to the views of right hon. and hon. Members and to respond. I am especially pleased as this is my first 90-minute Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall as the Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. I suspect that it will not be my last. I therefore express my appreciation for their generous words of welcome.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/4">I will express our collective appreciation and acknowledgement of all of those working in the capital to improve housing in London: Mayor Livingstone; the London boroughs; the Association of London Government; the Government office for London; and the London Housing Board; I also welcome the non-governmental organisations in the field: Shelter, which was mentioned several times, Crisis, and others.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate made comments about the Dickensian approach to overcrowding, to which we obviously do not want to return. That was also raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase>. I recognise that we have an outstanding commitment to publish a consultation paper on the statutory overcrowding standards. We fully intend to do so in the near future and that will address the question. I further appreciate the need for larger units for overcrowded households as well as the need to provide a balance of smaller units for single people, the homeless, and other families. More than a quarter of the social rented units in the Housing Corporation's approved development programme for 2004 to 2006 are homes with three bedrooms or more. I believe that the London Housing Board is examining the need for larger units. We are waiting to see how that will be reflected in its funding recommendations for 2006&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate also raised the need for pan-London lettings. I hope that she knows that the Government set targets for all local authorities to introduce choice-based lettings by 2010. We are keen on the development of sub-regional and regional choice-based letting schemes. I am pleased to say that London is ahead of the rest of the country in introducing choice-based lettings and that 21 London boroughs already operate such schemes. Three boroughs have plans to introduce them this year and seven others are actively considering introducing them. I understand that the London housing strategy, which is due to be published shortly, contains ambitious proposals for a pan-London choice-based letting scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/7">My hon. Friend also referred to children in temporary accommodation. The number of people living in such accommodation is too high; the figure stands at 101,000. Our strategy, &quot;Sustainable Communities, Settled Homes, Changing Lives&quot; will, we hope, halve the number living in insecure, temporary accommodation over the next five years. However, most people already in temporary accommodation live in self-contained flats or houses; indeed, 90 per cent. of families have their own front doors, which is a great improvement. We have ended the scandal of homeless families with children living for too long in poor-quality bed and breakfasts. We recognise that there have been improvements and that much has been done. I will comment further on that later.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/8">My hon. Friend also raised the fact that there is not enough private rented housing. There are a number of initiatives in that area and if she will allow me, I will write to her elaborating on them, and I will discuss them shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">My hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase> raised the similar problem of the need for more social rented housing. While we recognise that we provide a range of affordable housing options, we acknowledge the need for that important sector to receive the attention that it deserves in due course. The funding provided in the 2004 spending review will, along with efficiency improvements, produce 75,000 social rented homes across England by 2008. That represents a 50 per cent. increase by that year.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1571" name="Clive Efford">My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford)</phrase> raised the issue of the role of local authorities in regenerating local housing estates. He will know that in 1997 we inherited a backlog of repairs for social housing that was estimated at costing &pound;19 billion and involving 2 million non-decent homes. We have already refurbished and improved 1 million to decent standard and we are on target to ensure that we refurbish the others. &quot;Sustainable Communities: Homes for All&quot;, the five-year housing strategy of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, includes proposals for estate renewal schemes that involve the large-scale refurbishment and development of local authority or registered social landlord housing stock that can support the establishment of more mixed and sustainable communities. I am sure that my hon. Friend will closely follow that.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/11">One of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> was the exploitation of the right to buy. The Government have addressed that in a number of ways: by cutting the discounts available to local authority areas; by extending the qualification period before purchase is available; by extending the discounts repayment period from three to five years; by changing repayment calculations; and by exempting dwellings scheduled for demolition. I can provide further examples, and I will write to my hon. Friend on this matter, if he wishes me to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/12">I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase> to her post. She made the accusation that Ministers were interfering with the recommendations of the London Housing Board. In response to it, I say to her that the regional housing board recommendations and allocations for 2004&ndash;06 were largely accepted in full, although some changes to the balance of funding for different types of affordable housing were made for London and the south-east in order to meet the 2002 spending review commitment to spend &pound;1 billion on key worker housing in the three years to 2005&ndash;06 and to help recruit and retain front-line essential workers for the delivery of key services. The hon. Lady also mentioned the East Thames housing group's housing benefit block grant initiative, which is underway; I am watching that carefully, and I will write to her about it.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1395" name="Jacqui Lait">The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait)</phrase> raised questions about the Thames Gateway social infrastructure. Having attended a meeting only yesterday with the London Mayor, Ken Livingstone, and my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning, I can assure the hon. Lady that those issues are being addressed, and also that the Government will make their contribution to the building of sustainable communities in east London.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/14">The target for the supply of housing to begin to meet London's housing needs is set out in the Mayor's London Plan. The target is for at least 23,000 homes per year from all sources, and the aim is to get that figure up towards 30,000. The London Plan has set the strategic target that 50 per cent. of new homes in London should be affordable. The Government are committed to increasing the supply of housing, including affordable housing, which is why, since 1997, we have doubled the funding available for affordable housing to &pound;2 billion in 2007&ndash;08. That is a considerable increase, and it should be compared with the capital fund reduction between 1993 and 1997&mdash;it was halved.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/15">With the funding provided in the spending review of 2004, along with efficiency improvements, we will produce 75,000 social rented homes by 2008. We are also providing an extra &pound;500 million in 2006&ndash;08 for housing private finance initiative schemes, on top of the existing &pound;360 million per annum housing PFI programme, and will also deliver &pound;160 million in efficiencies on new social housing procurement in the period to 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/16">In London, we are investing almost &pound;1.5 billion to provide 21,000 affordable homes. That includes 10,000 homes for rent for homeless and poorly housed households, and 4,000 units for low-cost home ownership schemes. It will also provide 7,000 homes under the key worker living programme for key workers in front-line public services who are an essential part of our efforts to improve standards in hospitals and schools, and to win the fight against crime in London.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/17"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> raised the homelessness problem. The latest statistics were published on Monday, and they are encouraging. There has been a 20 per cent. reduction in the number of people becoming homeless. The figures show homeless acceptances falling by nearly 7,000 compared with the same period last year, and the number of people becoming homeless has continued to decrease nationally for over a year.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/18">What has that meant for London? Encouragingly, London is in line with the national trend, and acceptances have dropped by 18 per cent. The figures are down from 7,400 to 6,060; that is very welcome. New homeless strategies, and about &pound;20 million of homeless grant investment this year, has led to boroughs in the capital city making a real difference; they are preventing homelessness through initiatives such as rent deposit schemes, mediation schemes, sanctuary schemes for the victims of domestic violence, and by ensuring better access to the private sector.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/19">With regard to the Barker review and the longer term, we have accepted Kate Barker's central recommendation that there should be a step change. That phrase was used by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North; after eight years of a Labour Government he is clearly getting into the swing of things with the Administration. That step change will have a significant effect on housing supply.</p>
	<p pid=".94.0/20">We are also taking action to speed up the delivery of housing by transforming the planning system to make it faster, more responsive and more effective, and we shall make &pound;600 million of planning delivery grant available over the next five years.</p>

	Mental Health (Incapacity Benefit)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.99.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" speakername="Chris Bryant" colnum="99"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h02.htm#50615h02_spnew0">
	<p pid=".99.1/1">I am delighted that all Members with constituencies in London are staying for this debate because it is of such interest to them.</p>
	<p pid=".99.1/2">Incapacity benefit is claimed by roughly one in five people of working age in my constituency, so its reform will probably be one of the most important issues for my constituents over the next few years. That is true of nearly all the former mining constituencies&mdash;not only in south Wales, but across the whole country.</p>
	<p pid=".99.1/3">One of our biggest problems relates to those who suffer from mental health problems and are on incapacity benefit. According to the figures, 920,400 of the 2,398,700 people who claim it are on incapacity benefit because of mental health problems. In other words, 38 per cent. of people on incapacity benefit across the UK are on it because of mental health problems; that is the largest group by a considerable way. The next largest group is made up of those with musculo-skeletal problems, who represent only 20 per cent. of those on incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".99.1/4">If we are to tackle the ongoing problems with incapacity benefit, we shall have to look closely and analytically at issues of mental health as they affect incapacity benefit. Part of the problem is that only 24 per cent. of those with mental health problems in this country are in work; that is the lowest level of employment among all the disabled groups. If we want to care best for those who suffer from mental health problems, we need to find a way of getting them into work.</p>
	<p pid=".99.1/5">The category of mental health problems covers an enormous range of issues, from schizophrenia to anxiety, stress, depression and alcohol and drug dependency. The most recent figures on how much the different mental health categories cost in incapacity benefit are for the year 2003&ndash;04. Phobic anxiety disorders cost &pound;282 million, reaction to severe stress &pound;103 million, depression&mdash;whether episodic or long-term&mdash;&pound;1.036 billion and other mental health problems &pound;613 million.</p>
	<p pid=".99.1/6">It is interesting that incapacity benefit claims for stress and depression have grown dramatically during the past eight years, despite the fact that most surveys of mental health in the UK suggest that there has not been a dramatic increase in the number of people suffering from them. That may be because these days we have a greater understanding of stress and depression and the effect that they can have on people, or for a series of different reasons, but some research still has to be done.</p>
	<p pid=".99.1/7">We know that during the past 10 years there has been a significant increase in mental health problems in one area: that of alcohol dependence. That increase has put severe stress on some of the alcohol and drug dependency treatment services, although I am glad to say that their capacity has risen significantly during the past 10 years. However, that is just a small part of the equation. If the Government are serious about mental health issues and if they are to get more people into work, they will have to look at this nugget of people dealing with severe stress and depression.</p>
	<p pid=".99.1/8">We could just say, &quot;These people have mental health problems and the state should be generous to them. After all, we want to make sure that people have adequate finances and are able to care for themselves whatever disability they have. What is the problem?&quot; Well, there is a problem. One in six men who are out of work for six months will develop a serious mental health problem&mdash;in fact, probably a major depressive illness. When I say depressive illness, I do not mean somebody feeling down on a Friday afternoon or Monday morning, but a serious depressive illness. We have a duty to try to ensure that as many people as possible get into work because, on the whole, it is the best route towards sound mental health.</p>
	<p pid=".99.1/9">We have a vicious circle. So often, when someone goes on to benefits they find their life very circumscribed. They are no longer in a working environment; they no longer have a social life connected to work. Their income is very limited. All of that adds anxiety and stress to their situation. That can perpetuate the cycle of depression and exacerbate mental health problems. It is a well documented fact that quite a lot of people come on to incapacity benefit with other conditions&mdash;perhaps musculo-skeletal problems&mdash;and, by virtue of being on incapacity benefit for six months, a year or two years, end up developing a mental health problem either as well as, or instead of, the original problem that made them incapable of seeking work. We must turn around that vicious circle.</p>
	<p pid=".99.1/10">Another problem is that the system is open to abuse. I do not subscribe to the sneering attitude that some newspapers have adopted towards stress and depression, because they are very real conditions. The system is, however, open to abuse. In most of our constituencies, the surface does not have to be scratched to find examples of people who are swinging the lead and playing the game for all it is worth. Unfortunately, because this area is perhaps less immediately identifiable, it is all too easy for that to happen. Why is that a problem in itself? Not only because fraud is obviously wrong but, more significantly, because it undermines the whole system of incapacity benefit and the generosity that we should rightly afford to those who are genuinely disabled.</p>
	<p pid=".99.1/11">We also know that a person who is on incapacity benefit is 35 times more likely to commit suicide than someone who is in a job.</p>

	<p pid=".100.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on raising this issue. One of the problems in this field is the fact that the forms available for incapacity benefit rely on physical descriptors of illnesses, rather than what the hon. Gentleman is now addressing.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.100.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" speakername="Chris Bryant" colnum="100"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h02.htm#50615h02_spnew2">
	<p pid=".100.1/1">I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman. This is an example of where the Government need to look specifically at the cohort of people who are on incapacity benefit&mdash;not in any retributive way, or to try to assault the figures, but simply to assist us in helping people achieve what they, mostly, say that they want. In fact, of all those on incapacity benefit, the category of people who are most likely to say that they would like to get into work are those who are on it for mental health reasons. So the more we can do to ease the system&mdash;to offer incentives so that people can get into work, and make it possible for them&mdash;the better.</p>
	<p pid=".100.1/2">I shall now say where I suspect that some of the answers may lie. First and foremost, we still need better and more mental health services. There has been a step change in the last eight years, and I would like, briefly at least, to blow not only the Westminster Government's trumpet but that of the Welsh Assembly Government. They have invested a considerable amount of time, effort and money in improving our mental health services. We now have 25 per cent. more consultant psychiatrists, 42 per cent. more clinical psychologists and 13 per cent. more mental health nurses, which is excellent.</p>
	<p pid=".100.1/3">We still have a problem of recruitment and retention in mental health services, however. It is a very stressful area of work. Eleven per cent. of clinical psychologist places are still vacant. We have a considerable way to go to ensure that we recruit and retain more people in the service.</p>
	<p pid=".100.1/4">Part of the problem is that it is all too easy for the media to create a degree of hysteria surrounding every single incident where someone who has been seen by the mental health services is involved in some kind of violent attack. Somehow or other, the newspapers end up blaming the psychiatrist, the consultant psychiatrist or the hospital, whereas, in many of these cases, the chaotic lifestyle of the individual makes it very difficult to provide adequate and suitable mental health services. We need to retreat from the culture of blame that sometimes surrounds this issue, if we are to make sure that we recruit more.</p>

	<p pid=".101.0/1">A moment ago, my hon. Friend referred to the National Assembly for Wales, which is putting more emphasis on economic development at the tops of the south Wales valleys, the area in which there is the greatest concentration of incapacity benefit claimants. Does he recognise the important link between what happens here at Westminster at an all-British level and the Welsh Assembly in respect of economic development and reducing the number of people on incapacity benefit?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.101.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" speakername="Chris Bryant" colnum="101"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h02.htm#50615h02_spnew4">
	<p pid=".101.1/1">Absolutely. My hon. Friend makes a good point. Given that his constituency is a near neighbour to mine, he knows about the issues in my constituency. It is no coincidence that the areas with the highest level of incapacity benefit in the country were formerly mining or shipyard constituencies. That is why it is incumbent on the Government to take a holistic approach in Scotland, England and Wales to bring together the agencies that can make a difference.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/2">In Wales, the NHS spends 12 per cent. of its budget on mental health services, which is a higher percentage than in England. I congratulate the Welsh Assembly on such action because it is all too easy to forget mental health services. Pressure is often on to provide more money for a hospital or acute services, not mental health services, so I applaud what the Welsh Assembly has done. Rhondda has a new drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit in Llwynypia. It has cut the waiting list for drug and alcohol dependency treatment enormously from about 18 months to&mdash;if people were allowed on the waiting list four years ago&mdash;about three or four months. We still have some way to go to reduce the waiting list for treatment to three or four weeks, which is what I want.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/3">I applaud the fact that such a service is in place, but we still have significant difficulty in providing other therapies that can make a real difference to people's lives, such as counselling and psychotherapy. They might be available in Chelsea, Westminster or other parts of the country, but not on the doorstep in the south Wales valleys. It is well documented that we still need more support in such matters and one of the difficulties of achieving it is that we already have a population, especially the men, that does not like to talk about such issues. Young people tend to self-medicate with alcohol and drugs, and that causes bigger problems. The danger that stems from such action is that the only game in town is the taking of antidepressants. While such drugs have played a significant role in improving mental health over the past 15 years, I believe that we pop pills too readily and we need to find other ways in which to tackle the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/4">If we are to deal with the problem, changes must also be made to incapacity benefit. Through the pathways to work programme that was piloted in Bridgend and Rhondda, the Government were right to give incentives to everyone on incapacity benefit to gain employment. That is just as true for those with mental health problems because part of the danger in the past has been that attending work is regarded as much riskier financially than being on benefit, because that is guaranteed. That is particularly so because rates increase when people have been a recipient of benefit for more than a certain period. The danger is that people have been frightened out of starting work because, if they lost their job, they would have to start at the beginning.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/5">The Government have been absolutely right to change the rules and to put in place return-to-work credit, which makes it possible for many people to attend work as well as making work financially attractive. We should provide mental health training for all staff involved in the pathways to work programme who carry out job-focused interviews. If issues arising from stress and depression are not properly understood by the people on the front line, they can be made worse by the process of undertaking a job-focused interview.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/6">We must also integrate mental health services into the pathways to work programme much earlier in the system. Will the Minister explain whether the Department has carried out research into how the own-occupation test&mdash;the test that allows a person to be in receipt of incapacity benefit and one that is usually adjusted on the basis of the person's own statement and that of a general practitioner&mdash;works specifically for those with mental health problems? My suspicion is that it is all too easy for a GP to sign the person off and say, &quot;Oh, go on to incapacity benefit&quot;, instead of providing time and ensuring that they receive counselling or psychotherapy support. That may not be the right thing for the person's mental health, let alone their life.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/7">The final thing that we still need to change is the culture of despair that sometimes surrounds mental health issues. Old-fashioned attitudes to mental health have improved over the past 15 or 20 years. The number of hospital beds for people with mental health problems has gone down dramatically. Some people may say that that is terrible, but I think that it is a good thing. In the past, we used to lock up people with mental health problems. We have now learned much better strategies for providing them with a life in the community. Sometimes the community is not quite ready for that, and there is always more work that we can do in that respect, but we need to ensure that the old clich&eacute; of mental health services being a Cinderella service is genuinely something of the past.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/8">We also need to put an end to the sneering attitudes that all too often pervade this issue. It is pointless to say, &quot;Stress and depression don't really exist. People are just saying that they want to go on incapacity benefit because they can't be bothered to work.&quot; That attitude will never help us to achieve the real change that we need and which people with mental health problems need&mdash;opportunities for them to get into work.</p>
	<p pid=".101.1/9">The issue of mental health problems is not just about what people once might have thought of as the mad or the bad; it affects nearly every family in the land. I hope that, over the coming months, we see changes to the incapacity benefit system that will allow more of my constituents who have mental health problems but would like to get into work, to achieve that goal.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.103.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2013" speakername="Anne McGuire" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions"  colnum="103"  time="11:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h02.htm#50615h02_spmin0">
	<p pid=".103.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" name="Chris Bryant">my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> on initiating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the debate. I also thank the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1470" name="Wayne David">my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David)</phrase> for their contributions; I shall pick up on the two points that they made. The speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda highlighted not only his assiduous research on this matter, but his commitment to dealing with some of the complicated issues involved. The concern that he expressed is what anyone who examines these issues comes to feel.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/2">I think that we all agree that addressing the number of people with mental illness on incapacity benefit is one of the biggest challenges that we face. As my hon. Friend mentioned, nearly 1 million people are on incapacity benefit because of a mental or behavioural disorder. That means that there are now more mentally ill people claiming incapacity benefits than there are people on jobseeker's allowance. Overall, mental health problems account for 30 to 40 per cent. of work-related health problems, sickness absence, long-term incapacity and early retirement.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/3">It is fair to say that that situation imposes a heavy cost on us all. Estimates vary, but it could be anything up to &pound;45 billion a year. For example, the CBI estimates that there is lost output of &pound;4 billion a year from time off sick because of depression. The lower employment rate for people with mental health problems, which my hon. Friend highlighted, implies further lost output of &pound;9 billion. Public expenditure on mental health services accounts for a further &pound;8 billion. We also have to add the cost of state benefits and the time given by carers.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/4">Of course, those figures do not even begin to describe the impact on the individuals involved, whose loss of employment can often exacerbate their mental illness. The Government genuinely believe that we can and must start to address the issue seriously. Huge numbers of people with mental health problems suffer misery and social isolation. It is the job of any Government to empower such people to take back control of their lives.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/5">Our approach is not to stigmatise that group of people further by blaming them and labelling them as workshy or feckless or to call them fraudsters. I know that my hon. Friend has sympathy with that approach.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/6">Despite what one might believe from reading some of the more lurid headlines in the tabloid press, there has not been a big rise in the number of people coming on to our books with mental illness. In 1997, 220,000 people a year started to claim incapacity benefit on the basis of a mental health condition. In 2004, the figure was 233,000.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/7">As my hon. Friend highlighted, people with mental or behavioural disorders make up about 39 per cent. of IB claimants. The overall rise in the number of people on benefits with mental health conditions is quite simple to explain&mdash;indeed, I think that my hon. Friend alluded to it: it is difficult for them to get back to work. That is often because of a lack of support to help them to cope with their condition and move back to work. Sometimes it is because of the wider benefit and work-related barriers that they face, which my hon. Friend mentioned. We cannot estimate the size of the significant problem of lack of understanding by employers and fellow workers. Although they have a strong desire to work again, employment rates for people with mental health conditions are low. The labour force survey shows that people with mental health problems have the lowest employment rate of any disabled group. That is doubly concerning because there is increasingly good evidence that work could be part of the recovery process for people with mental health conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/8">Mental health problems can become much worse because of the isolation and loss of status that accompanies long-term unemployment. Many who start with chronic, pain-related conditions such as back or neck pain end up developing secondary mental conditions such as depression over the years.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/9">To help people make the transition back to work, we need to ensure that the right services are available in jobcentres, GP practices and the wider NHS, and among employers; and there should be greater co-ordination of those services, with GPs supporting patients alongside employers, helping them to focus on the return to work and allowing them back into work whenever possible. We also need services in the wider NHS to help people to manage their conditions, and at jobcentres to help them find work. I assure my hon. Friend that we are starting to do that.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/10">In the Department for Work and Pensions we have started to change fundamentally what it means to claim IB, particularly through the pathways to work initiative. In that respect, I want to reassure the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy regarding some of the tests for people with mental illness going on to IB: those capacity tests seriously take into account the impact of mental health conditions on people's capacity to work, and were drawn up in consultation with the Institute of Psychiatry to ensure that we did not miss anything. Through that initiative, we have started actively to intervene and support people back to work.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/11">My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda may be interested to note that when the pathways initiative was designed, we had the experiences and issues of people with mental health conditions at the forefront of our mind. The initiative offers a combination of sustained and highly skilled personal adviser support to people to stay engaged with the idea of getting back to work. I assure my hon. Friend that all pathways personal advisers get a full training package, which includes mental health awareness, so we are starting to look at some of the issues that he highlighted.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/12">There are new NHS condition management programmes, which help people to understand how to manage their mental and physical health conditions more effectively, and to develop positive coping strategies to avoid or reduce the occurrence of depression or pain.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/13">I can tell my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Caerphilly that I was in the Rhondda not long ago, helping the First Minister, Rhodri Morgan, with the launch of a joint initiative between the Government and the Welsh Assembly called &quot;Want to Work&quot;. That initiative is about trying to ensure that whenever possible we co-ordinate our efforts in support of the individual. As my hon. Friend said, there is no point in different pockets of work being done unless they are pulled together in the best interests of the individuals concerned. That work has already been started, and similar work is being undertaken by the Scottish Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/14">We are looking at improved financial incentives to ensure that, in most cases, work pays much more than benefit. We want to encourage local GPs to be supportive and take a more proactive attitude to people's fitness to work. During my visit to the launch of &quot;Want to Work&quot;, a general practitioner from the area highlighted the fact that he had become part of a system that signed people off sick without understanding the impact on the individual or knowing what that person did. One of the great liberating things for him, now that he is working with Jobcentre Plus and employers and dealing with other aspects of the health service, is that he can take a far more holistic approach to what is good for patients who are claimants and long-term unemployed. I found that most encouraging.</p>

	<p pid=".105.1/1">No; I need to respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda.</p>
	<p pid=".105.1/2">Pathways continues to show extremely encouraging results and it is making a profound difference to the lives of many people on IB with mental health conditions. Hon. Members will, I am sure, be aware of a number of case studies, but I shall highlight one. Kathy last worked more than 20 years ago; she had severe depression and anxiety, and she had to care for a disabled child. When it came to employment, she felt that she had been abandoned. Her personal adviser at Jobcentre Plus referred her to the local NHS condition management programme to improve her confidence and to help her cope with any negative feelings. At the end of that programme, Kathy had the confidence to apply for a post in a local nursing home as an events organiser. She loves her new job, and is apparently &pound;4,000 a year better off than when she was on benefit. I am sure that many similar stories could be told by people throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid=".105.1/3">As Jobcentre Plus is raising its game, so is the NHS. The mental health service has improved greatly over the last five years as a result of the national service framework and additional funding. New treatments have been introduced and new workers are being recruited and trained; in particular, staff are being trained and employed by GPs to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy. In 2004, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence published guidelines on depression and anxiety, strongly supporting the case for cognitive behavioural therapy. Those who are knowledgeable in such matters are aware that is a far more effective method than other talking therapies such as psychotherapy or counselling.</p>
	<p pid=".105.1/4">In addition, the Health and Safety Executive is focusing on improving awareness of best practice in sickness absence management. We have extended the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to remove the need for mental illness to be &quot;clinically well-recognised&quot;. That was a great leap forward in working with people with mental illness. The HSE has a crucial role in managing sickness and in encouraging employers to look at ways to manage sickness absence in order to ensure that people do not get to the point of needing incapacity benefit. We must work more closely on that.</p>
	<p pid=".105.1/5">None of that takes away from the need for a profound change in how we look at incapacity benefit during the rest of this decade. The comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda and other hon. Members will be most helpful in developing the Green Paper that is due to be published later this year. Finally, I reassure my hon. Friend that we share his commitment to addressing issues that unnecessarily blight the lives of so many people and so many communities.</p>

</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.107.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" speakername="John Bercow" colnum="107"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h03.htm#50615h03_spnew0">
	<p pid=".107.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate on the important subject of human rights, or perhaps I should say their violation, in Burma. I begin by declaring my interest, duly recorded in the register, as parliamentary adviser to Christian Solidarity Worldwide.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/2">The timing of this debate could hardly be more apposite or opportune. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-19">19 June</phrase>, Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel laureate and leader of Burma's democracy movement, will have spent nine years and 238 days in detention and she will celebrate, if that word can be used without absurdity, her birthday. She has long ceased contact with members of her family and representatives of the international community. Her post is intercepted, her telephone is unavailable for her regular use, and much-needed medical treatment has been denied. Her situation is serious indeed.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/3">Right hon. and hon. Members will recall that towards the end of the last Session&mdash;on <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>, if memory serves&mdash;an early-day motion was tabled on a cross-party basis and secured 289 signatures. That motion paid tribute to the championship of democracy, freedom, justice and human rights by Aung San Suu Kyi and called for the establishment of meaningful talks with a view to a speedy transition to democratic pluralism in Burma.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/4">When we talk about abuse of human rights, we think often of Iraq under Saddam Hussein, Sudan under al-Bashir, and Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe. We should think of Burma more readily than we do, because there is no doubt that the military junta that rules Burma and has continued to flout its people's views is one of the most savage military dictatorships to be found in the world. The record is well established, the documentation has been provided and the evidence has been regularly collated, but let the argument be reiterated so that we are clear and so that outside observers unfamiliar with the historical record are in the know.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/5">Rape as a weapon of war, extra-judicial killings, compulsory relocation, forced labour, the use of child soldiers and human minesweepers, and the daily destruction of rural villages, especially in eastern Burma, are all part of the cocktail of barbarity that has disfigured that beautiful but long-suffering part of the world. The use of child soldiers in Burma is on a scale proportionately greater than in any country in the world. The suffering is immense. The situation in Burma is not simply a matter of historical events about which there is continuing argument. The crisis is real, the atrocities continue, the pain is now. In the past 12 months or so, there have been continual attacks by the Burma army&mdash;the Tatmadaw&mdash;on the Karen, the Karenni, the Shan and the Chin people, to name but four examples of ethnic nationals targeted, vilified, attacked, maimed, disfigured, raped and murdered on the deliberate say-so of the so-called State Peace and Development Council, the name of the ruling regime.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/6">It is salutary to note that, on the advice of an American public relations company, I believe, the governing body of Burma changed its name from the State Law and Order Restoration Council&mdash;otherwise and perhaps more fittingly known by the acronym SLORC&mdash;to the State Peace and Development Council. When I was a young boy first taking an interest in politics, I asked my father what I thought was a simple but valid question. &quot;Dad,&quot; I asked, for I regarded him as the fount of all knowledge and wisdom, &quot;Why, given its reputation for human rights abuses, is the German Democratic Republic so called?&quot; He sagely replied, &quot;Ah, son, it is called the German Democratic Republic precisely because it isn't.&quot; There is a sense in which that is true in respect of the Burmese Government. Military offensives, not only against army opponents of the regime but against unarmed, innocent and non-political civilians, are a fact of life. We are talking about a 100,000-strong army attacking villages.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/7">Visiting the Thai-Burmese border last year, courtesy of Christian Solidarity Worldwide, was one of the most harrowing experiences of my life. I met parents who spontaneously volunteered to me that they had seen their children shot dead in front of them. Similarly, I met children who told me spontaneously that they had seen their parents shot dead in front of them. That is the scale of the savagery and wanton destruction of which the Government of Burma are guilty.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/8">The sources of evidence are many, respected and compelling: they include the United States State Department, the United Nations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, the Free Burma Rangers, the International Labour Organisation, the Karen Human Rights Organisation and the Shan Human Rights Foundation. The evidence is all on the record and documented, and the papers have been provided. Governments throughout the European Union and in north America and UN member states have been told of what is happening in Burma. I believe that the abuse of human rights in Burma is the most shameful and under-reported such abuse to be found anywhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/9">New evidence has recently been provided by Mr. Guy Horton, the author of a new report, which he calls &quot;Dying Alive: A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma&quot;. Mr. Horton, who has presented the evidence in Washington and will shortly do so at a press conference in London, argues that the Government of Burma are guilty of human rights violations that contravene three important protocols and public declarations. He argues, that the regime is guilty of, first, crimes against humanity under article 7 of the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court and, secondly, breaching common article 3 of the convention on refugees. He concludes, that in addition to those crimes against humanity and war crimes, the Government of Burma are guilty of attempted genocide under the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. That is an extremely serious charge. My understanding&mdash;the Minister will tell me if I am wrong&mdash;is that the British Government are not currently persuaded that the evidence constitutes proof. I hope that they will be prepared to look at that further when they have the chance to study the detailed report.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/10">There is also serious concern about reports in the past few months of what circumstantial evidence suggests was either a chemical or a poisoned-weapons attack on an army resistance camp in Karenni state. Independent medical examinations of residents of that camp have led to the conclusion that have symptoms of what appears to be illness resulting from a chemical or poison weapons attack. We have heard about the explosion of shells, a sinister, disgusting yellow vapour, and the consequences for the people in the camp of severe irritation to the eyes, damage to the lungs, a marked deterioration in the muscles and a period of prolonged weight loss, to name but four of the symptoms. We have also heard testimony from army deserters that they were instructed by their controllers in the Tatmadaw to carry boxes containing poison weapons. It is incumbent on the British Government proactively to consider the evidence and either satisfy themselves that it is compelling and that referrals of identifiable suspects to the International Criminal Court should take place forthwith, or decide that that they are not so satisfied, in which case the Minister has a responsibility on behalf of the Government clearly and openly to explain to the House why they are not persuaded by what appears to be compelling evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/11">Let us, briefly&mdash;I am conscious that many hon. Members in the Chamber wish to take part in the debate and have serious and informed contributions to make&mdash;look at the overview of the position in Burma. I have deliberately not subjected the Chamber to a history lesson about what has happened in that country. Many people present will be familiar of the brutality of the regime over the past four and a bit decades. They know only too well that the results of the 1990 elections, in which the National League for Democracy was manifestly victorious, were ignored by the Government, who are absolutely hellbent on retaining the aggressive and intimidating power of the military component of the regime.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/12">There were a few cursory and tokenistic releases of prisoners from jails not long ago, which were trumpeted by the regime and its naive or malign agents as constituting evidence of a dramatic march towards the democratic process on the part of the regime. Of course, they were nothing of the sort. The truth is that there are still between 1,300 and 1,400 political prisoners or prisoners of conscience incarcerated in varying conditions of severity and deprivation in Burma's jails. The offices of the National League for Democracy remain shut and there is not the slightest sign of the release of one of the heroines of the struggle for freedom, justice and democracy in the world today, Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/13">The regime, typical of authoritarian and, worse still, totalitarian regimes, spends a vast proportion of its national budget on the military, but spends, I believe, 19p a year per person on the health of the people. In those circumstances, it is not surprising that one in 10 children in Burma does not survive beyond the age of five. That is an horrendous state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/14">When I think about the reports of domestic organisations on the ground whose representatives I was privileged to meet last year, I think that we cannot look the other way and choose to think of and talk about something else. The Karen Women's Organisation's 2004 report &quot;Shattering Silences&quot; and the Shan Human Rights Foundation's May 2002 report &quot;Licence to Rape&quot; tell us about premeditated attacks on innocent people by the representatives of the army, which are all calculated to keep people down, to deny them protection and to send a message to anyone who might be thinking of arguing against the regime that they should not consider doing so. The Burmese people's plight is extremely serious. I do not think that that is be a matter of disagreement in this Chamber. The question is: what do we do to improve the situation? Can the Government, unilaterally, multilaterally or supranationally, take any action that would alleviate the plight of the people of Burma, in particular the long-suffering ethnic nationals, and offer the prospect of relief and progress in the future?</p>
	<p pid=".107.1/15">There are steps that can be taken. First, I appeal to the Minister to confirm that the Government will actively investigate the Horton allegations, if I may describe them so. Will he confirm that the Government will examine, painstakingly and in detail, the allegations of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide? Secondly, will they examine the particular accusation made public by Christian Solidarity Worldwide of an attempted chemical or poison weapons attack on the Karenni army resistance camp?</p>

	<p pid=".110.0/1">May I touch on a point that the hon. Gentleman has not yet talked about and might not do so? He has mapped out the details of an appalling regime, which has continued since 1962 in the face of worldwide opposition. We must recognise that it has survived since that time whereas other equally turbulent regimes have collapsed. What does he think are the reasons for the longevity of that appalling regime in Burma?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.110.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" speakername="John Bercow" colnum="110"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h03.htm#50615h03_spnew2">
	<p pid=".110.1/1">There are reasons for the longevity of the regime and I will detail them in broad terms and in short order. First, the regime is militarily powerful and its opponents are nothing like as militarily powerful. Secondly, there is an absence of television cameras in Burma. They would help open up to public and international view the reality of the violation of human rights that is taking place and would give the opportunity for independent testimony to the scale of the savagery.</p>
	<p pid=".110.1/2">Thirdly, the United Nations and other organisations have not accepted their responsibilities. In that sense, the hon. Gentleman, not for the first time and probably not for the last, has most helpfully prodded me to the third point that I want to make to the Minister about action to be taken and the attitude required for it to be carried out. I hope that today he will accept that, however well intentioned the policy of engagement might have been&mdash;I accept that it is a policy that applied under the Conservative Government as well as under the present Government&mdash;it has proved to be an abysmal failure. Under the Conservative Government, trade fairs were taking place in Rangoon between 1994 and 1996 when people were being slaughtered in Burma. Imports from Burma, which were worth &pound;17.8 million in 1998, now total about &pound;74 million.</p>
	<p pid=".110.1/3">Let us consider the EU-wide position. Since 1988, $4 billion of trade and investment has been conducted with Burma by member states of the European Union. Total&mdash;one of the most serious offenders whose activities have done a great deal to prop up the brutal, savage military dictatorship in Burma&mdash;is in the process of investing about $400 million in Burma. I have raised the matter with the Prime Minister in response to his statements in the aftermath of European summits. I have urged him to add to the list of agenda items on which he is regularly in dispute with President Chirac by rightly remonstrating with him about allowing the disgraceful, antisocial and deeply damaging behaviour of Total to prop in that way.</p>
	<p pid=".110.1/4">I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> that the international community must accept responsibility. The European Union must acknowledge that engagement has failed, that the brutal military dictatorship continues, that the semi-moderate Prime Minister in office until last year has been deposed, that a hard-line fascistic military despot is now in place and that the road map to democracy and the National Convention that was supposedly to take place to facilitate a multi-party dialogue about the country's future are things of the past. We need the European Union to get serious: it must implement a targeted sanctions policy and apply a comprehensive investment ban on Burma. Targeting the pineapple juice sector and a tailor's shop in Burma does not constitute evidence of serious intent on the part of the European Union to bring the regime to heel. Indeed, the word &quot;tokenism&quot; readily springs to mind.</p>

	<p pid=".111.0/1">I have waited many a long year for an opportunity to tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> that he is being far too optimistic and sanguine about the European Union; that opportunity has now arrived. The chances of the European Union doing anything effective against Total are minuscule. However, the company is this country's fourth biggest oil supplier. Can my hon. Friend not think of measures that this country could take to hit Total where it hurts&mdash;in its pocket? Such measures might prove slightly more effective.</p>

	<p pid=".111.1/1">The interesting point to emerge from my hon. Friend's intervention is that although I have not thought of ways to improve the position unilaterally, he has manifestly done so. It would be profitable for me to have further dialogue with him in the hope that we can launch a joint approach or two-handed initiative. The House ought to be aware that my hon. Friend and I, who have been friends for a long time, have always understood that we have only one brain and we have decided to share it between us. On this occasion, my hon. Friend has considered the issue carefully and contributed substantially to my thinking on this matter. I had not worked out precisely how we should proceed, but perhaps we can proceed within EU trade rules. If so, we should not wait for the collective response of the European Union&mdash;we might wait for that for a long time&mdash;but take unilateral action.</p>
	<p pid=".111.1/2">The UN has a role to play as well. It is a counsel of despair for the Government to argue, as the Minister did in a parliamentary written answer to me on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-25">25 May</phrase> this year, that there is no consensus on bringing the issue of Burma's human rights abuses to the UN Security Council, as if that were a justification for the Government wilfully continuing to fail to do so. I say in all candour to the Minister that I recognise that it is difficult to make progress, but the logic used by the Foreign Office is a case of reductio ad absurdum. Its argument goes, &quot;We do not think that we will get agreement in the Security Council. The French will probably complain and the Chinese will strongly object and veto any action. Therefore, it is not worth raising such matters.&quot; Miss Widdecombe, you know as well as I that if the Conservative Opposition in this House worked on the same principle, we would not have staged a single Opposition day debate since 1997. We would simply have said, &quot;Oh well, it is all hopeless. We cannot possibly win. The Government won't take any notice and we won't win a single vote. We might as well pack up and go home.&quot; I am sure that that would be satisfactory for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1569" name="Andrew Miller">the Minister and the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller)</phrase>, to name but two hon. Members, but we have not taken such an approach. The Government should raise matters such as Burma's human rights abuses and put them on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council. Let us name and shame those states that, because they lack any moral sense or they are consumed by the pursuit of filthy lucre&mdash;or both&mdash;object to and use the veto against any effective action that could help to bring the regime to heel.</p>
	<p pid=".111.1/3">In terms of sanctions, there is another stick that we can use in respect Burma. Everyone knows that Burma treasures the forthcoming chairmanship of the Association of South East Asian Nations in 2006. In respect of international credibility, that post is important to Burma. We should say that that is unacceptable. Parliamentarians in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, to name but three ASEAN countries, have objected to the idea that Burma should have the chairmanship. Through its military expansionism, its involvement in the drugs trade, its spawning of a humanitarian crisis as a result of the flow of refugees over the border, Burma now poses a serious threat to regional stability. Apart from its regional threat, it is also guilty of terrible human rights abuses. Unless and until Burma can comport itself in accordance with the standards of civilised behaviour, it should not be allowed to parley on equal terms with the world's democracies. We should say through the European Union, &quot;Unless and until you clean up your act, you will not have the chairmanship of ASEAN.&quot; One thing that we can say is that we will have no part in meetings under Burma's chairmanship if it is allowed to go ahead.</p>
	<p pid=".111.1/4">The Prime Minister has often displayed a truly laudable determination to tackle rogue states and to spread democracy and human rights throughout the world. Sadly, to date, Burma has not formed part of the equation. I am not making a party political point: it is a great indictment of the House that, so far back as records can be traced, not one ministerial oral statement has been made in Parliament about the abuse of human rights in Burma. That situation should change. If we declared our intention as a Parliament to oppose the regime, we could make a difference in time. If we were to adopt, through the European Union and the United Nations, the sanctions that are needed in respect of the oil, gas, timber and gems sectors on the one hand and follow up with a comprehensive UN arms embargo on the other, what a difference that could make.</p>
	<p pid=".111.1/5">The Government of Burma have a responsibility to stop subjugating their citizens and to start liberating them. If they will not act voluntarily, they must be squeezed, squeezed and squeezed again. Like many other despotic regimes throughout the world, the Government of Burma are contemptuous of weakness. They respect only strength. They will respond only&mdash;if at all&mdash;to pressure, pressure and more pressure. If we take the approach that I recommend and if the Prime Minister is willing for his remaining period in office to put himself at the head of a movement to bring about change in Burma, that would be right in itself. It would also enable us to send the most delightful and welcome 60th birthday present to Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>

	<p pid=".113.0/1">It is a genuine pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>. I congratulate him not only on securing the debate, but on presenting his case in the way he did and on his persistence in pursuing such an incredibly important matter.</p>
	<p pid=".113.0/2">I first became involved in issues in Burma when I was approached by a constituent, the late Bruce Humphrey-Taylor, an elder of the Karen nation. He had fought for the British Army during the war and had a spent a lifetime working in my constituency. On his retirement, he and his wife discovered a young relative who was living in a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees camp on the Thai border. Having lost her family in the terror of that awful regime, she had been a victim of the abuses of human rights that the hon. Gentleman described. I hope that one thing unites all of us who are present in this Chamber: that her case was genuine&mdash;that she was a genuine refugee&mdash;and that it was absolutely right on humanitarian grounds that the Government allowed her to join her only living relatives in the United Kingdom in 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".113.0/3">It was a great move by the British Government. That person is now settled: she has gone through her UK nationality qualification and learned English, and she is holding down a job in one of our hospitals. Having examined her case and spoken to her&mdash;and to Bruce, before he died&mdash;about the abuses, I became convinced that there were additional pressures that we could apply. The hon. Gentleman described some of them extremely well. I broadly agreed with the five points that he made, and I totally agree&mdash;as, I hope, do our Government&mdash;that the current European Union sanctions are grossly inadequate, and that more can and must be done.</p>
	<p pid=".113.0/4">Dealing with the oil industry is a problem. As my hon. Friend the Minister knows, my constituency is dominated by the petrochemical industry. Because of the global nature of the economics of the oil industry, it would be difficult to pursue the suggestion of putting pressure on Total, but if there is a way of doing that, we should try and unearth it and make it happen, because that would be a very valuable step.</p>
	<p pid=".113.0/5">It is one of the great ironies of this topic that Burma has the potential to be an extremely wealthy nation. It has enormous mineral wealth, not only in terms of oil but in other reserves, and it has great potential with regard to tourism and other economic activities. That Burma is not fully exploiting its economic potential is a tragedy, not only for the 600,000 displaced persons&mdash;that figure is probably higher now&mdash;or for the thousands of people the regime has tortured and the villages it has destroyed, but for the nation as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".113.0/6">We should certainly be doing more through the EU, but I also believe that more can be done through our work in helping China's economic development. There is a trade in arms across the Chinese border. It is not as strong as it used to be, but it is still the key supply chain for arms, as it has been for a considerable number of years. However, many western European weapons have been identified as well. We must try to close any loopholes that exist in the supply of arms to the regime from both Europe and China.</p>
	<p pid=".113.0/7">The hon. Gentleman mentioned genocide. I am familiar with the technical arguments about the legal definitions of genocide. It is an interesting subject; indeed, I was involved in a discussion of it several years ago in an Adjournment debate in this Chamber. However, I merely ask my hon. Friend the Minister to put himself in the position of the people who inhabited some of the villages that have been burned down and to try to understand the situation they face. Yes, there may be a technical argument about whether what has happened strictly falls within the UN definition of genocide, but it does not mean that no action should be taken. We should find ways, as the hon. Gentleman says, of naming and shaming countries like Burma.</p>

	<p pid=".114.0/1">The hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but am I right in thinking that, since 1996, no fewer than 2,500 villages in eastern Burma have effectively been destroyed?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.114.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1569" speakername="Andrew Miller" colnum="114"  time="14:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h03.htm#50615h03_spnew7">
	<p pid=".114.1/1">I have seen figures on that scale. Looking at the number of displaced persons, one would take that to be a sensible figure. As we discovered in a ping-pong match with the Home Office when I was trying to persuade them that Hilda should be able to come to the UK&mdash;they said &quot;Where are her papers?&quot; and her papers, of course, had been burned with the village&mdash;we do not truly know how many people were destroyed, because the records have all been destroyed.</p>
	<p pid=".114.1/2">All the evidence from people like Horton, and many others who have been brave enough to cross the border and look around, particularly in the east, suggests that the numbers are very significant. I certainly agree that the Horton report should be investigated. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to initiate some action on that front.</p>
	<p pid=".114.1/3">Similarly, on the issue of chemical weapons, I, too, have received the report. It was probably not from the same source, I have to say, as the one received by the hon. Member for Buckingham, but that it is coming to British Members of Parliament from different sources perhaps underlines the fact that it needs investigating.</p>
	<p pid=".114.1/4">The one area of the hon. Member for Buckingham's five suggestions where I think we must tread very carefully is how we manage the issue of the ASEAN chairmanship. It would be regarded as Britain at its imperial worst if we went around telling south-east Asia who should take office in various organisations that they are involved in. The point, however, is well made. We should try to encourage those countries that have already put their heads above the parapet and said, &quot;We do not want Burma as our chair&quot;, and try and work on Commonwealth countries in particular, where we may have some influence, to seek to persuade others to back the position that the hon. Gentleman has described. We must handle that with great care and put our best diplomats to work on how we achieve that.</p>
	<p pid=".114.1/5">I shall finish&mdash;because I know many Members want to speak&mdash;where I started. The hon. Gentleman has done the House a service by raising this issue. I hope that we can continue, hopefully on a genuinely all-party basis across the House, to find ways of working with my hon. Friend the Minister to make progress in a country that has so much potential but is suffering so much and has done for such a long time.</p>

	<p pid=".115.0/1">I ask hon. Members present to do a little mental transposition and imagine that, instead of talking about Burma today, we are cast back in time and are talking about apartheid South Africa. The question I want everybody to ask his or her conscience is this: if we were indeed talking about apartheid South Africa, would we be satisfied with the measures that are being proposed and taken today in respect of Burma? I think the answer to that is, &quot;Not in the slightest.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".115.0/2">I am old enough to remember the agitation, the campaigns, the harassment and the pressure which were rightly applied to the apartheid regime. It was essentially a policy of allowing no political hiding place for that regime, or anyone or any company that did business with it. When I was an undergraduate, for example, there was a perfect parallel with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> has been talking about in relation to Total and its support for the Burmese junta: Barclays bank and its investments in South Africa. We were contemporaries, Miss Widdecombe, so you may remember some of the demonstrations in and around Oxford university against Barclays bank. They were very effective.</p>
	<p pid=".115.0/3">My mind goes back even further to the perennial problem that civilised democracies have in dealing with dictatorships. Do they try to reason with them or do they confront and defeat them? That great man Winston Churchill was right about this, as about so many other things. Once, at a reception at the German embassy, he was asked by a press attach&eacute; why he was so confrontational towards the Nazi regime. He replied: &quot;When a mad dog makes a dash for my trousers, I shoot him down before he can bite.&quot; In other words, there are some regimes that are so awful, so despicable and so brutal that they do not understand anything other than the pressure of force.</p>
	<p pid=".115.0/4">We have a dilemma in the world post the creation of the United Nations. Recently, in relation to Iraq, we have heard that the notion of overthrowing a Government simply for the purpose of regime change is considered illegal under international law. However, we have also heard that one of the very limited number of circumstances in which it is legitimate to try to overthrow regimes is when a humanitarian catastrophe is being perpetrated. It must be said that the record of the UN, the body originally conceived during the second world war as a world policeman, is not good in that respect. One has only to think of Rwanda, of the long delays before there were interventions in the Balkans, and of the uprisings in East Germany in 1953, in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, to know the powerlessness of a world body, particularly when the brutality is being carried out by a regime that is either a superpower itself or enjoys the protection of a superpower.</p>
	<p pid=".115.0/5">However, I am not an absolutist about such things and I take the view that just because one cannot intervene effectively against every abuse of human rights, that is no excuse for not intervening effectively against those abuses of human rights where effective intervention is possible. Burma, like Zimbabwe, seems a case in point. I am not here today to argue the case for military action, but to pose a dilemma. We hear it said that the leader of Burma's democrats takes the view that force is not the answer and that peaceful civil resistance will eventually triumph. I hope that she is right, but it certainly will not triumph without effective international and commercial pressure, which is so far nowhere near being applied.</p>
	<p pid=".115.0/6">We must recognise, however, that those regimes where real force was not applied lasted a very long time indeed. In his famous essay &quot;On Liberty&quot;, John Stuart Mill observed that there is no guarantee that liberty will always triumph. He said that history is replete with examples of liberty being thrown down and suppressed time after time and that it is only because there is a natural urge towards liberty that it will tend to revive itself and try again and again until it may be successful. The intellectually bankrupt Marxist regimes of the Soviet bloc lasted in excess of 40 years before imploding, despite repeated attempts to destabilise them from within by democratic means. The ghastly Soviet Union survived for more than 70 years before its internal contradictions brought it to an end. If the policy in Burma is to be passive resistance, the regime may continue for a considerable time, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> observed when referring to its longevity.</p>
	<p pid=".115.0/7">I am drawing my comments to a close because many hon. Members want to speak. Part of the Minister's winding-up speech will have been written for him. I do not blame him for that and have no advance knowledge of it, but I suspect that I know what the structure will be. Part of it will be descriptive and say what a terrible state of affairs there is in Burma, just as Ministers always say what a terrible state of affairs there is in Zimbabwe. Hon. Members should try to distinguish between that part of the Minister's speech, which I predict will occupy at least three quarters of his time, and the recommendations and proposals for action that will be included at the end of his comments. I am not optimistic that it will be a long list.</p>

	<p pid=".116.0/1">The hon. Gentleman talks about a lack of optimism. Clearly, an economic stranglehold around the country would be helpful in the case of Burma. However, one of the problems that has been alluded to is the fact that a key economic partner in this respect is China. It is a superpower and currently engaged with Microsoft in eliminating words such as &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; from the internet. So, the task is not an easy one and is not solely dependent on western Governments.</p>

	<p pid=".116.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is spot-on in his observation. That should be a cause for realising where pressure points are. Just as there are possibilities in this country for exerting pressure on Total if the campaigners get their act together, so there are possibilities for exerting pressure on China, which is anxious to improve its relationship with the west. Even as we speak, China is trying to engage in major commercial deals with both Europe and America, but should not be allowed to compartmentalise such ambitions and separate them from its behaviour in supporting the appalling regime in Burma.</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/2">I shall give a couple of examples of the way in which the Government have responded to typically perceptive questions from my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham. He asked the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/3" class="indent">&quot;what recent assessment has been made of the political situation in Burma?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/4">The reply was:</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/5" class="indent">&quot;We continue to believe that it is essential for the State Peace and Development Council to enter into a genuine and constructive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/6">It would have been helpful if the Nazi regime had entered into a genuine and constructive dialogue with all those democracies that it was in the process of undermining and overthrowing, but that would not have been a practical suggestion.</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/7">When my hon. Friend also asked the Foreign Secretary if he would</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/8" class="indent">&quot;(a) make representations to ASEAN to strip Burma of its chairmanship, (b) make it his policy not to participate in meetings with ASEAN under Burma's chairmanship and (c) urge ASEAN to suspend Burma&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/9">he was told:</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/10" class="indent">&quot;We are . . . concerned about Burma's forthcoming chairmanship . . . It is too early for the EU to take a decision on the approach it will take in July 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/11" class="indent">We will continue to take advantage of our regular bilateral and multilateral contacts with all ASEAN nations to encourage substantive change in Burma&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-25">25 May 2005</phrase>; Vol. 434, c. 132&ndash;34W.]</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/12">I finish where I began&mdash;with Churchill. Such recommendations are like Churchill trying to negotiate and appeal to the better nature of the mad dog as it approaches. One cannot negotiate and appeal to the better nature of mad dogs; one has to shoot them down before they can bite.</p>

	<p pid=".117.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> on obtaining the debate, on an excellent speech and on sharing with me the privilege of chairing of the all-party group on Burma. He has spoken more fluently than I ever could on the depth and gravity of human rights, and I do not intent to repeat any of what he has said.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/2">Let me turn briefly to how I see the Horton report, as we have already started to call it. It re-examines existing evidence according to the most recent expositions of international human rights law that come from the Rome statute that set up the International Criminal Court, and from the tribunals on Rwanda and Yugoslavia. It concludes&mdash;relying on those modern expositions&mdash;that the process of &quot;Burmanisation&quot; that the nasty military junta has implemented, could be seen as an attempt at genocide of the Karen, Karenni and Shan, who live in the eastern states. Of course, the eastern parts of Burma are the only parts to which there is access. We do not really know what is happening in many other parts of the country. It is a slow genocide, a concept that is recognised in international law, and consists not merely of the random killings and brutality that have been cited, but of forced relocation to places where people will inevitably die for want of food, hygiene, medical care, water and shelter and because of military incursions.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/3">It is asserted that the scale of human rights abuse set out by the hon. Gentleman, the flight of refugees en masse and the spread of drugs are a threat to international peace and security meriting an intervention under article 24 by the UN, which has a duty to act to restore international peace and security where they are in danger of disruption. That is a new link between the situation, which has previously been seen as confined to Burma, and the international community. That link well merits a close look. Of course, it is primarily a challenge for the UN, which would have to take the action, but our representative must also consider that argument closely.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/4">It is equally clear that the iniquities of the regime are not confined to the ethnic groups that have been mentioned: the lowland Burman people, too, suffer subjugation, forced relocation and forced labour. They, with all the other ethnic groups, reject the military regime and all it stands for and did so most clearly in 1990. The all-party group was lucky to have Dr. Sein Win, the Prime Minister in exile of the national coalition Government of Burma, and the UN representative Thaung Htun, to talk to us last week. He spoke of his dismay at what he sees as a sharpening of military action against those ethnic groups and cited that with other evidence to show that there is no evidence that the junta will ever compromise with its own people. I am paraphrasing, but I am not using words a million miles away from his. There is no hope of home-grown national reconciliation; consequently, the Burmese must look to us for help.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/5">A campaign led by the estimable Burma Campaign, which has been taken on by the all-party group, sends Aung San Suu Kyi birthday cards on her birthday. They know that the cards will not reach her, but the sending of a huge number of such cards will have some impact none the less. Tomorrow, there is a reception to make the points that we seek to make through such demonstrations. First, we are watching what is going on, which we hope will keep her that bit safer. Secondly, we know that the junta fears her&mdash;it fears her courage and her popularity and the fact that it is thrown into evil relief by her stance.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/6">Aung San Suu Kyi has repeatedly called for strong political and economic pressure against the junta. The EU measures that we participate in are very weak. Briefly, they consist of a visa ban on senior generals who do not want to come to us anyway; an asset freeze when less than &pound;4,000 is held in the EU by any member of the regime; and a ban on investment in state enterprises, which has not stopped a single piece of investment, since the Burmese law itself bans investment in state enterprises. In other words, the measures are entirely symbolic and the generals are used to living with condemnation.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/7">The EU common position is due for review after our presidency ends. I urge the Government to put it on the agenda for consideration before our presidency ends. I had the privilege of accompanying Glenys Kinnock, MEP, and other women on a visit to the Prime Minister last Friday to discuss the issue. We believe that he is inclined to ensure that the common position is put on the EU agenda, with a view to tightening it up, before our presidency expires. Is my hon. Friend the Minister able to confirm that that is indeed the intention?</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/8">It is imperative that the EU imposes a total investment ban&mdash;which is a slightly ironic thing to say in the present debate. If the Government carry through their apparent intentions but nothing follows from that, we must consider unilateral sanctions. It is perfectly plain that we can impose them, despite our initial concern that EU law would prevent us from doing so. A short piece of legislation might be required: it could easily be attached to another Bill and would, I am sure, be passed with all-party support. The UK is Burma's second largest trade partner, largely through the British Virgin Islands, which is not wholly out of our control. Our unilaterally imposing sanctions would send a very strong message.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/9">There has been a counter-argument that to the imposition of such sanctions is damaging to the poor. That brings me to ASEAN. Contrary to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> said, pressure has been put on ASEAN. I understand that Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philipines, Cambodia and Laos are all impressed by the need to prevent from Burma from taking the chair of ASEAN. Embarrassment about the action that western Governments might have taken in the Asian Ministers meeting after ASEAN if Burma had been the chair has played a part. I further understand that some compromise way of presenting its non-chairmanship has been arrived at, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman was a bit hard. I agree that China and India remain major problems; however, we trade strongly with both, so I wish to ask my hon. Friend the Minister, who has responsibilities for trade, what he can do to influence them.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/10">I shall speak briefly in support of what others have said about the UN. It is said that if we put a proposal on the UN agenda, the Chinese will veto it and the Burmese will regard that as a victory. It is not at all clear that that is the case. The Burmese democracy movement have asked us to put the matter on the agenda and it appears that if the junta fears anything at all, it is the UN Security Council. I am told that, although it took five days before 9/11 was reported in Burma, the most recent suggestion that Burma's affairs be put on the Security Council agenda was reported in 24 hours, which suggests that there is truth in the claim that Burma takes that body seriously.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/11">As the former colonial power in Burma, Britain has a particular responsibility to take the lead in bringing change to this monstrous state. I urge the Government to think one more time about Aung San Suu Kyi, whose 60th birthday we mark in this debate&mdash;in fact, her birthday is on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-19">19 June</phrase>. She is the public face of the long-suffering people of Burma. We must all encourage the British Government to beef up their act with the aim of ensuring that she and her people are the sooner freed.</p>

	<p pid=".120.0/1">I am indeed aware of that. In fact, I arranged with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" name="Nicholas Clegg">my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg)</phrase> to borrow a couple of his minutes, no doubt to be repaid on some future occasion. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> on securing this debate but will heap the customary praise on him afterwards, when time permits.</p>
	<p pid=".120.0/2">This Saturday, I shall be cutting a birthday cake for Aung San Suu Kyi in Kirkwall. The Amnesty International groups in Orkney and Shetland have already held events to raise awareness of Burma. I mention that because that it is worth stating that concern about Burma is not the preserve of <i>The Guardian</i>-reading residents of Islington. Revulsion at and concern about the regime in Burma are felt the length and breadth of this country. Indeed, that concern is regularly reflected in my constituency postbag.</p>
	<p pid=".120.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1569" name="Andrew Miller">The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller)</phrase> spoke about the impact of the oil industry in his constituency. I can easily associate with that, because the oil industry has been a potent force for good in my own constituency. Throughout the last 30 years it has brought us a great deal of economic prosperity and stability. However, it is worth taking a few minutes to contrast the way in which oil has benefited our communities with the way in which it has operated in Burma and, in particular, to make brief reference to Total. To the French, Total is not a problem. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> said, Total is the fourth largest oil company in this country. It has a turnover in the region of &pound;2.2 billion per annum and supplies about 11 per cent. of petrol and other fuels. It is one of the biggest suppliers of plastics in the United Kingdom. How much of that &pound;2.2 billion actually comes from the Government of this country? That is something that the Minister might wish to consider.</p>
	<p pid=".120.0/4">Total is funding the Burmese regime to a significant extent, and we know what the regime do with that money. The first down payment they got from the Yadana gas project was spent on buying 10 MiG jets from Russia. That is the political reality of the involvement of a company like Total in a place like Burma. We all know what the situation is in Burma and, as long as we know and fail to act, we are all diminished.</p>

	<p pid=".120.1/2">Since Mr. Carmichael has stolen two of my minutes already, I am conscious that I must be brief. I shall focus on two issues: first, the personal dignity of Aung San Suu Kyi and, secondly, what we might ask the Minister to do following the debate.

	<p pid=".121.0/1">I apologise. The letter stated that when Aung San Suu Kyi was questioned about her detention in an interview, she replied that she had never considered herself a prisoner and&mdash;pointing to her head&mdash;explained that she had always been free here, in her head. That statement and many others confirm that she can stand alongside many of the other great icons of freedom&mdash;Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi, Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa, all of whom are distinguished in our collective political memory as having fought for freedom in their own ways and in their own context. Any surprise that I feel about the role that Aung San Suu Kyi plays in our public debate centres on the fact that she does not yet have quite the same scale of acknowledgement that many other figures have in other countries and in the face of other tyrannies and oppression.</p>
	<p pid=".121.0/2">One message that comes through clearly from this debate is that we must all, collectively, redouble our efforts to make sure that Aung San Suu Kyi's dignity and the personal sacrifice that she has made in the name of her cause should be as widely acknowledged throughout the world as others' have been.</p>

	<p pid=".121.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that it is important to recognise that there are still 15 elected Members of the Burmese Parliament in prison and that, since 1990, more than 200 members of Parliament have either been detained or put in prison? As an elected representative himself, does he not think that that is a tragic state of affairs?</p>

	<p pid=".121.2/1">Indeed it is, and in almost every statement that is published about her views, Aung San Suu Kyi repeats that her plight and her conditions are as nothing compared with those of others who have fought alongside her. My objective was to stress that in our public debates and in the battle for the hearts and minds of decision makers and voters everywhere, it is important to personalise the conflict and to emphasise her role in it. It is legitimate to do that, not only in her name but in the names of all those whom she represents.</p>
	<p pid=".121.2/2">What should we do and what should we seek from the Government today? Many suggestions have been made, but in order to secure greater clarity, let me emphasise a few of them. First, the UK is about to assume the presidency of the European Union. If, as seems likely, the EU treaties do not change radically&mdash;that will no doubt be welcomed by others&mdash;the presidency will not come round to us again for 13 or 14 years, so that will be a unique opportunity. The presidency is able to place issues on the agenda, both formally and politically. I join others in urging the Government to do so in Burma's case, in order to put pressure on France and other countries that have been reluctant to ensure that the attitude of the EU is more muscular than it has been hitherto.</p>
	<p pid=".121.2/3">Secondly, we all recognise the realpolitik constraints on the Government if they attempt to put the issue on the agenda of the UN Security Council. However, politically, the very act of trying is important. Even if we do not succeed through a diplomatic manoeuvre in New York to put Burma on the agenda of the Security Council, the act of trying will be noted. If we try repeatedly over a prolonged period, it will be almost as important as placing the situation in Burma formally on the agenda. Thirdly, we must endeavour to ensure that the abhorrent regime in Burma does not assume the chairmanship of ASEAN.</p>
	<p pid=".121.2/4">My final point has been made by others, too. This weekend is Aung San Suu Kyi's 60th birthday, which provides an opportunity to afford her the oxygen of publicity that is so essential to her. I hope that all of us here and anybody who hears this debate will use that opportunity to cast a spotlight on a conflict and on the plight of that woman and all those whom she represents. For too long, the issue has not been sufficiently examined in this country or elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid=".122.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> on having initiated the debate in his usual passionate way. He is no Johnny-come-lately, but has long been a firm advocate of human rights. He was a good shadow Secretary of State for International Development and I hope that at some stage he will be recalled to the colours in that post.</p>
	<p pid=".122.0/2">Several hon. Members have referred to the anniversary of one person's incarceration, and have mentioned another anniversary&mdash;her birthday. May I mention an anniversary in which Burma will probably appear as a footnote? We in this country will soon make a great thing of commemorating of the end of the second world war in the far east&mdash;although not, of course, on the day on which the second world war ended in the far east. We will rightly remember the suffering of British people, but we should pause and remember the suffering of the Burmese people. We should remember not only what happened to them under the occupation, but the fact that thousands of British Commonwealth troops and civilians would not have survived had it not been for the courage of the Burmese people who assisted us. We should remember that as part of the commemoration and as a background to this debate on human rights.</p>
	<p pid=".122.0/3">We can agree about the extent of human rights abuse being committed in Burma by the military regime. It has been passionately described by a number of hon. Members. There is also consensus on what needs to be done to bring pressure to bear on the Burmese Government. The difficulty is in knowing to what pressures the Burmese Government will respond and whether the British Government and other members of the international community are applying those pressures.</p>
	<p pid=".122.0/4">Last Friday, purely by coincidence, I was fortunate to meet a constituent who, for obvious reasons, does not wish to be named in this debate&mdash;a man who, with his wife, has been working as a missionary on the Thailand-Burma border for the past 10 years. He asked me to speak about the plight of the Shan people and to emphasise, as a number of other hon. Members have done, the increasing level of persecution that they and others face. He particularly wanted to emphasise what he thought were the practical steps that the British Government could take. He was not asking for sanctions to be applied across the border or anything like that&mdash;he realised the difficulties of doing so&mdash;but he genuinely wanted the Government to apply specific pressure on the Burmese Government to which they might want to respond. Indeed, as my hon. Friend rightly emphasised at the beginning of the debate, we need to ask what the British Government can do to shift things along. It cannot be done immediately&mdash;it will take time&mdash;but what more can they do?</p>
	<p pid=".122.0/5">We have moved from engagement to targeted sanctions, and I would like to pull together some of the thoughts expressed by hon. Members and put some questions to the Minister. Perhaps cynically, I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> that the Minister and his civil servants might have second-guessed all our questions. In such debates, it is always interesting to see whether Ministers take notes. If they do not, either they have two brains and have thought of all our questions, or they merely wish to read a statement. I shall give this Minister the benefit of the doubt, hoping that he has prepared himself to meet the sort of questions that I shall put.</p>
	<p pid=".122.0/6">The first question is whether the Government will now raise the issue of human rights in the UN Security Council and whether they will do so unilaterally. As other hon. Members have said, we all know that such an effort might fail or be vetoed, but are the Government prepared in principle to try? Secondly, are the Government minded to follow the example of the United States Government under its Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and impose investment sanctions on Burma, even if those sanctions are unilateral? Are they prepared at least to consider doing so?</p>
	<p pid=".122.0/7">As many hon. Members said, Burma's geographical neighbours are crucial in influencing and bringing pressure to bear on the Burmese Government . What measures have the UK Government taken to persuade Burma's most powerful and influential neighbour, China, to reduce the support that it is giving to the Burmese military, without which the Burmese military would have incredible difficulty in carrying out the kind of genocidal actions that it has taken? To my mind, China is the crucial element in bringing pressure to bear on the Burmese military. What exchanges have the United Kingdom Government had with China about the support provided to refugees from ethnic minorities on its borders? The Chinese Government have a responsibility in that respect. In addition, what pressure and practical help can the UK Government put on the Thai Government to help the thousands of Shan refugees now camping out in Thailand? In the words of my constituent&mdash;as I mentioned, he was a missionary in that area&mdash;what pressure can be put on the Thais to be &quot;merciful&quot; to those refugees? I think that the Thai Government, often by sleight of hand, have done much to help the refugees on their country's border. We must think what our reaction would be if a similar thing happened to us.</p>
	<p pid=".122.0/8">Hon. Members mentioned the presidency of ASEAN in 2006. I agree with those who said that it would be counter-productive for Britain to demand loudly that Burma should not take up the presidency, as it would produce an exactly opposite reaction by many ASEAN members. However, I hope that the British Government are using their best offices to persuade the senior members of ASEAN that is not only in the interests of human rights but in the interests of ASEAN's public persona that Burma should not take up the presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".122.0/9">None of us is suggesting that there is a quick fix to the problem, but we are looking for effective action from the United Kingdom Government. In the words of my constituent, expressing what has been articulated by all hon. Members who have spoken, there should be vocal and public protests by the British public and the Government not only on behalf of those suffering from human rights violations in Burma who are represented here, but so that the Burmese Government cannot take silence to mean complicity.</p>

	<p pid=".124.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> on having secured the debate. I agree that it is appropriate that the House is considering Burma just before Aung San Suu Kyi's 60th birthday. I assure all hon. Members that the Government share the concerns expressed about the appalling human rights situation and, in particular, the suffering of political and ethnic groups who challenge the Burmese authorities' misrule.</p>

Members for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael), for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg) and for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson). We also heard important interventions from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1481" name="Julie Morgan">my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan)</phrase>. As the hon. Member for New Forest, East suggested, I could speak at great length about the situation in Burma; however, I propose not to do that, because hon. Members know the situation well. Instead, I shall explain the Government's position and cover the major points that have been raised in this constructive debate.</p>
	<p pid=".124.0/3">On a personal level, in the 37 days that I have been Minister for Trade, I have raised the issue of Burma with the Chinese ambassador, the Thai Deputy Prime Minister and the Japanese Vice-Foreign Minister. I also intend to raise the issue when I visit China next month. Burma is very much on my and the Government's agenda. Our commitment to Burma is to promote human rights, democratisation and sustainable development as far as we can using all the tools at our disposal. It is important that we discuss openly and frankly the action and pressure that we can bring to bear on the Burmese Government that will be effective. The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk focused on what effective action can be taken, and I agree with him that there is no quick fix or one measure that will change the appalling situation in that country.</p>
	<p pid=".124.0/4">I assure hon. Members that the British Government remain at the forefront of international efforts to press for improvements in human rights in Burma. We are working actively with our EU and international partners to promote reform and respect for human rights in Burma, and we will continue to do so during our EU presidency. I was at the meeting that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar, Glenys Kinnock and the Burma Campaign had with the Prime Minister on Friday. The Prime Minister is committed to doing what the UK Government can to take the issue forward during our EU presidency, and I assure Members that it will be on the agenda for the UK's G8 presidency. We believe that it is right and important that we keep raising the issue&mdash;as hon. Members have said, part of the issue is its profile.</p>

	<p pid=".125.0/1">I am interested what the Minister has said about sustainable development and the G8. One problem for Burma is that even in war zones where ceasefires have been agreed, there is still difficulty with sustainability because the army is confiscating land, which is causing further internal displacement. Will the Minister take that on board when dealing with the Burmese Government?</p>

	<p pid=".125.1/1">We need to take a range of issues on board. Human rights violations have been highlighted in successive highly critical UK co-sponsored resolutions on Burma in the United Nations General Assembly and in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. We played a key role in drafting both last year's UN General Assembly resolution and this year's UN Commission on Human Rights resolution on Burma. They reflect the deep international concern about the situation in Burma and the human rights abuses committed by the Burmese authorities against their people.</p>
	<p pid=".125.1/2">The Government firmly support the mandate of Professor Pinheiro, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and we urge the regime to allow him regular, unrestricted access to Burma. As hon. Members will appreciate, one of the difficulties that we face is that good, reliable information about what is going on in parts of the country is hard to obtain. It is important not only that the Burmese authorities are aware of our views, but that they respond and do something about the problems. The UK, as part of the EU troika, expressed its deep concern about the situation in Burma directly to the Burmese Foreign Minister in Kyoto on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-06">6 May</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-16">16 May</phrase>, our ambassador in Rangoon drew to the attention of the Burmese Foreign Minister the high level of concern in both Houses about human rights in Burma.</p>
	<p pid=".125.1/3">We continue to believe&mdash;the hon. Member for Buckingham raised this issue&mdash;that it is essential that the regime enters into a genuine, inclusive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy. That might be a pious hope, but it is important to continue to put pressure on the regime to reform itself. Only such a dialogue can promote a peaceful democratic future for all Burmese people.</p>

	<p pid=".125.3/1">I do not believe that the Burmese Government are getting a mixed message from us. The Government have made their views about Burma extremely clear and will continue to do all they can to improve human rights in that country. However, primary responsibility lies with the State Peace and Development Council; the answer lies in its hands. For a start, it must begin to spend less on itself and its cronies and more on health and education. One telling fact is that the regime spends less than $2 per person per year on health and education combined.</p>

	<p pid=".126.3/4">The National League for Democracy spokesman recently reiterated that it is not the NLD's policy to call for sanctions. We have to bear in mind the circumstances of the people in Burma. If the NLD is not explicitly calling on us to impose broad sanctions, we have to take account of that fact. We need to see whether there is something more effective that we can do, and I am happy to engage in debate and dialogue with people on that.</p>

	Electricity Transmission Charges
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.128.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" speakername="Michael Weir" colnum="128"  time="16:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h04.htm#50615h04_spnew0">
	<p pid=".128.1/1">I welcome the Minister to what is probably his first debate on electricity transmission charges. He will probably think his new position as byzantine as his previous one. Electricity transmission charges have been a hotly debated issue throughout the implementation of the British electricity trading and transmission arrangements&mdash;BETTA for short. The charges were raised during the passage of the Energy Act 2004 during the last Parliament and managed the unlikely feat of uniting my party with the former Member for Cunninghame, North, Brian Wilson, in opposition to them.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/2">The charges proposed by Ofgem would be a disaster for Scotland. It is ironic that when the Prime Minister is jetting around Europe in an attempt to get agreement on tackling climate change at the G8 summit, which is to be held in Scotland, the Government at Westminster are making decisions that could strangle the prospect of renewable energy development in Scotland. On the one hand, the Government say that climate change is the biggest issue facing us, but on the other they sabotage efforts to tackle it. The more cynical among us might think that that is not unconnected with recent attempts to talk up the prospects of nuclear power.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/3">When the matter was first raised during the passage of the Energy Act 2004 in the House of Lords, the Government reacted by inserting a clause that would give exemption from those charges to an area especially favourable for renewable energy. It had been widely assumed that that area was the north of Scotland and the island areas. However, there are serious deficiencies in the proposals. For one thing, the derogation is for only five years, with the power to extend for a further single period of five years. The mathematicians among us will readily work out that that gives a total period of only 10 years. However, it is important to remember that the exemption&mdash;as I understand it&mdash;is for an area and not for specific projects, so only projects up and running at the time the exemption is introduced will get the full benefit of 10 years' reduction; any project coming later will get a tapering relief, if any at all. It should also be borne in mind that the payback period for many such projects will be far longer than 10 years, and that anyone investing in them will face the prospect of massive increases in transmission charges mid-way through their project.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/4">If the Minister takes nothing else from this debate, I urge that he gives serious consideration to this matter, and if the ridiculous transmission charges are to remain, I urge that he addresses the problem and considers making the exemption project-based within a specified area to allow for the continuing development of renewable energy. Each project set up and running within that area would then get the full benefit of a 10-year exemption, which would go some way at least to tackle the problems that the transmission charges will impose on those renewable projects.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/5">The situation has been made much worse by the attitude taken by Ofgem, which has recommended the charges. It seems to be governed not by the real world, but by some mad economic model of its own. During the passage of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1964" name="Alex Salmond">the 2004 Act, my hon. Friend the Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond)</phrase> and I met representatives of Ofgem to discuss their attitude to the charging regime. It was a very unfulfilling experience. Ofgem seemed to be totally dominated by a fixation that charges should be used to send economic signals and that generating capacity should be sited near centres of population, which, in its view, seemed to be mainly in the southern part of England. The representatives were asked three times whether they supported the Government's aim on renewable generation; three times they refused to reply to that question.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/6">The whole idea of locational charging is based on a misconception. The desire to locate energy generation near population centres can have a superficial attraction, but cannot be done under the present centralised generation and transmission system. Greenpeace has done work on local systems, and I understand that it is to produce a report later this summer that will argue that addressing the distribution system must be at the heart of the climate change agenda. Under the current system, the charging regime completely fails to take into account the fact that remote areas are the most efficient places for energy generation, and in particular for renewable energy generation. Instead of letting comparative advantage dictate where energy is produced in a manner that would be beneficial to all, locational pricing attempts, in effect, to second-guess the marketplace by using effective subsidies or taxation to force energy production into less resource-efficient areas.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/7">I understand that losses through transmission are only between 2 and 4 per cent., depending on distance, but locating power stations in places with greater resources delivers between 25 and 33 per cent. more power. That implies that a 1 GW wind farm with 50 per cent. capacity will lose 10 MW, but as a result of increased efficiency will generate between 100 and 150 MW extra energy. Therefore, it does not make sense to insist on locational pricing.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/8">When questions were asked of Ofgem at a meeting, its rationale seemed to be that there are many applications for generation in northern Scotland so there is no need for encouragement there, but there is a need for encouragement in other areas. I pointed out that there were so many applications in northern Scotland because that was the obvious place to site renewable energy developments. The odd thing is that Ofgem accepted that most of the applications were for renewable generation, but that did not seem in any way to impinge on its views on locational charging. Reality seemed to impinge little on its closed world. It still felt that there needed to be some encouragement for generation in the south of England.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/9">Ofgem's stance is bizarre. I think that we all now agree that climate change is a major danger. Even at today's Prime Minister's questions, the Prime Minister cited a report by the G8 nations' academies of science that advances that view. There is a suggestion that even President Bush is beginning to get the message. That being the case, we need to move towards renewable energy, and the regulator should not put barriers in the way of renewable generation in Scotland in favour of new generation in southern England. Perhaps it is the case that the regulator would prefer there to be new nuclear power plants in Surrey than renewables generation in Scotland, although it is doubtful whether the people of Surrey would agree.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/10">There is an argument that the Minister should take on board. The role of Ofgem in this entire matter must be looked into, and in particular whether its remit is sufficient to cover the new renewable energy sector&mdash;although, in my view, it should be got rid of altogether and something new should be put in its place. However, perhaps the need to meet carbon emission targets should be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/11">I was a member of the Scottish Affairs Committee in the last Parliament. We undertook an investigation into Scotland's energy needs, during the course of which we looked into the whole question of transmission charges. That subject was brought up by Scottish and Southern Energy, which is the main energy producer in the north of Scotland. Its chief executive commented on the effect that the charges will have on renewables, and he referred in particular to a hydroelectric project that his company was undertaking. He said:</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/12" class="indent">&quot;We are currently trying to consent a new hydro station at Glendoe on the banks of Loch Ness and the economics of that are being directly affected by transmission charges, and that makes a marginal project probably uneconomic. I am not saying I will not be doing it here, but there is clearly a marginal project that is being affected.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/13">From recent discussions with him, I understand that there has been a substantial increase in the costs of that project, partly because of the transmission charges.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/14">Similarly, those behind the Beatrice project in the Moray firth have suggested that transmission charges could have an effect on that project, costing it up to &pound;20 million per year. That is important because that offshore wind project will generate as much electricity as a new nuclear power station, and I am sure that most people in Scotland would very much prefer there to be a wind farm in the Moray firth than a nuclear power station in the north of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/15">It is worth remembering that these charges do not only affect renewables. They will affect conventional generation in the north of Scotland, in particular the Peterhead station, which is the most efficient combined gas station in Europe. What will be the impact of the charges? I refer the Minister to the report of the Scottish Affairs Committee entitled, &quot;Meeting Scotland's Future Energy Needs&quot;. The Committee was not stuffed full of nationalist members. I was the only nationalist member. In fact, it had a substantial Labour majority. The report contained trenchant criticism of the transmission charging regime proposed by Ofgem. It states:</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The effect of this is that it costs between &pound;23 and &pound;26 million more to operate a gas-fired power station in Aberdeenshire than one in South West England.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/17">Scottish and Southern Energy commented that</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/18" class="indent">&quot;our Peterhead power station will pay &pound;18 a kilowatt for every kilowatt it has connected. A power station in the central belt of Scotland will pay around &pound;12 a kilowatt. A power station in the north of England will pay around &pound;5. A power station in the Somerset area will <i>receive </i>&pound;5, so you have a very pronounced tilt.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/19">Under the scheme, there is in effect a subsidy for power generation in the south of England, as opposed to the north of Scotland. However, as I said earlier, the north of Scotland is the best area for most renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/20">Scottish and Southern Energy told the Select Committee that, under the proposals, Scotland would be the first place that a power station would be shut and the last place where one would be built. That has immense implications for the security of energy supply in Scotland and the future of power generation in Scotland. I am sure that the Minister will tell me that, under the British electricity trading and transmission arrangements, the interconnector charge is going and that will balance the cost to Scottish generators. The matter was put specifically to Scottish and Southern Energy when it was giving evidence to the Committee. It said that, for a big generator, that might be the case and that matters will balance themselves to some extent. However, it will not allow new generation and new renewables to come on line. Such projects are likely to be seriously hit by the charges.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/21">The Select Committee recommended an urgent review of the charges. I urge the Minister to take that on board. I understand that Scottish Power has launched a court case against Ofgem because of the charges and that matters have still to be determined. There is a prospect of a review of the charges taking place when they have been up and running for a time but, by then, generation in Scotland might have been damaged irrevocably. Such matters are important because Scotland has the potential to be the renewable powerhouse of Europe and to contribute greatly to the reduction of carbon emissions, both within the United Kingdom and throughout the European Union.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/22">Scotland has 25 per cent. of Europe's wind resources, 10 per cent. of Europe's wave capacity and 25 per cent. of the total tidal capacity. Indeed, the Pentland firth has been described as the Saudi Arabia of tidal power&mdash;an interesting thought. Scotland has the world's first commercial wave power station, but recently there has been talk about much of that being moved to Portugal, which would be seriously detrimental to Scotland. One of the major players in the wave generation market has recently been bought over by a German company, so we are already seeing some of the innovation in Scotland going to other nations, partly because of the lack of take-up of some of the technology. As I said earlier, that take-up will be hit by the fact that transmission charges are being imposed. It has an area exemption for a specified period rather than a project exemption.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/23">Scotland has the infrastructure and the professional expertise garnered from the oil and gas industry to create an important renewables industry. Denmark has a &pound;4 billion a year export industry, employing more than 15,000 people. Scotland could replicate that success in renewable energy only if it had a system in place with which to set up and operate renewable stations. The charges will undermine that potential and may force us to consider building new nuclear power stations&mdash;a move that would be fiercely resisted by the people of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".128.1/24">I urge the Minister to reconsider the charges and to ensure that Government targets for carbon emissions are met by taking control of the charging regimes from the ideologues at Ofgem.</p>

	<p pid=".131.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase> for securing the debate on this important issue. The debate is entitled, &quot;Electricity transmission charges&quot;, but the new transmission charging structure is a small part only of a much greater project&mdash;the BETTA project, as it is known. BETTA stands for the British electricity trading and transmissions arrangements; I hope that the hon. Gentleman and others in the Chamber do not mind if I refer to it as the BETTA project, although whether it is for better or worse may be the subject of this debate.</p>
	<p pid=".131.0/2">The BETTA project has had a profound effect on the Scottish electricity market. We cannot look at transmission charges in isolation. I stress to hon. Members that BETTA brings great benefits to Scottish consumers, who, for too long, had less choice and paid higher prices than their counterparts in England and Wales. As a Government who believe in competition and choice, we believed that to be unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".131.0/3">The hon. Gentleman expressed concern about the impact of transmission charges on the Scottish electricity industry. Those charges were set by the national grid and approved by Ofgem after extensive consultation with the industry over 18 months, during which there were many opportunities for industry representatives to feed in views. Any such views have been taken into account.</p>
	<p pid=".131.0/4">Let us remember what cost-reflective charging is intended to achieve. A cost-reflective system promotes the efficient use of the electricity transmission network, and hence the lowest-cost solutions for consumers, who ultimately have to pay. I emphasise that if charges did not reflect costs, the network would not develop efficiently and consumers would face higher electricity prices, which would harm industrial competitiveness and the fuel-poor.</p>
	<p pid=".131.0/5">I reiterate that BETTA is a package of measures, which must be looked at in the round. We have heard a lot about how transmission charges in Scotland have increased with BETTA, but BETTA is more than a new transmission charging structure. To consider transmission charges only would be to ignore the bigger picture.</p>
	<p pid=".131.0/6">Before BETTA, any Scottish generator that exported electricity to England and Wales had to pay separate charges to use the interconnector. Those charges disappeared under the BETTA arrangements and the merger of the Scottish electricity market with that of England and Wales. Indeed, connection charges are lower in Scotland as a result of BETTA, and Ofgem estimates that its overall effect on Scottish generation has been broadly neutral.</p>
	<p pid=".131.0/7">Let us not forget that a postage-stamp system of transmission charging, with which the rate does not vary geographically, would mean that Scottish electricity consumers would have to pay around &pound;46 million more in 2005&ndash;06 then they do now. Is that really what the hon. Gentleman wants? Surely it might lead to more fuel poverty in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".131.0/8">In short, the apparent increase in cost to Scottish generators has been misinterpreted or misunderstood due to a failure to look at the whole picture and, perhaps, a failure to consider the interests of the consumer, who is surely the person about whom we should be most concerned.</p>

	<p pid=".132.0/1">The Minister talks about the interconnector, but what about renewable energy? The Government say that we must have more renewable energy to meet our carbon emission targets, yet the transmission charges specifically hit new renewables. Taking away the interconnector charge will not help those developments.</p>

	<p pid=".133.0/1">I shall answer that question by moving on swiftly, as I shall cover that a page or so on in my speech.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/2">We need to recognise that Scottish generators are getting a different product in return for the transmission charge that they now pay. They have equal access to the entire British electricity market, which was not the case before. That is particularly good news for renewable generators, given that Scotland is already a net exporter of electricity. Instead of generators having to navigate different sets of rules and pay additional charges to access the market in England and Wales, there is a single British market with a single set of rules. Generators have easy access to a wider range of customers and can negotiate the best prices for their output.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/3">The Government regard the development of a range of renewable energy sources as a vital element in reducing carbon emissions and addressing climate change, and the role that Scotland will play is crucial. The energy White Paper set the goal of putting ourselves on a path to cut the UK's carbon dioxide emissions by some 60 per cent. by about 2050 or, with real progress, by 2020. The Government have a clear target that 10 per cent. of electricity should come from renewable sources by 2010. We also have an aspiration to double that figure to 20 per cent. by 2020 or thereabouts.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/4">In Scotland, the Executive have set a target of securing 40 per cent. of generation from renewable sources by 2020. We recognise Scotland's great potential for a range of renewable technologies: onshore and offshore wind and, in time, wave and tidal power. The fact that Scotland is a centre of excellence in this respect was apparent to me on a recent visit to Aberdeen.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/5">The renewables obligation encourages electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of power from renewables. It is already securing effective exploitation of wind resources and should, in time, assist development of other technologies on a commercial scale. We do not believe that transmission charges will impede the growth of renewables nationally. BETTA is essential to the growth of renewables in Scotland, as the hon. Gentleman will agree&mdash;at least I hope he will.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/6">I am well aware of the exceptional potential that the Scottish highlands and islands offer as a location for wind farms and, possibly, wave and tidal generation. I had discussions about that a while ago, when I was in the Western Isles. That is why the Government recently announced our intention to exercise the section 185 power in the Energy Act 2004 to adjust transmission charges for renewable generators on the Scottish islands. We shall consult on that in the summer. Not only will it help the Government to meet our renewables targets and so fulfil environmental objectives; local communities will also benefit. That is particularly important given that disposable household incomes on the islands are some 20 per cent. below the national average.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/7">Underlying all this is the need to do what is best for consumers. BETTA has already delivered more choice and better value for Scottish consumers. On a related matter, which will be of particular interest to the hon. Gentleman, as his constituents are benefiting, we introduced a new scheme to replace the now-defunct hydro-benefit scheme in the north of Scotland. That is of huge benefit for anyone who lives or works there. It will bring in &pound;40 million a year to offset the high cost of distributing electricity in the sparsely populated areas. We also put the common tariff obligation on a firm legal footing, which will protect consumers in remote parts of Scotland from the threat of discriminatory electricity pricing.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/8">Those examples show how the Government are responding to the particular needs of communities in the north of Scotland. We have ensured that the relatively remote location of some Scottish communities is no barrier to an affordable electricity supply. I again emphasise the Government's strong commitment to renewables as a major source of energy, not least in Scotland, in the foreseeable future.</p>

	Gedling Local Plan
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-15.135.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" speakername="Paddy Tipping" colnum="135"  time="16:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050615/halltext/50615h05.htm#50615h05_spnew0">
	<p pid=".135.1/1">I am most grateful for the opportunity to debate the Gedling local plan, which has been in gestation for a number of years and is now coming to a head. People who live in the area covered by Gedling borough council&mdash;6,500 of whom have objected to the Gedling local plan&mdash;will be delighted about the debate. I have no doubt that they will read and follow the proceedings carefully.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/2">The intention of the debate is to raise the profile of the issue in the highest levels of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. There is real concern, and a real desire for action to be taken. I know that the Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister are aware of the problems and the situation because I wrote to them, first on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April</phrase> and subsequently on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-09">9 May</phrase>, pointing out that the Deputy Prime Minister had powers to intervene in the local plan process.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/3">I appreciate that the Minister's officials, both in his office and at the Government office for the east midlands, have been considering the issues involved and making inquiries. I also appreciate that because the matter is, in a sense, quasi-judicial the Minister is constrained in what he can say today. I suspect that he will be reluctant to speak directly about the Gedling borough council local plan, but I hope that he will be prepared to talk in general terms about the planning policies and issues involved. I hope that he will listen to my final plea, which will be for the Deputy Prime Minister to make an early decision about whether he intends to intervene in the plan process.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/4">At the outset, I say that it is not all bad news. Gedling borough council has been working on the local plan since 1996. It has been a tortuous process. There have been real difficulties. One of the positive features has been that there has been tremendous public consultation, and a revision of the plan at various stages. I am not critical of any of the members of Gedling borough council personally, or of any of their officials&mdash;quite the contrary. Bob Wilson, the local plan manager, has been diligent and hard-working and is always sensitive and willing to help. He has been willing to respond to many questions. The leader of the council, Councillor Ivan Gollop, has also been involved&mdash;he has attended many meetings in the borough and considered the issues involved closely. There is no doubt in my mind that, if it were possible, he would be keen to protect and preserve the green belt.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/5">However, we are where we are. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-01">1 June 2005</phrase>, just a few days ago, Gedling borough council decided to adopt the local plan. The process is not over. I understand that there is a notification of intention to adopt that will run until <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July</phrase>. Following that, I am told that there is a six-week period in which people who wish to consider a legal challenge&mdash;such as a judicial review or a challenge in the High Court&mdash;can take action.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/6">So, although there has been a long period of preparing the plan and the council has made a decision, there is still time for action. The action that I want taken is that which I outlined in my letters of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-09">9 May</phrase>. I want the Deputy Prime Minister to become more directly involved and to consider some of the planning issues. I also know that there is a strong possibility that local people will mount a challenge in the High Court.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/7">I should mention one of the paradoxes of the case. The local parish councils, Linby, Papplewick, Ravenshead and Bestwood, have all taken legal advice. They have been prepared to use parishioners' money to buy legal advice and to share it with Gedling borough council. It is rather sad that although the borough council has had the benefit of that legal advice, and although it has sought its own legal advice, in a sense to try to resolve the situation, on two occasions it has not been prepared to make that advice available to the parish councils. There should be a sense of equity. There is an issue about who pays for the legal advice. Clearly, it is the residents living in the borough council area who are affected by that advice. It is very sad that the borough council will not share its advice, even though the parish councils, keen to make compromises, find a way forward and have discussions, have been open about theirs.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/8">There is no doubt in my mind, talking to the parish councils and local people, that there is a strong possibility of a challenge being mounted in the High Court. I should explain to the Minister why there is such concern and action. We are seeing real community involvement and real community politics. There is a strong feeling in the north of the Gedling borough council area that the council is making the wrong decision, that the local plan is fundamentally flawed, that it is bad in principle and that it will produce the wrong results.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/9">Let me highlight the reasons for that feeling. First, we all&mdash;the Government in particular&mdash;believe in the development of brownfield sites before intrusion into greenfield sites and the green belt. Let me be blunt: that will not happen with the Gedling local plan. The council is clear about that. It does not even pretend that that is the aspiration. It accepts that if the local plan goes through as it is currently envisaged, there will be large-scale housing development in the green belt before more sustainable sites&mdash;such as Teal close, close to the Nottingham conurbation, and, more particularly, the former Gedling colliery site, a brownfield site where the colliery has been closed for years&mdash;are developed. That is plainly wrong. The Government's planning advice is clear. It is now universally accepted that brownfield development should take place before greenfield and green belt development. However, that will not happen if this local plan is adopted. We will see areas of north Nottinghamshire being built on for housing very quickly indeed.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/10">Let me identify some of the sites. They include Top Wighay farm in Linby, a conservation area. Linby is a picturesque village with a historic background, situated as far towards the border of the north-west of the Gedling borough council area as one can get. The site has been identified for large-scale housing allocation and employment use. That is not sustainable development; it is the borough council pushing development right to the edge of its patch. It is no wonder that the neighbouring council, Ashfield district council, which comes right up to the border, is objecting strongly. In fact, the consequences of development at Top Wighay will have profound effects on Hucknall in the Ashfield district council area, rather than on the rest of the Gedling borough council area. People say to me, &quot;It doesn't make sense,&quot; and it does not.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/11">Cornwater in Ravenshead is another example. Ravenshead is a large, wealthy village, from which many people commute into Nottingham and Mansfield. There, a site next to the leisure centre has been identified for housing. Finally, I should mention Dark lane in Calverton. As its name suggests, it is an old green lane with historic connotations&mdash;a place of real beauty, which is soon to be built over for housing.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/12">I cannot get an answer from the borough council as to why it is pursuing policies that will ensure that those sites are developed before, say, the Gedling colliery site. That is an area of significant dereliction which has been identified for major housing development, yet the borough council accepts that its development will not take place until long after development on the greenfield sites and green belt. I want the Minister to make inquiries, both of the borough council and of the East Midlands Development Agency, which owns the site, to find out why there has been such a delay in putting in the infrastructure at Gedling colliery site and bringing it to the market.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/13">One of the issues is that, at the insistence of Nottinghamshire county council, a spine road needs to be put in to allow the colliery site to develop. I shall come to that council in a moment. I do not believe that Gedling colliery is too difficult to develop; we should make haste there. Perhaps I should turn to Teal close in Netherfield. The site was discounted by the planning inspector in May 2004. At that point, he reported that the site was by the River Trent and was liable to flooding. In fairness to the Environment Agency&mdash;I commend its work in Nottinghamshire&mdash;I should say that it has now confirmed that the site will not flood.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/14">Teal close is available for development, and could be used for housing and employment. It edges on to the built-up area. It is in the constituency of the Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase>, who, because of his other duties, cannot speak on these matters. He, too, has been involved with the people who are concerned about development on the green belt, and is anxious about the matter. Teal close is available for development. Again, it requires an access road to be put in by Nottinghamshire county council, and again the council has underestimated the cost of the road and, as a result, the timetable for the development has slipped. It must be right, in principle, in planning terms for the Gedling colliery site and Teal close to be developed before Greenfield sites such as Top Wighay, Cornwater and Dark lane.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/15">Secondly, the notion of a sequential approach to housing development&mdash;identifying the most appropriate sites to develop first, then moving on to the less environmentally desirable ones&mdash;has simply been disregarded in the Gedling local plan. In the north of the Gedling borough, there is a planning auction. Planning applications have been made for housing on Top Wighay, on Cornwater and at Dark lane. Unless we get a grip of the planning process, we shall see new housing built on those sites very quickly. So much for sequential development&mdash;brownfield before greenfield.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/16">I shall make a prediction: the kind of housing that will be built there will not meet local needs. I anticipate that the housing that will be built at Top Wighay will be what I call ranch-style executive homes: five-bedroomed houses with room for two cars on the drive. What we really need, if we want housing that meets local needs, is smaller housing nearer to town centres. What drives the housing market is the fact that many of us are living longer and that more families are splitting up, divorcing and therefore needing two houses. We do not need ranch-style executive homes; we need smaller housing nearer town centres, but that will not happen under the Gedling local plan.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/17">Thirdly, and most significantly, all the housing development is simply unnecessary. If the borough council acted sensibly and professionally and used the latest information, there would be no need for such housing allocations. The Gedling local plan is based on the existing structure plan, but as the Minister will know&mdash;his officials have been looking at this&mdash;a new structure plan is emerging in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire. That plan was helped by the panel report on the joint structure plan that was published in September 2004. That allocates 1,000 fewer houses to Gedling borough council. Put bluntly, if the borough council were to choose the new reduced housing figures&mdash;and there is nothing to prohibit that choice&mdash;there would be no need for housing on any greenfield or green belt site.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/18">The new structure plan would be in place very quickly. Nottingham city and Nottinghamshire county councils are to discuss the new structure plan at their joint committee on planning and transportation on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-15">15 July</phrase>, and they intend to adopt the new plan by the end of the year. I understand that if the Secretary of State chooses not to intervene, a legal challenge will be mounted. It may be that we will have a new structure plan with 1,000 fewer houses, whereas the old structure plan still has those 1,000 houses&mdash;and Gedling borough's local plan is dependent on the old structure plan. Put simply, the day that the Gedling local plan is adopted, it will be out of date.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/19">The council should take into account planning policy guidance note 12, which makes it clear that councils should use the most recent and relevant information, but it is simply not doing that. Perversely, at one point the local plan process was put on hold while the joint panel report was published. There was an expectation that the borough council would take the new figures into account, but on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-01">1 June</phrase> the council decided firmly and finally not to do so. I am not sure why that happened, and local people are not sure either, but there are rumours, and I want to focus on the role of Nottinghamshire county council.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/20">I pointed out earlier that the development of the Gedling colliery site was dependent on a new road, which the county council was insistent on. The development of Teal close is also dependent on a new road, again to be provided by the county council. It is important to see what local politicians are saying locally. Gedling is a balanced council where the leadership rotates, and the last leader of the council, my good friend Councillor Roland Spencer, said that</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/21" class="indent">&quot;the county council spent a lot of money making their case. Our legal advice is that if we turn it down they would take us to court and put it back anyway.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/22">The county council is so keen to have the development on Top Wighay that during the inquiry on the Gedling local plan it spent a cool &pound;450,000 on consultancy fees, reports and feasibility studies to ensure that Top Wighay was included. I find it crazy and it makes me angry that one public authority is threatening another with legal action, which will be funded by the local people. That is not right. The county council should look closely at its activities as a landowner.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/23">There is a potential conflict. The county council is the strategic planning authority. It is also a landowner that has told me directly that it has been offered &pound;132 million for the sale of Top Wighay. What makes matters worse is that the county council has a policy of devolving, giving 10 per cent. of the capital receipt to the local borough council. The county council will receive &pound;132 million and Gedling borough council will receive a &pound;13 million cut. I cast no aspersions, but I will just tell the Minister what local people say about that: the local plan is driven by financial gain for the county council and Gedling borough council.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/24">I want to quote from two of the letters that I have received. The first is from Margaret Kerr of Papplewick, in the affected area. She said that she was told that</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/25" class="indent">&quot;I should be lobbying Notts County Council&mdash;not Gedling.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/26" class="indent">Notts County Council own Top Wighay site and have already spent almost half a million pounds on external agencies to promote it for development. It is suggested that they stand to gain &pound;130 million if this area was removed from the greenbelt. Gedling could reasonably expect &pound;13 million pounds as their 'reward'.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/27" class="indent">I am extremely concerned that these financial considerations appear to be overriding planning criteria.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/28">I share her concerns, as do many people locally.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/29">Patricia Andrews, who lives at Ravenshead, wrote to me more specifically. She said that her</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/30" class="indent">&quot;concern is also with the ownership of the land. I understand that some of the land is owned by the Cabinet member for Finance and Property at Nottinghamshire County Council and that the husband of the leader of the Conservative Group on Nottinghamshire County Council also owns a part.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/31">That was in relation to land at Ravenshead. My own view is that both the people named have acted impeccably and there can be no impropriety. However, there is certainly a view that the planning process is being abused.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/32">I am extremely grateful for the work that the Minister's officials have put into the matter. I said at the outset that I did not expect a definitive answer today. I want the Minister to outline the planning principles and processes involved. However, I say to him, to the Secretary of State through him and to the wider audience who closely follow our proceedings that there is still time to act. There is widespread dissatisfaction with the planning process. There is a view that it has not been transparent. There is a strong view, which is right and correct, that development should take place on the brownfield sites before the greenfield sites. Once lost, greenfield sites and the green belt can never be recreated.</p>
	<p pid=".135.1/33">I am pleased to have had the opportunity to raise the issue today and to work closely with the local parish councils and local people. To put it bluntly and simply, there is still time to act. It has been a long planning process, but it is not over yet. People in north Nottinghamshire and the Gedling area want to leave a legacy of green fields for their children and grandchildren. They are right. I am delighted at the fight so far. I remain an optimist. I believe that we can win the battle, and it is a battle that I am proud to support.</p>

	<p pid=".140.0/1">I welcome you, Miss Widdecombe, to the Chair for this important debate and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> on securing it.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/2">My hon. Friend acknowledges that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the merits of specific policies or allocations proposed in the Gedling replacement local plan, as it could prejudice the First Secretary of State's impartiality in fulfilling his statutory responsibilities. However, I am able to discuss the important issue of the need to ensure sustainable development through the development plan system in relation to the Gedling borough replacement local plan process.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/3">First, I must emphasise the Government's commitment to a plan-led system for sustainable land use. The preparation of development plans is the most effective way of reconciling the demand for development and the protection of the environment. It plays a key role in contributing to a strategy for sustainable development by helping to provide the necessary development locations, yet it does not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/4">The Government are also committed to reforming and enhancing the system. In line with that, we successfully introduced the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, the first planning Act for more than a decade. It represents our commitment to a fundamental reform of the planning system that will nurture a strategic, proactive force for creating inclusive, accessible, safe and sustainable communities. Planning is about improving the quality of life and of places.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/5">The 2004 Act establishes a system for making better plans and better planning decisions more quickly. It introduces a simpler, more flexible plan-making system in the shape of local development frameworks. LDFs are made up of a suite of planning documents covering various aspects of spatial planning instead of a single all-encompassing local plan. In addition to being faster and more flexible, the new system also strengthens community and stakeholder involvement, and it allows people to be involved from the outset and throughout the plan-making process. Local planning authorities are required to set out their plans for creating a local development framework in a local development scheme, or LDS.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/6">I am pleased that Gedling met the statutory target date of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-28">28 March</phrase> for submitting an LDS to the First Secretary of State, and I am pleased that it has been agreed by him. The LDS demonstrates Gedling's commitment to producing a local development framework. Under the new system, Gedling has agreed to produce a core strategy setting out its spatial vision, strategic objectives and core policies for the borough, a set of generic development control policies, site-specific allocations setting out where future development will take place, an area action plan for Arnold, and a statement of community involvement setting out how the community and stakeholders will be involved in the process. Gedling has undertaken to bring those documents to adoption between 2006 and 2011. I urge my hon. Friend to maintain his obvious interest in planning in the borough under that the process, and I ask him to encourage his constituents to take up the opportunities that the new system brings with it.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/7">I turn from the future to the present, and the substance of today's debate. I welcome the opportunity to look at the Gedling plan. Local authorities have the responsibility of being the plan-making authority for land use. It is their job to bring forward local plans that meet the needs of their areas, in line with Government guidance, and national and regional planning policy. The First Secretary of State's role in the local plan process is to scrutinise development plans to identify whether they are consistent with national and regional guidance and whether there are conflicts with the guidance that do not appear to be justified by local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/8">At present, we are in a transitional period during which the old-style development plans will be replaced by new-style LDF documents. We are keen for local planning authorities to move as soon as possible to the new development plan system in accordance with procedures under the 2004 Act. During the transitional period, we wish to maintain continuity in the development plan system and minimise transitional costs. Local planning authorities, such as Gedling, that are in the process of bringing forward plans under the old system are allowed by the 2004 Act to continue that work through to adoption. That was vital to ensure that detailed work and community involvement previously carried out would not be wasted, and to avoid the potential for a planning policy vacuum.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/9">As my hon. Friend is aware, the first statutory stage of the Gedling replacement local plan process took place in February 2000 with the publication of the deposit draft. The council received duly made objections and produced a revised deposit draft just over two years later, in May 2002. Objectors to the proposals were, of course, given an opportunity to voice their concerns, and were heard by an independent inspector appointed by the First Secretary of State at the planning public local inquiry held in March to August 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/10">The inspector made his conclusions based on the evidence presented to him. He duly put forward his recommendations to the council in his report, which was submitted to the authority for their consideration in spring 2004. With the arrival of our new legislation in September 2004, Gedling borough council needed to decide how best to proceed: to continue with the draft plan, or to abandon that work and begin afresh under the new system.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/11">After a thorough consideration of all the options open to it, which I am aware included seeking advice from the structure plan authorities, the Government office for the east midlands and legal counsel, Gedling decided that the best way to proceed was to take the well-advanced draft plan forward to adoption.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/12">As required, Gedling therefore published a statement of decisions and proposed modifications in January of this year. During its consultation period, Gedling took it upon itself to hold additional public meetings, although there was no requirement to do so at that stage.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/13">I understand that some of the allocated sites within Gedling's proposed modifications, involving the development of greenfield land and changes to the green belt boundary, are a source of concern to my hon. Friend and some of his constituents. These concerns relate to a perceived failure of the borough council to comply with national planning policies in allocating the sites, particularly the need to follow a sequential approach. I am aware that my hon. Friend also believes that Gedling may not have taken into account material changes that have occurred since the publication of the inspector's report, as well as housing figures emerging from the Nottinghamshire joint structure plan review.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/14">I recognise these concerns and the strongly held views from which they arise. I also recognise the difficult choices facing local planning authorities in balancing the need to meet the demand for housing and employment against the need to protect the environment. In making the decision on where to locate new development vital to sustain and meet the needs of its borough, Gedling has followed the requirements of the plan-led system, and has kept the Government office informed of its intentions throughout.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/15">As I have said, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the merits of specific policies and allocations proposed by the Gedling replacement local plan, as this could be regarded as prejudicing the First Secretary of State's impartiality in performing his statutory responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/16">I can, of course, assure my hon. Friend that all the proposals put forward in the Gedling replacement local plan have been scrutinised by officials on behalf of the First Secretary of State. Rigorous assessment was given at each statutory stage as to the consistency of the proposed policies and allocations within national and regional planning policy guidance which seek to ensure sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/17">In carrying out this scrutiny, careful attention was given to national planning policy of particular importance to Gedling borough. This included policy for the green belt, as contained in planning policy guidance note 2, &quot;Green Belts&quot;; policy for housing especially for greenfield developments as set out in planning policy guidance note 3, &quot;Housing&quot;; and policy for development within areas of flood risk, as set out in planning policy guidance note 25, &quot;Development and Flood Risk&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/18">Again, as my hon. Friend is aware, it remains open for the First Secretary of State to consider the scope and appropriateness of taking any formal action in respect of the draft replacement plan before it is formally adopted. Of course, he will also know that the First Secretary of State's powers of intervention are used sparingly and only as a last resort.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/19">I am aware that Gedling borough council has this week published its proposals to adopt its replacement local plan without any further modifications after <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-11">11 July 2005</phrase>. Officials are currently giving detailed consideration to the issues involved and, I am sure, will scrutinise my hon. Friend's comments today as part of that scrutiny process. My hon. Friend will receive a response to his further letter to the Deputy Prime Minister in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/20">I will, of course, ensure that my hon. Friend is informed of the First Secretary of State's decision with regard to the Gedling replacement local plan as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/21" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid=".140.0/22" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Five o'clock.</p>
