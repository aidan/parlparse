<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-26a.143.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1440" speakername="Terry Rooney" colnum="143"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090226/halltext/90226h0001.htm#09022649000214">
	<p pid="a.143.2/1">This is the first time that I have had the pleasure of being in this forum when you have been in the Chair, Sir John. I have seen you in the Chair in other forums, and it is pleasure to serve under you today. This is also the first opportunity that I have had officially to congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his new position as the Minister with responsibility for disabled people, and to welcome him to that. I know about, and endorse, his commitment to the subject, and I shall say more about that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/2">I thank all those organisations and individuals who were summoned to provide evidence to the inquiry. Select Committees often forget the enormous burden that we place on people, particularly the voluntary sector, when requiring them to put together evidence to submit to us, and it is right to put that on the record. I particularly thank the Princess Royal Trust for Carers. We were fortunate to visit its carers' centre in Harrogate, which was an incredibly moving experience, especially our session with carers, one of whom was 17. We must remember that the number of child carers in this country is significant, and that involves considerable issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/3">I broadly thank the Government for their response to our report, but my hon. Friend will not be surprised that I take issue with some of it. I understand that today the National Audit Office published a report on carers, but I have not been able to obtain a copy&mdash;I do not know whether he is hiding them. Therefore, I am not sure what it says, but I am sure that it is constructive.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/4">I want to speak about three things: carer's allowance, information and advice, and employment and training for carers. My colleagues will also want to contribute to the debate. There are 4.5 million carers in this country, and it is estimated that they save the economy about &pound;87 billion, so they are significant. As life expectancy increases, that number will increase significantly. It is hoped that medical advances, such as stem cell research, will ultimately provide cures for diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, but as people live into their 80s and 90s, other issues will come to the fore&mdash;for example, osteoporosis. Our unsung army of carers will increase. That and social care are the two biggest issues facing the Government for years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/5">In round terms, just under 500,000 people receive carer's allowance, and about 400,000 others are entitled to it but do not receive it, principally because of overlapping benefit rules. We all understand that, and the Select Committee did not recommend a change to those rules, but what must change is the three-page letter that goes to pensioners telling them that they are entitled to the allowance.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.2/1">My hon. Friend is making an excellent point. The Government have said that they do not want piecemeal reform, but aspects of the system within which the carer's allowance works could be altered with no impact on the debate about a future single working age benefit. For example, those on the minimum wage receive an increase in that minimum wage in the autumn, and carer's allowance is uprated in April/May, so workers who receive carer's allowance sometimes find that they must stop work or reduce their hours or they will lose their entitlement to the allowance. That could be examined separately.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.0/1">May I welcome you to the Chair, Sir John, and express my pleasure in serving under you.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/2">It is a privilege to follow the Chairman of the Select Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1440" name="Terry Rooney">the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney)</phrase>. May I say, from the Opposition Benches, what a pleasure it has been for us to serve under his chairmanship as members of the Committee?</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/3">This was the first inquiry with which I have become involved since joining the House. I did not become a Member until near the tail end of the Committee's work. That was not entirely my fault, as the by-election did not take place until the end of the evidence-taking session. None the less, I am pleased to have been involved, as it is a subject of great importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/4">The report outlines very well the problems faced by carers. I draw the attention of hon. Members to paragraph 35, which gives a good summary of the human cost of caring. Exactly what carers have to go through was best brought out in one of the first e-mails that I received on the subject, which came from a carer in my constituency. The carer's story was also told in the pages of my local paper, the <i>Henley</i><i>Standard</i>. It is the story of a garden designer who, following the death of his mother-in-law, has had to care for his wife, who suffers from bipolar disorder. He has had to do so for some four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/5">My constituent spoke of the effect on himself and his own health, and how it had led to depression and problems with his blood pressure. He said that he could no longer work as a garden designer, as his wife needed constant care. He said,</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/6" class="indent">&quot;I used to try to work and look after her at the same time but it was impossible. Because of her illness, her mood swings are very unpredictable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/7">He also said that it was impossible to make ends meet, and spoke of the lack of respite care. Understandably, he took only small comfort from knowing that his situation was common to many carers, and that some were worse off than him.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/8">In the face of such a story, it was right for the Committee to have made carers the centre of its inquiry and of this report. If I had become a member of the Committee earlier, I would have wanted to make one slight addition to the report. It does not quite bring out the particular impact on carers who live in rural constituencies such as mine. In these locations the isolation is greater, the transport links are poorer, and caring usually involves additional costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/9">This may have been my first experience of a Select Committee inquiry, but it was also my first experience of a Government response. What a mixed bag it is. However, it is worth recording that we heard yesterday, in debates on Report and Third Reading of the Saving Gateway Accounts Bill, that the Government intend to make those in receipt of carers allowance eligible to open a saving gateway account&mdash;a small gesture of help to those carers who can meet the savings requirements, but a welcome one.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/10">One of the key things required&mdash;the report brings this out extremely well&mdash;is a simplification of the benefits system as a whole, but particularly in relation to carers. The system is too complex, and it does not necessarily ensure that the money goes to the right place. Perhaps the Minister will say more about the plans to simplify benefits and the application process, and to provide a timetable for such simplification. In doing so, I hope that he will take the opportunity to clarify how services for carers and those for whom they care will be joined up more at national and local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/11">The Minister and I are both members of the Public Bill Committee that is considering the Welfare Reform Bill, which has heard about the unintended consequences of delegating personal budgets. A gentleman decided to give his carer respite by buying him tickets to a football match&mdash;an action that was pilloried in the national press as a waste of money. There was much speculation as to whether people thought that the money was wasted because of the team that the carer supported or simply thought that it was not value for money. However, we all agreed that it was a perfect example of how money should be spent, and that it was a good way of joining up services, as it can give the sort of respite that carers need.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/12">There is huge scope for taking the pressure off carers. I echo the points made by the hon. Member for Bradford, North on the question of information. I very much support those actions that can be taken now to increase access to information and advice for carers. It is not acceptable that the take-up of benefit is so bad that, according to Carers UK, &pound;740 million goes unclaimed each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/13">One recommendation that I particularly endorse is that the right to request flexible working should be extended to carers to enable them to manage career and caring. I do not know whether that would have helped my constituent, but it would take the pressure off many carers&mdash;pressure that can lead to health problems for them and feelings of guilt for those being cared for. The wife of my constituent summed it up when she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/14" class="indent">&quot;I feel awful that my illness is the reason my husband cannot work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/15">That is a telling point, showing that caring affects not only the carer but the person being cared for.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.0/16">I note that Jobcentre Plus is examining the most effective ways of supporting carers to go into training. We need to know when the examination will stop and proposals will be made. That is particularly relevant today, as the National Audit Office has published its report, &quot;Supporting Carers to Care&quot;. It makes three relevant points. The first is that Jobcentre Plus services should not be regarded as being well suited to carers' needs. That seems to be a comment made by Jobcentre Plus staff rather than those outside. The second point is that not all interested carers make use of Jobcentre Plus, and the third is that there are gaps in the Jobcentre Plus management information on support for carers. Those are some key, relevant points.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-26a.156.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" speakername="Oliver Heald" colnum="156"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090226/halltext/90226h0003.htm#09022649000233">
	<p pid="a.156.0/1">We have heard two comprehensive speeches, and I do not intend to repeat the points that have been made. I echo the comment made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> that this is a substantive report and it has been well received. As a member of the Select Committee who went to most of the sessions, if not all, I am proud of it. It is a good report and a tribute to the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.0/2">On benefit simplification, as I said the other day in the debate on the uprating statement, we are in a ridiculous situation. There are so many income replacement benefits and they are uprated in so many different ways&mdash;in line with the Rossi index, the retail prices index and the consumer prices index. There is a case for looking seriously at a single, straightforward, working-age benefit. That may be simply unaffordable in the current circumstances. However there is a duty on us as a country to look again at this extremely complicated system.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.0/3">I find the Government's response to our suggestion that the carer's allowance should be overhauled rather odd. It is inconsistent to say on the one hand that the carer's allowance is not a wage for caring and is not intended to provide compensation for the costs of caring, and, on the other, that the White Paper &quot;Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future&quot; confirms the Department's intention to explore whether a single working-age benefit is the correct approach for carers. If the Department feels that there is a case for a single working-age benefit that includes a carer's allowance, then Ministers should say so. It is wrong to say that the carer's allowance should not be an income replacement benefit and then say that they will explore the subject in the context of our review of a single working-age benefit. I may be misunderstanding the Minister's intentions. I know that he cares about this issue, but it seems to me that carers are being given a bit of a tease. They are being told, &quot;We are going to look at this allowance in the context of income replacement&quot;, when the Government have no intention of doing that. If I am wrong about that, then no doubt the Minister will tell us.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.0/4">If we consider pensions, once a person gets to retirement age and pension credit, they get their income replacement&mdash;their pension income replacement&mdash;and an additional payment if they are a carer. What our report suggests is that we should have something that is consistent with that for people of working age&mdash;or at least that we should review that. Why is the Minister saying that we should have to put that off and treat it as part of the single working-age benefit review when that is some years away? One wonders whether one can hear the rustling of that longer grass, and whether this is not a question of Ministers kicking the matter into the medium term in the face of quite a lot of public concern about a group that does so much for our society and gets so little for it. I should be grateful to hear the Minister's thoughts on benefit simplification and whether he is serious about looking again at whether it should be an income replacement benefit with an addition.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.0/5">We were very impressed when we went to the Harrogate centre. Carers know where to go because there is a sign saying &quot;Carers Centre&quot;, and that is always a good start. If carers go in there, they find deeply experienced people who know about carers and their benefits and what is on offer. The staff know their stuff and provide good advice. We met carers who had been helped by the centre. In large parts of the country, there is not anything as simple as that. Will the Minister become a strong advocate for a simpler, better system in which carers can get the help that they need?</p>
	<p pid="a.156.0/6">In Australia, we were very impressed&mdash;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.]</i> The Minister laughs, but I was impressed by the respite that was on offer. In Australia, there is a clear recognition that if someone is a carer and they want to work, they may need respite. Carers can reach a point at which they cannot go on. In Australia, they can ring up and get immediate respite help. Moreover, some schemes exist that enable people to take a break. They can go with the person for whom they care, or on their own to recharge their batteries. I thought that that was excellent. I should be grateful to hear something from the Government about respite. Is it on the agenda? It was not mentioned in the strategy document, but it is very important to somebody who is caring.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.0/1">May I say something before the hon. Gentleman leaves this issue of a network of carer centres up and down the country, which is something that I strongly support? The Government said that while they gave grants to carers' organisations, including those that ran carers centres, it was for councils and their partners to ensure that there was appropriate local support. Is that not kicking the prospect of achieving a full network into the long grass? What about those local authorities that do not provide such a service? A lot of local authorities complain that they have not had a grant from the Government to do so and that such centres are a low priority for them. That is why we will not get a national network. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Government must get their hands dirty to ensure that there is one?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-26a.158.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1956" speakername="Anne Begg" colnum="158"  time="015:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090226/halltext/90226h0003.htm#09022649000236">
	<p pid="a.158.0/1">I should like to extend my thanks to the members of the Work and Pensions Committee for producing a thoughtful and good report. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase>, I think that this is a good piece of work, and I am very proud to be part of the Committee that has produced it.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/2">Our Chairman has said that carers are the silent group, the group that nobody listens to. All of us feel that we have played a small part in giving voice to carers. They are people who work seven days a week, 24 hours a day caring for a relative, friend or next door neighbour. I wonder why such people are so silent and why we do not hear their voices very often. I think it is because a lot of our attention is concentrated on the recipients of the care. The Chairman said that he was a carer for a short time over Christmas when his wife broke her leg. I bet she got lots of cards saying, &quot;Get well soon&quot; and, &quot;I hope you will soon be up and about&quot;. I am sure that she got the odd bunch of flowers&mdash;her husband is shaking his head&mdash;visitors, and lots of tea and sympathy because she had broken her leg. I also bet that the Chairman, her husband, did not get any of those things. I am fairly sure that he did not get a card saying, &quot;Good luck on your role as a carer&quot; or, &quot;I hope things work out well for you.&quot; I am also fairly sure that no one knocked on the door and said to him, &quot;You go and have a break, we'll look after your wife for you&quot;&mdash;I know that they would not tell him to go down to the pub, because he is teetotal. The tea and sympathy and concern are generally for the person who needs care.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/3">I speak from personal experience. I have often been the recipient of care, mostly when I was younger, from my parents. I must say that I gave them a pretty hard life. When a person is going through a lot of pain and misery, and is finding life difficult, they take it out on the people who are closest to them&mdash;their nearest and dearest. They are the ones who are asked by, say, a child with a disability, &quot;Why can't I be normal?&quot; or &quot;Why can't you take my pain away?&quot; Parents get that kind of pressure, and they are also the carers. They have a double burden. They have the burden of caring and of doing the state's job&mdash;often, they do not want the state to be involved. Many people, particularly those who care for older people, do not want their relative to be in a residential or old folks' home; they want to keep them at home. At the same time, particularly if the person who is being cared for can be difficult or has behavioural problems as a result of their disability or illness, or due to mental illness, they often have the burden of being the butt of the anger of the person for whom they are trying to care. However, they do not walk away. They stay, day in day out, year in year out. That is why it is important for Committees such as the Work and Pensions Committee to take their plight seriously, and for the Government to do likewise. Without those carers, the whole care system would collapse.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/4">I think that carers save the Government &pound;87 billion a year. I do not think that any of us are advocating that carers should relinquish their role. They assume their responsibilities, willingly in some cases and reluctantly in others, because they think that they can probably provide far better care than could ever be provided by a state system, no matter how good. Carers are the silent group, as the Chairman of the Committee said.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/5">I am following other speakers, and I am not sure what bits of our report to talk about&mdash;a lot has already been covered. However, individual stories often tell us more than anything else. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2033" name="John Howell">The hon. Member for Henley (John Howell)</phrase> used his speech to highlight individual cases, and I will do the same. More than anything, individual cases illustrate what difficulties and problems can arise. The biggest single thing that the Government can get right for carers is respite. Perhaps we do not give enough attention to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/6">We are lucky in Aberdeen because we have a carers centre. Last year, when we were producing the report, I was amazed how many carers I met&mdash;I have been meeting a lot of carers in the past week in my constituency, and I will come to why they have been knocking on my door. The Committee met a lot of carers. We visited Harrogate, and I went to my carers centre to talk to people. They raised the issue of young carers, who are often forgotten. In some cases, people's whole young lives are affected by their caring role. Any aspirations and ability to go into further or higher education, for example, are curtailed because they care for their parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/7">We met some children in Harrogate whose homes were dysfunctional because a parent was a drug addict. Those individuals can lead enormously unsettled lives. I remember vividly one of the people who worked at the centre in Harrogate saying that parents who had mental health problems&mdash;they might be manic depressives&mdash;often caused the most difficulty. She said that a child could adapt remarkably well if their life was dreadful all the time; they simply learned that that was the norm and to cope. However, some mental health illnesses mean that the parent is up and down, and there are huge differences between manic and depressive phases. The children of those parents find life the most difficult. Things can be great if the parent is in a manic phase and there is lots of energy going around, but the children do not know how long the phase will last or when it will end and the whole family will tumble back into depression. That can be difficult to cope with. That is why respite for young carers was talked about when I visited the Aberdeen centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/8">As part of national carers week in December last year, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1955" name="Frank Doran">the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran)</phrase> and I ran a carers surgery so that people could come to see us&mdash;he did it in the morning and I did it in the afternoon. The enormous range of carers who came in that day was interesting, from the man who had reluctantly allowed his wife, who suffered from Alzheimer's, to go into a care home, to the mother whose daughter was at a special school but reaching the transition period, who felt that there was nowhere to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/9">I should explain the situation in Aberdeen as it relates to the latter case. Aberdeen city council has a fairly major problem with its finances. Last year, it had a &pound;50 million deficit. It took the decision that children who were at special schools could no longer stay on in school to age 19, a provision that had existed for some time. If people attended a special school, the school leaving age was effectively 19, and the six months before was used as preparation for transition. The decision was taken, presumably to save money, that those people would have to leave school at 18, like everyone else. It was taken arbitrarily, and with no proper discussion. The mother who came to see me thought her daughter had six months in which to prepare and get ready for adult life and move from children's to adult services, but was told that her place at school was going to be withdrawn, and there was nothing in its place.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/10">She was not alone. Other constituents have come to see me with exactly the same problem. I thought that I was being very successful as an MP, because I seemed to win every case I took up with the local council. It would back down, saying, &quot;They're not going to have to leave school at 18, they can continue.&quot; However, I found out only last week that it was not down to my success as an MP; the local council found that people had nowhere to go, and the preparation had not been done, so people had to go back to their school. Imagine the upset that that caused in the family. We are still in that position.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/11">Another constituent, Margaret Hodder, got in touch with me last week. Her daughter is 18, and she has autism and bipolar disorder. The daughter will be leaving school in the summer, but Margaret does not know what will happen to her, because the council is not providing the appropriate support. Part of the problem&mdash;this is why I have seen a lot of carers in the last week&mdash;is that, due to budget constraints on the council, decisions are being taken that affect the care and respite that parents will get.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/12">The council has two day centres&mdash;Rosehill and Burnside&mdash;to provide respite for a range of people. However, one of them is to close&mdash;I believe I heard two days ago that it is probably Burnside. Some 190 people go to the two day centres, but the council wants to cut it down to 100. It is going to get rid of some people. It said that over-65s did not qualify, so they will not go to the day centre, which is fine. It will get rid of others by reassessing people under new criteria. They will go because they will not be severely disabled enough. However, a large number of people will be left without the day centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/13">Today's <i>Press and Journal</i>, the paper for north-east Scotland, tells the story of a mother, Aileen Hutchison, whose 31-year-old daughter Susan has cerebral palsy. I must declare an interest; Aileen was in my class at school, so her story is all the more poignant. What she said sums up why we wrote the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/14">She went to a meeting to find out what was going to happen. At the moment, her daughter attends the Rosehill day centre five days a week and is thriving. Aileen says in the paper that the council</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/15" class="indent">&quot;admitted that the council's plans are to save money but tried to say that the plans will also improve the service users' lives. When it was pointed out to them that this decision does not only affect the service users but their families too, they didn't even respond.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/16">That goes back to what I said originally. We often think of the service users or the people needing care, but in the impact studies that must be done under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, we forget to factor in carers' needs as well. The Committee Chairman said that carers were entitled to respite. The carers in Aberdeen do not think that they are entitled to respite; they are losing what respite they had.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/17">I have described the picture for those leaving school and looking for help, but carers and constituents have come to me from the other end. They are elderly parents whose children are perhaps in their 40s. Because people are living longer, people well into their 70s may end up caring for children in their 40s. One mother phoned me last summer, before the Rosehill closure was an issue. Her daughter goes to Rosehill. She had been told, again in an arbitrary way, that her 43-year-old daughter's day care was to be cut by one day. She was in tears on the phone, saying, &quot;How can I manage? I can only manage her over the weekend because five days a week she goes to her day care. What happens when she can only go four days a week?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/18">Such are the individual stories that illustrate why the Government have to get it right. We must also get it right in services for older people. There is a huge job of work to be done by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The way we behave towards older people with disabilities, particularly learning disabilities&mdash;I hope that this is happening only in Aberdeen&mdash;is nothing short of a diminution of their human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/19">Another decision by the council in Aberdeen is to move everyone over 65 into older people's services. The result is that adults with learning disabilities who have turned 65 are now being reassessed. If they are in supported accommodation, they are being told that it is too expensive and that they will have to go to an old folks' home. The only reason they have to move is that they have turned 65 and they have learning disabilities. Their relatives have been knocking on my door in the past week. I was quite horrified. I honestly thought that I had got it wrong. I wrote to the chief executive of the council expecting an immediate rebuttal saying, &quot;No, we're not doing that. Of course we wouldn't dream of doing that.&quot; It has not come. Instead, the lead councillor on social work has accused me of scaremongering in the press, saying, &quot;Actually, we're just going to assess them, and then we'll decide from there where they're going to live.&quot; Those people are living in a home situation where relatives may be caring for them, and they are being told where they must live. It is appalling. I was horrified, and I have got increasingly angry as the week has gone on since I found that out.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/20">Those things are happening in Aberdeen, where we thought we were getting better. If it is happening now, the situation may be happening elsewhere, in other local authorities that are finding that their money is being cut. It is difficult to get to the bottom of where the money is coming from. Some of it comes from Westminster and some of it from the Department for Work and Pensions in the form of benefits to both the cared-for and the carers, but in other areas it may come from the local council. It is difficult and confusing.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/21">I hope that we can behave better in the 21st-century world. We are a rich country. We should be valuing our disabled people. A measure of how civilised we are is how we treat the most vulnerable, and part of the package of those most vulnerable people is their carers. How we treat the carers in our society should also be a measure of how civilised we are.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.0/1">I apologise for arriving late. I have been talking in the Chamber about a Welsh Assembly Government legislative competence order on carers. Does my hon. Friend agree that we ought to recognise the excellent work that Crossroads does for carers, particularly at the local level? It works closely with local education authorities to assist young carers and help them through problems such as bullying. May I place on record the thanks of the all-party group for carers to the Select Committee for its tremendous report? At yesterday's all-party group meeting, I was asked to come along today to place that thanks on the record and to say that we look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir John.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/2">I begin by explaining that I am wearing two hats today. I am speaking as a proud member of the Select Committee, and I am happy to follow my colleagues and their excellent contributions, but I am also speaking on behalf of my party.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/3">I have been on the Work and Pensions Committee since I joined the House in 2005. With my first hat on, I would like to say that this is probably the best report that we have done. It is excellent, and its timing could not have been better. The Committee was everything that a Select Committee should be&mdash;unified, strong and bold&mdash;and, as well as looking at some of the failures of the past, it suggested positive ways forward to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/4">I thank my colleagues for working together. I am sure that everyone on the Committee would agree that we work together extremely well, and we also get on very well, I am glad to say. We all take the roles of a Select Committee&mdash;scrutinising and coming up with positive proposals&mdash;very seriously indeed, and we would all want to thank our excellent staff, who do so much to enable that.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/5">The only problem I may have today, Sir John, is referring to my Select Committee colleagues by their first name, which we always do. I ask you to forgive me if I make any mistakes. I am not entirely sure of the names of all the constituencies, such is our usual informality, but I will do my best.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/6">I began by saying that I am wearing two hats today. One thing that we found through our extensive research leading up to this excellent report was that that is exactly the situation that carers find themselves in. They have the difficult job of juggling different roles. Their job of caring is often combined with work, and is sometimes combined with child care or other family responsibilities. Of course, whether they work or not, they still carry the burden of ensuring that sufficient income is coming into the household, whether that be from employment or through pensions or benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/7">What I found particularly helpful in our inquiry and our work was going out and speaking to many carers. We wanted to hear their voice, and I found the experience extremely powerful. Since then, like other Members who have mentioned that today, I have been speaking to carers in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/8">Something that will live with me for a long time is the visit to Harrogate, which was mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1440" name="Terry Rooney">the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney)</phrase>, our Chairman, and during which we heard from carers of all ages. We heard about the challenges for older carers and the situation that they face. Many of them do not see themselves as carers&mdash;they are simply caring for their spouse, their loved one. They do not even see that they have a caring role.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/9">And then, of course, we had that inspiring meeting with the young carers. We heard from incredible young people who have spent most of&mdash;in some cases, almost all&mdash;their childhood looking after a parent. We heard about their experiences and how they coped. That, too, has been touched on by other hon. Members. Caring has taken those young people away from the normal, every-day things that children would and should take for granted, if they are able to do so. I found that particularly powerful. Because we were listening to the voices of carers and were driven by the experiences of carers up and down the country, we made proposals that I am proud to associate myself with.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/10">The bigger picture, of course, is that we want to move on to changing the position of carers in this country. I am sure that the Minister is listening carefully to everything that we have to say and I know that the Government took the report seriously. As our Chairman said, carers are an incredibly precious resource in our society, which is what we need to consider as we move forward on policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/11">Carers are individuals who contribute to society. Our Select Committee Chairman gave that extraordinary &pound;87 billion figure as the amount that they save the public purse every year. That is astonishing. To be honest, I cannot imagine such a figure. It is enormous, but, to put it in context, it is more than the annual spend on the entire national health service. I find that hard to take in, but it shows exactly what carers are doing, not just for their family members and loved ones, be they spouses or parents, but for our society and country. It is time that we recognised that. Instead of thinking, &quot;What benefits can we give them?&quot;, we should ask, &quot;How do we recognise them and their contribution?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/12">The simple fact&mdash;I do not believe that anyone, including the Minister, would disagree with this&mdash;is that in the past we have not adequately recognised the support that carers give to people or their contribution to society. That really has to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/13">Another thing that we found as part of our inquiry was that we are far behind some other countries. Select Committees can and do look at examples of best practice from all over the world and at the systems of nations that are ahead of us. We are ahead of many nations on many things, and I hope that they are looking to us to see how they can improve things, but we found examples from other countries&mdash;I believe most of us on the Committee would say from Western Australia in particular&mdash;that are, frankly, miles ahead of what we are doing in relation to not just the money given to carers to recognise their contribution, but signposting and support. Other countries really are a long way ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/14">There are examples in this country of where we are doing things very well, such as what we saw in Harrogate.</p>

	<p pid="a.171.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about training, and he is quite right that training and facilities should be available at the end of caring. Does he agree that the state&mdash;the NHS, care homes and social care policy-making&mdash;is missing a trick? Although some people will have had enough of caring, others will have learned skills that they want to take into other productive work&mdash;in care homes and in the NHS. Should we not look at that aspect, too?</p>

	<p pid="a.172.0/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir John. I do not know about you, but at times during this debate I have felt hardly entitled to contribute at all, not having been to Australia&mdash;rather like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1920" name="Adrian Bailey">the hon. Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey)</phrase>. Despite that, I intend to add a few comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/2">I have listened intently to this important and timely debate. I thank the Select Committee, which has produced a thorough and well-researched report, and particularly the Committee Chairman who introduced it. As constituency Members of Parliament, I think that we have all been touched by the dedication and hard work of the carers whom we have come across. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1956" name="Anne Begg">The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg)</phrase> gave us some examples from her constituency. It is impossible to say with total accuracy how many informal carers there are in the UK at this moment&mdash;one estimate is around 6 million&mdash;but one thing we know for sure is that that figure will rise as people live longer and the demographics change in the next few decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/3">One reads a great deal in the papers about the so-called sandwich generation, of which I regard myself as a member: people who are looking after both children and elderly parents. Only the other day, there was a report on the number of such carers who are drawing down from their own pension pots to look after their own parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/4">As the Committee's report rightly mentions, based on the Leeds university study, carers save the Treasury an estimated &pound;87 billion a year, which, as has been pointed out, is a sum greater than the entire annual budget for the national health service. Unfortunately, not a lot of that money is passed on to the carers themselves. The report says that caring has a sustainable impact on carers' incomes. We have heard all sorts of evidence to that effect this afternoon. Research by Carers UK found that carers lose out on about &pound;11,000 a year as a result of either giving up work, reducing their hours or taking a junior position. This loss of income is hardly replaced by the &pound;53 a week, from April, that they will get in carer's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/5">Astonishingly, the Government do not know the current take-up rate for carer's allowance. The latest report&mdash;I mean &quot;latest&quot;, because it only appeared in the early hours of this morning&mdash;from the National Audit Office states that estimating the take-up rate is incredibly complex because it is based on the take-up rates of other benefits. We have heard something about that from other hon. Members. However, according to the Department's own longitudinal study, of the 882,800 carers entitled to carer's allowance in May 2008 only 480,730 claimed it. That is the equivalent of &pound;740 million in carers' benefits going unclaimed in a single year. It is remarkable that the Government's own carers strategy failed to address directly this rather obvious problem with the benefits system, given the amount of invaluable service that carers give not just to those they care for, but to the state and the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/6">As we have seen, the eligibility criteria for carer's allowance are complicated. A carer must provide service for over 35 hours a week to a person receiving a qualifying disability benefit. Such strict criteria leave little room for manoeuvre. As has been said several times, carers who care for more than one individual for less than 35 hours a week each cannot receive carer's allowance. Age Concern and Help the Aged rightly pointed out in their joint briefing note:</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Fundamentally, the current benefit system is financially inadequate for carers, discouraging to claimants, and far too complex.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/8">The Government's response to the report acknowledged that the current system of carers' benefits lacks regard for the different situations and needs of carers. If a carer needs more flexibility to balance caring and working&mdash;because, per hour of service, the carer's allowance sits well below minimum wage&mdash;the Government provide little advice or guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/9">The National Audit Office report is not very flattering. It finds that a fifth of carers still have difficulties in applying for carer's allowance and it mentions the fact that the Department does not actually know the real level of take-up. It also reveals that while Jobcentre Plus is the main source of employment support for carers, only about one third of Jobcentre Plus personal advisers believe that carers receive the support that they need or should expect. More than 70 per cent. of those who had contacted Jobcentre Plus for employment support in the past year found that its services were not well suited to their personal circumstances as carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/10">My party is working on ways to simplify the benefits system so that the take-up of those key benefits is improved, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2033" name="John Howell">the Member for Henley (John Howell)</phrase> spoke about that. Several hon. Members talked about the holy grail in this area&mdash;a single working age benefit. I am not trying to raise the temperature of the debate at this late stage, but in many ways the Government's response was dismissive to some important points in the report. Paragraph 32 of the response states:</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/11" class="indent">&quot;The White Paper confirms that the Department remains attracted to the idea of a single working age benefit&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/12">so far, so good&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/13" class="indent">&quot;and will continue to explore whether, over the longer term, this is the right approach.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/14">That choice of words does not suggest that a single working age benefit is top of the Minister's in-tray, but I agree with hon. Members who have said that perhaps it should be. I take the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1440" name="Terry Rooney">the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney)</phrase> and others made that we should not let the best be the enemy of the good and do nothing because we hope one day to reach that nirvana when everything will be perfect. However, we need a bit more enthusiasm from the Minister for getting on with this.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/15">Without access to flexible work schemes, many unpaid carers are unable to continue working, so a future Conservative Government will ensure that every unpaid carer has the right to ask for flexible working hours so that they can manage their career and caring responsibilities in the best possible way. That is something that my hon. Friend raised.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.1/1">I am grateful for my hon. Friend's further reference to Australia. He has obviously been hacking into my computer, because I was about to deal with some of his very good points.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.1/2">Our welfare to work proposals will also help those carers who are out of work but are able to enter employment by giving them help and support so that they can return to work as soon as possible. Carers who are already out of work need help in different ways. We heard a couple of times about the strange rule of 21-hours a week for education and training, and surely Ministers should examine that urgently. The Government should encourage training, as my hon. Friend said, so that carers' skills do not become rusty or out of date.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.1/3">The Conservative party's welfare reform package is being spearheaded by my about-to-be noble Friend David Freud and includes proposals to help carers who are out of work to re-enter the work force by giving them help and support. When they are in flexible, carer-friendly work, a Conservative Government will help them to stay in work by ensuring the swift roll-out of individual budgets and direct payments. That will mean that instead of being fitted into a one-size-fits-all benefits system, carers will get the help that they need and want.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.1/4">Comments have been made about care vouchers, and I have received briefing from Employers for Carers. Responsible, good employers, such as John Lewis, see that as the way forward, and it would be useful if the Minister will say something about that. The press release of Employers for Carers says that back in August 2008, the Select Committee recommended not only that the Government carry out a full cost-benefit analysis of the care voucher model, but that the Department pilots the scheme for its employees. I thought that I had <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase>&mdash;Fleetwood is where the tram stops&mdash;on board, and I do not see why that cannot be considered seriously, because Ministers can control that directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.1/5">The hon. Lady, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1684" name="Harry Cohen">the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen)</phrase> and, I am sure, others rightly referred to help and advice. We all know how important advice is, and in its briefing Age Concern and Help the Aged said that there should be a cross-Government strategy for the delivery and funding of information and advice, which would meet the needs of carers and others. That chimes in with the briefing from the Local Government Association, which says that good quality information and advice are the first things that people with care and support need and their carers want. I am sure that that is right.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.1/6">Many aspects of local government are having problems with cutbacks that have to be made because of lack of Government funding. In some parts of the country, advice services are one of the first areas to fall to the axe. In its Fair Care campaign, the Local Government Association set out the main problems and said that the system is underfunded, unfair and unclear. It went on to say that because of the tight financial environment in which they operate, councils now have little alternative but to tighten their eligibility criteria, raise charges and reduce services. How true that is.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.1/7">The current economic climate does not help. On page 20 of the Select Committee's report, it says that it was right to place these issues in the broader context of child poverty and pensioner poverty. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> touched on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.1/8">The hon. Members for Bradford, North and for West Bromwich, West referred to child carers, who are a huge and often hidden problem. We know that there is an existing and growing problem with pensioner poverty. The official figures show that about 2.5 million now live in official poverty, and many are teetering on the edge simply because their savings&mdash;they did the right thing all their lives, as the politicians told them to, and put money aside while they were working to supplement in retirement&mdash;are bringing them a zero return. If that were not bad enough, to add insult to injury, when some of the benefits are calculated, it is assumed that they are receiving 10 per cent. on some of their savings. I would love to find the bank or building society that is giving such a return because I would be there like a shot.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-26a.178.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" speakername="Jonathan R Shaw" colnum="178"  time="017:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090226/halltext/90226h0006.htm#09022663000098">
	<p pid="a.178.3/1">I am not able to give my hon. Friend a timetable. He knows that the care and support programme is coming up soon. We have signalled the way forward by giving a commitment on certain dates, but as I said about the NHS, we need to consider in a wider context the reform of services in relation to benefits and how that can affect carers and those for whom they care.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.3/2">A number of Members said that the disregard of &pound;95 was insufficient. It is reasonable to point out that it was increased two years ago from &pound;50; we wanted to give a significant uplift in order to assist people and provide some certainty. It could be argued that there should be a taper, but that would introduce more complexity. Universally, Members have said that carers have told them&mdash;they have told me, too&mdash;that they do not like complexity. We will keep that under review, but there is not a simple solution. If we do not have what I might call the cliff face, we must have a taper; but with the taper comes more complexity. Again, carers have told the Committee and me that they do not want that.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.3/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North asked whether carers who did not meet the conditions of the progression to work group, rightly referred to in the report, would be able voluntarily to enter that group in order to be assisted back to work. The answer is yes. I hope that that also answers the questions about assisting people into employment asked by the hon. Member for Eastbourne.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.3/4">A number of hon. Members referred to the provision of carer centres. Special grants have been awarded to carers organisations, including those that run carers centres, to enable them to develop capacity. However, it is for councils and their partners to ensure an appropriate level of provision. We will do our bit, but local government needs to do its part as well. Do services vary from one authority to another? Yes, they do. That reflects the priorities of those elected to serve their local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.3/5">The report also refers to how to empower individuals. I have been taking part in the Committee stage of the Welfare Reform Bill today, and we are introducing the right to control benefits, some provided through social care and some through the Department, such as access to work. Indeed, there will be benefits also under the Health Bill, with tailored individual budgets. We will pilot those measures, working in partnership with carers' groups, disabled people's groups and local authorities, in order to find out what works. It is important to establish what works. If we do not have pilots&mdash;some have suggested that we should not&mdash;we shall have to roll out different budgets together. If it falls over, people's anxieties will be raised, and we will lose the opportunity to introduce the necessary reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.3/6">We have been asked what steps are being taken to ensure that carers undertaking part-time work do not lose their entitlement to carer's allowance as a result of the minimum wage. I hope that what I said earlier about the disregard will help. We will keep the matter under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.3/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2033" name="John Howell">The hon. Member for Henley (John Howell)</phrase> gave us examples from his constituency. He rightly mentioned the need to develop services in rural communities and to have individualised budgets. That will bring some tension without an economy of scale. Although we will have pilots for the benefits reforms that I referred to, it is important to consider rural areas; previously, I was Minister with responsibility for rural affairs, and I know that the hon. Gentleman was right to bring the problems in such areas to our attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.3/8">I am encouraged that Conservative Members now support flexible working policies. There was a time when they set their face against people having time off for family matters. They have reformed, and that is welcome. We have to strike a balance between the needs of business and the needs of individuals, but if someone is already in work when they acquire their caring responsibilities, they will be pre-qualified to request flexibility. Again, it is an important piece of legislation that assists people in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.3/9">The Coleman judgment was mentioned. We are considering the appropriate legislation in order to deal with that concern. That will be forthcoming soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.3/10">Many hon. Members will know that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> has had a distinguished career in matters to do with social services. She chaired Leicestershire county council's&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.181.1/1">We must consider the infrastructure, as well as how we apply the benefits. A move towards vouchers, given the time and cost implications, and the apparatus that would need to be put in place, would not produce a situation more desirable than that resulting from the reforms to the benefits system that we want. The analogy with child care vouchers is also imperfect, because children are rarely financially independent with an income source, whereas generally adults needing care have some financial resources at their disposal, as well as state-provided care or benefits, which I referred to earlier. The circumstances, therefore, are different.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/2">Our ambition is to move to a single benefit. I have referred to remarks about putting this matter in the context of care and support. Having listened to carers, we decided not to move carers on to jobseeker's allowance, as we had originally proposed in the Green Paper. Carers told me in no uncertain terms at the Carers UK conference that they thought it would be an insult to do so&mdash;actually, there were a few expletives&mdash;so we are not going to do that. We do want more simplification, but we need to consult on that and take people with us before we introduce our proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/3">The personal account given by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1956" name="Anne Begg">the Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg)</phrase> provided an insight into what it is like to be cared for. She also told us how her parents had to endure some of her less than reasonable moments&mdash;not that she is like that now. She rightly pointed out the need to support young carers, and talked about the difficulties faced by families often in a chaotic situation. She talked about parents who might be drug dependent. Albeit only in England, we are introducing support for families as part of the aiming higher for disabled children initiative. We have invested &pound;370 million to support, and increase the number of, short breaks for parents caring for a disabled child, which I am sure will make an enormous difference to the lives of many families. It is for her to talk to the Scottish Government to see whether they can match that. I shall not respond in detail to her point about Aberdeen council, but obviously she is no fan of that particular local authority and some of its decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1920" name="Adrian Bailey">the Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey)</phrase> eloquently talked about the need to improve services for young carers, as did a number of others&mdash;I am pleased that the service in Sandwell is there. He talked about the question that he put to young carers in his constituency and about a national organisation. He asked me to pass on those points, which certainly I shall. However, we need to recognise that the Prime Minister has set up a cross-cutting body to look at carers that will take account of children.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1684" name="Harry Cohen">the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen)</phrase> was his usual direct self and invited me to go and live with Rab Nesbitt&mdash;if he does not mind, I shall decline the offer. However, I shall provide him with a note on the point that he raised on behalf of the Parkinson's Disease Society. I can provide him with the details that will allay his concerns. He also mentioned someone who had suffered a stroke, which brings me back to one of my original points. NHS stroke services have improved vastly in recent years. I am sure that that goes for his patch as much as mine. That will have lowered the dependency of some on carers as well as the requirements of carers.</p>
