	<p pid=".1.3/1">I apologise for my late arrival, Mr. Olner, but I have rarely seen such appalling traffic as I encountered on my way here.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/2">I am pleased to have secured this debate about the future of NHS Logistics and the market testing process being carried out as part of the review of NHS arm's length bodies following the Gershon report. I have a constituency interest in that one of the six distribution centres that services the NHS supply chain is based at Somercotes Alfreton in my constituency. The centre, which employs about 400 staff, also serves as the headquarters of NHS Logistics. Labour Members who have NHS Logistics sites in their constituencies or whose constituents work at sites in neighbouring constituencies have been visiting the sites over the past year and more, we have held meetings and written to Ministers and we recently tabled a number of parliamentary questions. Not all of those Members who have a constituency interest are able to be here today&mdash;two are Ministers, so they are barred from participating in the debate, and a couple of others have inescapable commitments&mdash;but all are concerned about NHS Logistics.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/3">I start with a quote:</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/4" class="indent">&quot;The NHS Logistics Authority has proved itself to be right at the forefront of the transformation taking place in the health service and it fully deserves this award.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/5">That was the former Health Secretary, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase>, talking about NHS Logistics when it scooped a top award at the <i>Health Service Journal</i> awards. The award was for improving care through its work on developing an e-technology system and a good computer system. NHS Logistics received a large number of compliments for that work and for saving large sums of money through its systems.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-05.1.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1373" speakername="Judy Mallaber" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050705/halltext/50705h01.htm#50705h01_spnew2">
	<p pid=".1.5/1">Yes, I am. NHS Logistics has won a string of awards. For example, last year it won an IT technology award for which it was praised by Sir Nigel Crisp. I am particularly interested in the IT awards, because we are told that the need for investment in a new computer system is a major reason for bringing the private sector into the NHS supply chain&mdash;in the role that is currently fulfilled by NHS Logistics. We hear that such investment can be funded only by the private sector, yet NHS Logistics has won many IT awards as well as awards for its other functions. That is just one of the things that puzzle those of us who have NHS Logistics sites in our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/2">We are also puzzled by some of the arguments that have been made for moving the service into the private sector. There is much on which I agree with my right hon. Friend the Minister. It is sensible to review the plethora of arm's length bodies to ensure that they provide value and effective services and work as efficiently as possible. It is also reasonable to keep the NHS supply chain under continuous review to ensure that it runs efficiently and to seek improvements&mdash;the evidence from our visits suggests that the supply chain is run efficiently. While safeguarding the security of the supply chain, we should also ensure that maximum resources are available for front-line patient care.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/3">While we would not dispute that we have some common ground with the Minister, I and other hon. Members have sought this debate because there is under way a process of market testing to decide whether the private sector should become involved, or whether NHS Logistics should stay as it is, perhaps with adaptations. We want to ensure that that process is carried out properly. We are concerned that it is not taking into account all the necessary factors, and I would like assurances from my right hon. Friend the Minister that nobody involved in the process&mdash;whether a civil servant, a member of the Department of Health commercial directorate or a Minister&mdash;starts by automatically assuming that the private sector is the best or the only option. I should also like to be told clearly the aim of the process. In what direction are we going? Because I am accountable to my constituents, I need access to full information about how any decision is taken. I want to make sure that the process is transparent, and I seek ministerial assurances on all the issues. That is why my colleagues and I have sought this debate and tabled a number of parliamentary questions.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/4">We started off thinking that the issue was NHS Logistics' efficiency, but when we visited its sites, we were impressed by its efficiency. As has been mentioned, it has won a number of awards and it clearly is efficient in a number of ways. Following a number of efficiency exercises, many jobs were lost at the Alfreton site last year&mdash;I know that because one of my good friends lost her job in that review. One of the six NHS Logistics sites&mdash;the one in Bridgwater&mdash;is already privately run, and that is the site with the lowest satisfaction rate among customers. In addition, the organisation already works with private sector partners&mdash;the transport that I saw was provided by TNT. I note that NHS Logistics' on-time delivery performance is running at well over 90 per cent. It runs a benchmarking system to test its performance against that of the private sector through Logmark, the UK logistics benchmarking club, and utilises a number of other means. There is not necessarily any doubt about the organisation's efficiency. I think that it is generally accepted that it is efficient, and I ask the Minister to confirm that.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/5">We were then told that the argument had moved on and the question now was whether the organisation could be more effective if a greater proportion of the market were provided for centrally, thus achieving economies of scale and enabling more money to be put into patient care. I am rather dubious about some of the arguments that have been put in that respect and I should like the Minister to ensure that all the arguments are taken into account. When colleagues and I met the Health Minister Lord Warner before the election, he stated that NHS Logistics formed only a small proportion of the supply chain. However, although it has only 20 per cent. of the market share by value, it provides 70 per cent. of the market by volume.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/6">It is important not to disrupt the supply chain to health providers. I am told that there are 9,000 suppliers in the sector, of which NHS Logistics is by far the largest. I have also seen the current business plan, which I believe the commercial directorate has approved. NHS Logistics is already expanding into some of the more specialist areas with which it has not previously dealt. It has plans for a 41 per cent. growth target over the next four years, taking it to a market share of 30 per cent. by value, following growth of 35 per cent. in the past four years. Although there may have been a rocky start after the Cabinet Office report, NHS Logistics has gone zooming ahead over the past few years.</p>

	<p pid=".4.1/1">I would argue that, as the NHS Logistics Authority is running efficiently&mdash;when I first started investigating, I was prepared to be told that it was not efficient, but everything that we have seen makes us think that it is&mdash;I would want clear reasons for making a change spelled out so that I could explain it to the people who work there. Often, we turn things upside down for no good reason. If the authority is working efficiently, I, as the MP who represents one of its sites, want to be given the full information that justifies any change. That is particularly important because the authority is managing the vaccination programme and the cleaning supplies and is part of the anti-terrorist contingency plans. It would be worrying if that went wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".4.1/2">One of my main concerns is that the debate and process should be transparent. At the moment, it can be difficult to get information because we are told that it is all commercial and has to be kept secret. If I make inquiries, I am told that that is not something that I should know about. To me, as a local representative, that is not acceptable. I want a totally transparent process. We have asked parliamentary questions about issues such as identifying the gap between what is provided by NHS Logistics and what could potentially be provided, and about its growth levels. I also want to know whether NHS Logistics can submit a bid, which I understand it has not been allowed to do. If it gets to the next stage&mdash;we are now down to three bidders, each of which has an IT component&mdash;the question has been raised whether it will need a new IT system. I also want to know and be able to see the commercial case, if it is decided to go on to the invitation-to-negotiate stage.</p>

	<p pid=".5.0/1">Before my hon. Friend concludes, would she like to comment on the ability of NHS Logistics to expand its capacity? We have been led to believe that the commercial directorate is considering that as an option for future operations. To meet the demands of the NHS, capacity will need to be expanded. The question is whether NHS Logistics can expand its capacity without further recourse to the public purse.</p>

	<p pid=".5.1/1">As I understand it, NHS Logistics has dealt with that in its plans. It would be able to expand and it has built into its plans the need for additional warehousing. The original report suggested that it should reduce the number of its distribution centres to six or seven, one of which should be tested privately, which is how the Bridgwater site came into being. However, it has been pointed out to me that these days supply chains do tend not to buy warehousing but to lease it. That has been built into NHS Logistics' plan, so that should not be a problem.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/2">I ask my right hon. Friend the Minister to ensure that all the issues are taken into account and that we, as Members, have full information on why any change is taking place. I have yet to be convinced that change is necessary. If there is a good argument, I will not stand in the way of ensuring that NHS supply is done efficiently and well. There may be alternative ways to improve the authority besides straightforwardly handing it over to one private sector consortium. From the evidence that I have, it seems to operate efficiently.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/3">I also want to see the commercial case so that if it is decided to extend invitations to negotiate, we can see the advantages of any firm being involved. I have an example from the same area, in Alfreton, near the NHS Logistics site. When it was decided to transfer some Benefits Agency services to the ONE service, we had a private sector pilot in my area. The company chosen was Reed, but I was not allowed to have any information on why the service was put out to the private sector. Subsequently, it came back in house and into the public sector again. I do not know why.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/4">The review of NHS Logistics affects hundreds of my constituents and I would like an assurance that the process will be transparent, that all the factors will be taken into account, that our questions will be fully answered and that I will be given a clear, compelling and detailed argument about why any change should take place. I am the one who will have to go back and explain things to my constituents and my hon. Friends will have to explain to theirs. Will my right hon. Friend the Minister ensure that we have full information throughout the process?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-05.6.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1914" speakername="Mike Hall" colnum="6"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050705/halltext/50705h01.htm#50705h01_spnew11">
	<p pid=".6.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1373" name="Judy Mallaber">the Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber)</phrase> on securing&mdash;by the skin of her teeth&mdash;this important Adjournment debate, which covers a number of constituencies, on arriving right on time and on delivering such an excellent and eloquent dissertation on the reasons why we are here this morning.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/2">NHS Logistics has an operational distribution centre in my constituency, on the Astmoor industrial estate. It employs more than 200 people and is part of an excellent distribution network that serves the NHS well. I understand that my right hon. Friend the Minister will soon be making a visit to NHS Logistics in Runcorn, and I am sure that she will be warmly welcomed whenever that visit may be&mdash;her office has not told me yet, but I understand that it will be on Thursday.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/3">NHS Logistics is a very successful business. It is not for profit, it is an NHS operation, it is run by NHS staff, and the interests of NHS staff and patients are at the epicentre of what it does. Figures vary, but I understand that, nationally, NHS Logistics employs more than 1,400 people. It has six distribution centres, 230 vehicles and makes 1,200 deliveries a day to hospitals, clinics and GPs' surgeries. It has a catalogue of 42,000 items, which it delivers to 10,000 points in approximately 600 NHS trusts. As my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley has already said, its efficiency in delivery is superb. Some 98 per cent. of items are always available, 99 per cent. of the items that are important to the NHS are available and 98 per cent. of deliveries are made within 30 minutes of the delivery time specified by the purchasing NHS trust. That is a fantastic record. Achieving that on a day-to-day basis shows us that, as she has said, this is a superb operation.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/4">The non-pay, non-drugs spending of the English NHS is about &pound;12 billion. NHS Logistics operates in a market that has been estimated at about &pound;3.7 billion. The turnover of NHS Logistics is about &pound;700 million per annum. It has an operating cost of about &pound;70 million. Again, we can see that this is an efficient operation that does not cost the NHS any money to run. It provides the NHS with 75 per cent. of the volume of consumable durables involved at factory gate prices. It is important to make the point that any surplus that it makes is given back to the NHS in rebates. Over the past three years, at least &pound;9 million has been returned to the NHS. The business is growing very fast at the moment: we are talking about a 10 per cent. compound interest rate per annum. That is a phenomenal growth in an already excellent business.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/5">At the core of the business is the fact that it involves a paperless ordering system, through its e-commerce computers, which connects every NHS trust&mdash; everybody in the NHS who buys from NHS Logistics&mdash;directly to the operation. Online orders are made and, as I said, 98 per cent. of deliveries are made within 30 minutes of the delivery time specified by the NHS Logistics Authority. It is an extremely efficient operation. There have been at least two efficiency studies. You will not be surprised to hear, Mr. Olner, that both conclude that it is an extremely well run and efficient business that provides the NHS with an excellent service.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/6">Given the facts and figures that are on the record, anyone from outside who observed what was going on this morning would rightly ask why we were considering moving a service that serves the NHS well into the private sector or outsourcing it from the NHS. Clearly, the service does its job.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/7">The audit trail starts with the Gershon review. In his 2004 Budget report, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said:</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/8" class="indent">&quot;the pursuit of efficiency also includes reducing bureaucracy, that both cuts headquarters' administration costs and frees up time of front line professionals to respond better to the needs of their customers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/9">Anybody who works for the NHS Logistics Authority would have thought, listening to the Chancellor, that there was nothing in the Budget that should cause them to worry about their job security or about the prospects for NHS Logistics. The service allows a huge amount to go to front-line services, it is efficient and it provides a service that the NHS wants. It is a front-line NHS service.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/10">However, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-20">20 May 2005</phrase>, the then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase>, announced in a press release that the number of arm's length bodies in the NHS were to be reduced by 50 per cent., which would save &pound;500 million and reduce the number of posts by 25 per cent. It is not clear why he chose the figure of 50 per cent. I understand where the saving of &pound;500 million comes from and that, when we reduce the number of arm's length bodies, the number of people on the central payroll will reduce. I have no problem with that argument as long as it is done for the right reasons. My right hon. Friend went on to say:</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/11" class="indent">&quot;I want to see more staff and resources at the frontline delivering better patient care across the country. I want to see improved efficiency, reducing bureaucracy and better value for money.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/12">We keep making the point that that is exactly what NHS Logistics does. It is efficient, there is little bureaucracy and it provides excellent value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/13">The next bit of the audit trail is a statement made by a Department of Health spokesperson in the <i>Derbyshire Times</i>, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-21">21 October 2004</phrase>. The spokesperson said of the Department of Health review of arm's lengths bodies that</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/14" class="indent">&quot;A key objective of the review is to drive efficiency and best value for the NHS, and for the taxpayer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/15">We have no problem in pursuing best value and in getting good value for the taxpayer. The question in our minds is whether what the Government propose will achieve that.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/16">The spokesperson went on to confirm that</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/17" class="indent">&quot;The market testing process is looking at the feasibility of contracting out the consumable supplies and activities of NHS Logistics.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/18">That is almost a return to something that we had in local government&mdash;compulsory competitive tendering. A service that is delivered publicly by the NHS is being subjected to a market test to determine whether it can be done better; whether efficiency can be improved and costs reduced.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/19">The statement continues:</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/20" class="indent">&quot;The decision about contracting out will be taken in due course and will be subject to careful evaluation of the responses that the private sector will provide to the market testing currently initiated.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/21">What does that mean? How are we going to evaluate whether the market test has produced either a more efficient delivery of consumer durables in the NHS or delivered those durables more cheaply? Is that the test in this case? Is that the acid test that NHS Logistics must be put to? I hope that the Minister will address that when she responds to the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/22">We are getting closer to the real reasons why we face the market test. It is not about delivering efficiency or about value for money. It is about capturing more of the business of the NHS that does not relate to wages or the drugs bill.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/23">Our noble Friend, the then Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Health, Lord Warner, went further on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-13">13 December 2004</phrase>. He sent us a publication entitled</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/24" class="indent">&quot;Developing the supply chain and procurement services for the NHS to achieve better value&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/25">In that document, he explained the reasons for the market test. He said that</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/26" class="indent">&quot;market testing is designed to prove whether or not the most effective supply chain and procurement service for the NHS can be achieved by partnering with the independent sector.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/27">There was no question of contracting out, or of the private sector making comments as to whether the service could be delivered. The question was whether it could be achieved through partnership with the independent sector. The document then states something quite extraordinary:</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/28" class="indent">&quot;In the current environment of diverting all available resources to frontline services, it is not intended that the Department will make any further investment into the NHS Logistics Authority&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/29">That is quite remarkable because the Government do not do that anyway. It is a self-funding business that puts money back into the NHS. Its running costs stand at &pound;70 million, as has already been said, and if it needed to it could clearly expand its operation through its financial ability to draw on funds wherever possible. The Government do not actually fund what goes on within NHS Logistics.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/30">The NHS Logistics Authority could provide the Government with extra money or enable someone in the private sector to deliver this service in one of only two ways: it could reduce staffing costs or increase the cost of the services that it provides. I am not certain that there is much scope left for reducing staffing costs because that exercise has already been carried out. The only way in which anything can be achieved for the private sector is if it takes over the business and increases the cost to the national health service. That would be disastrous for the Department of Health and the NHS because increased costs for consumer durables would be passed on to NHS trusts. It would be a fruitless, pointless and stupid exercise.</p>

	<p pid=".10.2/1">I echo the words of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1914" name="Mike Hall">the Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall)</phrase> in congratulating our hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1373" name="Judy Mallaber">the Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber)</phrase> not only on securing this debate, but on all the hard work that she has put into the review of the NHS Logistics operation. The NHS Logistics Authority is a vital part of a successful NHS. Its hard-working staff are the backroom people of the NHS, not seen by the public, but the service that they provide is fundamental to our hospitals. NHS Logistics supply some 42,000 items, including blankets, bandages, biros, buckets and bedpans and many others. My hon. Friends and I understand that the Government have a responsibility to cut out waste and slash red tape to maximise the amount of resources going to the front line of our public services. It was a manifesto commitment on which we all stood for election. We all support that proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".10.2/2">The arm's length body review was commissioned by NHS Logistics and its sister organisation the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency, which are two of the 38 agencies whose number is to be reduced to 20. The Chancellor has said that the proposals for the arm's length bodies will produce savings of &pound;500 million, and my right hon. Friend the Minister will rightly point out that &pound;500 million could be used to build four new hospitals or employ 20,000 more nurses, 6,250 consultants or even 7,500 GPs. I have not attempted to calculate how many bedpans it would purchase, but I am sure that it would be a lot.</p>
	<p pid=".10.2/3">We want to understand clearly what the Government hope to have achieved by the end of the process. If they want the very best supplies operation for the NHS and a better-managed operation that is more efficient, that can expand its capacity and that can return resources to the NHS, they will have our support, but we need to understand how they will arrive at their decisions. Are they confident that they can, in advance, compare the private sector with the existing operation and its achievements, which my hon. Friends have described in detail?</p>

	<p pid=".12.1/1">TNT was obviously some way down the list, because it is not mentioned on the front page. It is not even on the shortlist. The judges recognised NHS Logistics as</p>
	<p pid=".12.1/2" class="indent">&quot;the team who has created or developed the most outstanding supply chain in the country. It is the 'best of the best' and is the top prize.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".12.1/3">That recognition comes from the industry itself. The judges also gave NHS Logistics a technology award, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley referred, for its e-supply package, which includes an electronic catalogue, ordering and billing. That part of the operation was, they said,</p>
	<p pid=".12.1/4" class="indent">&quot;an exceptional achievement in terms of strategy, implementation and user education&mdash;the best bit is it's my money they're saving&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".12.1/5">NHS Logistics is saving taxpayers' money through such investment in its technology.</p>
	<p pid=".12.1/6">Staff and organisations receive such awards with great pride, and those awards are not achieved by accident. A point that my hon. Friends have not made is that NHS Logistics has taken off recent years because of good management and the dedication of staff. With that comes good industrial relations with the main union, Unison. NHS Logistics invests in its staff and has a good training programme. The Maidstone site is next to my constituency and has 300 employees, and when I have visited it I have seen that management and staff work very well together. It is what the Labour Government want&mdash;a modern partnership in the workplace that invests in staff and improves productivity through investment in training. Many of the staff who work in the sector benefit from an increase in their basic skills and customer care skills. The results are there for all to see. The 98 per cent. achievement of delivery times is no accident, nor is the acknowledgement of NHS Logistics as the &quot;best of the best&quot;, nor the fact that more money is being put back into the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".12.1/7">NHS Logistics talks about paying detailed attention to customer care, and says that</p>
	<p pid=".12.1/8" class="indent">&quot;To be successful the customer must be at the centre of everything that we do&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".12.1/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley referred to the comparison between the private sector site at Bridgewater and the other four sites elsewhere in the country, including the one at Maidstone. A recent customer survey showed that Bridgewater was the poorest performer. The Cabinet Office report recommended that the number of sites should be reduced from six to five and that one should be run privately so that comparisons could be made. Everyone should be able to understand the intention and then determine whether the private sector is delivering a better operation.</p>

	<p pid=".13.2/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1373" name="Judy Mallaber">the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber)</phrase> on securing this debate. She and the hon. Members for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall) and for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw) spoke convincingly of the work done by their constituents who are employed by NHS Logistics. We heard about their excellent performance and the awards that they have won. I do not believe that anyone who heard those three hon. Members speak need have any doubt that NHS Logistics is a highly effective and, as far as one can tell, highly efficient organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".13.2/2">I have a great deal of sympathy with the general thrust of what the hon. Member for Amber Valley said about the need for a proper and transparent market-testing process. No one who has spoken would object to the principle of assessing whether what is done at present by NHS Logistics could be done better another way, although I believe that they are all confident about what the answer would be.</p>
	<p pid=".13.2/3">In trying to reassure us that the market-testing exercises are properly, not dogmatically, done, could the Minister give us an example of a market-testing exercise undertaken by her Department that did not find that the private sector would be more efficient than the public sector? If she could demonstrate that sometimes the answer is to keep activities in house, that would reassure us that the process is open, and not one that inevitably leads to a private sector solution.</p>
	<p pid=".13.2/4">The starting point for this debate and this process is, as the hon. Member for Weaver Vale said, the Gershon process and a bidding war between the Chancellor and the Tories over who could get rid of the most civil servants. I presume, although I am open to correction, that if NHS Logistics were market-tested and someone else were to carry on, the civil service head count would go down by a few thousand.</p>

	<p pid=".15.1/1">I could not disagree more with the hon. Gentleman's final comment, but, in the interests of not spreading disharmony on the thing that he does care about, which is his constituents and the logistics agency, I shall stick with that point. Suffice it to say that that money would have been better spent in the NHS with NHS providers, but we will return to that. I appreciate that there is a paradox here, in that I am trying to stand up for his constituents and he is trying to undermine the NHS, but we will come back to NHS Logistics.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/2">There seems to be no dispute about the fact that NHS Logistics provides an excellent service. The hon. Member for Amber Valley asked the pertinent&mdash;almost conservative, perhaps Conservative&mdash;question, &quot;If it ain't broke, why fix it?&quot; What is the motivation for the change? Government reviews have concluded that there is scope for efficiency savings. It is not clear why they say so; they just seem to assert it. I hope that the Minister will clarify, given what we have heard about the performance of NHS Logistics, why the Government are convinced that there is flab or fat to be got rid of. I see no symptoms of that. In fact, the phrase that the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford quoted a chief executive using was quite pertinent; the issue just was not on the radar. The point he was making was &quot;If it's not broke, don't fix it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/3">It is very interesting that we have, as it were, a mini market test, if one of the sites is run by the private sector and if, as we are told, it gives lower levels of satisfaction. If the Minister can tell us how that evidence will feed into the market-testing process, that will be helpful. I freely admit that the issue has not registered strongly on my radar until today, but I am concerned to hear from the hon. Member for Amber Valley that she has tried to get information about what is happening and that once again the response has been, &quot;Oh&mdash;commercial confidentiality. Can't really say.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/4">At what point will Members of the House stand up and revolt, and say &quot;Hang on. We have a job of scrutiny to do here&quot;? In individual constituency cases we get quite cross about such instances, but perhaps collectively we need to get crosser about the scrutiny of public services. All too often, we want to know what is going on, and are told that we cannot be told the details of the contract, because it is commercially sensitive, and we cannot be told operational details, because they are commercially sensitive, too. Our role in scrutinising what Government and public services do is undermined if we do not get answers to such questions, as the hon. Lady says.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/5">Perhaps I may be heretical for a moment. If the principle is bulk purchase and getting good value for the taxpayer, why must the NHS be ring-fenced? My example of coffee and stationery is slightly facetious, but why do not we link together public purchasers across the public sector? If the NHS has buying clout, presumably it and the Department for Education and Skills put together have even more. Could we get even better value for money by using the bulk purchasing power of the wider public sector more effectively, or are we dealing with a case of departmentalitis that prevents one Department from working with another for collective purchasing? I wonder whether the Minister has talked to ministerial colleagues in other Departments about whether the taxpayer, and the NHS purchaser, could get better value for money by working with other Government Departments as a bulk purchaser.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/6">We seem to be dealing with a paradox. The Government and, to an extent, all the political parties want the NHS to be more devolved&mdash;more local and more responsive to local needs and demand. Yet there is a danger that if we fragment and atomise the NHS we shall lose economies of scale from bulk purchasing power. Arguably, using bodies such as the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency and NHS Logistics to deliver services is a way of maintaining those benefits. It does not matter how devolved the primary care trusts and the rest may be; it will still be possible for them to tap into national purchasing and national logistics, and potentially that is good value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/7">Will the Minister clarify the motivation for what is proposed? I get the sense that it was decided on high&mdash;arbitrarily, as far as one can see&mdash;to reduce the number of arm's length bodies. It was asserted that there was scope for efficiency gains, in the face of apparent evidence that we have an impressively efficient organisation that works well. I hope that the Minister can assure us about the transparency of the process, and clarify the motivation. We all want more value for money, but it is not clear that the current process is the first place one would look for it.</p>

	<p pid=".16.0/1">I add my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1373" name="Judy Mallaber">the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber)</phrase> on securing the debate and on all the hard work that she has done for her constituents. I share the concerns that have been expressed by all speakers in the debate so far about the apparent lack of information on, and transparency in, the process. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to clarify the issues and answer questions.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/2">There is no doubt that NHS Logistics has been a success story. We have heard of the various awards that have been granted. As we know, demand for the organisation's services has risen year on year and it now accounts for about &pound;730 million, which is a very good figure. Every day its fleet of about 200 vehicles delivers to wards in NHS trusts items from the 42,000 lines kept at its five distribution centres.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/3">Credit for the authority's success lies directly with its management and staff of almost 1,500, many of whom are based at its headquarters and distribution centre at Alfreton in the constituency of the hon. Member for Amber Valley. I think that most hon. Members would agree with the Opposition that those staff face great uncertainty. For a number of reasons, either intentionally or inadvertently, that uncertainty has, to a large extent, been created by the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/4">To a certain extent, the Government have played politics with the authority in the timing of announcements&mdash;I shall make that clear in a moment&mdash;and in the message itself. That has created uncertainties and a certain lack of transparency. I say this with all due respect to the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>. As she is newly appointed, I know that she would not have been party to the problem, which goes back a few years.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/5">The Department of Health review of arm's length bodies, which was completed in July 2004, recommended that the authority's functions be outsourced and that the authority should be abolished by <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> next year. In truth, however, the authority's fate was already under discussion before the review started. In the autumn of 2003, the recommendation of the Department of Health's commercial directorate was that the authority's procurement and supply chain activity would be best developed in the private sector.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/6">Unfortunately, that was decided at about the same time as the then Secretary of State decided to undertake a review of the Department's arm's length bodies. The recommendations were unnecessarily delayed, so NHS Logistics was included in the review even though its future had already been decided. The Conservatives contend that it was included deliberately to expand the number of arm's length bodies being considered so as to make the scale of the apparent cuts seem larger. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/7">The inclusion of NHS Logistics to beef up the review was not unique. The Commission for Health Improvement, the National Care Standards Commission and the Retained Organs Commission were also included, despite having been abolished before the review got under way; and the National Radiological Protection Board and the Public Health Laboratory Service were included, despite the Government simultaneously progressing legislation to abolish them. Six of the original 42 arm's length bodies in the review had already been earmarked for abolition.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/8">To a certain extent, at least, the timing of announcements about NHS Logistics was about playing politics. That may not have been the sole factor, but it has contributed to the confusion and lack of transparency that have characterised the entire process.</p>

	<p pid=".18.3/1">The hon. Gentleman calls it a brilliant consultation, but many bodies involved felt that they had not been adequately consulted. I shall give him one example: the Society of Radiographers staged a picket of Parliament to make the point that it had not been adequately consulted. There were exceptions to that consultation and the hon. Gentleman should take them on board.</p>
	<p pid=".18.3/2">Bearing in mind that time is running short and as I would like to give the Minister plenty of time to answer a number of key questions, will she please address the following issues? There has been concern in my party about the actual privatisation. NHS Logistics has achieved valuable efficiency improvements in the NHS supply chain. Its strong and successful brand has encouraged NHS trusts and primary care trusts to use its services more and more, which is to be welcomed. That has further strengthened the integration of the various NHS supply chains and realised further efficiency gains.</p>
	<p pid=".18.3/3">The Government must ensure that the independent provider eventually chosen provides a service that is as good as, if not better than, that provided by NHS Logistics. Because of a poor Government track record regarding the designing of contracts involving the private sector, such as those related to the computer system for the Child Support Agency and independent involvement in London Underground, such contracts must be properly crafted. If the outsourcing of NHS Logistics is similarly poorly handled, we may see trusts seeking alternative distributors, the fragmentation of the supply chain and the loss of the efficiency gains achieved in the past few years.</p>
	<p pid=".18.3/4">We must not sacrifice the valuable emergency role played by NHS Logistics in order to entice private sector providers to bid for the contract. NHS Logistics provides a 24-hour, 365-day-a-year delivery service, which has been invaluable in building up the authority's reputation as well as helping to safeguard patient care. The authority will also be called on to supply health service consumables in the event of any terrorist or other major incident. The capacity for emergency response must be retained when the supply and distribution work for the NHS is put out to tender.</p>
	<p pid=".18.3/5">I also ask the Minister to address the fact that in recent years NHS Logistics has taken on an active role in bringing health care closer to the patient. The authority launched the home delivery service in April 2003, which now caters for more than 1,000 patients. That valuable resource should not be sacrificed simply because a private sector provider does not deem it commercially viable.</p>
	<p pid=".18.3/6">Finally, I ask the Minister to ensure that all relevant parties are fully consulted on the privatisation, including the relevant Members of Parliament. To help achieve greater transparency, I suggest to the Minister that there is no reason why NHS Logistics should not be allowed to bid for the contract, bearing in mind its excellent track record of recent years. The Minister should give due consideration to that.</p>
	<p pid=".18.3/7">I welcome the Government's apparent commitment to reducing the size and scope of the arm's length bodies, although they have yet to demonstrate that commitment anywhere but on paper. NHS Logistics is a successful distributor. It has driven wider efficiency improvements across the NHS and its staff must be congratulated on that achievement. Although I believe that it can operate better in partnership with the private sector, the partnership must be carefully crafted for the reasons already given. It must be drawn up to ensure that there is no loss of service or reduction in standard as the provider shifts from the public to the private sector. It must be drawn up with the full involvement of the staff and, I would suggest, other relevant individuals, such as MPs, who have done so much to build a successful organisation. The staff in particular deserve to be consulted on its and their future.</p>

Friends the Members for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall) and for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw) on their speeches. I apologise sincerely to my hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale for the shortness of notice about the visit on Thursday; I shall make sure that that is corrected as soon as the debate is concluded.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/2">I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" name="John Baron">the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase> to his position. This is the first chance that we have had to cross arms across the Chamber, but I am sure that there will be many more in future. I look forward to that, particularly if we can conduct business in the constructive style to which we have been treated this morning.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/3">Today's debate is about the market testing of the potential outsourcing of the supply chain and consumables procurement service for the NHS, which involves NHS Logistics. Let me quickly run through the process to date. An outline business case was presented to Ministers in spring 2004 and the usual notice was published and released in August that year to engage the private sector in a procurement process.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/4">I do not quarrel with any of the descriptions that hon. Members have given of the detail of the debate about the ALB review except what the hon. Member for Billericay said. I know my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase>, who was Secretary of State for Health at the time in question, extremely well: he is an extremely complex individual, but not as Machiavellian as the hon. Gentleman suggests. I reject his suggestion that the process was manipulated to the extent that he claims.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/5">Following the pre-qualification process six bidders were originally asked to respond to the invitation to submit an outline proposal. The next step would be to issue an invitation to negotiate. I was invited to take that step, but knew that there was anxiety on the matter; it was for that reason that I met Members of Parliament recently. I hope that this debate will contribute to dispelling some, if not all, of the anxiety and to counteracting some of the misinformation, or lack of information, about the process.</p>
	<p pid=".20.0/6">Three options are under consideration. The first is what we have been debating today&mdash;the option to outsource NHS Logistics only. However, there are two other potential options. One is to integrate NHS Logistics and the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency into one organisation; that is the recommendation of the arm's length bodies review. A third option is to market test the whole of the supply and procurement chain. We are not considering that option now, but it may be useful to describe it to hon. Members.</p>

	<p pid=".21.0/1">That, as I understand it, is the recommendation and that is what will happen in April next year if the status quo applies.</p>
	<p pid=".21.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase>, in a typically thoughtful and probing contribution, asked whether the Government were taking a dogmatic view of contracting out and whether we had examples of occasions when we had considered the issues and turned back. I cannot give him examples of recent Department-level decisions because I am not aware of any, but there is the option within trusts of considering market testing, and there are organisations, trusts and hospitals that do not contract out some of their services&mdash;some have chosen to do so, but others have not. At Guy's and St. Thomas' across the river, for example, cleaning services are not contracted out. Equally, a hospital in my constituency does not contract out its portering service. We are not considering the issue from the dogmatic point of view that private is best. I hope to address that point in the short time available.</p>
	<p pid=".21.0/3">I accept that there are concerns about the impact that the proposals could have on staff and on the continuity and standard of service that the NHS currently enjoys. Since it came into being in 2000, the management team at NHS Logistics has grown the business from &pound;500 million to &pound;700 million-plus per year. It is important to place on the record the fact that NHS Logistics offers the NHS an efficient, one-stop shop for consumables and minimises the effort that trusts have to expend on such orders. Trusts benefit from the fact that NHS Logistics takes care of the ordering process, supplier payment, storage and the receipt and delivery of orders. As a result, those that rely on its services do not need to operate on-site stores to hold large quantities of consumables stock and they enjoy a paperless inventory trail.</p>
	<p pid=".21.0/4">One of the key points is that nobody has said that NHS Logistics is not a good business. The crucial point, however, is that the NHS is not realising its full potential. The logistics service must expand and develop to meet the needs of a rapidly changing health service and the vision of a public sector that puts people at its heart. I say that not as a piece of political jargon, but because it is crucial that the whole NHS constantly reviews and examines the way in which it does business. My hon. Friends have acknowledged that.</p>
	<p pid=".21.0/5">The NHS must become a service that works with patients to support them and their needs&mdash;a truly patient-led service. That must be our focus. Operating and managing a consumables procurement supply chain might deflect effort and resources from that critical agenda&mdash;the hon. Member for Northavon was prepared to contemplate the possibility that questions can be raised about that point. We should therefore consider partnering with someone for whom such things are their central focus. We have to take every step to ensure that the greatest percentage of the available budget is directed towards creating a patient-led NHS. By not achieving best value for money through our supply chain service, we are undermining our core mandate.</p>
	<p pid=".21.0/6">My hon. Friends have said that they will be less anxious if it can be demonstrated that the proposals offer the best value and are in the best interests of the NHS. Why, in the Government's view, are we not achieving best value? We spend about &pound;15 billion a year on non-pay goods and services. Approximately &pound;3.7 billion is spent on consumables, with only &pound;700 million of that going through NHS Logistics, as we discussed earlier. There is considerable opportunity for expansion and to drive efficiency and savings across the NHS. All of that will have a significant impact on front-line delivery. We believe that an independent sector organisation could be best placed to achieve such expansion. Far from driving up costs to the NHS, we seek to widen the benefits. We believe, for example, that we could achieve lower product prices through back-office efficiencies, and that we could provide a greater variety of services to meet different trust requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".21.0/7">The introduction of new and innovative technologies could also bring enormous benefits to the NHS. I assure hon. Friends and other hon. Members who have taken part in the debate that none of that would be achieved at the expense of the trusts. Trusts would benefit from significant savings, which could be invested in front-line delivery.</p>

	<p pid=".22.1/1">We discussed that when we met hon. Members who represent constituencies that are affected. The truth is that the management could have responded to the advertisement placed in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>. If the management had submitted a bid at that stage, I understand that they would have had to withdraw from the business in order to create a bid that could compete and that would not be based on the unfair advantage of actually running the business at it stands. I know that that is a convoluted process, but that was the advice as I understand it. Service delivery might have suffered if the management had withdrawn from the day-to-day operation of the business. The management would not have been able to inform or influence the process of developing the contracts and considering whether to move to the stage of inviting organisations to bid. That is as much as I want to say about that at the moment, but I have considered the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/2">I was asked about consulting customers. Customers have been consulted. The trusts that use NHS Logistics and PASA say that they value the service and do not want there to be any deterioration in it. We share that aspiration, and are determined that that will not happen. However, they do want changes in the range of services offered. There were common themes in the trusts' comments to those who organised the consultation. First, the organisers were told:</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/3" class="indent">&quot;they need to manage the whole supply chain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/4">That might be addressed eventually any way, but another comment was that</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/5" class="indent">&quot;they are good at what they do but to me they are box shifters&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/6">Finally, one trust said:</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/7" class="indent">&quot;our service is 24/7, NHS Logistics isn't&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/8">It is possible that an independent sector partner would be incentivised to increase the volume and business and to achieve better product prices. That would directly benefit the trusts. I assure hon. Members that one of the driving principles behind the market testing is to protect the continuity and standard of service that the NHS currently enjoys. No decision would be taken that would jeopardise that.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/9">I do not have time to touch on the consultation with Unison, but there are two points to make. My hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale asked what we were testing. We are testing the ability of the market to deliver the lower total cost of supplying consumables to the NHS. That would be achieved by a growth in the volume, which would deliver lower prices, thereby driving prices down further. That is our objective. We would not be cutting staff numbers if the business were growing; on the contrary, staff numbers would increase.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/10">The commercial directorate in charge of the operation deserves great credit for its work. The supply chain excellence programme, under which the process is being run, is proving to be of real benefit to the health service. It is important for the House to note that the directorate has worked with the NHS procurement and supply agency to achieve an annualised saving that is forecast to be more than &pound;140 million. The process may yet achieve even more savings for the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".24.1/1">Thank you for calling me, Mr. Olner. I am delighted that the subject of fatherhood and the care of children has been chosen for debate this morning. I welcome the Minister to her place and look forward to hearing her response.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/2">For me, today has been all about fatherhood. I have just had a meeting with the Nappy Alliance, whose chairperson lives in my constituency, and an esteemed company called Bambino Mio, the UK market leader in reusable nappies, which is based in Brixworth in Kettering. I should like to dedicate the debate to my baby son Thomas, who is just over one year old. I am sure that he would be delighted if he knew that he was appearing in parliamentary records so early. Unfortunately, he cannot be here because he is with his mum, Donna, at the village coffee morning. Both of them send their apologies.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/3">The main themes on which I want to touch are the importance of the contact between fathers and early-years children and of increasing parents' active responsibility for their children's behaviour, and the need for us to do four things: to do more to promote the institution of marriage; to get back to the idea that it is important to be able to afford and provide for a family before becoming parents; to tackle the issue of teenage pregnancy; and to make it easier for fathers to engage in fatherhood.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/4">I started my research by going to the House of Commons Library to look up the dictionary definition of fatherhood. Unfortunately, despite the Library's huge resources, although I could find a definition of father, I could not find one of fatherhood. In my view, paternity&mdash;the Hollobone definition of which is the act of fathering a child&mdash;is very different from fatherhood, the participatory process of caring for and nurturing one's child or children. Fatherhood has demonstrable benefits. My wife said at the weekend that Thomas behaves differently with me than he does with her. Of course there is a very close bond between mother and child, and the relationship between father and child is different. However, the two together have been for centuries&mdash;and, I would suggest, will continue to be&mdash;the best way to bring up children.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/5">The Equal Opportunities Commission has published magnificent research into the benefits of fatherhood. One of its recent studies suggested that children whose fathers have been actively involved in their lives do demonstrably better, with higher educational achievements, more satisfactory relationships in adult life and less likelihood of getting into trouble with the police. The EOC goes on to say that the</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Early involvement of father with child is associated with continuing involvement with that child through childhood and adolescence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/7">A report called &quot;What Good Are Dads?&quot;, a review of 20 years of research into fatherhood by Charlie Lewis, professor of psychology at Lancaster university, was published in June 2001 by Fathers Direct. The research showed that involvement of fathers with children aged seven to 11 predicts exam success at 16. If fathers are involved before the age of 11, children are less likely to have a criminal record by the age of 21, and pre-school children who spend more time playing with their dads are often more sociable when they enter nursery school.</p>

	<p pid=".27.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing this important debate.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/2">We use the word &quot;crisis&quot; a lot in this place, in our press releases and in our speeches. Last night we were discussing council tax and the crisis affecting certain income groups, and last week we were discussing the crisis affecting NHS dentistry. All are important issues and certainly worthy of parliamentary time, but this morning we have the opportunity to focus on something that I truly believe is a national crisis. However, it is rarely discussed properly, either because of political correctness, which sucks the very heart and value from any debate on social issues, or because it is so easy to fall back on generalisations and caricatures, stigmatising vulnerable groups or harking back to a bygone age.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/3">We in the UK face a social crisis as a result of the absence of fathers from the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. The absence of fathers from family life is surely the most socially consequential family trend of our era. Some 15 per cent. of babies born at the turn of the millennium now live just with their mothers. Of those, nearly half see their fathers at least once a week, but nearly four in 10 have no contact with their fathers at all.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/4">We see that phenomenon all around us in our constituencies, especially in communities centred on social housing developments. We are familiar, I hope, with the complex and interrelated problems of social exclusion that characterise those communities: poverty, low aspirations, educational failure, truancy, crime&mdash;the list goes on. Rarely do we hear discussion in this place about the link between family structure and such outcomes for children and young people, however. The evidence is there, but it is staggering how often people involved in family policy refuse to acknowledge it.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/5">The proportion of children being raised by lone parents has increased by a quarter under this Government&mdash;there are now more than 3.2 million of them&mdash;and we are in danger of becoming the lone-parent capital of Europe. According to EUROSTAT, lone-parent families make up more than 70 per cent. of households with children&mdash;more than in any other country in Europe. That is partly because the absolute number of children living in one-parent families is so large, but also because the birth rate among intact couples has fallen. As a result of those twin developments, the percentage of children living in one-parent households is now much higher in Britain than elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/6">It is so easy inadvertently to frame the debate in terms that lay the blame at the door of the single mum, but that is absolutely not the purpose of my speech, or of this debate. One of the Conservative party's great errors of the past 20 years was to view social fragmentation through a lens that saw single mums as the principal problem. To a large extent, the problem is also about men, and about men behaving irresponsibly and fathering children. Often, they too have been brought up in lone-parent homes, with no understanding of what real fatherhood is about, and they then replicate the cycle in the lives of their own children.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/7">There has been a lot of research in recent years about the socio-economic changes affecting the male population in post-industrialised countries. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1623" name="David Willetts">the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts)</phrase> has written at great length about those changes, describing what has happened to the marriageable pool of men. Often in communities there are men whom women will happily sleep with, and have children with, but with whom they would never in their wildest dreams set up home.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/8">Many children living in single-parent homes will eventually end up in step-families. Social parenting, as opposed to biological parenting, is an important new phenomenon in family life. It is essentially about stepfatherhood. More and more men are raising other men's children, while in many cases their own children grow up elsewhere. No fewer than 17 per cent. of dads born in 1970 are stepfathers, nearly double the number among men born just 12 years earlier.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/9">The most rapidly growing family type is the step-family. Since most children remain with their mother following divorce or separation, most step-families have a stepfather rather than a stepmother at their head. Not nearly enough research has been undertaken into the pressures on step-families, especially as the Child Support Agency is often lurking in the background of those families' lives, and payments are being made to the previous partners.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/10">There has been a great deal of research about what social fragmentation means for children and society in general. Although many lone parents and step-parents do a superb job raising their families, the children are at much greater risk of abuse, of neglect and of worse social, educational and health outcomes than children who live with both their natural parents.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/11">The decline of the traditional family unit is harmful to children and to wider society. As an example, I dug out a Home Office report on young people and crime from about 10 years ago. It undertook extensive research into the factors that drive young people to criminality. One conclusion stated:</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/12" class="indent">&quot;For both males and females, those who lived with both natural parents were the least likely ever to start to offend, followed by those living with a lone parent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/13">Those living with one natural and one step-parent were the most likely to start offending.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/14">A few years ago I paid a visit to Cardiff prison, where I met a group of young men in their late teens and had a discussion with them about their lives. All had had chaotic home lives; all had grown up without the presence of a father; all had failed at school, played truant and committed criminal acts; and a few of them had found themselves in a revolving door situation, in prison for the third or fourth time. Several of those young men had already started to father children, thus repeating the pattern.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/15">Family fragmentation matters. One of the most important factors to understand in this debate, although by no means the most important factor, is the fiscal framework surrounding the family structure. During the election campaign two months ago, I spoke to one young family at their home in Haverfordwest. They had two young children, the mother stayed at home and did not work, and the father had a modestly paid job earning less than &pound;16,000 a year. They told me that their calculations showed that they would be better off if they divorced and the mother raised their children as a single parent. What a staggering conclusion in this day and age: a family can make that judgment and those calculations, and find that they would be better off splitting up and having the mother raise their children alone.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/16">I have seen research undertaken by people such as Jill Kirby at the Centre for Policy Studies, which claims that the tax and benefit system subsidises marriage break-up. It shows that the average couple family in which one partner has a job is only &pound;1 a week better off than the average workless one-parent family, because lone parents get so much extra support from the state. I do not believe that the perverse incentives created by the tax and benefit system go anywhere near far enough to explain the social trends that we are debating, but they are important factors that Ministers need to address.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/17">One point that I want to draw attention to, which is linked to the main issue, is the wider absence of male role models in the lives of young people, particularly in schools. The General Teaching Council for Wales noted two months ago that there were so few male teachers in Wales that many pupils had gone through their primary years without ever being taught by a man. In primary schools, only 16 per cent. of teachers are men. In secondary schools the figure is 40 per cent. I welcome the Minister's thoughts on why, despite the campaign by the Teacher Training Agency, the overall percentage of male teachers is falling. It was 28 per cent. last year and it is 27 per cent. this year.</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/18">What more can be done to address that problem? In other areas of life we see many examples of positive discrimination to rectify gender or racial imbalances. Should Ministers not be taking a more active approach in this area as well?</p>
	<p pid=".27.2/19">We in the House are doing the country a huge disservice when we fail to promote marriage, and fail to tell the truth about how the collapse of family life seems to fuel every social problem, including truancy. This is not about a mission for moral rearmament, and it is certainly not about demonising single mums, the vast majority of whom do a fantastic job. It is simply about recognising that children who grow up with their fathers do far better emotionally, educationally, physically, and in every way that we can measure, than children who do not. That conclusion holds true even when differences of race, class and income are taken into account. The simple truth is that fathers are irreplaceable in shaping the competence and character of their children.</p>

I, too, must declare an interest. I am a father of five children. To follow my hon. Friend's lead, they are Barnaby, Harriet, Dougal, Dorothy and Noah. Perhaps we should all declare a significant interest&mdash;we all want children to get off to the best start and there to be a reduction in the antisocial behaviour that we see in our communities. We all have an interest in trying to ensure the presence of a responsible father in our homes.</p>
	<p pid=".30.0/2">I have been a solicitor dealing with criminals for the past 11 years. Yesterday, I handed over my files to my replacement, so I spent some time looking back at old files. I thought about the characteristics of criminal clients. Invariably, they are young men, who show irresponsibility. Often they are drug addicts with learning difficulties and are from homes in which there was a single parent. They invariably had little or no contact with a father and no older male role model.</p>
	<p pid=".30.0/3">One such client was my first client at Enfield police station. He was a young man who had previously had high expectations&mdash;he had hoped to be a weightlifter for England&mdash;but had, sadly, been tempted by drugs. His lack of discipline and respect showed itself in what was the first of many criminal offences. Over the years, he became one of the most prolific offenders in Enfield. It was not uncommon for him to commit 100 burglaries in a week. He has now become my last client. He is in Pentonville serving a stretch of three years for robbery.</p>
	<p pid=".30.0/4">During the 11 years that I have known him, there have been periods of stability in his life. I will consider the characteristics of that stability. It has been when, as a father of two young children, he has, for brief times it must be said, showed responsibility. He has then been able to reconnect with society. When he took seriously his responsibility as a father, that connection was made. He suddenly woke up to the fact that he had duties and responsibilities in society. That had a profound effect on him not committing offences. Yes, he was no doubt helped by drug treatment and testing orders and by probation supervision, but of most significance, as he would say himself, was when he faced his responsibilities as a father.</p>
	<p pid=".30.0/5">It is that challenge that we need to face. The cost to Enfield of those 100 burglaries a week and the cost to his family and to others have been because of that individual and others like him. The big challenge for such people is to reconnect with society and with being fathers, and to take their responsibilities seriously.</p>
	<p pid=".30.0/6">It is significant that when I visited that person in the cells at Enfield magistrates court or at Pentonville he was often distraught or in tears. The bravura of being a prolific offender had peeled off and he was just a young child in many ways. The first thing that he would always say was that he wanted his father and that he wanted his father to show some interest in him. That had a profound effect on him, and it is now showing itself across the generations as he is not taking seriously his responsibilities as a father. We must tackle the issue of fatherhood, not only for his benefit but for that of the community.</p>
	<p pid=".30.0/7">Statistics have been produced, which I will not seek to repeat. It is shocking that the rate of lone parenthood in this country is more than double that of our European neighbours. Teenage motherhood and teenage pregnancy rates are rocketing. Enfield has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy of any London borough. The challenge, which we need to tackle early, must be to ensure that fatherhood has an important role. Young men should appreciate their responsibilities at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid=".30.0/8">Fathers who are on the scene and the time that they spend with children are also important Matters. One survey researched a number of fathers, who spent on average three minutes a day with their children. We should compare that with the fact that the same research showed that children spent three hours in front of a television. We have serious problems in our society with the time that fathers take with their children and with fathers being absent from the home.</p>
	<p pid=".30.0/9">We should perhaps learn some lessons from America, where there has been a debate about family breakdown. I am sure that we can all agree that family breakdown has dire consequences. The debate on welfare to work has been followed by a number of programmes, aimed at getting lone parents back into the work force. The Government are taking that part of the equation seriously. However, we cannot stop there, and we need to accompany that with the role of fathers. That role is vital, and we need to promote it, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering said. The equation is important. There is an imbalance if we rely on getting people back to work and do not properly value the importance of fatherhood.</p>
	<p pid=".30.0/10">We need to wake up effectively to the profound financial and social costs of family breakdown. Disintegration can no longer be tolerated by a responsible Government. Firm action is needed and it has to happen now. Welfare policies have sought to create a habit of getting people back into work. At the same time we need policies that will restore the important role of men in family life. That is important and it needs to accompany any welfare-to-work policies.</p>
	<p pid=".30.0/11">We need to examine some radical measures, such as joint registration of births, joint interviews for benefits and encouraging the family and father link in housing. In Enfield, we have been particularly keen to consider the family and generational link for housing preferences. Where the state is involved in funding, we need to be creative and maybe even radical to ensure a role for men in family life and in the important decisions. Whenever welfare is handed out, a contract is involved and that needs to be a proper contract that includes fathers.</p>
	<p pid=".30.0/12">The vital challenge that we need to take up is to reconnect fathers to families. The debate is not simply about fathers paying their child support and having supervised contact. That is not good enough. We need to go further. We need to promote and value the role of fatherhood, and to harness and encourage voluntary groups and faith-based organisations that promote fatherhood.</p>
	<p pid=".30.0/13">As my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering said, we need to be bold and to recognise that generally, although not exclusively, marriage sustains fatherhood. We should promote and reward those groups that promote not only fatherhood, but, explicitly, marriage. We must support trusts that work hard practically to support and encourage stable and long-lasting marriage, because that is in the interests of fatherhood and children. We therefore need to ensure that all our welfare and family policies promote family, fatherhood and marriage. That is in the best interests of us and our children.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-05.37.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" speakername="Brian Binley" colnum="37"  time="011:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050705/halltext/50705h02.htm#50705h02_spnew14">
	<p pid=".37.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Olner. I apologise for not letting you know earlier that I wanted to speak, and am grateful to you for calling me.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/2">I start by referring to my maiden speech in the House, in which I talked about a dear friend of mine who was the Labour agent in Kidderminster when I was the Conservative agent. I said that when we cast aside our political differences, we were surprised by how much we agreed on and how much work we could do together. It is in that spirit that I make my contribution today, because there is much that we can do together. If the Minister sees this as a political attack requiring a political defence, we shall fail, but I am sure that she does not, and that encourages me.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/3">I shall concentrate on the impact of the absence of a permanent male role model, commonly called a father, in family life, particularly the way it affects the education of boys aged 12 to 14. Some 50 per cent. of boys brought up in two-parent families have the chance to achieve meaningful educational qualifications, but, sadly, only 30 per cent. of boys from homes in which one parent&mdash;overwhelmingly the mother&mdash;has played almost the sole parental role have a chance to achieve the same. That is a massive difference of 40 per cent. If anything shows the import of male role models in parenting, it must be that.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/4">I have discussed the matter with teachers in upper schools in Northampton, and it is clear that boys brought up in homes without a permanent male parent are more likely to reject the benefits of education when aged 12 to 14, seeing it as a waste of time in many respects. Teachers think that, sadly, the interest of such boys is consistently more turned off than the majority of young men from homes with a permanent male role model. Equally importantly, such boys are also much more likely to reject authority because, in a way, they see having authority as a male activity. It is not difficult to see how important that is in other aspects of life as they proceed through their lives.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> said that fatherhood is the participating process of nurturing and progressing the life of a child. There is support for that in the 2000 Ofsted report, which said that</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/6" class="indent">&quot;there is a disturbing absence of men involved in family learning.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/7">That is the point from which I start: the life chances of a child are created through the learning process, particularly our education process in this country. It is clear from all the evidence that when fathers are involved in their children's learning, those children's exam results and school behaviour improve, they exhibit less criminal behaviour later on, and they have better relationships in their adult lives. I did not say that&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-05.38.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" speakername="Nick Hurd" colnum="38"  time="012:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050705/halltext/50705h02.htm#50705h02_spnew17">
	<p pid=".38.2/1">I am grateful to you, Mr. Olner, for squeezing me in. This important debate goes to the heart of a growing concern in my constituency about the perceived breakdown in the values that once bound the community together&mdash;respect for the law, respect for property and respect for each other.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/2">A growing voice has linked that breakdown with the way in which children are being brought up today. It is not just the voice of nostalgia for a golden age of parenthood that probably never existed. I have spoken with senior London policemen who have to deal with the fact that 40 per cent. of street crime in London is committed by 10 to 16-year-olds playing truant. I have spoken with the headmasters of secondary schools who often find parents who obstruct rather than support their efforts to instil more discipline in their schools. A growing body of research summarises the evidence of family breakdown in Britain and its harmful impact on children.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/3">It is striking how out on a limb we are. Britain is the divorce capital of Europe, with 25 per cent. of children living in lone-parent households. That is twice the European average as measured by EUROSTAT, and the trend shows no sign of slowing. The Government's approach has been to respect personal freedom and to help those facing the challenge of bringing up children on their own in conditions of poverty by providing them with support. Those good intentions are to be supported&mdash;they are thoroughly respectable&mdash;but I would argue that they have unintended but damaging consequences.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/4">I would like to pick up the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase>, which is that the tax and benefits system now discourages low-earning parents from forming two-parent families. That message comes through strongly in research from a wide range of organisations, including Civitas, Care, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Centre for Policy Studies. It is the inevitable outcome of a system in which income tax is based on individual assessment, with no allowances for marriage, and benefits are based on a joint assessment; arguably, penalties for marriage are built in to the system.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/5">If that is true, Government policy may be helping to increase the number of children being raised without a father in the home, despite increasingly clear evidence that there is a link between marriage or stable cohabitation and a better outcome for children in terms of health, performance at school and crime. That being so, is it not time to confront the awkward truth that children growing up outside the family unit do not have equality of opportunity? Is it not time to re-examine where the interests of children lie and ask whether it can be in their interests to penalise couples and subsidise lone parents? Faced with the growing tension between the need to respect personal freedom and the desire to give children the best possible chance, I argue that the Government should at least be neutral in the signals that they send via the tax and benefits system.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/6">I was canvassing on an estate in Ruislip during the general election when I was pursued down the street by a young man in a dressing gown. He wanted to tell me that his decision to marry his girlfriend would cost him &pound;400 in lost benefit. He was going to do it anyway, because he thought that it was the right thing to do&mdash;but he wanted to know whether it was wrong for the Government to be sending that signal to young people. I said yes&mdash;and I would be interested to hear the Minister's response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-05.39.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="39"  time="012:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050705/halltext/50705h02.htm#50705h02_spnew18">
	<p pid=".39.0/1">I add my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase>; our debate has raised many interesting issues. I stand here with some trepidation, in view of the line-up of hon. Members behind me. I am a mother&mdash;and to protect myself from further comments, I can tell the House that I have been married for more than 35 years. I also declare an interest in that I am a trustee of Poole community family trust. I share many of the enthusiasms of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase>, and his interest in the topic. Of course, the trust receives Government money.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/2">I was slightly disheartened when I first saw the title of this debate, because I always think that we should put children first, and I thought that the title should be &quot;Children and the Role of Parents&quot;. However, many hon. Members have addressed that point. It is clear that childhood, and therefore parenting, are much more complex in today's society. We have to understand the needs and rights of parents of both sexes, and of children, in the context of the economic and social environment in which we live.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/3">We are getting it wrong in so many ways. I would like to add just one more statistic: ChildLine reports that 1,500 suicidal children phone its helpline every year, often citing problems of abuse, neglect and low self esteem that build up during childhood. We have a lot to answer for.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> made some particularly interesting contributions about work-life balance. Most people would agree that ideally, caring roles should be shared by women and men, with support from employers. Interestingly, that probably does not mean a 50:50 split, although we hear a lot about 50:50 splits in the debate on child contact. That is a sad reflection on the number of hours that our fathers work&mdash;the longest hours in Europe. One in eight fathers work excessively long hours&mdash;60 or more hours a week. That does not give much chance, or time in the day, for the development of fatherhood. Even so, overall, fathers' time spent with their children accounts for one third of total parental care time. On that basis, we have to value the contribution of fatherhood to caring for children.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/5">We have mentioned the need for flexible working time, and we need to be concerned about the lack of opportunity for flexible working practices, and also the lack of take-up by fathers. When fathers have been actively involved in their children's lives, the children have better outcomes. We have heard about a number of such outcomes today.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/6">Fathers often face the conflict of being both a parent and, frequently, the main breadwinner. What can we do in terms of maternity and paternity leave&mdash;paid and unpaid&mdash;and flexible working time? We need to applaud the Government for making a move. From April 2003 there has been a fortnight's sort-of paid leave&mdash;although there is not very much pay, which is not a great incentive. Indeed, where not enough money is paid, it might even be a disincentive for fathers.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/7">It is clearly an advantage to have the father around during those all-important early years. What more can we do? I look forward to the new measures that the Government will announce shortly. I also agree with some of the comments about encouraging active fatherhood; I am not sure that I agree with all the ways of encouraging it, but the principle is sound.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/8">I would like to touch briefly on the importance of family support mechanisms. With the changing structures in society, support mechanisms have become much more important. Being a parent is probably the most important job that we can ever take on in life, yet most of us have no training whatever. Parental training should not be seen as something to be scorned, but should be available for everybody; it should be seen as the thing to do, rather than as the result of some failure.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/9">To return to relationships, which I care so much about, I am sure that we can do so much more pre-marriage, pre-relationship and post-relationship, particularly in schools. We could start at the age of five, and have a curriculum that embraced the importance of relationships. In the other place the other day, Lord Northbourne suggested that</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/10" class="indent">&quot;children should be learning from appropriately trained teachers interpersonal skills appropriate to their age&mdash;communication skills, emotional literacy, how to form and sustain good relationships with peers and adults and how to discuss and negotiate without anger.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2005-06-29.276"><i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>29 June 2005; Vol. 673, c. 276</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/11">There is so much scope there. Without being preachy about the situation, we can actually improve the family's chances and the children's life chances within that.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/12">As far as fathers are concerned, I am particularly keen on early bonding. That is happening in some places, and the early and prenatal involvement of fathers is all-important. Once that bond was formed, it would be likely to continue on in life, and perhaps we would not have so many disputes over child contact.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/13">Important scientific evidence is also emerging now that without a strong bond with at least one adult, a baby is likely to suffer brain damage, which can lead to all sorts of antisocial behaviour. We need to study the first six months closely; we need to think about the child and both parents. That is critical to later life. I also endorse the point about the male role model in school. My perception is that things are changing. However, for a long time there was a noticeable absence in primary schools, which was significant.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/14">Before I finish, I want to mention the Child Support Agency, with all the mistakes that are made, and the other issues involved, as a clear example of not putting children first. We must also be mindful of domestic violence. We must ensure that women&mdash;or men, if that is appropriate&mdash;and most of all children, are protected.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/15">Many of us are exhausted from the long hours that we work, and perhaps we do not take enough time out to think about what we do. We need to love and care for our children and value their great achievements. We must appreciate that we bring precious beings into the world, and that they should come first.</p>

	<p pid=".41.0/1">We have had an excellent debate, and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing it. This is the first time that this subject has been tackled in the Chamber in all my years in the House. It is an enormous subject.</p>
	<p pid=".41.0/2">When we talk about fathers in the media and politics, it tends to be in negative terms&mdash;what Fathers4Justice and &quot;Superman&quot; may have been getting up to, and problems with the Child Support Agency and errant fathers. However, there are an awful lot of positives, too, and some have been mentioned by my hon. Friends today. Certainly, lack of involvement by fathers has been and is still the cause of enormous social fragmentation, as my hon. Friends the Members for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb), for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley) and for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd) have said.</p>
	<p pid=".41.0/3">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. I find it extraordinary, particularly given the strong interest that the hon. Members here have shown, that not a single Labour Back Bencher has contributed to a debate on a subject that covers a multitude of matters of direct and key relevance to many of our constituents. That is a cause of great sadness.</p>
	<p pid=".41.0/4">Many organisations, particularly in the voluntary sector, are contributing to the debate about how we can be better fathers. Fathers Direct has been mentioned several times, and it produces excellent publications, among which &quot;Working with Fathers: A Guide&quot; is worthy of a mention.</p>
	<p pid=".41.0/5">It is worth contemplating some of the changing social patterns that mean that fathers spend more time with their children than they ever used to. Despite some of the assumptions rightly made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> about the pressure of work, parents in general now spend four times as long on child care as they did 40 years ago. Interestingly, men now spend eight times as long with their children as they did then. There has been a drastic change between the amount of time that my father would have been expended to spend with me in the early 1960s and the amount of time that I might be expected to spend with my children now. As hon. Members have said, however, Members of Parliament are perhaps not the best role models in the matter of finding quality time for bonding with children.</p>
	<p pid=".41.0/6">Things are getting better. Almost eight out of 10 working fathers in a survey revealed that they would be happy to stay at home and look after their baby, while almost nine out of 10 felt as confident as their partner&mdash;hopefully their wife, in many cases&mdash;about caring for children. In families where women work, fathers now carry out one third of the parental care. &quot;Househusband&quot; is no longer a demeaning term, but a real qualification for many people. In 24 per cent. of families with two parents, the father carried out most of the child care on one of the two days monitored for the time use and child care survey.</p>
	<p pid=".41.0/7">There have been changes in employment practices, too. Two in 10 new fathers made work pattern adjustments at the time of the birth, including one in 10 who reduced their working hours and 4 per cent. who took advantage of flexitime. That is a message that needs to go out to employers. Flexibility in work patterns for both parents can lead to better employees. It is in the interests of everybody to help to achieve that. British Telecom is piloting a flexible working scheme from which it is seeing benefits for its work, not just benefits in social conditions for families. So there is a mutual interest.</p>
	<p pid=".41.0/8">According to Lisa Harker of Children Now, British fathers have yet to match the level of family involvement of the Aka pygmies, a hunter-gatherer tribe from northern Congo in central Africa. Those fathers are branded the best dads in the world by Fathers Direct. Aka pygmy fathers spend 47 per cent. of their time in close contact with their infants, even letting them suck their nipples. So in this country, we still have a long way to go.</p>
	<p pid=".41.0/9">However, cultural changes and developments in Britain in the last half century have produced a generation of fathers who are more eager than ever to play a central role in the daily lives of their children. The Government should be conscious not to put any unnecessary obstacles in the way of fathers who want to engage with their children. Too often, the stereotyping in many Government publications&mdash;good publications on Sure Start and the child care work force, for example&mdash;still concentrates on women and their role. Not enough is being done to promote the role of fathers.</p>
	<p pid=".41.0/10">We also know that there is a distinct lack of men in the child care work force. I do not see enough being done about that problem. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire and the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> both mentioned it, particularly in the context of teaching. When I go round primary schools, it is rare to see a male teacher&mdash;and if I do, it is usually the head. I was at a primary school in my constituency last week and I was absolutely gobsmacked to see a male classroom assistant. He was the first one I have ever seen, and he was doing a fantastic job.</p>
	<p pid=".41.0/11">Despite everything that the Government do, I still have concerns. They do many good things, such as promoting the child care work force, extended schools and the greater roles that professionals play&mdash;but we must not forget parents. The people who know best about bringing up children are, in 99.9 per cent. of cases, the parents of those children. Please let us not create a professional work force that looks to usurp the role of parents, but create one that complements and works with both parents, wherever possible, so that love, affection and attachment to the child is present in the home 24 hours a day.</p>
	<p pid=".41.0/12">We know of the problems when fathers are not properly involved. Children without fathers are more likely to live in poverty and deprivation. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> said that 45 per cent. of children in poverty were in single parent households. Such children have more trouble in school. Forty nine per cent. of prisoners have been excluded from school. Non-father families have a higher risk of health problems, and children in them are at greater risk of suffering physical, emotional and sexual abuse. They are more likely to run away from home, more likely to experience sexual health problems and more likely to become teenage parents. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase> rightly pointed out, they are also more likely to offend. Of those convicted of an offence by the age of 32, 59 per cent. are the sons of a convicted parent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-05.44.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" speakername="Maria Eagle" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills"  colnum="44"  time="012:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050705/halltext/50705h02.htm#50705h02_spmin0">
	<p pid=".44.2/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing the debate. It has clearly evoked a lot of interest&mdash;particularly, I must admit, in his party. None the less it is a subject that matters to people from all parties, whether they are here today or not. I know from my postbag that it matters a great deal in any constituency. In dealing with their constituency case loads, all Member will recognise the issues and concerns that have been raised today by Opposition Members.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/2">I concur with the point, which was the point of the entire debate, that the contribution of fathers to bringing up their children matters a great deal. There will be no disagreement in any part of the House, or in this Chamber, about that. I had not realised that there were quite so many nappies in Kettering, but one learns something every day. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's interest in this matter comes not only from his own recent fatherhood, which is bound to make one think about such issues very deeply, but from the fact that he has organisations that deal with nappies in his constituency. It is important to tie in the bringing up of children with good environmentally friendly policies&mdash;a double whammy&mdash;and I am sure that he will learn a lot from the local organisations to which he referred.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/3">The hon. Gentleman made a number of points, which I shall take some time to deal with. Despite the protection that you offered me, Mr. Hood, I do not have enough time left to deal with all the points. If I miss out points that Opposition Members specifically wanted answers to, I will contact them by correspondence after the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/4">A number of themes came through. We can agree about the importance of fatherhood in bringing up children, and we all agree that fathers should be as involved in bringing up their children as mothers are. That is not a controversial thing to say; we know that many fathers do just that. Many hon. Members know that from personal experience, and have referred to it in a wide context.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/5">We are not saying that there is a problem with men, or with men who happen to be fathers. We know that many fathers do an excellent job, and have well-adjusted children and happy families as a result. As Members of Parliament we tend to come across issues and problems, so perhaps it is natural that we should concentrate on situations where things do not turn out quite so well, but that does not take away the fact that in many instances there are no problems with fathers or families.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/6">The hon. Member for Kettering said that fatherhood was different from paternity, and I understood what he meant. He is right: we need to ensure that young men who become fathers do not see involvement in their children's life as something that they should not aspire to, or something that is nothing to do with them. They should see it as part of their responsibility and part of what life is about when one has children. We must ensure that we encourage that, particularly where there are problems.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/7">Opposition Members mentioned particular areas and factors that they felt made matters worse, and the Government can intervene to ensure that we do the best possible job in deprived areas to give children a proper chance in life. We are committed through the local Sure Start programmes to focus on deprived areas to ensure that children there have the best possible start in life. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of that because he has a Sure Start local centre in his constituency, based on the Grange school main site, which I am sure he knows very well. That local programme, which is doing very well, already has a fathers group. It is important that Sure Start does not forget fathers where it is up and running and spending significant resources to tackle issues. It should not assume that it should be dealing only with mothers. The best such programmes already realise that and are active in that regard. When I visit Sure Start local centres, I do not find that they are designed just for mothers.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> and many Opposition Members, some of whom have had experience as teachers and may perhaps been active in teaching until recently, expressed some concern about the lack of male role models. That theme came through in several speeches, and questions were asked about precisely what we are doing to tackle the problem. The hon. Lady said that as far as she was aware, things were getting better. That is right, and we are working with the Teacher Training Agency to try to recruit more male teachers, in primary schools in particular, to provide the role models that hon. Members have been calling for.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/9">The agency provides support services and holds events to encourage men into teaching. I suppose that for many men an overwhelmingly female work force is quite a barrier to venturing into teaching. The issue is not just about the fact that men might not want to be teachers, it is about how welcome they feel when entering an environment overwhelmingly composed of the opposite gender. That is not easy on either side.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/10">We are having some success. Support and advice are available for individuals when applying for training, there are events in schools to attract men to the profession, and there are wider opportunities. We can only keep trying and hoping that we will succeed. We do not consider the increasing emphasis on the professionalisation of the child care work force to be a substitute for good parenting, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> feared. It is an important part of our plans to improve the skills and the esteem of the child care work force, so that it will prove more attractive to men, and I hope that that will have a real impact.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/11">Several Opposition Members, including the hon. Members for Kettering and for East Worthing and Shoreham, referred to Fathers Direct. In the Department for Education and Skills we work directly with that organisation. It has a great deal of contact with us, and we involve it in our work. In particular, there was ministerial attendance at its conference in April&mdash;although that was before my time in this job. I was interested to hear about the fatherhood quality mark, and I shall have to look into it, because I do not know much about it. I quite like the idea that it can offer something positive. Further, the organisation's chief executive, Duncan Fisher, is on one of our ad hoc groups, advising us on parental support and the development of our strategy for supporting parents.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/12">We see the importance of involving the organisations set up to represent fathers and fatherhood, and we do not try to put them to one side simply because some groups of fathers, to which the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham referred, have undertaken high-profile stunts. It is regrettable that the more positive examples of activism are ignored.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-05.51.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" speakername="John Healey" colnum="51"  time="012:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050705/halltext/50705h03.htm#50705h03_spnew2">
	<p pid=".51.1/1">My hon. Friend is slightly overstating his argument, which, as I am sure he would accept, he is occasionally prone to do. Some stand-by agreements include an element of privatisation, but we do not yet know whether that will be an element of the SBA that is negotiated with Iraq through the IMF. We will simply have to wait and see.</p>
	<p pid=".51.1/2">My hon. Friend referred to odious debt law, but there is no such thing as established and accepted odious debt legislation. Were we to pursue the odious debt route, rather than doing what we have tried to do with the Iraqi Government&mdash;which has been to take a pragmatic, practical approach to quickly securing the debt relief and aid that the country needs&mdash;we would be likely to provoke a series of legal challenges that would tie up efforts to help Iraq for a decade or more.</p>
	<p pid=".51.1/3">My hon. Friend made a passing, welcome, reference to his strong support for the debt relief and aid programmes that the Government have put in place for Africa. He and I share a sense of pride that the Government have led the international efforts to put in place a comprehensive programme of significant levels of aid and debt relief for the poorest countries, including the recent fresh agreement among G8 finance Ministers.</p>
	<p pid=".51.1/4">Iraq is not considered to be one of the world's poorest countries. Nevertheless, as my hon. Friend pointed out, it faces immense social and economic challenges and hardships. Although Iraq's first democratic elections were an historic occasion, with 58 per cent. turnout and almost 8.5 million people voting, the upsurge of violence since the formation of the new Iraqi Government only adds to the challenges. Not only does Iraq face the challenge of establishing a truly inclusive political process, drafting a constitution that reflects its diversity and building security, but it faces a significant reconstruction challenge. Iraq has one of the largest estimated petroleum reserves in the world, but years of economic mismanagement, international sanctions and the recent conflict have hit economic activity hard. My hon. Friend vividly described the impact on Iraq's people. Social development that was once well ahead of the regional average has now well fallen behind to be one of the lowest.</p>
	<p pid=".51.1/5">Neither my hon. Friend nor the Government underestimate the challenges that Iraq faces in rebuilding the economy or the challenge that we face in trying to assist. Under Saddam Hussein, mismanagement and embezzlement of Iraq's resources was rife. The oil sector was starved of investment and the regime built up huge debts. Infrastructure, public services and industry were left in a poor state, unemployment was high and 60 per cent. of the population were dependent on food rations. Overall, GDP per capita is estimated to have fallen from more than $3,000 in the early 1980s to about $500 by 2003. It was then, through analysis by the IMF and World Bank, that Iraq's external debt&mdash;approximately $120 billion at that time&mdash;was judged to be unsustainable. The UK Government have therefore worked hard with the Americans and others to devise what we regard as a fair and sustainable solution to Iraq's debt problems.</p>
	<p pid=".51.1/6">We have also been at the forefront of international efforts to rebuild Iraq's economic institutions. In passing, I pay tribute to a number of officials from the Treasury and from HM Revenue and Customs who served for periods in Iraq to help with that rebuilding effort, in some cases putting themselves in danger in the process. Specific economic achievements have included some recovery in oil production, the stabilisation of inflation and the exchange rate, a financial management law, a new currency and an IMF emergency post-conflict assistance package of $436 million. However, by far the most important achievement with the most significant long-term gain was the negotiation of a debt relief deal with the new Iraqi Government. That is the view of the Iraqi Government, abeit not that of my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid=".51.1/7">The Paris club deal in November 2004 was an agreement to give to Iraq 80 per cent. debt relief, to be delivered in three tranches, linked to Iraq's economic reform. The first 30 per cent. tranche of relief was delivered on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-31">31 December 2004</phrase>. More than &pound;340 million of Iraq's debt to the UK has already been written off. Part of the Paris club agreement was a moratorium on debt repayments until 2008, and part was a rescheduling of debt over 23 years. The latest reports from Iraq indicate that good progress is being made with other creditors, and even though a number of technical issues have to be resolved we feel that the risk of Iraq's not achieving comparable treatment with its other creditors, which was one of the conditions of the deal, is low.</p>
	<p pid=".51.1/8">Once the agreement is fully implemented, Iraq is expected to receive almost $100 billion of debt relief. The US and a few other creditors have offered to give 100 per cent. debt relief; we welcome that generosity, but we have taken a different view. The UK intends to focus its resources on maximising the immediate benefits to the Iraqi people through aid, and we have pledged $544 million in direct aid over three years to March 2006. That money is being put to good use now, as the Iraqi Finance Minister made clear to my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary when they met last month. It is being used to rebuild facilities and to set up new infrastructure and new institutions, particularly in southern Iraq, as well as to provide support to key ministries of the new Government. If the UK offered 100 per cent. bilateral debt relief, some of that aid money would have to be diverted, Iraq would not feel the benefit of further debt relief until 2008 because of the moratorium on payments, and the benefits would be spread over 23 years, rather than concentrated now, when the need is greatest. However, as I said to my hon. Friend, we have an historical relationship with Iraq and therefore stand ready to consider any request for aid or debt relief that the Iraqi Government might make of us.</p>
	<p pid=".51.1/9">Despite the difficulties, there is real hope of progress and hope for the future of Iraq. It is not merely a country beset by severe economic difficulties but one with the prospect of and potential for a sound economic future. However, my hon. Friend will recognise that the deep damage done by decades of a repressive regime cannot be rectified in one, two or three years. It will take time to build Iraqi institutions and to improve infrastructure, and for the private sector to flourish. We hope that by 2008, Iraq will be in a position not only to start repaying the remaining debt, but to become the major economy in the region that it once was.</p>
	<p pid=".51.1/10">My hon. Friend said that the Paris club debt relief deal was not acceptable to the Iraqi people, but it is acceptable&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".54.1/1">I am pleased to have secured the debate. I have come to the Chamber hot foot from the Committee that is considering the Identity Cards Bill and understand that we are to have the benefit of your chairmanship there, Mr. Hood, so your chairmanship of our debates this afternoon in Westminster Hall is an unexpected pleasure.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/2">I congratulate the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1836" name="James Purnell">the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell)</phrase> on his recent promotion. I also make it clear to the House that I approach the subject of digital switchover without the benefit, or possibly the hindrance, of any particular technical expertise.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/3">The switchover to digital television is a multilayered subject that brings with it a whole range of technical and regulatory issues, only some of which I intend to touch on today. The Northern Isles, as elsewhere in the United Kingdom, are looking forward to the switchover to digital. Like others, we see it as progress. In recent years, however, because of our geographical remoteness from London, we have been left behind in several other areas of technical progress, particularly in the roll-out of broadband. If the Minister can give us nothing else today, I hope that he will be able to assure us that we will not be left at the coo's tail simply because we are geographically few and far away from London.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/4">As I said, digital switchover is an enormous subject with many angles, but I shall focus today on two important issues: the impact of coverage on my constituents, and help for vulnerable groups.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/5">In 1999, the Government set a target of 99.5 per cent. of homes being able to receive digital terrestrial reception. At the start of June, however, Ofcom announced that 98.5 per cent. of households should be covered by the digital transmitter networks. So there has been some slippage even in that short period. That slippage causes the Scottish highlands and islands communities, and indeed other peripheral parts of the UK, particular concern. A recent piece in <i>The Guardian</i> explained that the coverage had been</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/6" class="indent">&quot;a disappointment to those in the Welsh Valleys and Scottish Highlands who hoped the conversion to digital between 2008 and 2012 would mean an end to fuzzy analogue television pictures&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/7">In the same article, Allan Williams of <i>Which</i>? magazine said that the decision means that</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/8" class="indent">&quot;some homes may lose TV reception when digital switchover takes place.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/9">He went on to point out that</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/10" class="indent">&quot;Ofcom must make sure that alternative means of reception are in place so no one loses out&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/11">I hope that the Government agree and are already working on such alternatives. Subscribers in many parts of my constituency would dream of having the fuzzy analogue television pictures mentioned in <i>The Guardian</i> article, and we would be concerned if even that provision were to be lost.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/12">The Minister will be aware that the independent Consumer Expert Group has called for at least 99.5 per cent. of the population in each region, and not just in the UK as a whole, to be able to receive digital at the point of switchover. Will he make clear the Government's position on that proposal? Does he accept that such a small shift in target would give a great deal of comfort and reassurance to people in the highlands and islands?</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/13">Communities in my constituency are split into three categories of television reception. First, most people in the main towns and villages have reasonably good analogue reception and have the option of converting to digital by purchasing a freeview set-top box. Secondly, some people can receive analogue reception, but cannot use freeview through the digibox. That is true of many households in many parts of communities such as Yell, Brae and Unst in Shetland, and for some people living in parts of Hoy, Orphir, Longhope, Westray and Evie in Orkney. Finally, there are some communities, in Graemsay in Orkney and Ollaberry in Shetland, in particular, who have no analogue reception at present. They rely on satellites to access the main terrestrial channels. Digital switchover will affect each of those groups differently.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/14">The first group will experience the process pretty much as will most people in the rest of the country, and my main concern in those communities is for the vulnerable groups. The second group, who have analogue reception at present but no set-top box option, causes me some concern. I am concerned about the incentives to prepare for switchover. Given the 98.5 per cent. target, it is highly likely that after switchover some people in my constituency who cannot at present obtain television reception using aerials will be able to do so. Additionally, some people who can use aerials at present to access the main channels will not be able to do so after switchover. I fear that the second group may be larger than the first and that freeview set-top boxers, if I can call them that, will not work in large parts of Orkney and Shetland.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-05.55.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" speakername="Alistair Carmichael" colnum="55"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050705/halltext/50705h04.htm#50705h04_spnew2">
	<p pid=".55.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention. Yes, I think that Border Television, the company that gave us &quot;Mr and Mrs&quot;, is a broadcasting institution that deserves every protection. As to the hon. Gentleman's point about the level of awareness, we should be on a rising curve. If the Government can, by way of public information, put us on that rising curve, we should have no problem in the end. However, we are not there yet. The hon. Gentleman's concerns are legitimate, and he has done us a service in putting down a marker for the future.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/2">The Minister may be aware that his predecessor, the Minister for Sport and Tourism answered a debate on digital switchover on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-15">15 March</phrase>. His only answer to some of the concerns that I have set out about constituents' predicament post-switchover was that there</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/3" class="indent">&quot;are issues that have to be worked through&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2005-03-15.55"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall,</i> 15 March 2005; Vol. 432, c. 55WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/4">I hope that, four months down the line, some of that work has been done. I should be interested to know where we stand on them today.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/5">When will we be in a position to know who will be able to use digital terrestrial after switchover? Will we simply have to wait for switchover to happen before we know whether or not it is worth while buying a digital box? What will the Government do to assist the 1.5 per cent. of the population who will apparently not be able to access digital terrestrial? Colette Bowe, who chaired the Ofcom consumer panel that considered what measures might be necessary to protect vulnerable groups said last November:</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/6" class="indent">&quot;As a society we ought to damn well make sure that people who currently have access to television continue to have access to it. And if that means that the Treasury . . . have to open their pockets, well, so be it. Because that is the way it's got to be.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/7">With slightly more temperate language, I could not have put it better myself. Will the Government ensure that people unable to receive digital terrestrial are given the necessary financial support to receive freesat?</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/8">Those in my constituency who have no analogue TV reception were not able to watch ITV or Channels 4 and 5 for part of 2003 after Solus cards, the predecessor scheme, became obsolete. Previously, the BBC had offered services &quot;in the clear&quot; on satellite, but thereafter removed their funding for Solus cards.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/9">If my recollection is right, an Adjournment debate on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-21">21 October 2003</phrase>, which I attended, was initiated by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" name="Alan Reid">the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid)</phrase>. In reply, the Minister for Sport and Tourism was able to announce that ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 had come forward with a replacement card. Those cards cost &pound;20 plus VAT, and he assured the House that they would</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/10" class="indent">&quot;last until Sky does another card swap-out, and for at least two years if the next swap-out is sooner than that.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2003-10-21.252"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 21 October 2003; Vol. 411, c. 252WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/11">So far as we can ascertain, the provision continues to be valued by my constituents, but does the Minister have any information on a longer-term solution? Are ITV and others working towards operating &quot;in the clear&quot; on satellite so that people who do not subscribe to Sky can receive the main terrestrial channels? Once digital switchover happens, will the 1.5 per cent. of the population who are unable to get digital terrestrial be treated fairly?</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/12">In the time that remains, I want to speak about helping vulnerable groups. Last week, the Minister announced a targeted assistance trial; I believe that it will be run in Bolton. I understand that it will consider the best way to assist vulnerable groups. Will that be the full extent of the trial, or will it be the first of many?</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/13">The Minister will be aware that the issues affecting people in Bolton are not necessarily those that affect people in more rural or island communities. Does he accept that there will be a benefit in running further trials to deal with the problems of people living in communities that are less urban than those currently being trialled? Of course, many of the issues would be the same, but I suggest that there will be particular difficulties helping the old or house-bound in places such as the Northern Isles.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/14">The Minister will be aware that take-up of digital among the over-75s is especially low. Only 16 per cent. of households in that category had digital in 2003. When will the Government be in a position to outline what support will be provided to the elderly, disabled and those on low incomes? I am keen to allow the Minister as long as possible to respond to a number of my questions.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/15">I finish with a query that relates more to radio than television. I have received a number of letters from constituents who feel frustrated that they receive repeated adverts promoting digital radio services to which they cannot gain access. In the longer term, do the Government hope to switchover radio services in the same way as television? Does the Minister think it acceptable that, although we pay the same licence fee to TV Licensing, we are effectively barred from some of the services provided by the BBC, which is supposedly a public service broadcaster?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-05.58.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1836" speakername="James Purnell" colnum="58"  time="013:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050705/halltext/50705h04.htm#50705h04_spnew6">
	<p pid=".58.1/1">I will have to write to the hon. Gentleman about that. We currently have national targets and we will investigate whether it is practicable to have regional targets, but I cannot give him a guarantee at the moment.</p>
	<p pid=".58.1/2">As the hon. Gentleman knows, digital satellite is no longer just a pay option. People can now receive the public service channels through satellite in a kind of freesat option offered by Sky. There was real concern when Solus cards stopped being an option, but people can now purchase the kit to provide, in effect, a free satellite option. The hon. Gentleman asked how long such an option could be guaranteed. At present, it is guaranteed for a minimum of two years. Therefore, there is now a reasonable option to get public service channels through satellite, and, post-switchover, that may be the best way for some of his constituents to access those services.</p>
	<p pid=".58.1/3">The hon. Gentleman wanted to know what progress ITV, for example, is making on providing their services in the clear. I understand that ITV has a problem with rights, in that it has rights to broadcast a proportion of its programmes only in the UK. If it were to broadcast on satellite, those programmes would be available outside the UK, and it would either have to take them off or increase the amount that it spends on programmes. We are happy that the BBC has agreed to go in the clear, as that solves part of the problem. I understand that the difference between the BBC and ITV is that the BBC has a much smaller proportion of programmes that are affected by rights, and it gets around the problem by not showing such programmes on satellite. For ITV, at about two hours of programming a week, the problem is more significant. We would encourage any solution, but the best option at present is for people to pursue the freesat option. With a cost that is comparable with the digital terrestrial option and with the two-year guarantee, that option is attractive to a significant number of people.</p>
	<p pid=".58.1/4">There are alternatives for people who cannot get digital terrestrial television, but we take seriously the hon. Gentleman's argument that more must be done. Ofcom is working with the broadcasters on specific technological solutions to increase coverage in certain areas. In fact, there are already many ad hoc arrangements&mdash;for example, a village got together to buy an aerial to boost the signal. As we go through the digital switchover, we will need to work through what can be done in particular cases, but, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman understands that that technical exercise must be led by people who understand the technology rather than by politicians. People will not have only one option available to them. As I said, other solutions are coming through, such as new DSL technologies, including the new ADSL2, and experiments with broadband internet carried through the electricity lines. There will be a patchwork of provision.</p>
	<p pid=".58.1/5">I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a guarantee for every household in his constituency, and I am aware that there will be frustration for each constituent who is not able to receive digital TV. However, I am confident that the vast majority&mdash;more than at present&mdash;will be able to do so. We will provide information in good time on whether people will be able to receive digital pictures. That information will include detailed postcode information, and I hope that there will be some technological means by which people can check before they buy a set-top box whether it would be a good investment. As I said, almost all the hon. Gentleman's constituents will be able to watch BBC and ITV digital programmes in one way or another. The figure may well be more than 98.5 per cent.. Although we cannot give a guarantee for every household, I hope that I have given him some comfort.</p>

	<p pid=".62.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this debate on the future of primary school provision in Rossendale in Lancashire. I say at the outset that I represent only a small part of the borough of Rossendale, most of which is represented effectively by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1788" name="Janet Anderson">the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Janet Anderson)</phrase>. I shall confine most of my remarks to how my constituents in Haslingden are affected by Lancashire county council's review of primary provision and, in particular, by the proposal to close St. Mary's Roman Catholic primary school in Haslingden.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/2">Any responsible Government or education authority need to tackle surplus places. I welcome the review of primary provision in Rossendale that Lancashire county council has initiated. We need a review and I welcome the way in which the council is going about it. The review is open and transparent and, although no final decision has been made, the process is a good one. We need to congratulate county councillor Hazel Harding, the leader of the county council, on how the review is being conducted. I also support the objectives of the review. The review document says that a balance must be struck between providing school places within the immediate community and ensuring that schools are large enough to be educationally and economically viable. I support that. The document says that there should be a vision of schools operating at the centre of their immediate or extended communities. St. Mary's in Haslingden is at the heart of its community. Keeping it open dovetails with the vision outlined in that document.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/3">Lancashire enjoys diverse provision&mdash;there are probably more faith schools in the Lancashire LEA than in any LEA in the country. I welcome that. We need to cherish and maintain that diversity. In my constituency there are not only community schools, but Roman Catholic schools, Church of England schools and even Methodist schools. I welcome that diversity. The review document says that Lancashire recognises the</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/4" class="indent">&quot;need to retain a reasonable pattern of denominational and non-denominational provision wherever possible (even if this means retaining some surplus places) in order to preserve a range of choices for parents.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/5">Preserving that choice for parents is at the heart of what I want to say. I contend that the current proposals, which provide for the closure of St. Mary's Roman Catholic primary school in Haslingden, would deny that parental choice to Catholic parents in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/6">The document also refers to the Education Act 2002, which enables small schools to flourish by working in co-operation with other schools or, in some circumstances, by federating with them. It is important that the Government recognise the role that small schools have to play at the heart of communities. I just hope that the Lancashire LEA and, importantly, the Roman Catholic diocese of Salford also accept that role.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/7">None of us would deny that there is a problem with surplus places in primary schools in Rossendale. There are currently about 6,700 primary places in Rossendale, give or take a few. Six years ago, the schools were broadly full, with 6,500 primary pupils and 6,700 places. It is always good to have a small amount of surplus capacity, to provide for new build or for parents to exercise choice or to move. Now, however, there are only 5,500 primary school pupils in the same 6,700 places. The demographic trends show that, with the birth rate and planned building projects in Rossendale, the number of primary school pupils is set to fall to 5,100 by 2010. If we do not do anything, that will leave a vacancy rate of more than 20 per cent., which is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/8">We know that tough decisions will have to be made, but why, in tackling surplus places, is St. Mary's Roman Catholic school in Haslingden the only faith school to be singled out for closure, with no other option open to it in the review document? If it was a failing school in special measures, all reasonable people could understand the logic. That is not the case. It is an improving school that has been turned round. Ofsted has described it as being the sixth most improved primary school in the country. I went to the school last week and can say that it is a happy, succeeding, improving school.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/9">The school is at the heart of the community. Its history is interwoven with that of the town of Haslingden. Following the famine in Ireland in the middle of the 19th century, many Irish people sought a new life in England. They came through Liverpool and formed a diaspora in Lancashire and the north-west of England. Haslingden has a large Irish community, which came seeking food and work in the middle of the 19th century.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/10">The community established St. Mary's church and wanted to establish a school to go with the church. It is worth bearing in mind that that period was only a generation after the Catholic emancipation Acts. There was still a large amount of anti-Catholic sentiment and anti-Irish bigotry. When people learned of the proposal to open a Catholic school, an angry mob descended on what was to become the site of the school. It was dispersed only when a lone figure fired a revolver in the air. That man was Michael Davitt, the founder of the Irish Democratic Land Federation and a renowned Irish nationalist.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/11">The school opened a year later in the summer of 1869. There are not many schools that can claim to have been founded on a single gunshot dispersing an angry mob. We ought to cherish our history.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/12">The review document has some figures about the school that are not entirely accurate. It says that there are 150 places. In reality, there are more like 125, because one of the classes has been converted into an information and communications technology suite. The review document refers to problems with flooding as though that were a perennial problem that would lead one to conclude that the school had no viable future. In fact, nobody can remember the last time that the school flooded. Flooding is a problem that was solved a long time ago.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/13">The school is much loved by the community and the wider community. I have received letters from as far away as Boston, Massachusetts urging that the school be kept open. I have been inundated with letters and have petitions running to hundreds, possibly thousands of signatories, urging that the much-loved school be kept open.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/14">I have noticed that pupils do not always love their schools, but I have many letters from pupils saying that they do love the school. One letter said that many pupils are not Catholics but they still come to the school because it has kind teachers. Someone else said:</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/15" class="indent">&quot;How could you even consider closing this lovely school?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/16">One pupil said:</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/17" class="indent">&quot;My teacher . . . is the coolest teacher here . . . if you end up shutting down St. Mary's . . . her children . . . could end up with a horrible teacher.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/18">That is a fair point. Two pupils wrote to say that if the school were closed, they were</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/19" class="indent">&quot;going to go on strike!&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/20">I suspect that that referred to a day when maths was being taught.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/21">It really is a school that is at the heart of the community. The point that I make to my hon. Friend the Minister is that closure should not be the first or the only option for schools such as St. Mary's. There are other ways of tackling surplus places. It should be possible to reduce the number of pupils on the roll to tackle surplus places. It should be possible also to look imaginatively at co-operation with other schools.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/22">The review document says that, if St. Mary's closes, there are sufficient places, either at St. Veronica's Roman Catholic primary school in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen or at other schools in the area. Frankly, that would deny the choice of Catholic education to many of my constituents because there are more than 70 Catholic pupils at St. Mary's but there are only 17 places available at St. Veronica's. There are places available at community schools and faith schools of different faiths but that is not the same thing.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/23">I return to what the document says. It talks about preserving a range of choices for parents. If we are not careful, that will be denied. I cannot understand why St. Mary's is the only school earmarked for closure. All the other schools have been given other options and St. Mary's deserves that choice as well.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/24">Who wants the school to close? The parents do not, nor do the teachers, the pupils, the governors, the local councillors, the local MP, the Catholic community in Haslingden, the wider community in Haslingden, and nor even, I suspect, does Lancashire local education authority. I suspect that the only people who have the school earmarked for closure and who have their hearts set on that are, sadly, members of the Roman Catholic diocese of Salford. I cannot imagine why they should want to close a popular school with a large playing field in a residential area with rising property prices. Those considerations have led some to speculate on their motives, which I would not dream of doing.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/25">The school was born out of adversity in the 19th century, and has the chance to flourish in the 21st century. All that it requires is a helping hand and an imaginative reconsideration of the circumstances. That is not to deny that the problem of surplus places in Haslingden, Rossendale and across Lancashire needs to be tackled&mdash;of course it does, but I am sure that we can tackle that problem and find a future for this popular, improving and happy school. I hope that the Lancashire education authority and the diocese of Salford will listen, through the debate, not to me but to my constituents and the community who I represent, who want to keep the school open.</p>

	<p pid=".66.1/1">My hon. Friend has raised a point that I shall come on to during my remarks.</p>
	<p pid=".66.1/2">I congratulate the teachers, parents and, most of all, the pupils of St. Mary's for the impressive achievement of being identified by Ofsted as one of the most improving schools in the country. From my constituency experience, I understand how difficult things can be in a school that is improving and has been turned round from a slightly difficult position&mdash;albeit not special measures in this instance&mdash;only to be faced suddenly with such a threat to its future, after all the effort that has gone into turning it around. All I can say is that I congratulate the school and all connected with it on its achievement. No matter what happens to the local organisation, there is no doubt that it is a significant achievement to be named by Ofsted as one of the most improving primary schools in the country. That is something of which everyone should be very proud.</p>
	<p pid=".66.1/3">I understand that one difficulty is that pupil numbers are quite small, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn referred to that. I am told that the number stood at 81 in January and that there are currently 78 pupils. My hon. Friend raised some issues in referring to our 2002 legislation about the way in which small schools might be helped to continue even though the numbers are smaller. That is particularly important in rural areas where schools are centres of the community, and I am sure that all of those factors will be taken into account during the current consultation and in the decision-making process thereafter at the level of the schools organisation committee when it considers the points made or whether the proposals should go ahead.</p>
	<p pid=".66.1/4">The consultation document was issued in May and open evenings have been held at schools that could be directly affected. I am not sure whether that applies to the nursery, but I am sure that it does. I am sure that it will have had meetings where parents of the children who go there could make those points. I know that there were open evenings at St. Mary's school on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-07">7 June</phrase> and at St. Veronica's on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-06">6 June</phrase>. The results of the consultation are to be reported to the cabinet member for education on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-13">13 September</phrase>, which leaves my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn, and those of his view, the summer in which to campaign. Of course, before making any decisions, those making the decision locally will take into account the views put forward.</p>
	<p pid=".66.1/5">Lancashire county council and the Salford diocesan schools commission recognise in their consultation document the important role played by denominational schools. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn about the possibility of removing the option of a Catholic primary education from some parents is important, and I am sure that he will stress it to those who are to make these decisions in due course. I understand that a reorganisation of Roman Catholic churches is being undertaken in Rossendale and Ramsbottom, which may result in an amalgamation of the parishes of Haslingden, St. Mary's and St. Veronica's. I do not know what impact that might have on some of the proposals that have come forward, but I am sure that the two things are not unconnected.</p>
	<p pid=".66.1/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen raised a point about a nursery school in her constituency and asked what, if anything, the Government can do to ensure that funds are available to ensure that schools can continue where that is wanted. I am afraid that I will have to write to her on that point. However, she will be well aware of the increasing resources that the Government are putting to ensure that pupils attain in their current school buildings and to extend and extensively rebuild our school infrastructure throughout the country. I will have to check at the Department to see what might be available for her nursery school, but she will be aware of our 10-year child care strategy and the concept of extended schools, which may well provide some options that could be considered locally to ensure that valued local facilities can not only continue, but be expanded.</p>
	<p pid=".66.1/7">Over the next 10 years, there will be a vast expansion in the availability of child care and extended schools in particular areas, which will offer all kinds of additional support services to parents, families and learners of all ages. I am certain that, in conjunction with the local authority, local diocesan schools commissions can come up with helpful plans.</p>
