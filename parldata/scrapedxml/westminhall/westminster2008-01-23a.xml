<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-23a.430.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" speakername="Iain Duncan Smith" colnum="430"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080123/halltext/80123h0001.htm#08012348000535">
	<p pid="a.430.1/1">I shall come to the highest wages point in a second, but let us consider whether the premiership is the best competition. I looked at some of the overseas involvement&mdash;I know that this question has been around for a long time. Who actually plays from those countries? One would think that they would be the very best&mdash;in other words, that our teams would be packed with people who play for their national teams. Should we think that? Of the 15 Spanish players in the premiership, five play for their national side; of the three Italians, none play for their national side; of the 34 French in the league, only 12 play for their national side; and of the German eight, three play for their national side. My point is that if the situation were exactly as the hon. Gentleman suggests, we would have nothing but top-flight internationals, but some of the top players who play for countries such as Brazil do not choose to come to the premier league.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/2">I am not damning the premier league, but I am saying that we allow that statement to go out as if it were set in stone and biblical&mdash;it is not. I do not believe that our league is considered by players as technically any better than the others. Let us dismiss the idea that, somehow, this is a fantastic league with which none of the others can compete. In spectacle, it may be&mdash;perhaps the television side is&mdash;but in technique and for the internationals, it is not.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/3">If the premier league is doing so well, it must therefore be exporting talent to every country. Is not one of the things about businesses that they want a fantastic export record? We could not find any English players playing in any of the European top leagues at present, but I found that 12 Italians are playing in Spain, three are playing in France and three are playing in Germany, and that off a high base of those who are playing in their own home league.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">The hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase> is on to a good point when he mentions salaries. I looked at the salaries and was quite shaken. When the premier league came into being, the salary base was &pound;54 million. By 2006, it had risen to &pound;605 million a year, which was a compound increase of more than 1,000 per cent. In comparison, the increase in the national economy was 67 per cent. So there has been a huge increase in salaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/5">Okay, let us say that, as it is a competition, we have to compete; the others are paying massive salaries, too. So I looked at that, because businesses must compete&mdash;and, of course, keep their cost base down. However, I found that the others are not paying massive salaries. In fact, if salary bills are converted into euros, in 2005-06, the premier league paid &euro;1,235 million in salaries. In Italy, the figure was &euro;806 million; in Spain, it was &euro;739 million; in France, it was &euro;541 million; and in Germany, it was &euro;578 million. Do they know something that we do not? Do they know something that means they can get away with paying much less for their football players yet still retain some of the great players in their leagues? I do not know what other hon. Members think, but I am not aware that anyone would accuse Serie A of being a substandard league. I remind Members that it produced the World cup winner, and it produced the champions league winner last year. I do not think that one can safely say that that league is worse than the premier league.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/6">Too much nonsense has been chucked around about the premier league and about why we must not touch it, why we must not have this debate and why fans must accept the fact that we need such high participation by overseas players because it is good for the game. My concern is that we do not examine the situation properly or ask questions. The fact is that no one else seems to be competing in the marketplace in which we seem to have set ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/7">The big questions are for those charged with running the game. Why have we not done an in-depth analysis of what is going peculiarly wrong with the game in England and even in some of the home countries, although, as I said earlier, some of that is being put right? Why is it that we simply do not study the facts and ask questions about training? Why have we not asked about the quality of training in England? Why have we allowed ourselves just to bumble along like Mr. Micawber, believing that something will turn up? That seems to be peculiarly English, and it is time that it stopped. That must happen for the sake of all those who pay huge amounts for season tickets and who want their clubs to do well but who&mdash;like me and, I believe, all hon. Members in this Chamber&mdash;also share a passion for the game and for their national side and a belief that football is not just about profit and loss.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/8">Football is not just about our clubs doing well. It is also about wanting one of the home countries to go on and, even if not to win the World cup or the European cup, at least to get within striking distance regularly, as other countries so often seem to do. There is that terrible, constant shrugging of the shoulders every time that international competitions come around. We talk about our wonderful players only to find that they simply do not succeed. Yes, football is a business, but it is not just a business&mdash;there is much more to it than that.</p>

	<p pid="a.432.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> on securing this debate. He is a football friend of mine, and it is worth noting that there are at least five Members waiting to take part in the debate who play football regularly, as he does.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/2">In his summing up, the right hon. Gentleman asked who is running the game. That is one of the keys to this debate. About half the premiership is in foreign ownership, and those people certainly do not care too much about how the England side is affected by the decisions that they make when running their clubs. When I decided to participate in this debate, I did not want to talk just about the England side, because I did not want to repeat the clever words used by the right hon. Gentleman. Instead, I wanted to talk about the growing inequalities in the game, which stem from the decisions that have been made by those who run the premier league. We all admire football; we watch it every week. However, the people who take ownership of clubs, and therefore make the decisions that affect our national side, come into football for financial reasons. We should not be surprised that they make short-term decisions, which are not directed at the aims of those who care about football.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.0/3">We have to do something about the problem. Whenever we have these debates, the media say, &quot;What do Members of Parliament have to do with football?&quot; The right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green said straight away that it is not MPs' job to run football. However, it is our job to look after our constituents. It is our constituents who, on a weekly basis, pay money for subscriptions to Sky, and now Setanta, who go through the turnstiles and purchase merchandise such as shirts and everything else that young people enjoy so much. It is our constituents who pay those massive sums, which eventually go back into football. Obviously, it is a wonderful if young players come here from Africa and go back&mdash;of course, they do not always do so&mdash;as multi-millionaires 15 years later and can help others. That is excellent, and we all praise such work.</p>

	<p pid="a.433.4/1">I was not sure which team my hon. Friend supported&mdash;I should know more about football. We have a Charlton Athletic supporter here, and I can see that there is someone listening to the debate in the audience&mdash;the crowd, I should say&mdash;who supports Arsenal. I was delighted that my team, Middlesbrough, beat Arsenal a few weeks a go. I wish that I had been with the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green last night when Spurs knocked out Arsenal. I know what it is like to be as happy as that. I remember how I felt a few years ago when we beat Spurs on penalties on our way to the UEFA cup final. I thought about the right hon. Gentleman last night when I watched the game on television.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.4/2">We care about football, and we also care about our constituents, who love football and their own team. Our constituents care about the long-term future of the game. We want our grandchildren to enjoy the game as we do now, which is why are here to participate in this debate. I was explaining how happy we were that youngsters from deprived parts of the world could come to the UK and end up as multi-millionaires. Many of them go back to help their own nations, and they spread some of their wealth around. However, it is not the ones who succeed whom we are worried about. As the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green said, youngsters are brought from all over the world at a very young age, and we should be concerned about the ones who do not succeed. I should like to relate a story that I was told by the owner of a premier league club. A youngster was enticed away from his home club by an agent of some sort. He ended up going to a bigger club, but failed to get on, and I believe that his family split up as a result. He did not last at the club for more than six or nine months. We must therefore look after those youngsters as well as the skilled players.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.4/3">The Government Whip, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1717" name="Siobhain McDonagh">the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh)</phrase>, is a supporter of AFC Wimbledon, which is trying to climb back into the Football League after the original club, Wimbledon FC, relocated to Milton Keynes. AFC Wimbledon is run and owned by its supporters, which is a great illustration of how much people care about their own club. It is not just the rich footballers about whom we should care&mdash;it is the people who support the game. It would be surprising if families had to pay &pound;50 a week to watch premier league football on television. I remember going to Arsenal a few seasons ago&mdash;I have already mentioned that my team beat Arsenal a few weeks ago&mdash;with three researchers, and it cost me &pound;140. We lost 7-0 that day, which evens up things a bit.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.4/4">We care about the long-term future of the game, which is why we are all here today, speaking on our constituents' behalf. Those who run the game must listen to the fans as well as to the very rich owners to whom they answer and from whom they receive their large salaries. We are here today representing those fans, and I hope that some notice is taken of our debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-23a.436.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="436"  time="010:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080123/halltext/80123h0002.htm#08012348000550">
	<p pid="a.436.0/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his excellent contribution to it. He summed up concerns that many people have about overseas footballers. There is great complacency in the national game, because it is regarded as the greatest show on earth; that is how the premiership is marketed overseas. My right hon. Friend made very good points about ensuring that the quality of training for our home-grown talent remains strong; indeed, it should be strengthened. We have much to learn from what goes on in continental Europe and possibly even from other parts of the world. There is a notion that we are attracting just the cream of the cream of players. In fact, we are getting players who are being paid a lot of money, but they may well be approaching the end of their careers.</p>
	<p pid="a.436.0/2">Like all hon. Members who have and will make contributions to the debate, I am a keen football fan and have been for almost the entirety of my 43 years. Certainly for the past 35 years I have watched the fortunes of my beloved Bury football club, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1584" name="Alan Keen">the hon. Member for Feltham and Heston (Alan Keen)</phrase> referred. I have to say that it has been a case of thin and thinner times, although we got an equaliser three minutes from time to deprive Bradford City of a victory last night, so at times there are small mercies in supporting Bury.</p>
	<p pid="a.436.0/3">Great changes have taken place in the footballing world even in that 35-year time frame. I recall that in the 1970s, many footballing commentators said that the best talent was going overseas, to the detriment of the English game. We were not actually losing that many players, but some of the top players moved overseas: Kevin Keegan went to Hamburg; Liam Brady, who was Irish but who played in England, moved abroad; and other players left these shores, albeit in relatively small numbers. Of course, my right hon. Friend and people more generally now argue that there is perhaps too much overseas talent in this country, to the detriment of the national game. I accept that, in part, it is a matter of degree. A vast number of overseas players play here at the highest level of the game, which is inevitably a barrier to some of the young talent.</p>
	<p pid="a.436.0/4">Another big problem is that there have always been overblown expectations of our national side. Back in the 1950s, the nation had its first footballing fiasco when we lost in the 1950 World cup to the United States of America. Three years later, we had the horror of losing for the first time against anything other than a home nation at Wembley. In a sense, expectations were ratcheted up still more by winning the World cup, as we did on home ground in 1966. The expectation is that winning the World cup is the rightful place of the England national side, but the fact is that only in 1990 has England made it even as far as the semi-final in a World cup.</p>
	<p pid="a.436.0/5">On immigration and overseas players, there are a lot of EU nationals playing in the premier league, but they are increasingly playing right the way through the profession, including, in some cases, in the semi-professional game in this country. Of course, there is free movement of labour, so we cannot prevent such people from playing here, nor should we.</p>

	<p pid="a.437.1/1">This is going to be quite a battle. My other great passion is cricket. Twenty years ago, the notion that we would have an England cricket captain by the name of Hussain might have been a horror to some of the purists of that game. Obviously, things move on, and rightly so. If Mr. Almunia wishes to make his home here and is committed to becoming a British citizen, he should have every right to play for the English national side or, indeed, the Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish national side.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/2">There are something like 250 or 260 overseas players on the books of premiership clubs, but there are virtually no restrictions whatever to the talent that premiership or other clubs can choose to employ. There are no wage, squad size or registration restrictions, and, post-Bosman, sometimes no transfer fees. Of course, that is in stark contrast to other games internationally; for example, baseball in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/3">There are plenty of non-EU nationals for whom, potentially, employment restrictions are in place. Those of us who are keen football fans will have seen coverage of the Africa cup of nations. I suspect that we are at the thin end of the wedge. We are attracting and will continue to attract an incredible amount of top quality African talent to these shores, as well as South American talent. The recent controversy over the Watford player Al Bangura, a Sierra Leone national who was initially refused a work permit will, I suspect, be the start of things to come with regard to the debate over such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/4">I understand that the Minister will elucidate in his contribution at the end of the debate the plans afoot to limit the number of non-EU players. I understand that the Home Office tightened the rules as long ago as 1999, so that non-EU players applying for a permit must have either played for their country in at least 75 per cent. of its competitive A-team matches in the previous two years, or else it must be possible to say that they have contributed significantly as a special talent to the development of the game at the top level in the UK. Given my right hon. Friend's concerns, will the Minister tell us more about the potential review of that legislation, and whether there are plans to tighten or loosen it in future?</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/5">The face of the national game has changed greatly. Again, I recall the low point in the 1980s, which I mentioned earlier. There was hooliganism and poor attendances, and crumbling, low-grade stadiums led to some of the appalling disasters that those of us who follow football well remember. To a large extent, the money from television has helped to transform elements of the national game. Today, the premier league is the most lucrative football league in the world, with total club revenues nearing &pound;2 billion. The Sky TV deal money has cascaded in, as it were, even in recent years. Rightly, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase> talked about the importance of the premier league, which was created 16 years ago. At that time, the Sky deal was worth what seemed like an astronomical sum compared with the deal negotiated by the BBC and ITV only a few years previously. It was worth &pound;191 million over five seasons, but it increased to &pound;670 million over four seasons from 1997, and to in excess of &pound;1 billion over three seasons for the period that ended last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/6">There is no doubt that the game is being marketed abroad. I travel abroad, and it is a joy to me to be able to watch live football matches in China or India. The game is being marketed as the greatest show on earth. The branding and marketing opportunities, particularly in south-east Asia&mdash;audiences in China alone are in excess of 200 million&mdash;are making an enormous difference. The colossal marketing and branding of our game has had a great impact on the amount of money that it attracts. I understand that football goes out to 202 different countries, which is greater than the membership of the United Nations, and that 500 million people frequently watch it.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/7">I worry for the future of our game. I worry that too much of the money goes straight through to the talent, and I wonder how sustainable that will prove to be, particularly if Sky reaches saturation level in its coverage of the game. Although I accept that Setanta has moved in to some extent, it is a smaller interest in the broader TV game. Sky is almost a monopoly player, so if it wanted to put a cap on its coverage, it could be difficult for clubs to work down the talent's expectations of the game.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/8">We must also think about what would happen if the popularity of our game begins to wane internationally. Potentially, other leagues could attract great interest in China and south-east Asia or, indeed, other sports could begin to make more of an impact there. There is little doubt that football is the world game at the moment, but I worry that we tend to look on the past 10 years as the norm. As I said, I can well recall how unpopular football had become in the mid-1980s. It was not seen as a sexy sport; and, given the game's problems, celebrities did not wish to associate themselves with it in any way.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/9">The half-empty stadiums in recent weeks have been quite an eye-opener.</p>

	<p pid="a.440.1/1">If it was a quota on commitment, enthusiasm and downright love of the game, the hon. Gentleman would in be every squad that I could name.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/2">I, too, support a club at the lower end of the league, my beloved Bury&mdash;I am wearing the team's cufflinks today&mdash;but I have also had a long relationship with Manchester United, following its kindness and support for UK PFC, when we played a match at Old Trafford for charity many years ago. The team has always been helpful, which has enabled me to see another side to the game.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/3">I went through an FA level 1 coaching course last year with Bedfordshire football association, for which I am grateful. That helped me to coach the game in Rwanda for a couple of weeks in the summer. I am grateful for the help given by the Football Association, which was terrific in supplying me with kit and knowledge. I was also involved in the small team that appointed Adam Crozier to the Football Association some years ago, when I was a head-hunter. Like many of my colleagues, I have seen the game from different levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/4">This subject is not new for English football. It is often forgotten that the English game has always had people from outside playing a prominent part. Hardly any English clubs have been successful without the influence of Scottish, Welsh and Irish players. The Spurs team of 1963, which won the first European cup winners competition for these islands would not have been anything without Danny Blanchflower or John White. Manchester United, which won the European cup in 1968, would not have been the same team without Dennis Law and George Best, Shay Brennan, Tony Dunne, Pat Crerand and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/5">One struggles to find an English club that has been successful without foreign talent. The great exception in our islands, as some will know, was the extraordinary Celtic team in 1967 under Jock Stein, which won the European cup not only with an all-Scottish team but with a team drawn from within a radius of 40 miles around Glasgow, a feat that will never be surpassed.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/6">That foreign influence has always been an issue in how English players develop, and how to create a great national side, hence the discussion about whether there should ever be a Great British side. I hope that we will have one at the Olympics, but that must be an end of it. I believe that the four home nations should retain their individual identities for other competitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/7">The scale of that influence is now so different from what it was in the past. The point is that it will not change, as many hon. Members have said. My right hon. Friend was right to pose the question, but it will not change. Fans want their clubs to be successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/8">The investment being made in the game is such that the best players will always be sought, and they will come here for the higher wages. That will not change. However, there is a price to be paid. Part of our role this morning is to question how high that price should be. There is a price for the English national game and the quality of players able to play at the highest level in the premier league. It is not a matter that can be sorted out by politicians; it is an issue for the game itself, and a variety of suggestions have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/9">I strongly support the concern expressed this morning about the quality of coaching. There must be some reason why, if they have the skills, our players are not picked up to play in leagues all over the world. It is incredibly rare to find that. When our youngsters are small and playing in their grassroots competitions at home, is too much emphasis placed on competition? Are they trying to win little medals when they are six and seven? If so, they are subject to the pressure that they have to win&mdash;to get rid of the ball.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/10">The problem is that coaches select youngsters who may not be good enough for the team because the parents want them to win&mdash;but the children want to play. Do we have to consider the parental pressure that is put on coaches? Is the link between those grassroots clubs, youth teams and the schools and academies of professional and non-league clubs strong enough?</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/11">We should pay tribute to the coaches. Football survives on volunteers at all levels, but the coaches have to assume a tremendous burden these days, working with youngsters, boys and girls, to advance the game. They deserve all our support. They should be encouraged to allow youngsters to play their natural game and to develop their skills. How is it that with &quot;the finest league in the world&quot; we are still searching for a left-sided midfielder? We have a game that cannot produce at the highest level those with interchangeable feet, able to play at the world level. That is extraordinary, bearing in mind the development of the game. If I were to concentrate on one thing, it would be that.</p>
	<p pid="a.440.1/12">Other issues come in on the back of the immense amount of money that has gone into the game, and the introduction of overseas players. I, too, worry about the growing lack of competition in English football. For how much longer will fans watch a premier league in which only one of four clubs is ever going to win and in which the only competition is for the fifth spot and the UEFA cup spot. It is not good enough; it is not what football is meant to be.</p>

	<p pid="a.444.0/1">I would like to start by congratulating my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> on securing this debate. As he said at the outset, it is a matter of great regret that no home nation will be take part in this summer's European championship finals. Failure to qualify for a major international tournament in any sport can be put down to a considerable number of factors, but if structural issues within English football are indeed part of the problem, it is right that we should identify them and encourage&mdash;that is the key thing, as my right hon. Friend said&mdash;those responsible to take the necessary action. I therefore congratulate my right hon. Friend not only on securing the debate, but on the way in which he put his case.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/2">We heard, too, from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1584" name="Alan Keen">the hon. Member for Feltham and Heston (Alan Keen)</phrase>, chairman of the all-party group on football, and probably the wisest and most experienced voice of football in the House. I thank him for his contribution. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">The hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase>, spoke about his own team, Manchester City, and we would all endorse his remarks about the Munich air disaster. We also heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase>, who made some sensible comments about over-hyped expectations, which are a key problem affecting English football, and about the success of the premier league. We then heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>&mdash;another keen footballer and cufflink-wearer&mdash;who made some wise remarks about youth development, and he was absolutely right. Finally, we heard from the Liberal Democrat spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" name="Richard Younger-Ross">the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross)</phrase>, who laid out his party's approach to these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/3">Hon. Members want to hear from the Minister, so I shall keep my remarks relatively brief. I do, however, want to lay out the Conservative party's initial thoughts on the two key issues that have been raised&mdash;the premier league, and the dearth of English qualified players who are of sufficient quality to represent this country successfully. Before I do so, however, I want to make two preliminary points. First, during the two years in which I have served as my party's sports spokesman, I have become ever more convinced of the need to empower national sporting governing bodies to get on and run their own sports without constant interference from the Government or anybody else. I am not naive enough to believe that that is always an easy course for Governments to follow, but I genuinely believe that it is the right way to proceed.</p>

	<p pid="a.445.3/1">I am delighted&mdash;that is four reasons to celebrate the FA's success on that side of the fence.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.3/2">My second preliminary remark&mdash;and this point has been made by one or two Members&mdash;is that we should keep the issue in proportion. As I said at the outset, there are several reasons why we failed to qualify for Euro 2008, but chief among them is the fact that we failed to beat a sufficient number of teams during the qualifying rounds. We have discussed several other reasons&mdash;the number of foreign players, academies, structural issues and so on&mdash;but it is worth remembering that it is the basic failure to beat a sufficient number of teams on the pitch that caused the problems that we face today. I have every confidence that the appointment of Fabio Capello, who seems to be bringing a more professional approach to the top end of the national game, will have a considerable effect on football.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.3/3">I want to move on to the two issues that underpin everything that we heard this morning: the premier league and the development of young players. We have, of course, been debating football, but the club-versus-country issue is not confined to football, and has recently been addressed in rugby and cricket. It is easy to be critical of the premier league, but, again, we should balance that criticism by recognising, as hon. Members have, that it is the wealthiest league in the world and is watched on television and listened to on the radio by more people across the world than any other league. It is a UK export with a truly global reach, as we have seen in India this week, to cite a recent example.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.3/4">I am told, albeit by the premier league, that stadium attendances over the past 15 years have gone up by 60 per cent. and that the average occupancy rate now sits at a staggering 92 per cent.&mdash;figures that almost every other sport in this country would die for. I entirely accept what my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green said in this regard, but the premier league is also a significant economic driver, with a considerable impact on local economies, and it generates huge revenue for the Treasury. Of course, all of that depends on what happens on the pitch, and much of the league's success and, indeed, from my point of view, its fun comes down to the fact that it is such an uninhibited, unencumbered free market. My advice to anybody seeking to curtail that is that they tamper with it at their peril.</p>
	<p pid="a.445.3/5">It is, however, perfectly reasonable to ask whether some form of restriction, whether voluntary or otherwise, would enable more English qualified players to gain the necessary benefits from playing top-level club football so that they stood a better chance of succeeding as internationals. I am not sure that intervening in that way would help, and there is the obvious problem of whether any quota system would be legally enforceable or practically workable. Furthermore, any possible restrictions might fall victim to the law of unintended consequences, and simply encourage big clubs to source their talent from Africa and south America even earlier. I am not sure that any of us would wish to encourage that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-23a.446.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" speakername="Hugh Robertson" colnum="446"  time="010:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080123/halltext/80123h0004.htm#08012348000569">
	<p pid="a.446.1/1">To be entirely honest, I not sure that anybody in the room or in the premier league knows what the unintended consequences of any intervention would be, which is precisely why that is such a dangerous track to take.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.1/2">Any levelling-down, which is what the artificial selection of English qualified players would involve, would not be the correct response. The challenge for English football is to produce more young players of the calibre necessary to break into the top premiership clubs, so that they could hold their place there on merit and then get through to the national team. The key to unlocking this issue is therefore improving the supply line of young English football talent.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.1/3">Time does not allow me to examine the various strengths and weaknesses of the supply line from schools, through clubs, academies and centres of excellence and on to the proposed new national football centre, although I am sure that we all welcome the news that that centre is going ahead. However, the 2007 Lewis review on youth development in football makes excellent sense, and if its conclusions had been implemented five years ago, I suspect that we would not be in the position in which we find ourselves today.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.1/4">Incidentally, I suspect that all right hon. and hon. Members would join me in paying tribute to Richard Lewis. Not only has he been an excellent executive chairman of the Rugby Football League, which promotes truly community-based sport, but he has given up a tremendous amount of time&mdash;he is a wise and influential figure in the wider world of sport&mdash;to help with the FA review and the Sport England review, which the Minister will no doubt mention. We should all put on record our thanks to him for all that he has done. The Lewis review has identified a sensible way forward, and I strongly urge the FA, the premier league and the Football League to work together&mdash;that is crucial&mdash;to implement the review's recommendations and see what difference they make, before turning to any other possible interventions, which may produce considerably less certain outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.1/5">In conclusion, I again congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green on securing the debate. There has been a wide measure of agreement about the problems and possible solutions. The Conservative party's position is threefold. First, we strongly believe that the issue before us is one for the FA, not the Government or anybody else. As part of the FA's root-and-branch review, I urge it to look at the issues raised this morning, to work with the premier league and the Football League and to produce a genuine plan of action as soon as possible. If that requires legislative action&mdash;I am not sure that there is any reason why it should&mdash;I am happy to put on record that we would, of course, offer our full support.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.1/6">Secondly, I strongly support the recommendations in the 2007 Lewis review of academies and centres of excellence, as well as the FA's decision to press ahead with a new national football centre. No one should ever pretend that it is easy to get young players to make the jump from club to international level, but the review's recommendations are a sensible way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.1/7">Thirdly, unless there is a voluntary quota, which is unlikely, I would not support any artificial barriers to the selection of players in the premier league. The premier league is a fantastic national asset, and we should enjoy and cherish it, warts and all. The answer to this question lies in getting more youngsters into the top flight of the game. As so often in sport, it is a question of getting the structures right to service the national team&mdash;the academies, centres of excellence and the national football centre&mdash;then breeding a culture of success within the team, as the Australians have done so brilliantly in cricket, and as I believe the French did in football in the late '90s. If that is done, I have no doubt that we shall qualify for the next World cup.</p>

	<p pid="a.448.0/1">Welcome to the Chair, this morning, Mr. Caton. I congratulate my right hon. football friend&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase>&mdash;on securing this important debate. Indeed, I congratulate all the hon. Members who have contributed; I consider them all parliamentary football friends. I am quite happy as Sports Minister, because in the past week about eight hours have been dedicated to sport in the House; that is unusual. We are often criticised for not being topical and not having our fingers on the pulse. The debate shows that we are indeed passionate about our football, on behalf of our football constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/2">I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> that we are not attacking the Football Association, the premier league or the Football League; we are making a genuine effort to get debate going about what should happen. I sometimes think, particularly in my present role, that the football authorities are a little bit sensitive when people start to raise issues about the game; we do so for its benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/3">I was interested in the speeches that right hon. and hon. Members made, and not least by the points raised by the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1584" name="Alan Keen">the Member for Feltham and Heston (Alan Keen)</phrase> raised ownership and governance issues, and I agree with him about putting a supporter on every board, with the right support. That is the ambition of Supporters Direct&mdash;a movement that we are happy to support.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/4">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase> for his response on the Munich air disaster. I understand what he said about the minute's applause. However, the issue is bigger than the two clubs involved and bigger than English football. If we cannot get across what the aftermath of the Munich air disaster meant to everyone, we shall sink low in the estimation of football supporters around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/5">The hon. Gentleman was right to talk about the positive impact of foreign players, particularly at Manchester City. I was interested in his suggestions about the transfer window not working as well as it might and particularly in what he said about the academies quota.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> talked about the new rules on European Union players and freedom of movement and about the Government's proposals in connection with the points system for immigration. He will be pleased to know that the new system simplifies more than 60 current routes to enter the country into five tiers. Tier 2, for skilled workers with a job offer, covers footballers playing for UK clubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/7">We have developed a special tier 2 sporting category for elite sportspersons and coaches, for those internationally established at the highest level, whose employment will make a significant contribution to the development of their sport at the highest level in the UK. Other tiers relate to sporting competition. I hope that will satisfy the hon. Gentleman that we are taking the right approach. He made great play of the impact of television money on football and its presence in the game at all levels. He makes a fair point about saturation and what will happen in the future. The football authorities need to take those points on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">The Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> is another of my footballing friends; we have shared many games together. In fact, I should congratulate the parliamentary football team, which I understand won 6-2 yesterday against the Showmen's Guild. I think that the parliamentary team has had a long successful streak.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/9">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of coaching and the debt that we owe to volunteer coaches throughout the country for their commitment to football. I want coaching to grow, and I want coaches to be held in the same esteem in the UK as they are in the United States, where a high-school coach is not only a high earner but a well respected member of the community. We need to apply the same principles to volunteers and to professionalise coaching in any way we can. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on doing the level 1 coaching course.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/10">I also congratulate the hon. Gentleman on going to Rwanda to show the power of sport and of football in particular to the wider world. This week I went to Nottingham to visit an organisation called Balls to Poverty, which is involved in taking footballs to South Africa. It has been very successful in the past three years and is now paying attention to the UK&mdash;including areas such as Nottingham, where there are difficulties with youth crime and gun and knife crime&mdash;using the same principles. That is the power of football working. The hon. Gentleman also talked about great teams and football's aspirations and about the Celtic 1967 team of home-grown players.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/11">My intervention on the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster was about residence rights and being able to play for national teams. He made some points about cricket and rugby union. My parents were from Yorkshire and Scotland, but I was born in Salford at the time when people could not play cricket for Yorkshire unless they had been born there. I always remember the great pleasure that other people took in telling me when I was a child that I could never play cricket for Yorkshire because I was not born there. The fact that I could not play cricket, and had no intention of doing so, did not come into it. They made the point that I would not be able to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/12">I am pleased to see my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1557" name="Hilary Armstrong">the Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong)</phrase>. She is a keen Sunderland supporter and keeps us abreast of all the things that happen to Sunderland, and the battle against relegation. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" name="Richard Younger-Ross">the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross)</phrase> for his comments about EU restrictions and about the opposition and problems that we may encounter in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/13">The hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent really summed things up with respect to our unity of purpose and aims. We must ensure that we reach grass-roots level and support young players, and the Government have a role to play: by investing in school sport and providing coaches at clubs, we can help the premier league, the Football League and the Football Association.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/14">I am particularly pleased about the appointment of Lord Triesman as the independent chairman of the Football Association. The Burns review has been implemented by the FA, and the future is still being considered. A continual review is taking place in the FA, and I congratulate all those who are involved. It has been a difficult period, with the move from the old FA council set-up to an independent chairman. I know that Lord Triesman will be a tremendous asset to the FA.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/15">The defeat against Croatia upset us all. I was there on that eventful night, when we all had expectations that the team would do really well. Israel had done what it did on the Saturday against Russia, and we all expected a walk-over against Croatia. However, those of us at the game saw Croatian players who could hold the ball and hold the game up, and who showed tremendous skill, whereas, unfortunately, the England players looked as if the ball was a hot potato.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/16">The tragedy was that not only England but the rest of the home nations failed to qualify. I said that night that there should be a root-and-branch examination of what is happening in football. It was a disaster in footballing terms, but also in economic terms. The failure of any home nation to qualify could cost the economy billions of pounds. That evening the causes were considered. The following day the FA announced a root-and-branch investigation of what was happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/17">Yes, Mr. Capello is now here, and I am pleased about that. He is a world-class coach and we look forward to success for the England team, but things must go much deeper into what is happening at grass-roots and school level. I watch my grandchildren playing football. There is too much pressure and competition for results. There are too many parents who are pushy for their youngsters, not focusing on skill levels and people enjoying being on the ball and enjoying the game.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/18">The impact of foreign players is important. The premier league is world class, for the reasons that hon. Members have set out. I understand the arguments that have been given. Quotas would be difficult because of European legislation, so I want the FA to lead a review and put together a board of people who will study football at grass-roots level and consider whether we get to players early enough. I hope that the Government will be involved in that through UK sports coaches and Sport England, to help the FA and the football authorities come to terms with the fact that we need to ensure that young players get support at the highest levels. Trevor Brooking said to me on several occasions that he thought that some of the TV money could be diverted into support for skills development and training, and I agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.0/19">It is no coincidence that the Man United coach Carlos Queiroz said at a conference in Portugal recently that he was concerned and appalled about what he saw of the coaching of young players in England. We need to learn the lessons. I think that we have a glowing view of the past, and we all say that the '70s were a great era for professional football&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.451.1/1">It is an honour and privilege, as ever, to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Caton.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/2">This is an important and timely debate. During the passage of the Animal Welfare Act 2006, the Government gave a clear commitment and undertaking to introduce regulations to ban the use of certain non-domesticated animals in travelling circuses. Lord Rooker has since noted that there is no reason why the regulations could not take the form of a general prohibition with exemptions on a species-specific basis. Yet in every week and month of Government dither and delay, the stress of animals incarcerated and exploited in British circuses continues. With countries such as Austria, Denmark, Israel, Singapore and even India banning such animals in their circuses, why are the British Government being so slow to act?</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/3">The Minister will know that there remains strong parliamentary and public interest in the matter. The circus industry says that there is no need for a ban, because if there were a welfare problem, there would have been numerous prosecutions under existing legislation. That is disingenuous. It is impossible for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and local authorities to be present 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all over the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/4">The industry says that banning circuses would damage the film industry. Again, I do not believe that that is correct. In fact, it is one of the industry's weakest arguments. It is really saying that such a ban would damage its pockets. It also says that film makers would be moved eastwards to eastern Europe, where animal welfare standards are not as high. I agree that standards should be improved in some eastern European countries, but I contest whether the consequences of a ban would be as the circuses suggest. Paradoxically, it might drive up animal welfare standards, as the film industry would say in those countries, &quot;We are prepared to work with you only if you improve your standards&quot;. Some of the industry's arguments are weak.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/5">The industry says that it can regulate itself and that all that is needed is a dialogue with the Government, perhaps through the new system of Performing Animals Welfare Standards International, which the Minister will know about. It is interesting to note that, until the deliberations on the 2006 Act, there was no detailed discussion between the industry, the Government and animal welfare groups. There was always dialogue, but not in the detail that there has been since. I question whether the industry's heart is really in improving animal welfare standards, as we all want.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/6">I am not suggesting that people in circuses are deliberately cruel&mdash;of course not, although there are bad apples on every organisation&mdash;but I question their motive for wanting to self-regulate now, when little was done for many years. That is why the welfare renaissance is bogus.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.1/7">As a libertarian Conservative, I do not really believe in banning things&mdash;I shy away from it&mdash;but history shows that even the most libertarian Conservative parliamentarians have voted for bans at some point in their careers, when the cause has been justified, which I believe this cause is.</p>

	<p pid="a.452.3/1">It is, and the right hon. Gentleman was a distinguished Minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for many years and has a long and illustrious track record of standing up for animal welfare. He makes an important point, which I shall come to later. There is a danger that circuses will benefit if we compare them with zoos. Zoos have breeding programmes for endangered species, are subject to strict regulations and have larger areas for animals such as lions and tigers. Given their itinerant nature, circuses cannot live up to those standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/2">I return to the opinion of the Great British public&mdash;a good thing to return to. In a recent BBC News online survey, 79 per cent. said that they would like a complete ban on the use of non-domesticated animals in circuses. The Minister is a decent and honourable man, and I hope that he will not dismiss that opinion easily and that he will encourage his officials, who I am sure are equally decent and honourable, not to dismiss it either.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/3">It may help Members if I say that four of Britain's nine circuses use non-domesticated and, indeed, domesticated animals as part of their performances. Approximately 47 non-domesticated animals are exploited for profit in those four circuses. That is why they are so keen to hold on to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/4">To return to the point made by the former Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" name="Elliot Morley">the right hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley)</phrase>, no defence can be made that vital breeding programmes, such as those in many zoos, are at stake or that there is a need to protect a certain endangered species. In my view, circuses use the animals simply to make money. In a modern, supposedly forward-thinking society, such antiquated and, some would say, barbaric practices should not be allowed to continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/5">No hon. Member would like to be kept in close or solitary confinement. I am sure that the Prime Minister might have some recommendations for one or two of his colleagues, but it is not how kangaroos, lions, tigers and camels should be kept. It is clearly not normal. They are kept out of their natural environment and often separated from other animals. Most of them are social animals and interact with other members of their species.People say, &quot;Don't bring emotion into this argument,&quot; but there is certainly emotion for those sentient animals; they feel emotion. Anyone who keeps animals or lives in proximity to animals know that the majority of those animals about which I have spoken are sentient and highly intelligent, and have emotions.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.3/6">To return to the comments made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>, many such animals are exposed to long journeys and continual forced movement&mdash;to constant caged motion and alien environments. The era of exposing those precious, sentient and often beautiful wild animals to diminished physical and social environments has to end. It is a blight on our nation's humanity and character&mdash;a nation, supposedly, of animal lovers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-23a.453.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" speakername="Mark Pritchard" colnum="453"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080123/halltext/80123h0005.htm#08012348000578">
	<p pid="a.453.1/1">Again, I am happy to refer my hon. Friend to the RSPCA, which has a catalogue of evidence. It is interesting that one of the Minister's advisers on the advisory group&mdash;I shall not name him, because it would embarrass him&mdash;said in an e-mail to me that there is no evidence of physical suffering among any of those animals. Earlier in the e-mail, however, he admitted that at some time in his career as a vet, he had treated some circus animals, so even the e-mail from a so-called experts was contradictory.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/2">I shall put on the record what I call the industry's hall of shame: Bobby Roberts Super Circus, Circus Mondao, Peter Jolly's Circus and the supposed Great British Circus. There is nothing very British or great about exploiting such animals. I am not saying that circus owners or staff are cruel, although there are always bad apples in any organisation; I am saying that the conditions in which the animals live and the way in which they are forced to live are cruel. There are people who say that emotion should not be a part of the argument. There are no tears in this place today, but there are probably tears in the eyes of those animals. One might say, &quot;Well, that's very sentimental, Mr. Pritchard. We can't take that very seriously.&quot; But those animals are sentient, they care and they have emotions, so for people to say that we should not bring emotion into the argument is disingenuous. It is interesting to note that it is not permissible to bring emotion into the argument if we are for a ban; if people are against a ban, they are quite happy to bring in emotion.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/3">What is clear, and what even the circus working group agreed, is that the status quo is not an option. The group did not conclude that the evidence of suffering of wild animals in circuses was &quot;inconclusive&quot;; rather, it said that evidence of the absence of cruelty was inconclusive. One academic on the advisory panel said that</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/4" class="indent">&quot;the absence of evidence of suffering is not evidence of the absence of suffering&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/5">Interestingly, that important and critical statement was omitted from the report, and I should be grateful if the Minister explained why.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/6">The Government should allow the courts to test the robustness of the Animal Welfare Act 2006. They should not allow themselves, as a result of conflicting legal advice, to become fearful and fail to test the robustness of the Act. Indeed, it may be helpful to develop some case law on such issues, because it may recur with regard to pet fairs and other matters on which the Government deferred action during the passage of the Animal Welfare Bill in order to deal with them through regulations or at a later time. The RSPCA is right to suggest that section 12(1) of the 2006 Act allows an amalgam of different information and evidence&mdash;including 24-hour video evidence, which the so-called experts did not use&mdash;to inform decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.459.1/1">I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to debate this issue, which is at the core of a great many people's problems. People feel very strongly and passionately about it, and I am delighted with the turnout from colleagues representing constituencies across the length and breadth of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/2">Pleural plaques is a condition caused by asbestos passing through the lung and the pleura that protect it, causing a hardening of those pleura. In October, the Law Lords decided to deny victims of pleural plaques the right to compensation on the basis that the condition is symptomless and therefore is not compensatable. Bizarrely, the ruling went on to suggest that if a person suffers anxiety as a result of plural plaques, it is caused by being told that they have it, rather than by the condition itself. That belittles claimants and causes increased anxiety, because they know that there is currently no chance whatever of redress.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.1/3">There is significant evidence to suggest that pleural plaques are not the symptomless condition that the judges thought. The five judges were unanimous, and I accept that that makes their judgment difficult to overturn. However, legislation is needed to offer hope to the victims of the condition. The Scottish National Administration in the Scottish Parliament have pledged to introduce legislation to deal with this issue. I am pleased about that, because the victims do not care how they get compensation as long as they get it. My only concern is about the SNP leading people up the garden path, believing that it can overturn the decision or introduce legislation, only to let them down at the end. I sincerely hope that the party is sincere in its endeavours to overturn the decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.462.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There should be some mechanism whereby people can trace their employment. Anybody who knows someone who has died from either pleural plaques or mesothelioma will know how difficult things are when they are diagnosed. They do not have a great deal of time to start tracing their employer. Some of them, particularly those who worked in the construction industry years ago, find that either their employers or the insurers have gone bust, and it is extremely difficult to get compensation. There is a case to be made for some mechanism whereby people can trace their employer.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/2">Recently, several insurers have refused to pay out on mesothelioma claims. They now say that the wording of the insurance policies that they entered into with employers means something very different from what they accepted it meant for the past 40 years. The insurers are arguing that the trigger for the insurance policy to respond to a mesothelioma claim is not exposure to asbestos but development of the disease asbestosis itself. The obvious benefit for insurers who are using the trigger issue is that, if they are successful, they will escape liability completely. The problem for the victims is that there will be no other insurer to turn to, because by the time they begin to suffer symptoms of the disease, which is often or could be as much as 40 years or more after they were exposed to asbestos, many employers will have simply gone bust, as my hon. Friend said.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/3">The effect of the trigger defence is to frustrate and delay the process of obtaining compensation for some terminally ill claimants, but it also introduces uncertainty about how employers' liability insurance policies should be interpreted in mesothelioma cases. The insurance industry and its advisers know that, although perhaps not all insurers are presently using the trigger defence as accepted by the court. The rest of the insurance industry will fall in line, leaving our members, our constituents and thousands of other workers who develop mesothelioma deprived of their entitlement to compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/4">What should the Government do? Pleural plaques is a condition that affects thousands of ordinary working people. They were negligently exposed to asbestos, their lungs have been damaged, and they face an increased risk of fatal illness, about which they are genuinely worried. The decision of the House of Lords to deprive them of compensation should be reversed by legislation. Insurers should be forced to use any savings from the judgment&mdash;it is estimated that they stand at some &pound;1.4 billion&mdash;to set up a fund of last resort for claimants who, through no fault of their own, cannot identify an insurer, or whose employer, again, through no fault of the claimant, has gone bust.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.1/5">I have heard from people who are close to these issues that there is a reluctance by the Government to intervene in such cases because, as someone said, the disease is symptomless. People who go off sick with stress could perhaps claim similar compensation, but I think that there is a clear distinction between people suffering from stress and people diagnosed with pleural plaques. Pleural plaques is a tangible disease, the effects of which people can see. The can see what it develops into.</p>

	<p pid="a.464.0/1">I appreciate that many hon. Members want to speak today, so I will be brief. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on initiating the debate? As he has said, many hon. Members share his concern about the Law Lords' decision. I believe that a very simple point needs to be made. Compensation for pleural plaques has been paid for nearly 30 years. The disease has been acknowledged as an industrial injury and many people have received compensation. Although the sums of money have been small, they are a just recognition of the fact that pleural plaques is an industrial disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/2">The world's largest asbestos factory was based in the town that I represent. Rochdale's Turner Brothers manufactured the stuff and then exported it to different industries, which many hon. Members here represent. Hundreds of people in Rochdale have been diagnosed with pleural plaques, and they are now extremely concerned at the effects of the Law Lords' decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/3">Clearly, as the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North said, the Government should do something. Last year, when the issue of mesothelioma payments arose, they acted very speedily. In the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill, which is now being considered in the Lords, a mechanism was found to ensure that compensation was paid speedily. I put it to the Minister that she should consider allowing amendments to that Bill to be tabled in the Lords to restore a right that has existed previously.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.0/4">We are not talking about something that has not happened before. It has been an established practice&mdash;developed by case law&mdash;to recognise that pleural plaques is a disease or an injury caused by exposure to asbestos and therefore that compensation should be paid. I hope that the Minister will listen to what hon. Members have to say and that she will introduce positive proposals to restore that right.</p>

	<p pid="a.464.1/1">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase>, I will be very brief. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on securing this debate. Pleural plaques is an important issue, and we must impress upon the Minister that she needs to think about how she might change the situation. The Law Lords made their decision on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-17">17 October</phrase>, and it has impacted on every constituency. Pleural plaques is clearly the result of exposure to asbestos.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North referred to two experts&mdash;Professor Mark Britton and Professor Newman Taylor&mdash;both of whom have said that pleural plaques is not a disease that affects the general population; it is clearly the result of exposure to asbestos. They also say that, after 30 years' exposure, a person will have calcified plaques. After 20 years' exposure, there will be plaques, but they will not have calcified.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/3">The Law Lords have accepted that there is a physiological change. The calcification, or the change to the lining of the lung, is a tangible change that can be shown on X-rays. It proves that asbestos has polluted the body. Under the concept that the polluter should pay, we should return to the situation in which compensation has been paid for 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/4">There is no doubt that there is a link with mesothelioma. Although the letter from the Association of British Insurers, which my hon. Friend mentioned, refers to only 1 per cent. of people with pleural plaques developing mesothelioma, Professor Mark Britton and Professor Newman Taylor say that the number is between 1 and 5 per cent. They make it clear that an association exists between pleural plaques and the development of mesothelioma.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/5">My hon. Friend and I met the laggers of London&mdash;there is a GMB branch for laggers&mdash;who are exposed to asbestos in their daily work. They pointed out that each year in their branch, 12 people are diagnosed with pleural plaques. They say that a significant number go on to develop worsening conditions, such as mesothelioma and cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.1/6">I hope that the Minister will think very seriously about how we can move the matter forward. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North asked what the implications would be if the Scottish Parliament overturned the Law Lords' decision. I hope that the Minister can give us an indication of the implications that that may have for England.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-23a.476.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1737" speakername="Henry Bellingham" colnum="476"  time="015:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080123/halltext/80123h0008.htm#08012348000625">
	<p pid="a.476.3/1">I was just about to say, before the Division bell went off, that I have recently received a letter from Mr. Legg, who is president of the Swansea boilermakers society. There is obviously a major campaign developing. I believe that Mr.Legg is actually a constituent of yours, Mr. Caton, so you will be well aware of the pressures that are building up. In fact, all MPs now know of cases in their own constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/2">What we have seen in the last few years is a very successful campaign on behalf of those exposed to asbestos and dust. One has only to look at the measures that have been introduced, including the Pneumoconiosis (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979, the action that has been taken to assist mesothelioma sufferers, the Compensation Act 2006, which stipulated that negligent companies had to be jointly and severally liable, and part 4 of the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill, which is going through Parliament now. We also have the Civil Procedure Rule Committee, which is examining a new practice direction to ensure a uniform fast-track system for all mesothelioma cases. So there has been impressive progress and indeed there is a great deal of public support for sufferers of any form of industrially caused lung-related illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/3">Among the 1980 cases was Patterson <i>v</i><i>.</i><i></i>MOD, in which the key finding was the theory of aggregation, which did not accept that plaques themselves could give rise to a claim, but when they were aggregated with risk and anxiety that could create an actual case. Indeed, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> pointed out that many cases were settled, but not at high cost. We are talking about many cases settling at &pound;4,000 or &pound;5,000, up to about &pound;10,000 or &pound;15,000, so they did not cost the insurance industry a great deal of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/4">On the other hand, we are talking about one of the most vulnerable groups of people in the country and those small amounts of compensation were actually bringing some relief to people at a time of great distress. It is very unfortunate indeed that we had a situation in place&mdash;we had a status quo, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the right hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> pointed out&mdash;that met with approval and satisfaction yet the insurance companies decided to take the test case to the House of Lords. However, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase>&mdash;my legal adviser from the Liberal Democrats&mdash;tells me that the law was, in fact, changed in another case and that the insurance companies had to take this test case.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/5">So we had the two cases, Johnston <i>v.</i> NEI International Combustion and Rothwell <i>v.</i> Chemical and Insulating Company, and the conjoined cases. There certainly was a very substantial cost in bringing these cases and it is a great pity that they were brought. I was not surprised at the outcome when I saw all the evidence. Nevertheless, I was very disappointed indeed. I did not sit through the House of Lords case. I did not hear all the evidence, and I do not think that any of us did. However, when we had a system that was working perfectly well and we see that system turned upside down, it is indeed most unfortunate.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/6">The only good thing that came out of all of these cases is that a great deal of medical expertise is now on the record. However, that medical expertise, it has to be said, is divided. In fact, a number of hon. Members&mdash;I think that among them were the hon. Members for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham), for Leeds, West (John Battle) and for Jarrow (Mr. Hepburn)&mdash;pointed out that there are medical experts who say that pleural plaques are not common. Those experts include Professor Mark Britton and Professor Tony Newman-Taylor, who are two of the most pre-eminent chest physicians in the land and world-renowned experts on lung diseases, and they both confirmed that pleural plaques were not prevalent in the general male population and were an indicator of asbestos exposure. In other words, one cannot develop pleural plaques through passive action, or as the result of smoking or other activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/7">However, there are other experts, for example Dr. John Moore Gillan, who is president of the British Lung Foundation, and Dr. Robin Rudd, who is a leading consultant, who are adamant that pleural plaques do not themselves form any malignant problems and do not themselves cause asbestosis to develop.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/8">I would suggest to the Minister that we have a great deal of medical opinion out there, but it is divided opinion, and there is a need for a wider inquiry. May I suggest to her that she either sets up a royal commission on this subject or tasks the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council to examine the evidence urgently? She should also look at setting up a proper register of medical evidence. There is a great deal of evidence out there and indeed there is a large amount of factual evidence that can be pulled together, but it is not being pulled together in any worthwhile shape. It would be very helpful to have that information brought together.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/9">I have to say that I was disappointed at the attitude of the Association of British Insurers. In its briefing to hon. Members, it said:</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/10" class="indent">&quot;We know that some have called for a new database to record the details of people with pleural plaques. The ABI rejects this proposal. It would not benefit people with plaques, and may cause anxiety&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/11">I do not accept that argument at all. We need more evidence and we need to have all of the facts properly recorded and when we achieve that, we will be well on the way to mounting a stronger case.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/12">There is another point that I would like to make that flows from the opinions of the medical experts who have been commenting on this issue. They conclude that 1 per cent. of people suffering from pleural plaques suffer some form of inconvenience, pain or constant irritation; whether or not that suffering leads to anything more serious, those people experience that suffering anyway.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/13">Of course, I dare say that sufferers would be able to mount a legal challenge anyway, but why should they, when the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill, which is going through Parliament, will help those people with mesothelioma? Would it not be possible to amend that Bill so that 1 per cent. of people suffering from pleural plaques could be immediately eligible for some form of compensation? That is an issue that the Minister should examine carefully, and it stems from a debate that took place on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-03">3 December 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/14">One point that the Government will have to examine very carefully is what is happening in the Scottish Parliament. If the Scottish Parliament legislates successfully on this issue we could end up with some ridiculous anomalies. For example, we could have a company that has plants both sides of the border, with employees moving from plant to plant. Those resident in Scotland would be able to take action and mount a civil case, but those living south of the border would have no hope of doing so. Another example would be if someone was working for a Government Department, such as the MOD, with facilities both sides of the border. Again, people may be posted to different sites and different rules would apply for Scottish citizens than for people who are resident south of the border. I foresee significant problems. The Government need to tell us what contingency plans they have put in place and how they plan to address the problem. If legislation is enacted north of the border that puts residents of Scotland in an advantageous position, it will lead to even more anger in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/15">We have had a passionate debate, and I congratulate hon. Members on proposing it and on the way in which they put forward their arguments. We are talking about a very tough decision. A retrograde step has been taken and the status quo, which was working perfectly well, has been turned upside down. We need more information; we need that register and an urgent independent inquiry or commission to look into it. Furthermore, the Government must act, in another place, on the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill, which is being considered. If they take those steps, the Opposition will certainly support them.</p>

	<p pid="a.482.1/1">I was delighted to succeed first time in securing this Adjournment debate on the future of the UK bird registration scheme, which was introduced under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The scheme, which is held in high regard by conservationists in general, and by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in particular, has acted as an effective deterrent to nest robbers and people who wish to profit from the illegal taking of birds in the wild. However, its future has been put in doubt by moves within the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to deregulate section 7 of the Act as part of a Treasury initiative to move to full cost recovery on all registration schemes. I, the RSPB and hon. Members from all parties sincerely hope that the Minister will resist it.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/2">It was somewhat remiss of me not to have congratulated my hon. Friend the Minister on her long overdue promotion to Government ranks. She is a close colleague of mine, and we worked together until recently on Labour's parliamentary committee. She is a passionate conservationist, a politician of substance and not the sort of Minister who will be pushed around by mere accountants in the Treasury. I have no doubt about it. That should have sealed it, anyway.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/3">On the substance of the debate, I shall set out the case for retaining schedule 4 to the 1981 Act, which provides for the bird registration scheme, and I shall challenge the arguments for deregulation. The Minister knows that any good public policy must be based on evidence, and I shall highlight some of the evidence that she has already received from the RSPB, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee and the majority of the countryside agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.1/4">DEFRA argues that taking schedule 4 birds from the wild poses no conservation threat to the species concerned, and that the national wildlife crime unit has not identified it as a priority, although I must say that that statement has been taken out of context. The argument misses the point about registration, which is, in combination with DNA testing, a tried and tested method of deterring criminal activity, and a major wildlife crime enforcement success story .</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-23a.490.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" speakername="Peter Bone" colnum="490"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080123/halltext/80123h0011.htm#08012348000661">
	<p pid="a.490.1/1">It is a pleasure, Mr. Caton, to serve under your chairmanship. I hope that we have saved the best for last.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/2">I thank Mr. Speaker for granting a debate on the great mystery of Rushden&mdash;the whodunnit of Rushden, and probably the crime of the century there. It involves deception and lack of reception. It involves large organisations, cover-ups and conspiracies. We know who the suspects are. One is the Government, in their shining offices in Whitehall. The other is a developer in Rushden&mdash;or is it the council in Thrapston, or even the regulator in his shining offices in London? Or, as I think possible, it is the European Union and the European Commission in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/3">It involves a huge theft. It has affected hundreds of people in my constituency who have lost financially and lost their quality of life. It is on such a large scale that it is inconceivable, but like many such things, it has been allowed to drift. It involves the theft of the television signal in The Hedges and the roads around it in Rushden.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/4">I have been stumbling around trying to find a solution, more like Inspector Clouseau than Inspector Morse. Now that I know which Minister is to answer the debate, I am sure that she will rise like Sherlock Holmes to explain the crime, how it happened, who the victims are, what compensation there will be and how things will be put right.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/5">The loss of the television signal in The Hedges was brought to my attention by Councillor Carol Childs, a member of Rushden town council who lives on that road. I praise Mrs. Childs for her efforts. She has campaigned tirelessly for the past year to try to get something done to help the people in her street. Indeed, I know that she is following this debate closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/6">When I was told of the problem, I contacted East Northamptonshire district council, the relevant planning authority. The chief executive of the council confirmed to me in a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-22">22 November 2006</phrase> that television reception was not considered a material consideration in the determination of a planning application for two large industrial warehouses to be built behind The Hedges.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/7">I had hoped to receive help from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase>, who had a similar problem in his area. I would like to say that he has been abducted and cannot assist in this debate, but he has been detained in a Select Committee meeting, which, in a way, is just as bad.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/8">Planning consent was granted to the developer without considering the potential loss of television signal to householders adjacent to the new development.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/9">I go back to what actually happened, and to the autumn&mdash;not of last year but the year before. On one evening, the good citizens of The Hedges were watching their normal evening programmes&mdash;probably watching the excellent programme on the Parliament channel, which gives the people raw politics without distortion&mdash;and they went happily to bed knowing about the state of the country and what was happening. In the morning, they got up, switched on their television sets&mdash;and nothing. Well, some of them got a wintry scene, with snow going across their sets, but there was no picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/10">It sounds as though it might have been a minor thing that could have sorted itself out the following day, but it did not. What did the people of The Hedges do? Just as we would have done, they assumed that it was a problem with the television set, so many of them rushed out to buy new sets, or to see whether a repair man could sort it out. Of course, that was pointless. It was nothing to do with their equipment. The television signal had been stolen.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/11">The developer&mdash;a major developer, not a small one&mdash;admitted that TV signal interference sometimes happened with buildings of that size due to the materials used in construction, but it did not provide any remedial action on the residents' behalf. The developer claims that it is not its fault if the planning authority did not take TV reception into consideration when granting planning consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/12">Ofcom was also involved at that time, because East Northamptonshire district council thought that it should have dealt with the matter, as it had in other cases. Ofcom, however, said that it was a matter for the local planning authority, so the buck had already been passed from one organisation to another, with none of them taking responsibility or owning up to the crime. That led me to table parliamentary questions to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport about the role of Ofcom when a television signal is lost or badly impaired due to new construction. The then Minister, now the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, replied that the issues that I had raised were the responsibility of Ofcom, and passed my queries on to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/13">The chief executive of Ofcom wrote a letter to me on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-21">21 February</phrase> that makes the matter even more confusing. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/14" class="indent">&quot;OFCOM has no statutory powers to investigate situations where television reception is disrupted by physical structures such as tall buildings...We do recommend that planning authorities should take potential disruption to TV reception into account when considering planning applications for large structures, although there is no statutory requirement on them to do so.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/15">Although I have been told by the Government and the planning authority that the problem is Ofcom's responsibility, Ofcom clearly states that it has nothing to do with it. I suppose that, like many regulatory authorities, it does not want to take responsibility for anything.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/16">The letter raises an important point. Ofcom says that there is no statutory obligation on planning authorities to take TV signal disruption into account when considering planning consent. That needs to be addressed immediately, and I shall refer to that later in my request to the Minister. I am not getting anywhere very quickly with the various organisations all blaming each other and none of them taking responsibility for solving the problem for my constituents. A public meeting was held in Rushden, which was well attended by affected residents and local councillors. I praise Councillor Andy Mercer, the able and hard-working leader of East Northamptonshire district council. He got involved with the mystery and tried to solve it. I am grateful to him for all his work on this issue and many others in my constituency, where he has been at the forefront of my &quot;Listening to Wellingborough and Rushden&quot; campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/17">Following the well-attended public protest meeting, a petition was formed, which I presented to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March 2007</phrase>. I thought, &quot;That should do the trick; the Minister will respond and the matter will be resolved.&quot; The petition urged the House of Commons to ask the Secretary of State to initiate an investigation into the matter with the aim of finding a solution that would restore a quality television signal. The Secretary of State's reply was taken largely from the letter I received from Ofcom. The only new piece of information given by the Secretary of State was that:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/18" class="indent">&quot;it is open to households to negotiate with the developer about remedial action to provide householders with alternative means of receiving TV services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/19">So, we are asking the victims of the crime to negotiate with one of the chief suspects. That is a novel idea. Once again, we are led around in circles. The planning authority blames Ofcom. The Government blame Ofcom, although they say that Ofcom is powerless to do anything about this issue anyway. Ofcom blames the planning authority. The developer refuses to take any responsibility because planning consent was given. All the while, my constituents are losing out. My constituents have lost their TV signal, yet they are still being forced to pay the TV licence fee.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/20">Another hard-working local councillor, Councillor Robin Underwood, contacted the ombudsman, yet it washed its hands of the matter and said that it had nothing to do with the ombudsman. After a number of other parliamentary questions that I tabled to the Secretary of State regarding guidance to local planning authorities, I had still got no further in seeking a solution to the great Rushden mystery. Then it came to me in a flash of genius that Inspector Morse would have been proud of&mdash;it must be the fault of the European Union. Clearly, as we are part of this transnational, unaccountable superstate, it loves interfering in everything that we do. Surely, as TV signals do not recognise national boundaries, the European Union must have rules on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/21">As luck would have it, later today in the House of Commons we are considering European Union document No. 15869/07. Lo and behold, it is entitled &quot;Communication&quot;. Surely this was it. This would be the solution to our whodunnit, but alas no. When I looked at the document, I saw that it was the usual incomprehensible Euro-babble promoting intercultural dialogue. My constituents in Rushden are worried not so much about intercultural dialogue as about when they will next be able to see &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Despite nearly 16,000 new European regulations last year, not one will solve the theft of the TV signal in Rushden, but I suppose the European Union cannot be guilty, as the Commission would not even know where Northamptonshire was.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/22">Enough is enough. Solving the Hound of the Baskervilles mystery was easy for Sherlock Holmes, and I know that in a little while the Minister will solve this whodunnit. For more than a year, my constituents have experienced organisations that should take some responsibility denying responsibility, blaming others and passing the buck. It is not so much a case of Colonel Mustard in the library; it is probably the developer in Rushden or the Government in Whitehall. It is a whodunnit with no obvious solution. Perhaps they are all guilty, as in &quot;Murder on the Orient Express.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/23">The buck has to stop somewhere, and unfortunately it has to stop with the Government. Only the Government are in the unique position of being able to introduce legislation so that the theft of television signals does not happen to others. Only the Government can intervene on behalf of my constituents with the developers to find an immediate solution. Only the Government can urge Ofcom to lay down statutory guidelines for planning authorities to use when considering proposals for large developments and the effects that they might have on existing television reception. Furthermore, in case planning consent is given and there is a problem with television reception, a condition of the planning consent should be that the developer must correct such a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/24">My hon. Friend the Member for Kettering, if he had been here today, would have said that in his situation, in which a wind farm was put up that later affected the television signal, the wind farm put it right. As we have heard, however, there is no legal requirement for it to do that. Only the Government can ensure that my constituents get a refund on their television licence fee. For more than a year, they have dutifully paid for the television licence, but received no signal whatever. It is a whodunnit. It is a crime. There are victims. I look forward to the Minister, or Sherlock Holmes, solving it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-23a.496.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" colnum="496"  time="017:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080123/halltext/80123h0012.htm#08012348000668">
	<p pid="a.496.2/1">My hon. Friend is helping me with that question. That would not be unreasonable, and I would expect&mdash;I am a former member of a local authority, and I do not know whether the hon. Member for Wellingborough is, too&mdash;the local authority to negotiate with the developer to ensure, through the section 106 arrangements, that the disbenefit experienced by the hon. Gentleman's constituents is put right through an agreement with the developer before planning permission is granted.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.2/2">I also must tell the hon. Gentleman that when his region switches to digital in 2011, the situation is likely to continue in respect of digital terrestrial services, as the digital signals will be broadcast from the same transmitters that broadcast the analogue series. There is only one piece of good news for those constituents who have problems with &quot;ghosting&quot;, which happens when the analogue television signals are reflected by buildings or other tall objects, leading to multiple pictures being layered on top of one another on the TV screen. After switchover, ghosting should not be a problem, because of the technical characteristics of the digital switchover.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.2/3">The final option for the hon. Member for Wellingborough's constituents would be for the community in some way&mdash;through the town council, the district council, the county council or whatever structure&mdash;to build and operate a low-powered TV repeater transmitter. The cost will vary, depending on the precise situation, but it is likely to be in the range of a few hundred pounds to a few thousand pounds. Such transmitters require a licence, so the hon. Gentleman should advise his constituents to get in touch with Ofcom if they wish to pursue that option further. The hon. Gentleman will also know of the digital switchover help scheme. It might be appropriate, particularly for people who are over 75, seriously disabled or registered as blind or partially sighted&mdash;those groups are eligible for help under the scheme&mdash;as it could provide a subsidy for those people for the switchover.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.2/4">I feel huge sympathy for the position in which the hon. Gentleman's constituents find themselves. I hope that my comments have helped them. I think that there is a clear route forward. The hon. Gentleman should not have got to the position that he is in, but having got there, he must look forward and I hope that he will find a solution on behalf of his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.2/5" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.2/6" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-nine minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
