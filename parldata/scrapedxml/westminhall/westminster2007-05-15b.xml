<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-15b.183.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" speakername="David Burrowes" colnum="183"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070515/halltext/70515h0001.htm#07051560000489">
	<p pid="b.183.2/1">It is a pleasure to have secured the debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Olner. It is timely and important. When the Government published the alcohol harm reduction strategy they also promised a review of the strategy in 2007, during which they would &quot;take stock&quot; against &quot;clearly defined indicators&quot;. The Department of Health and the Home Office will soon publish a revised draft. This is, then, an important opportunity to engage with the Government directly, before publication. However, that opportunity has not been afforded properly to interested groups and individuals, by way of a formal consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/2">The answer to my parliamentary question about consultation, which I tabled on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-30">30 April</phrase>, reveals the different ways in which the Government deal with their drug and alcohol strategies. The response on the drug strategy was:</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/3" class="indent">&quot;A consultation document is planned to be issued alongside details of the consultation process in May/June 2007. The intention is to consult interested groups and individuals, including service providers and those affected by drugs&mdash;users, families and local communities. Subject to cross-Government agreement, the new strategy is likely to be published in late 2007.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/4">Moving on to the question of alcohol, the response was:</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/5" class="indent">&quot;A series of detailed discussions have been held with key stakeholders from the health, police, young people's sectors and the alcohol industry to inform the development of the new Alcohol Strategy. The new strategy is due to be launched in summer 2007. A formal consultation is not planned prior to launch, but consultation is likely to be required on implementation of key aspects of the strategy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/6" class="indent">&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-02">2 May 2007</phrase>; Vol. 459, c. 1771W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/7">Why is there no intention formally to consult in the same manner on alcohol and drugs? Does the Minister recognise the concern from different interest groups, including Alcohol Concern and the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, that the Government</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/8" class="indent">&quot;needs to be much more proactive and confident in consulting&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/9">Have the detailed discussions with key stakeholders included service providers, alcohol addicts and their families, and the local communities that are most affected by alcohol misuse? Even before the launch of the new strategy, a fundamental criticism of the Government's approach is exposed in its process of review. That is the fact that alcohol is the poor relation in drug and alcohol policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/10">The debate is important because alcohol consumption and the harm arising from alcohol misuse affect all our constituencies. The debate is less about the millions of people who enjoy drinking responsibly than it is about the millions who do not do that, and who devastate many lives and relationships around them. It is a debate about binge and chronic drinkers; but such drinkers should not be the only focus of debate. The Government strategy is too limited. It fails to tackle the need to reduce overall consumption and alcohol harms. Indeed, that attitude is supported in many ways by the media, which play to our voyeuristic tendency to be entertained by the antics of binge drinkers. Mr. Olner, you may have seen recent television productions of that kind. We can too easily stereotype the problem of alcohol misuse, and comfort ourselves that it is someone else's problem. However, increased consumption and harm is everyone's problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/11">Alcohol consumption has grown and spread. Consumption has doubled in the past 50 years, and it is up 15 per cent. in the past five recorded years. It is estimated that 8.2 million adults have an alcohol use disorder and that up to 3 million are alcohol dependent. Young women have doubled their consumption in the past 10 years, and children have doubled consumption in the past 15 years. Six million under-25s binge drink and 60 per cent. of 15-year-old boys binge drink monthly.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/12">Many of the figures relating to alcohol harm will be familiar to hon. Members who are present for the debate, but it is important to explain the harms at the outset. Alcohol damages the economy. The total loss to the economy from alcohol misuse is estimated to be some &pound;6.4 billion a year. Alcohol damages mental health: 65 per cent. of suicides are linked to alcohol misuse. Anxiety and depression are very common among heavy drinkers. Alcohol damages health: 22,000 people are estimated to have died each year as a direct or indirect result of alcohol&mdash;more than the combined number of deaths from breast and cervical cancer and MRSA, which often make the headlines. Deaths from alcohol-related liver disease have doubled in the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/13">Alcohol damages through violence. At least one in three reported instances of domestic violence are known to be linked to alcohol. The British crime survey's figures show that 44 per cent. of victims of violent crime believe that their attackers were drunk or under the influence of alcohol at the time of their attack. Alcohol damages public services. Hospital admissions resulting from alcohol abuse have increased steadily between 1997 and 2004 from more than 19,000 to more than 25,000. More than 3,000 of those admissions were of children. At peak times seven out of 10 accident and emergency admissions stem from alcohol abuse and the Department of Health estimates that about &pound;1 in every &pound;3 spent in A and E is alcohol-related.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/14">Alcohol damages the young. Home Office figures state that among 16 to 24-year-olds 63 per cent. of males and females who admitted to criminal and/or disorderly behaviour were drunk during or after the event. Alcohol and drug misuse is the cause of permanent exclusion from school for more than one in 16 children. More than three out of 100 babies born could have been damaged by their mothers' drinking during pregnancy. Alcohol fundamentally damages families. It is estimated that 920,000 children in the United Kingdom currently live in a home where one or both parents misuse alcohol. Marriages in which one or both partners have a drink problem are twice as likely to end in divorce as those that are not affected by alcohol. The list could go on.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/15">The Government need to be more open about what they want to achieve by their strategy for alcohol. Do they seriously want to reduce overall consumption and alcohol harms? If so, a more strategic approach is needed, recognising the impact of price, regulation and availability; alcohol misuse should have the same public health status that tobacco and obesity currently have. The 2004 strategy, like many strategies emanating from the Prime Minister's strategy unit, is strong on fine-sounding words but weak on delivery. To take one aim&mdash;improving health and treatment services&mdash;it is estimated that alcohol-related harm is at least six times worse than the harm related to drugs, but alcohol services continue to receive far less than drugs services.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/16">It is extraordinary that the Government have developed a treatment policy with a pooled treatment budget, targets, monitoring and all the paraphernalia of bureaucracy that go hand in hand with the Government's top-down initiatives, but that they have failed to include alcohol in that treatment policy, leaving it as the almost exclusive preserve of drugs. For a Government who pride themselves on their target-led approach to health and asserting their key health priorities, it is significant that the alcohol strategy discussed the importance of</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/17" class="indent">&quot;Setting goals and monitoring progress&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/18">but also stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/19" class="indent">&quot;There is no comprehensive target for reducing the harms caused by alcohol misuse&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/20">Guidance notes for primary care trusts have been published, including on programmes of improvements and models of care for alcohol misusers. The result of the strategy is much paperwork, but the impact in increased access to treatment has so far been limited, as local commissioners have determined their actions without national targets to guide them. The lack of dedicated funding and the absence of alcohol monitoring in the quality outcomes framework have meant that alcohol issues have not been prioritised by many PCTs. The alcohol strategy has failed to set out a framework of national, regional or local targets, or drivers to increase access to treatment for problem drinkers. That has left 17 out of 18 problem drinkers, on average, without access to the specialist support that they require. The Prime Minister's constituency of Sedgefield suffers from being in the region with the highest incidence of problem drinkers and the lowest access to treatment, with barely one in 100 able to find any kind of treatment. I doubt that the other 99 would agree with the Prime Minister's foreword to the strategy, in which he said that it would</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/21" class="indent">&quot;in time, bring benefits to us all in the form of a healthier and happier relationship with alcohol.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/22">In stark contrast to the 2002 drug strategy, there are no targets to increase the number of problem drinkers in treatment, or reduce alcohol misuse in general. Also, no funding is ring-fenced for alcohol treatment services, and it is unclear how much money goes to alcohol services. There are no centrally held figures beyond the global figures that the Minister gives in parliamentary answers, so I have conducted my own survey of primary care trusts across the country. It is significant that of the 66 PCTs that have so far responded, only 39 know how much is spent on alcohol rather than being absorbed by the drugs budget. Most have responded that only a small proportion is given to alcohol treatment and that they do not think that the amount allocated to alcohol is sufficient.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/23">In 2006-07, of the 39 PCTs that supplied separate figures for alcohol and drugs services, the average spent on alcohol was &pound;424,500, compared with the average of &pound;3,832,000 that is spent on drug treatment. So, alcohol treatment receives about 11 per cent. of the amount that is allocated to drug treatment. The survey shows that the 20 PCTs that were able to provide the relevant data for 2006-07 will spend an average of 0.72 per cent. of their total annual budget on drugs and 0.15 per cent. on alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/24">The situation in Enfield illustrates the reality: the strategy has not made tackling alcohol misuse a priority. The answer to a parliamentary question in March revealed that &pound;1.5 million had been identified</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/25" class="indent">&quot;to support various 'Choosing Health' White Paper initiatives including alcohol treatment services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/26">But there was, as always, a caveat. The answer goes on:</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/27" class="indent">&quot;It is for PCTs to determine how to use the funding allocated to them to commission services to meet the healthcare needs of their local populations.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-05">5 March 2007</phrase>;Vol. 457, c. 1681W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/28">The Minister might, in her response, be quick to extol the virtues of PCTs having self-determination, but managers at the cash-strapped and top-sliced Enfield PCT would say that they do not have a choice. It has a &pound;13.1 million deficit and a priority to meet other central targets, which means that alcohol services inevitably lose out. There is no funding for any specialist alcohol treatment services in Enfield to support the good work that is being carried out by Rugby house and the service providers at Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust mental health and substance abuse services.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/29">Enfield has squeezed out of its drugs budget some support for alcohol addicts. Its focus on excluded and disadvantaged sections of our community is welcome and chimes with the words on page 5 of the alcohol harm reduction strategy, where it proposes</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/30" class="indent">&quot;better help for the most vulnerable&mdash;such as homeless people, drug addicts, the mentally ill, and young people. They...need clear pathways for treatment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/31">However, that is not happening in Enfield or in many other places. It is madness that although patients might be addicted to both illicit substances and alcohol, there is a division between those services. One service might not treat illicit drug abuse until the patient is detoxed from alcohol, and the alcohol services might not detox a patient whilst they are addicted to illicit drugs, hence the patient does not get access to appropriate treatment. Drug action teams are encouraged to take the lead with alcohol strategy, but they refuse to do so in Enfield because they do not receive the funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/32">The strategy speaks about piloting schemes to find out whether the earlier identification and treatment of people with alcohol problems can improve health and lead to longer-term savings. That all sounds good on paper, but the PCT in Enfield has cut the &pound;82,000 allocation that was intended for alcohol screening in the accident and emergency department. Will the Minister tell us how that decision fits in with the strategy?</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/33">The situation in Enfield is not due to a lack of effort on the ground. The alcohol strategy manager there is doing a fine job, and Enfield is one of only six London boroughs that has such a strategy management consultant. There have been significant results with crime and disorder in Enfield as a result of the dedicated support of a co-ordinator pushing up the alcohol agenda across services in Enfield and because of joint working with the police and probation, particularly on domestic violence. Despite the strong multidisciplinary approach and partnership to tackle alcohol misuse, however, the PCT is unable to allocate funds to plug the funding gap, especially with tier 3 alcohol treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/34">The lack of a serious and resourced strategy to deliver real progress on the ground means that alcohol treatment is left predominantly to small voluntary sector organisations such as local Alcoholics Anonymous groups and 1NE Beulah road, which are beacons in the desert of treatment. There is a highly effective and cost-effective abstinence-structured day care programme for alcohol at 1NE Beulah road, which has no direct or reliable source of funding despite the fact that most of the people who use the service there are referred from the statutory sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/35">An area that the 2004 strategy avoids, which I would like the Minister to consider, is the control of supply and availability. Government policy has been to liberalise the main drivers of consumption&mdash;regulation and taxation&mdash;but where does that policy fit in with the strategy to reduce harm? The rising levels of alcohol misuse in recent years, the state's power to sanction the manufacture and sale of alcohol and its potential power to control the availability and price of alcohol all inevitably give the Government the lead responsibility to minimise the harm that alcohol causes, not least because of the cost to the public purse. However, the 2004 strategy rejected tax as a means of tackling harm. In so doing, it rejected substantial scientific evidence that the price of alcohol is one of the principal influences on levels of alcohol consumption and harm, whether we like it or not. Will the Minister review the evidence that supports the idea that duties should be based on the alcohol content of the drink and should be used as a means of controlling alcohol problems?</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/36">I am not sure what the Minister's career prospects will be in seven weeks' time or whether she is feeling demob happy, but I invite her to boldly go where no Minister of Health has gone before in terms of alcohol policy. Professor Chris Cook, who is a consultant psychiatrist in alcohol misuse, has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/37" class="indent">&quot;The enormous popularity of alcohol&mdash;our 'favourite drug' can make wise evidence based policies politically unattractive...It is not enough that debate about matters of production, distribution and consumption are conducted simply in terms of scientific opinion, political expediency and consumer choice. Alcohol policy should also be based on soundly reasoned ethical principles.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.183.2/38">I invite hon. Members and my hon. Friends to debate this matter, and urge the Minister that we should have an alcohol strategy based on such principles.</p>

	<p pid="b.197.1/1">Certainly, Mr. Olner. In fact, you will have heard from the way I was speaking that I was seeking to convey the message that I was indeed bringing my comments to an early conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.1/2">We need the balanced picture that alcohol can be pleasurable, and even preventive in health terms, and has been part of our culture for centuries. However, part of that balance is to admit that there is a serious problem that cannot be ignored, and that must not play second fiddle to acknowledging the serious problems associated with illegal drugs. We look to the Government to strike the right balance throughthe review promised this year. In doing that, I hope that the problems faced in Bedfordshire will be resolved, but also that we achieve a much better balance, which will help us all in this country.</p>

	<p pid="b.197.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase> on securing this debate. The problem of alcohol abuse has had a raised profile recently, which is a good thing, although I still believe that it is not discussed enough, so I thank him for successfully raising it today.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/2">As a relatively fresh MP a few years ago, I made a round of visits to police stations. I would ask the local police officers what their biggest problem was. I was also quite interested in the drugs problems, because they were high profile at the time. This was probably not a politically correct comment to make, but the police would invariably say in informal feedback, &quot;Drugs? No problem. In fact, we quite like them when they've been smoking spliffs, because they're quite mellow and they don't cause that much harm&quot;&mdash;let us put aside the longer-term harm of drugs for a moment. &quot;Alcohol's the real problem we have to deal with, but nobody's doing anything about it&quot;. Seven years on, it is difficult to see what has been done to address those problems practically, because they have got much worse.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/3">Hon. Members have mentioned that there is a problem in recognising alcohol abuse, and also highlighted the fact that the availability of treatment varies. &quot;A Glass Half Empty?&quot; by Alcohol Concern calculated that &pound;400 million had been spent on 18,390 drugs service users, which is equivalent to just over &pound;21,000 a head, but that only &pound;217 million had been spent on the 1.1 million people who are dependent drinkers, which is equivalent to about &pound;197 a head. There is clearly a great disparity in how the different problems are funded and perceived.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/4">I know from talking to my local drug and alcohol treatment centre that it feels that it has a relatively large amount of funding for drugs, but that it struggles to find adequate funding to treat alcohol problems. It is only because more and more people are coming through with joint problems that the centre can tackle some of the problems, such as the long waiting list. Figures show that an average of only about one in18 people who need treatment for alcohol abuse can receive it. The regional disparities are even starker; in the north-east of England, only one in 102 people requiring access to such treatment can receive it. If people who have an incident that prompts a desire to tackle their alcohol problem cannot get help there and then, things become difficult. The necessity of waiting weeks or months to access services is one of the urgent problems that needs to be tackled.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/5">I am surprised that little mention has been made in this debate of Alcoholics Anonymous, which provides a very useful service, although the style may not be for everyone. Last year, I was invited to attend an open AA local meeting, which I found illuminating. I was particularly struck that some people with an alcohol problem had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous for 15 or 20 years. They felt that it was important to keep the link and realised that they were no better, if you like, than the tramp in the gutter with a bottle of cheap plonk.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> highlighted the problems in respect of children. Recent surveys have all pretty much confirmed that alcohol consumption among children is increasing. There are mixed reports about whether allowing children to consume alcohol at home eases or worsens the problem. We are probably taking too broad and simplistic a view of the issue. As was hinted at in an earlier intervention, there is a range of parental attitudes towards alcohol. Some parents introduce it in a controlled setting and supervise their children's exposure to it. However, I remember being absolutely horrified when I watched a programme called &quot;Wife Swap&quot;&mdash;one has to de-stress somehow&mdash;in which a couple were knowingly giving their quite young children quite large amounts of alcohol. The parents thought it fine if their children, totally unsupervised, drank large amounts at parties. So there is a range of parents, and they can have completely different attitudes to alcohol. We have to take that into account when we analyse such surveys.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/7">Binge drinking among children is on the increase, and that is a concern. The European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs found that drinking levels among 15 to 16-year-olds in the UK were at 27 per cent., exceeded only by two other countries in Europe. Ireland tops the poll at 32 per cent. Clearly, there is a problem. Recently, I tabled a parliamentary question about end-stage liver disease among the under-18s. I did not expect any sort of answer at all, and some people were pleased that only three under-18s had been diagnosed with the problem. However, given the lead-up time to developing end-stage liver disease, the figure means that children are drinking large amounts at a younger and younger age. A bulge in the figures indicates such a shift and indicates the growing problem, which is not being tackled.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/8">Obviously, the problem will impact on the health service, but there are o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">ther impacts too. My hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> asked for figures on alcohol-related accident and emergency admissions since 1997. In 1997-98, there were 75,863 such admissions; by 2005-06, that had almost doubled to 148,477. Earlier, we heard evidence that when such people access A and E, they can be abusive and a threat to our NHS staff. That is another aspect of the problem that we cannot afford to ignore. There is also a large alcohol-related component in domestic violence figures; about half of domestic violence incidents are fuelled by alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/9">Another health-related link is with teenage pregnancy and it should not be ignored. In 2002, when I was one of its members, the Health Committee wrote a report on sexual health. We invited young people to talk to us and they were clear that the pressures of drink&mdash;or the pressure to drink&mdash;added to the problem of the pressure to indulge in sexual activity. The two are not unrelated. Alcohol Concern's &quot;A Glass Half Empty?&quot; points out that evidence suggests a strong link between alcohol consumption and the neglect of contraceptive use during sexual intercourse among the young. However, that issue was completely ignored by the alcohol strategy. It would be helpful if the Minister said whether anything was planned to tackle the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">The hon. Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase> claimed that things had not worsened under the new licensing hours. However, there is no evidence that matters have improved either. Recorded alcohol-related crime between 11 pm and 2 am has not decreased as a result of extended opening hours. However, I&mdash;and many other hon. Members as well, I suspect&mdash;have probably had an increase in our postbags as a result of those hours. People now go home from the pub during a longer time span, in which minor criminal damage&mdash;silly things, such as damage to cars and property, that are a real irritant to people&mdash;can take place. Having spent my teenage years on the continent, I always felt that introducing those hours would be a good thing. However, that is not necessarily the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.2/11">In my last couple of minutes, I should like to talk about advertising.</p>

	<p pid="b.202.2/1">I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> will forgive me if I prioritise <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">the questions of the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase>, who secured the debate, and other colleagues on the Back Benches. The hon. Member for Westbury probably gets more than his fair share of opportunities to ask questions of the Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/2">First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate on securing the debate. It is timely, because we are reviewing the alcohol harm reduction strategy for England that was published in 2004. Although we have not carried out a formal consultation as part of that process, I can assure hon. Members that we have had a series of detailed discussions that have informed our thoughts and views on how to take the strategy forward. Those discussions have included stakeholders from health, non-governmental organisations, the police, young people's services and industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/3">Once the strategy is published, there will be further opportunities to consult on different aspects of it. It is a cross-Government approach to tackling the multi-faceted problems of some for whom drinking has become a problem in their daily lives to varying degrees, but it is also for the majority who keep within the sensible drinking limits but for whom excessive drinking spills over into their lives. That might be because they want to go for an enjoyable night out without having to face the prospect of disorder in their communities or, as we have heard, because of matters such as domestic violence in which alcohol plays a part. Hon. Members have commented on the difficulties for children living in homes where alcohol is a common feature and contributes to a lack of support for them. There will be on ongoing discussion, and we will look for opportunities to consult on the various aspects of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/4">We are determined to reduce the harm caused by alcohol misuse, and without being at all complacent I think that we have made some progress. It is becoming clear that the mechanisms that the Government have put in place since 2004 are becoming established and beginning, in spite of comments made today, to have a positive effect in tackling the range of harm that results from alcohol misuse. Most of the commitments in the Government's strategy have been delivered&mdash;on under-age sales of alcohol and on violent crime and offences involving alcohol, which have fallen. That is not to say that we should be satisfied by where we are, but the indications are that such offences have fallen.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/5">I pay due respect to those in local communities who are enforcing operations on under-age sales, which have been extremely successful. The partnership involved has been very good. I visited two small supermarket outlets, which I shall not name, and in both asked about alcohol sales. Both those supermarkets were on a final warning after two operations in which, I am afraid, they had been found wanting. In the staff room there was information up for all staff to further get across the point that they really had to take responsibility for checking on age. Schemes such as those mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">my hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase> are, I am sure, common to many other hon. Members' constituencies and tackle under-age drink sales. That is vital if we are to change some of the worst aspects of where drink is provided in our communities and the consequences of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/6">We need to challenge the belief that drunkenness and antisocial behaviour are an accepted part of English drinking culture. There is sometimes a perception that it is our drinking culture, but the reality is that a minority indulge in such a way. Most people drink within the Government's sensible drinking guidelines or exceed them only occasionally. Even among 18 to 24-year-olds, the group most often associated with drunkenness, more than two-thirds of young men and three-quarters of young women drink within the guidelines. Of those who drink at levels above them, only a quarter become involved in antisocial behaviour or disorder.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/7">The renewed strategy needs to build on what has been achieved and where we are now, and set out how to embed the strategy further&mdash;it is not about starting afresh&mdash;and take it forward. Total recorded alcohol consumption in the UK is estimated to have doubled between 1960 and 2002, which is a trend over a long period. That is important in dealing with the cases of cirrhosis of the liver that appear in our hospitals, and I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> that we need to consider future health and what we can do to prepare for the number of people who might still have problems with cirrhosis of the liver or other health conditions linked to alcohol. We must look further down the road at how we can stem that flow in the future, but consumption has doubled in40 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/8">The average weekly consumption of alcohol increased from 5.3 units in 1990 to 10.4 units in 2000, and it has since remained at about that level. That decade was significant in that respect. Heavy drinking remains high, but levels have decreased significantly among men and there are indications&mdash;I use that word carefully; we cannot be complacent&mdash;that it may have peaked among 16 to 24-year-old women. It is too early to say whether that represents the start of a consistent downward trend in consumption levels, but it is at least helpful for an informed debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/9">In 2000, between 15,000 and 22,000 deaths in England and Wales were related to alcohol misuse. Since 2003 the number of alcohol-related deaths has slowed and flattened out. I use those figures not to over-hype that as a sign of success, but something seems to be happening. I am not suggesting that it is all down to the Government; maybe it is because of greater awareness or maybe the headlines in our papers are beginning to make people take stock of their drinking and the impact that it has.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/10">Through the strategy we undertook the first national assessment of the need and availability of alcohol treatment, which was published in November 2005. We allocated &pound;3.2 million last October to establish three major identification and brief advice trailblazer trials, which are taking place on 57 sites, to identify and support harmful drinkers. That initiative is important because it is about trying to address people who are not defined as chronic alcohol dependants but whose drinking is regularly proving hazardous to their health and could result down the road in severe health conditions for them to face up to.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/11">We are trying to examine the matter differently&mdash;maybe in accident and emergency settings or maybe in other environments such as a local police station if someone has been picked up for antisocial behaviour&mdash;to engage with a person's drinking and its relationship to why they have turned up there. They might have turned up at A and E because they have fallen over and cracked their head open and require stitches, or at a police station because of disorder. I know that they are examining the matter in Enfield and are in discussion with their trust about staffing in the A and E department to support such work. I congratulate them on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1396" name="Patrick Hall">The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate, my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall)</phrase>, and the hon. Members for Romsey and for Westbury talked about drugs and why they are given such a priority compared with alcohol. We could have a whole debate about that, but I have a few comments. Action on alcohol is at a much earlier stage than that on drugs. It is also, as I think we all agree, a complex issue in that it is not of itself illegal. The drugs strategy was combined with dealing with illegal drugs and their link to crime. Unlike tobacco consumption, low alcohol consumption may be beneficial for health for certain population groups, and moderate consumption is not harmful. Alcohol therefore poses a different range of problems and issues to be resolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/13">The alcohol harm reduction strategy for England was the first comprehensive Government-wide strategy to establish different ways to approach this complex issue. We may compare that with drugs, for which the Government have had a strategy in place since 1998 and for which there were predecessor strategies before that under other Governments. We are now encouraging drug and alcohol action teams, and many people involved in drug addiction through illicit drugs, a number of whom I have met, also have alcohol problems. There is an opportunity for dual diagnosis and dual treatment to go hand-in-hand.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/14">I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford that there is an opportunity to use the young people's grant to address both alcohol and drugs. I am happy to talk to him about the situation in Bedford and why that might not be happening in his area. We work with the NTA and discuss such issues regularly, and we are considering how we can improve the situation. I hope that I shall not be corrected on this by officials, but I understand that if an area has met its targets on drug treatment numbers there is flexibility to use resources for alcohol services.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/15">Of course, a number of our providers are both alcohol and drug treatment providers and will have benefited, for example, from the capital funding that we have provided for those services. Many of them are in the voluntary sector, such as Clouds, which was mentioned. I was happy to go to the launch yesterday of the merger of Clouds, Action on Addiction and The Chemical Dependency Centre. Quite cleverly they are going to use the same name&mdash;Action on Addiction.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/16">We are absolutely serious about focusing on the area in question. I commend the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Burton about how we can work with the industry. We cannot work with the illegal drug industry, but we can work with the alcohol industry in different ways to tackle irresponsible retailing. I have heard the points made about on-trade/off-trade promotions. We are examining advertising, and the authorities are going to review the code that they tightened up only a short while ago to see whether it is working. We are also working on labelling, and through self-regulation that is one way in which we have made some progress.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-15b.208.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1947" speakername="Ian Lucas" colnum="208"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070515/halltext/70515h0005.htm#07051560000515">
	<p pid="b.208.3/1">That is certainly the case. It is extremely important that we diversify the sources of funding in higher education. There are difficulties in the approach to endowments recently announced by the Prime Minister because the scheme tends to benefit those universities with a more traditional background, more alumni and more affluent alumni; smaller and newer universities do not have that same support. We must look for new sources of funding by developing links with previous students and with industry. The most competitive economies in the world have extremely high levels of contribution from the private sector. For example, in the higher education sector in the United States, levels of private sector funding are higher than we currently have. That is something that we need to develop. The foundation degree scheme that I mentioned in relation to Airbus in my own area must be extended in order for universities to progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/2">There are concerns about the disparity of funding in the UK, which was recently expressed in evidence that was given by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales to the inquiry on globalisation by the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs. Even now, under devolution, there is a dual-support system for higher education in Wales. The Welsh Assembly Government provide funding through the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales and funding is also provided by the Department of Trade and Industry and UK research councils to important universities in Wales, such as Cardiff and Bangor. Therefore, even under the devolved system, contributions are made by the UK Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/3">The higher education sector in Wales has expressed concerns that it is not adequately funded by the Welsh Assembly Government. When a Government have been formed, I will ask them to look at that issue. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales observed in its evidence to the Welsh Affairs Committee:</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/4" class="indent">&quot;Levels of overall public investment in HE in Wales lag well behind England, Scotland and some of our key international competitors. HEFCW estimates a &pound;41 m funding gap exists between the HE sectors of Wales and England.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/5">Anecdotally, vice-chancellors in Wales have told me that that is their perception of the issue. I am not sure whether the Minister should take that as a pat on the back from England or not, but I am sure that he will take it that way if he can.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/6">Welsh institutions are in a small higher education environment and must compete with higher education institutions in England. It is increasingly difficult for Welsh institutions to secure the appropriate level of investment to finance high-quality higher education for students. In the modern economy that we are developing, which is supported by universities, it is important that progress is made on that issue. I want to see a university in Wrexham, in my own constituency, that works closely with the successful private industry in north-east Wales and provides support for the research that companies undertake. I have met companies in my constituency that have told me about their research and that they use universities from across the United Kingdom and, in certain cases, from other parts of the world. There is a gap in the market and a missed opportunity for the local education sector as it could provide companies with the support that they need to progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/7">The link between industry and universities must be taken forward and competitive universities should be able to offer the appropriate support to business. However, that is complicated by the current arrangements and the disparity in funding regimes for students and institutions in the UK. This matter has not been on the political agenda for a long time, which may be because of the elections to the Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament. The issue presents some political difficulty and should be discussed not just within one political party, but among all parties. We all agree that we need a competitive and high-quality higher education sector, which at the present time is very complex. We had a full debate about different funding systems for students at the time of the 2004 Act, but things have moved on since then. We are beginning to see evidence of changes in student behaviour, and that evidence will, of course, increase as time passes.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/8">This is the appropriate time for the UK Government to engage closely with the devolved Governments and institutions to discuss how we can codify and bring together the funding systems within the United Kingdom. It is also time that we had detailed proposals from all political parties, not only from the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in the House of Commons, but from nationalist parties in Wales and Scotland, so that we can hear what they have to say on the subject and how they believe that higher education can be taken forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/9">Make no mistake: the higher education sector is vital to the continued success of the UK economy and to the UK as a cultural centre that other countries respect. We have built that up over many years, and further in recent years, and I am pleased to see the increased number of students accessing higher education through different means&mdash;not just through school, but through the workplace, institutions such as the North East Wales Institute and other non-traditional means. It is important that we make the system work as well as possible. In order to improve the current position,we need much greater dialogue between the UK Government and the devolved institutions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-15b.211.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" speakername="David Howarth" colnum="211"  time="011:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070515/halltext/70515h0005.htm#07051560000518">
	<p pid="b.211.1/1">Yes, on those two points, certainly I welcome the money offered by the Government to universities to encourage fundraising. There are limitations on it and difficulties with the amount offered, but the principle is none the less a good one: higher education institutions should be looking for as much independence as possible, and financial independence is one of the foundations of academic freedom. It is often said that the older institutions have more opportunity to fundraise on that basis than new ones, but experience in the United States, to which the hon. Member for Wrexham referred, shows that even quite new state universities can raise a lot of money from the private sector in that way.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.1/2">On the o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">ther point that the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> mentioned about employers effectively paying off the debts of those they recruit, that is one way in which employers can contribute, but of course it is voluntary: some do it, but others do not. There is a problem with free-riding by some employers. Furthermore, in America&mdash;part of my education was at a law school in the United States&mdash;I noticed that that was one of the ways in which the very well-off commercial law firms in New York and Wall street attracted bright students to their firms, as opposed to their going into perhaps more socially useful areas of the law. The number of my contemporaries who went into New York legal aid was, I think, one, and the number of my contemporaries who went into very large commercial firms in New York was very large. That is part of the problem with doing things in that way.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.1/3">My main reason for speaking today, though, is to put a particular point to the Minister, to which I hope he will respond. Much of the debate on fees has been about the financial attractions or otherwise of taking a university course. As an academic, my point of view is probably slightly different from that of most people, in that for me, the most important thing about university is the content of the course and the effects of higher education more broadly on our culture. There is evidence, for example, that people who go through university courses tend to be more tolerant and liberal in their outlook, which I think is a very important aspect of our education.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.1/4">Nevertheless, the question of the financial return to the student from taking a higher education course is important. I want to bring the Minister back to his comment in a debate in the main Chamber not so long ago that, on average, the financial benefit for students of taking a degree, over and above what they would obtain on the basis of A-levels, was about &pound;100,000. Does that figure take into account taxation and the amount of income forgone by a full-time student on a three-year course? I ask that because those amounts can be quite considerable.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.1/5">There are estimates that the amount of tax that someone would pay on an extra lifetime income of &pound;100,000 would be about &pound;42,000. Turning to the income forgone, let us say that someone worked for, say,30 weeks a year extra by not taking a course and they worked full-time at about minimum wage level. On those figures, a student would lose, over the period of a three-year degree, some &pound;20,000. Obviously, that figure would be much higher if the alternative employment was more lucrative, as it probably would be.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.1/6">Let us consider how much per year a student will gain over a 40-year working lifetime and how much they lose by not working for the three years of the course&mdash;they never get that back, and in effect they lose the interest that they could have earned by putting the money in the bank. If we also take into account the tax, the overall calculation as to whether it is worth while, purely in financial terms&mdash;for me, that would not be the most important factor&mdash;for a student to take on a university course turns out to be very close. Indeed, it is so close that the question whether there are fees, and especially whether there are &pound;3,000 fees, would make a difference to a large number of students.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.1/7">I ask the Minister to consider that, because if the calculation is correct, we will see a shift in the student population away from students who are from what one might call risk-averse backgrounds. People who are not sure what the rewards will be may be less confident than others that those rewards will come their way, which will discourage them from going into higher education. Perhaps just as important, there will be a shifting of students on to courses on which they think they will get a higher financial return than the present average.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.1/8">That might be part of what the Government intend to achieve through their higher education policy, but we need to consider whether it is right to encourage students to think about lucrative careers&mdash;in the City, perhaps&mdash;and to think less about less lucrative careers, which might be highly socially useful, such as careers in social work or in teaching. For me, the crux of the argument about fees is what we are trying to get students to do and whether we think that the only plausible incentive to give people who go into higher education is financial. If it is financial, will it work and what effects will it have?</p>
	<p pid="b.211.1/9">My final point about the fees system applies also to the proposal made by the hon. Member for Wrexham when he talked about a graduate tax; it is a problem with that system as well. If it is true, which I think it is, that higher education is desirable for the whole of society&mdash;it is something that we want to see more of&mdash;does it make sense to tax it? Increasingly in the debate about green taxes or environmental taxes, for example, it is accepted broadly across the political spectrum that taxation should be used as far as possible to discourage activity or behaviour that we disapprove of and to encourage behaviour that we do approve of. If that applies to higher education, what we are doing now is completely wrong.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-15b.213.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" speakername="Stephen Williams" colnum="213"  time="011:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070515/halltext/70515h0005.htm#07051560000519">
	<p pid="b.213.0/1">I was not expecting to speak so soon: I thought that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> might be about to speak, so that we would have an Oxbridge contribution across the Floor of the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1947" name="Ian Lucas">the hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas)</phrase> on securing the debate. I listened with interest to his description of North East Wales institute of higher education. He may not know that I come from south-east Wales originally. I am sure that he has followed the fortunes of what was in my day Caerleon institute of higher education, which has become the university of Wales, Newport. Newport has become a city; perhaps Wrexham will go along the same path in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/3">I also had some empathy with what the hon. Gentleman said about Airbus. From the point of view of my own constituency across the border in Bristol, Airbus is crucial to the west country economy as well as to the economy of north-east Wales and Cheshire, and co-operation between higher education institutions and industry is vital in that area.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/4">Going back 20 years, I was a cross-border student myself, but it was a rather simple thing for me to decide to go from a south Wales valleys comprehensive school to an English university. There was no difference at all for me between doing that, going to Scotland or going to Cardiff or Swansea, which were my two nearest home institutions. Now, of course, students face a considerably more complicated application procedure and have financial choices to weigh up. The Campaign for Mainstream Universities has sent through a most useful briefing, to which I think the hon. Member for Wrexham would also have had access, which says that there are seven scenarios as to whether someone is an English, Welsh, Scottish or Northern Ireland student, depending on where they apply. Universities UK has also sent a very useful summary, which sets out the financial difference that students now face.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/5">Let us take the example of students who originate from Wales or are going to study in Wales. A Welsh-domiciled student studying in Wales will receive from the Welsh Assembly Government &pound;1,845 towards their &pound;3,000 tuition fee, whereas someone going from Wales to study in an English university, as I did20 years ago, will not receive that support: they will have to pay the full &pound;3,000, albeit on a deferred basis under the new arrangement. A Welsh student from my background will now have to weigh that up.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/6">An English student studying in Wales is subject to exactly the same regime as if they were studying in an English university. Someone who is from Wales but studying in Scotland has a completely different arrangement, and a Scottish student studying in Wales has a completely different arrangement as well. I will not go into the arrangements in Northern Ireland, because that would complicate things even further.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/7">As someone who believes profoundly in devolution, I suspect from what the hon. Member for Wrexham said that I have rather more enthusiasm for it than he has. Indeed, my first political act as a schoolboy in the late 1970s was to deliver leaflets for the yes campaign in the dying days of the Callaghan Labour Government, so I have a long-term interest in devolution, and some of the things that he described and that I am summarising are an inevitable consequence of the devolved arrangements. I am sure that those complexities will evolve even more. If we believe in devolution, we cannot complain too much about that, because just as is the case for different health treatments on different sides of the English and Welsh border, or for bus travel and all the other anomalies that have sprung up since devolution, it is a natural consequence. For a 17 or 18-year-old in school who is contemplating where to study, the state none the less has a role in ensuring that they have access to the best advice and information, so that they can make an informed choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/8">The hon. Member for Wrexham alluded to the funding gap between Welsh and English universities as institutions. Again, I can express concern about that as my party's spokesman on higher education in England, but it is for the Welsh Assembly Government to decide how to spend the block grant that it receives from the UK Treasury, and the choices that it makes in the Cardiff Welsh Assembly are fundamentally a matter for politicians there. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should influence his Labour colleagues in Wales&mdash;if they are still in government&mdash;to invest rather more in higher education than they have over the past eight years of devolution.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/9">At many events in this place, I have anecdotal conversations with Welsh vice-chancellors and principals, and many of them have told me that the Welsh Assembly Government are not giving higher education in Wales due attention. Historically speaking, that is rather peculiar, because investment and belief in education have always been fundamental in Wales, and there has always been enthusiasm for investment in education. I did a history degree at Bristol university, and my dissertation was partly about the foundation of the university of Wales and the Welsh people's huge enthusiasm for providing the initial funds to set up Aberystwyth, Bangor and Cardiff. It is a pity that that enthusiasm is perhaps no longer felt with enough fervour by politicians in Cardiff.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-15b.232.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="232"  time="012:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070515/halltext/70515h0008.htm#07051560000546">
	<p pid="b.232.0/1">It is always a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Taylor. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate. It is perhaps important that we as parliamentarians occasionally bring individual real-life stories to this surreal world of ours. I congratulate him on bringing to our attention some of those cases, which I shall deal with, as much as I can directly, in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/2">I am also delighted that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1717" name="Siobhain McDonagh">my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh)</phrase> has joined us in this debate. She more than anybody has been passionate in her support for St. Helier hospital and in making the case, privately and publicly, for the site to remain a district general hospital, serving the local community. There has been a tremendous all-party commitment to that campaign, which we welcome, although it is interesting to note that no Conservative Members at all, either Front Benchers or Back Benchers, have been present during this debate. I do not quite know what that says about their interest in the health service or some of the issues locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/3">The hon. Gentleman recently brought Mrs. Donoghue, one of his constituents, and the organisation Headway to see me, to talk about the impact of her husband's condition on her and her family's life. She is a remarkable woman, of tremendous courage and insight, and she gave a most powerful presentation. The hon. Gentleman will be pleased to know that we are having a summit tomorrow on the specific issue of long-term neurological conditions. As promised, we will begin that summit with a presentation on Mr. Donoghue's case given by Jean Donoghue. Talking about the real-life impact that those debilitating and challenging conditions can have on people is an innovative and important way to begin such a meeting, so I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity of meeting Mrs. Donoghue. We shall be using her and her husband's personal experience tomorrow to influence, I hope, the development of some of our policy on neurological conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/4">The hon. Gentleman referred to two cases: that of Mr. Leonard Kent and that of Mr. Douglas. The first thing that I would say, through the hon. Gentleman, to the families of those individuals is that we cannot underestimate the reality, which they have articulated, of their experiences of the health care that they have received. It is important to send them the clear message today that not only do we have empathy and sympathy with their experiences, but we redouble our efforts to ensure that every day we minimise the number of people who have a negative experience of the national health service. We would never want to belittle or devalue the experiences that people have had. I should like in particular to extend my condolences to the family of Mr. Douglas, who tragically passed away, having, from his family's point of view, not received the kind of care that they would have wanted and had a right to expect.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/5">It is also important to say, however, that the vast majority of people, when asked about their experiences of acute national health service care, speak about it incredibly positively, whether at St. Helier or in different national health service organisations up and down the country. There is a great disparity between the way the NHS is reported and people's general or abstract sense of optimism about the state of the NHS, as well as the real-life experiences of those who access NHS services day in, day out.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/6">It is important to make that point, and not only for political reasons&mdash;clearly the Government are very proud of the additional investment, nearly tripled by next year, that has been put into the NHS. We are also proud of the fact that by the end of 2008 we shall have achieved the historic target of a maximum wait of18 weeks from the point a patient visits their GP to reaching the door of the operating theatre, for the vast majority of conditions. That is a remarkable storyfor waiting times in the NHS, compared with 10, 15 or 20 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/7">It is important to make the point that the extra investment has made a difference and that waiting times are coming down. However, the point is also important for the morale of the people who work on the front line of the service&mdash;the doctors, the nurses, the support staff and the ancillary staff. On the whole they do a tremendous job, not always in the easiest circumstances, to ensure that patients and their families get access to the highest-quality treatment. However, health services are about not only treatment but emotional support and understanding what emotional impact a serious illness can have on a patient and their family. On the whole, those health care professionals are still passionate and idealistic about working in the national health service and still, by and large, do their best to be as professional as possible. In debates such as this we must always pay tribute to those front-line workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/8">However, we must also make it clear that dignity and respect in how we treat patients, particularly older people, have to be at the heart of the health care that we provide. About a year ago, not long into this job, I launched a national campaign to place dignity and respect at the heart of services for older people&mdash;whether delivered in hospitals or nursing and residential care settings, or as part of day care services or of the support that people receive at home. We launched the campaign because people and their families told us time and again about some of their unsatisfactory experiences. Those were not so much to do with surgery or medical attention, but were about the sense that becoming a patient should not mean ceasing to be a human being. When we become more frail and dependent and lose control of many elements of our personal needs, perhaps for the first time, we want to hang on to our dignity and respect more than ever. It is crucial that the health care system&mdash;indeed, the social care system&mdash;should place dignity and respect at the heart of everything that they do.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> mentioned the experiences of the Sutton Association for the Blind and his constituent Mr. Bedford. I say to Mr. Bedford's family that obviously I regret some of the experiences that they appear to have had. It is not for me to make judgments; there is a formal and proper complaints process that families and patients have the right to use. However, I obviously regret that Mr. Bedford and his family feel that they were let down.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/10">The Sutton Association for the Blind raises issues that are right at the heart of our national dignity and respect campaign. First, at a basic level, if somebody does not eat properly when they have a health problem, that will undermine their capacity to recover and will affect their general well-being. Too often, we hear from patients and relatives stories of food being left in places clearly inaccessible to the person who wants to eat. The direct impact will be that the person will not have the balanced, nutritious diet that they require and that will have a direct impact on their health care. A major part of our dignity and respect campaign is the question of nutrition. Often an assumption is made that somebody's deterioration is due to their condition, when it may well be because they are not getting the balanced and appropriate diet that they require.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">There are other factors. My hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, the Minister with responsibility for public health, may not thank me for saying this on the record, but if an older person of85 or 90 is used to eating steak and kidney pudding, trying to persuade them to eat salads regularly is a little pointless. There is also the question of appropriate food, listening to people's definitions of a balanced diet and offering them a choice so that the food is as attractive as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/12">There are also cultural and faith-based sensitivities about food. That applies particularly to older people. For most of their lives, they have been in control, have made choices, and have been proud of their independence and clear about what they want. Suddenly, because of a health issue, they find themselves dependent on others in a way that they would not have chosen. Even in such circumstances, it is crucial that we respect their right to retain maximum control.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-15b.236.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1978" speakername="Gavin Strang" colnum="236"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070515/halltext/70515h0009.htm#07051560000553">
	<p pid="b.236.1/1">We are all aware of the tragedy of HIV/AIDS and the impact of that pandemic throughout the world. The damage being done is particularly serious in a number of developing countries. We are looking forward to the launch of the Government's consultation on a new strategy for HIV/AIDS later this week. The Minister will not be able to anticipate the content of that document, but I hope that he will see the debate as an opportunity to set out the Government's assessment of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/2">Some 40 million people now live with HIV. Last year alone, 3 million people died of AIDS and more than 4 million were newly infected. Two thirds of people with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa and three quarters of all AIDS deaths occur in that region. In recent years, the most dramatic increases in the spread of HIV have been elsewhere. In east Asia, the number of people living with HIV rose by 17 per cent. in the last three years. In eastern Europe and central Asia, the number of new infections rose by almost 70 per cent. in the last two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/3">HIV/AIDS in the developing world is predominantly a young person's disease. The leading causes of death in the UK tend to affect people as they get older; HIV/AIDS tends to strike young people. Life expectancies in many countries have plummeted and many of the people killed by AIDS are at an age when they would contribute most to the development of the country that they live in. So it is that in many developing countries, HIV/AIDS corrodes the economies, the services and the infrastructure. Vital sectors&mdash;health, education and agriculture&mdash;are put under intolerable strain as the work force are removed by AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/4">The world has responded to the pandemic, but slowly. The $10 billion estimated to be available for HIV in low and middle-income countries this year is a significant increase on the $8.9 billion provided last year. However, that $10 billion is just over half of what is needed. Estimates of global resource needs for this year stand at $18 billion, and $22 billion will be needed next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/5">One landmark development in the effort to combat HIV/AIDS has been the establishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which has approved a total of $7 billion for more than450 grants in 136 countries. A report on the first five years of the work of the global fund was published in February, and the fund has made a good start.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/6">The focus has rightly been on expanding access to treatment. Until a few years ago, to become infected with HIV was in practice a death sentence. The question was not whether one would die of an AIDS-related condition, but when. That is no longer the case thanks to the development of antiretroviral drugs. With access to proper treatment and care, people with HIV can now live fairly normal lives. However, millions of people have died of AIDS despite the emergence of antiretroviral treatment because those drugs have been unavailable to much of the developing world.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/7">In recent years, the international community has accepted the principle of universal access: as far as possible, everybody who needs antiretroviral drugs should receive them. Under the presidency of the UK in 2005, the G8 agreed the aim of universal access by 2010, which was taken up in the political declaration by the world's Governments at the UN last June.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/8">There have been improvements in access to antiretroviral drugs. UNAIDS&mdash;the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS&mdash;estimates that since 2002, some 2 million life years have been gained through expanded access to antiretroviral treatment. In December 2006, the number of people on treatment in low and middle-income countries was 54 per cent. higher than in the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/9">Treatment still reaches only a small proportion of the people in need. The World Health Organisation estimates that just over a quarter of people in low and middle-income countries who need treatment receive it. There is a particular problem with children. Despitea 50 per cent. increase in the number of children receiving treatment in the past year, still only 15 per cent. of those in need get access to HIV treatment. The World Health Organisation and UNAIDS have called for urgent action to develop appropriate diagnostics and paediatric drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/10">A report published last month by the World Health Organisation, UNAIDS and UNICEF made it clear that universal access by 2010 will require a steep increase in the number of people who receive treatment each year. The UN Secretary-General has reported that many countries are struggling to scale up their work sufficiently to be on course for the 2010 commitment. If we continue at this pace, the UN estimates that less than half of those in urgent need of treatment will receive it by 2010. My hon. Friend the Minister will be aware of the campaign calling for a G8 funding plan to be put in place to achieve universal access, and I would be grateful for his thoughts on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/11">Will my hon. Friend set out what is being done to enable developing countries to find their way through the legal complexities of TRIPS&mdash;the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property? There are particular concerns about access to newer drugs, including second and third-line treatments. Since 2003, the price of most first-line antiretroviral treatments has decreased by at least 50 per cent. in low and middle-income countries. However, the World Health Organisation has found that the prices paid for second-line treatment tend to be unaffordably high in countries that lack generic alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/12">In the years to come, more people will need access to second and third-line therapies as the first-line treatments will cease to be effective. UNITAID, the international drug purchasing facility of which the UK Government is a sponsor, is working to lower prices of second-line medicines and I was pleased to see the price reductions that the Clinton Foundation was able to announce last week. However, as patenting restrictions are tighter on newer drugs, a lot needs to be done before we can expect to see adequate reductions for second and third-line treatments.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/13">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-30">30 August 2003</phrase>, a decision was taken with the aim of allowing certain countries to import generic drugs. However, my hon. Friend is probably aware of the conclusions of M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res that the mechanism is unworkable. The Government have made clear their support for the right of developing countries to use TRIPS flexibilities to ensure affordable access to drugs, including the use of compulsory licensing provisions. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and his G8 counterparts agreed at their meeting in March that more needs to be done to help to lower the cost of some drugs</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/14" class="indent">&quot;including the use of TRIPS flexibilities to the fullest extent&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/15">My hon. Friend will be well aware of the calls from non-governmental organisations in the field for the G8 urgently to review the effectiveness of the TRIPS flexibilities and to identify and resolve all obstacles to their use. I would be most grateful for his perspective on the progress that has been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/16">Perhaps my hon. Friend can also take the opportunity to update us on the new independent advisory body that was announced by his Department last month to help get more drugs to the world's poorest people. The Secretary of State has also expressed an interest in patent pooling, and I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would tell me the Government's thinking on that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/17">In order for antiretroviral treatment to be successful there must be a medical infrastructure in the country that ensures that people have regular access to their medication, and are properly instructed and supported in adhering to their regime. The UN Secretary-General has remarked that we must move from an emergency footing to a longer-term effort, laying the groundwork for sustainable progress and strengthening health and social service systems. Far greater investment is required in the infrastructure of health systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/18">When we talk about getting drugs to people, there is a tendency to assume that Governments and Government services alone can deliver, but in many countries projects run by employers or the voluntary sector are equally important. Professor Richard Feachem, the previous executive director of the global fund, and the Secretary of State himself have singled out faith groups as being particularly important because of the work that they do in that area.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/19">It is right that we focus tremendous effort on expanding access to treatment. It is a matter of international shame that so many have died and continue to die of a treatable disease. At the same time, we must dramatically step up our efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. Work on a vaccine continues, and it seems that every few years we are told that a vaccine is 10 years away. I know that that work is supported by the UK Government. A vaccine would of course be a huge breakthrough, but in the meantime we need to improve prevention efforts dramatically. If we do not, meeting the commitments to universal access to treatment will be well-nigh impossible.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/20">The rate of new infections far outstrips the expansion of HIV treatment. While 700,000 additional people got on to treatment last year, 4 million became infected with HIV. Treatment and prevention services must be scaled up in parallel. The World Health Organisation has called urgently for far more effective outreach work with at-risk populations and for prevention work to be done with people living with HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/21">UNAIDS has identified three main problems with the current prevention effort: insufficient funding, inadequate access for populations with higher rates and risks of infection, and a lack of action against the social, economic and cultural factors that drive the spread of HIV, such as stigma, poverty and gender inequality. Access to prevention services for at-risk populations in low and middle-income countries remains generally very low. In 2005 it was less than 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/22">Still only about 11 per cent. of pregnant women with HIV are given treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission. That is a particularly depressing statistic when one bears in mind the fact that the treatment available for pregnant women with HIV is so effective that it virtually eliminates the possibility of the child being born with HIV. I presume that it is very different if no treatment is provided. I would have thought that most reasonable people would see it as a priority to get a lot more pregnant women on the treatment so that their children are not born HIV-positive. Just last year my hon. Friend's Department cited an estimate thata comprehensive HIV prevention package costing $4.2 billion annually could avert 29 million of the 45 million new infections expected by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/23">I cannot end my consideration of prevention work without mention of a recent development relating to male circumcision. As colleagues may well be aware, the World Health Organisation and UNAIDS have stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/24" class="indent">&quot;Male circumcision services should be recognized as an important intervention to reduce the risk of HIV infection&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/25">That followed clinical trial data that demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection among circumcised men.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/26">This summer marks the halfway point in the work to achieve the millennium development goals. As one of those goals, the international community made a commitment to have halted and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. A massively increased prevention programme is required if we are to meet that commitment. We must also consider the important role that diagnostic testing must play, as the availability of testing is vital for progress in prevention and access to treatment. The global coverage of HIV testing and counselling remains low. Available information is limited, but surveys done in a small number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa indicate that at most one quarter of people living with HIV were aware of their status. Late diagnosis not only impedes prevention work that can be done with people living with HIV but means that treatment for an individual is less likely to be successful.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/27">The Government are playing an important role in the councils of the world. They have ensured that HIV/AIDS is on the agenda at the UN, the EU and the G8. They are also putting their money where their mouths are by increasing the amount that Britain spends on overseas aid. Will my hon. Friend give us his view of the prospects for progress at the G8? The Finance Ministers meet this Friday and the G8 summit is just more than three weeks away. I am sure that we all hope for progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.236.1/28">I am pleased that we have had the opportunity to have this debate in the week when my hon. Friend the Minister will be launching a consultation on a new strategy along with the interim evaluation of the current strategy. I look forward to hearing his comments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-15b.240.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development"  colnum="240"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070515/halltext/70515h0009.htm#07051560000554">
	<p pid="b.240.0/1">I begin by saying, and particularly this time genuinely meaning, that I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1978" name="Gavin Strang">my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang)</phrase> for persuading Mr. Speaker to allow us to debate this topic. As he said, the debate is timely, not least because of the launch on Thursday of a consultation on how we can step up our work on HIV/AIDS as a country and particularly as a Department, but also because we are a matter of weeks away from the G8. There will be considerable international attention on what else the G8 can do to focus attention on the terrifying growth in the incidence of HIV/AIDS across the world. I shall not repeat the statistics that he rightly reminded the House of.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/2">My right hon. Friend ended his comments by drawing attention to the lead that the Government have taken on HIV and AIDS. It is perhaps worth noting that, in 2005, when we held the G8 and EU presidencies, we took the opportunity to use them to secure important commitments to universal access to HIV treatment and prevention. As he and the House will know, through the UN General Assembly we managed to secure a commitment to a broader definition of universal access, including prevention, treatment, care and support. I know that he supports that.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/3">A year earlier, in July 2004, we attempted to prepare the ground for such a discussion at the UN by setting out an ambitious and, I hope the House will agree, progressive UK policy on tackling AIDS in the developing world in the document that we published called &quot;Taking Action&quot;. We shall have a chance to discuss on Thursday a review of that document and an assessment of where we have got to in implementing the commitments that we made in it. It set, for the first time, a spending target for funding through my Department of some &pound;1.5 billion to support our response to AIDS, making us the world's second largest bilateral donor. It took a strong stance on the importance of meeting the needs of vulnerable groups, including by committing to spend some &pound;150 million on support for children affected by AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/4">My right hon. Friend rightly sought to remind the UK and the international community of the need to follow through on the commitments made at that G8 summit and the UN millennium review summit. That is why we have sought to do our part by commissioning an independent interim evaluation of the &quot;Taking Action&quot; document to enable us to assess our performance at the midway point in the drive to make progress towards universal access, and to enable us to take any corrective action needed. Again, Thursday will offer the opportunity to review in more detail where we have got to.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/5">It is also why we pushed to set ambitious targets in-country, led by the developing countries themselves, including interim targets for 2008, in the UN General Assembly's political declaration on AIDS in June 2006 to help us to review progress towards the goal of universal access. It is also why we pressed the G8 at St. Petersburg&mdash;and will press again at the summit in just a matter of weeks&mdash;to report against the AIDS commitments that were made at Gleneagles.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/6">On progress, it is clear from the UN and from civil society reports that there are areas where the AIDS response has progressed. We can be proud of that response, but it is also true, as my right hon. Friend said, that there is a considerable amount that we still need to do if we want to achieve our ambition of an AIDS-free generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/7">On treatment, there have been huge increases in the number of people taking antiretroviral drugs, as my right hon. Friend said. According to UNAIDS, the World Health Organisation and UNICEF, more than 2 million people were receiving treatment at the end of 2006, a 54 per cent. increase in just one year. Of that number, more than 1.3 million people in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving treatment in December 2006, compared with just 100,000 in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/8">However, the sad truth of those impressive statistics is that only 28 per cent. of those who need treatment actually have access to the drugs that they need. We must do more to boost access to treatment and diagnostics, in particular for children. We must take steps to reduce the cost of second-line AIDS drugs, which, as my right hon. Friend clearly knows, can cost as much as 10 times more than other treatments, and we must take more steps to tackle the stigma and discrimination that block people's access to services, including treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/9">I am delighted that the UK played its part in tackling those issues by helping to set up UNITAID, the new international drug purchase facility. It has already approved, among other things, programmes of nearly $62 million for treatments for children and nearly $70 million for those second-line therapies that cost so much.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/10">This week, UNITAID and the Clinton Foundation announced a major cut in the price of 16 AIDS treatments that will be available to 66 developing countries. That clearly is positive progress and an endorsement of the approach that mechanisms such as UNITAID allow. I am pleased, and I hope that my right hon. Friend is as well, that through the Medicines Transparency Alliance we can begin to tackle some of the fraud and other inefficiencies that can on occasion lead to a 300 per cent. mark-up in the price of medicines in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/11">My right hon. Friend drew attention to funding, and rightly said that we need to do more to ensure that the necessary resources are available to finance universal access. He said that an estimated $10 billion will be available in 2007 for HIV-related programmes in low and middle-income countries. As he said, that is a huge increase, but, as he also said, it is just over half of the $18 billion that UNAIDS estimates is needed in 2007, so the international community needs to do more work together to meet that funding gap.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/12">We are committed to playing our part, not least through the Global Fund. I take this opportunity to put on the record my appreciation of the considerable effort made by Richard Feachem, the first head of the fund, and of the excellent job that he has done. We have pledged some &pound;359 million to date to support the fund, making us the fifth largest donor, and we recently supported the decision to triple the size of the fund so that it has the potential to reach $6 billion to $8 billion in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/13">I touched on UNITAID. We pledged some $20 million for UNITAID as part of a 20-year commitment potentially increasing to some $60 million by 2010, subject to the performance of the organisation. We also pushed hard at the UN General Assembly in June to ensure that the international community in general made a commitment that no credible, costed national AIDS plan should go unfunded. That important commitment should play a central role in helping to get all donors working on the goal of achieving universal access in each developing country.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/14">The AIDS response must support and strengthen health systems&mdash;we must not undermine them. In short, that is the only way to achieve universal access and better all-round health outcomes. We must do more collectively to strengthen health systems, not least because of the need to address the global shortage of 4.3 million health care workers, as estimated by the Global Health Workforce Alliance. People are not likely to stay on antiretroviral drugs without health care workers to support them as they take the drugs, and, potentially, the virus could become more resistant to drugs. I have no doubt that that issue will be of particular importance in the discussions that will take place at the G8 coming soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/15">The UK is playing its part on that issue. In Malawi, for example, we are helping with a &pound;100 million emergency programme over six years that seeks to double the number of nurses and to treble the number of doctors. The programme helps to do that by increasing salaries by some 50 per cent. We are considering options to extend that approach to other countries, and we are seeking to have discussions with other donors about how we can better pool our funding to make that happen more effectively in developing countries. I personally have had discussions with key people in the US Government about how we could do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/16">My right hon. Friend touched on the importance of prevention. We are supporting ongoing research to develop new microbicides, which potentially offer the most appropriate technology most quickly to help women to protect themselves from HIV infection. We continue to put money into the international AIDS vaccines initiative to help to make progress there.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/17">I know that my right hon. Friend shares our concerns about stigma and discrimination. I hope that he will be able to attend the launch tonight with England and West Indies cricketers of a stigma unit to promote our work in the Caribbean, which has the second fastest rising epidemic rates in the world. Discrimination is the single biggest blockage to making progress on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/18">My right hon. Friend also asked about our position on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. We remain a strong supporter of the right of developing countries, including Thailand and Brazil, to implement the TRIPS agreement, as is appropriate for their circumstances. We understand the concerns of M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res and several others about the complexity of the agreement, which is why we are working in Kenya and Botswana to fund legal research and assistance that will help those countries to implement the flexibilities that are available under the TRIPS process.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/19">We initiated an access to medicines conference just a matter of weeks ago because of concerns about TRIPS, about whether enough diagnostics are available, about whether we need new treatments and about how tocut through some of the other blockages to making drugs available to fight HIV/AIDS. The conference brought together experts in health systems and drug programmes from developing countries, people from the non-governmental organisation world, international pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. From those who came to that meeting, we are seeking to establish a small group to work with us, on a continuing basis, on the key blockages internationally to making progress on delivering more HIV/AIDS drugs and more drugs to help to fight other developing-country diseases.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/20">I am grateful for the considerable effort that was put in by the many different stakeholders who turned up at the conference. As my right hon. Friend will know, access to medicines is often a politically contentious issue, but the constructive nature of the dialogue at that conference offers hope that we will be able to make faster progress. I know that he will be pleased in particular by the announcement by UNITAID and the Clinton Foundation.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/21">Again, I welcome the opportunity for this debate. It is timely, with the G8 approaching so soon, with our launch on Thursday of a consultation on what we can do next about HIV/AIDS and with the launch of the stigma unit tonight. My right hon. Friend takes a considerable interest in the issue and has done so for a long time. I hope that he will continue to pursue that interest and to put pressure on us to do more.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-15b.244.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="244"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070515/halltext/70515h0010.htm#07051560000555">
	<p pid="b.244.1/1">I am delighted to have secured a debate on local health funding after having the good fortune to initiate a debate on midwifery and maternity services only a fortnight ago, to which the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase> responded. I am pleased to see that the Minister of State will be responding to this debate. I will consider the Government's national policy and the way in which it affects local health funding, considering the local circumstances in my area&mdash;Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly&mdash;and, as I am sure the Minister expects, I will look constructively at potential solutions to local problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/2">I have always welcomed, strongly supported and voted for investment in the NHS. I appreciate that the Government were fearful that some of the money would go into a black hole and that they have therefore engaged in a number of reforms, but I fear that the Government have created some black holes of their own, particularly regarding the pursuit of the so-called choice agenda. Sadly, I believe that that agenda has swallowed up billions of pounds in IT systems and bureaucracy. Choice is desirable, but for many people it is a luxury to be considered after basic services are in place and are sure to be intact.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/3">The theme of my speech is that I am worried about a lot of the changes to the NHS. I have seen some of the proposals for health reform and they seem to be promoted by PowerPoint-wielding management consultants who have too much say in how services are run. Instead, we should concentrate on running front-line services properly and effectively. Those are the issues that I want to consider.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/4">When considering the national policy context, the Minister may wish to look at the British Medical Association document that was published last week, &quot;A rational way forward for the NHS&quot;. It puts the issue in context and provides some good, helpful and constructive comments, on which I am sure the Department has reflected. At the BMA conference in 2006, alarm was expressed at the incoherence of Government NHS policies. The letter that was attached to the BMA document and was circulated to MPs&mdash;I am sure it was also sent to the Government&mdash;states:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Thanks to the government's injection of funds and the hard work of NHS staff, patients have seen considerable improvements in the health service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/6">The letter goes on to state:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/7" class="indent">&quot;However, there has been a failure to engage either the public or health professionals in the early stages of policy developments which undermine the long-term future of the NHS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/8">The BMA document states:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Progress...is under threat due to a constant wave of poorly integrated initiatives from the centre&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/10">and:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The NHS is suffering from reorganisation fatigue&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/12">I am sure that those are themes that the Minister has heard many times before from critics of the system. Indeed, at the weekend, the former Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, said on &quot;The World This Weekend&quot; on Radio 4:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/13" class="indent">&quot;We started losing advantage when we started saying choice was the great thing and that the choice that people want is the choice between 5 competing hospitals. Every bit of polling evidence and common sense suggests that that's not the case. The first choice for most people is that the hospital down the road will do a first class job for them and do it promptly. That should've been the Government's task. It started going wrong there.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/14">I agree with that.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/15">If the Government want to offer choice, in my area the choice of an NHS dentist would be nice. Those who get the opportunity of once in a while joining an NHS dentist seem to have that opportunity for only a short time before being presented with the ultimate choice of staying with the practice and going private or having no dentist at all. Sadly, that is the type of choice offered to the patient&mdash;the consumers&mdash;on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/16">The national programme for IT underpins the choice agenda and the &quot;choose and book&quot; system, which has been re-branded &quot;connecting for health&quot;. The system is immensely expensive, and the <i>BMA News </i>of <phrase class="date" code="">27 May</phrase> last year states:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/17" class="indent">&quot;Connecting for health management has now admitted that it will cost at least &pound;15 billion and final figures in excess of &pound;30 billion have not convincingly been denied.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/18">Perhaps the Minister will reflect on that. I have asked many parliamentary questions about the cost of the &quot;choose and book&quot; system and the nature of its assessment and costs locally. In March, I received an answer to a written question that I had asked about what measures the Secretary of State had put in place to assess the change in the overall administrative burden of the &quot;choose and book&quot; system. The answer provided was:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/19" class="indent">&quot;None. The choose and book system should reduce the overall administrative burden of managing referrals.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-12">12 March 2007</phrase>; Vol. 458, c. 142W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/20">Yet we know that because of the creation of private sector contracts, which primary care trusts were forced into, the Government has had to encourage PCTs to establish referral management centres to intervene in the referral process. That has added a further administrative and cost burden, which has not been part of or factored into the overall budget of the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/21">Indeed, the movement towards a greater emphasis on the private sector has concerned many people. The BMA document that I referred to earlier, which was published last week, states:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/22" class="indent">&quot;There is no evidence that the private sector offers improved services or better value for money than the NHS&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/23">and that the role of the private sector is to</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/24" class="indent">&quot;support the NHS rather than supplant it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/25">I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson)</phrase> has been assiduous on that matter, particularly regarding the movement of a contract to a private sector hospital in his area in Bodmin. He shares my concern about that issue and I have asked parliamentary questions on the nature of the contracts and the basis on which PCTs were forced into them. In particular, I asked about the widely understood target of contracting 15 per cent. of all elective procedures, and in an answer that I received last July, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/26" class="indent">&quot;The figure of 15 per cent. is not a target but a level of service that the independent sector might be providing by 2008.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-18">18 July 2006</phrase>; Vol. 458, c. 381W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/27">On the same day, in answer to another question, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Bury, South, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/28" class="indent">&quot;Individual contracts' performances are monitored to ensure facilities are utilised.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-18">18 July 2006</phrase>; Vol. 458,c. 376W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/29">On the same day, in the very next column, the same Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/30" class="indent">&quot;Capio and national health service sponsors are working to ensure that the full value of activity is delivered over the contract period.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/31">I have also asked Ministers questions about the extent to which the Government are ensuring that contracts would add value to services locally, rather than denude funding from the local community.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/32">In February, the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, said in answer to a question in the Chamber:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/33" class="indent">&quot;I am pleased to say that the Plymouth and Bodmin treatment centres are on target for up to 100 per cent. capacity.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-06">6 February 2007</phrase>; Vol. 456, c. 703.]</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/34">Freedom of information figures showed, however, that the company met only 19 per cent. of its contracted activity in the first quarter up to April 2006; 45 per cent. in the six months between April and September, and only 65 per cent. in the final period to the end of March. Any yet it will be paid fully for the services that clearly are not being rendered to the local community.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/35">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March</phrase>, in a debate that we had here, I raised another point with the Minister about the impact of European competition law, which he did not address that day. Indeed, I raised subsequent questions in the House and wrote to the Secretary of State to ask what assessment the Government had made of the impact that that significant move in trend will have on increasing the amount of work contracted through the private sector, and whether it will open a Pandora's box. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-05">5 April</phrase>, in reply to a letter that I had written her, the Secretary of State for Health stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/36" class="indent">&quot;National Health Service bodies have generally fallen outside the scope of EU competition rules&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/37">Generally that might be the case, but given the contractual and tendering processes, and the ability to alter, reconfigure or intervene, the NHS will be open to very complex challenges. In fact, the European Court is likely to deem the service a market and not a public service. I am sure that local health services will be most concerned about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/38">On the local situation, as the Minister knows, at the end of the last financial year, the Royal Cornwall Hospitals trust ended up with a deficit of &pound;45 million, and is currently one of 18 financially-challenged trusts undergoing a review. Obviously, it aims to balance its budget, but wants an agreement on how to repay the deficit. It believes that that can be done provided that it is given a reasonable time in which to repay. It is now in the second year of a three-year period, but it would be helpful to have the Minister's advice on whether it is possible to consider a five-year period in which to achieve the kind of balance that a trust such as Royal Cornwall Hospitals needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/39">I have another point to make that I really would like the Minister to address: unlike other trusts with severe deficits, for some reason, the strategic health authority, rather than the Department made the adjustment for the resource account budgeting arrangement for the Royal Cornwall Hospitals trust. As a result, it appears to have lost out significantly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-15b.247.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="247"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070515/halltext/70515h0010.htm#07051560000557">
	<p pid="b.247.1/1">I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. I was due to come on to the income that the Royal Cornwall Hospitals trust and indeed the health community in Cornwall receives. He made the point very well.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/2">I would appreciate it, however, if the Minister could answer this point: in order to help lift the burden we must address the purely administrative question of who adjusted the RAB for the Royal Cornwall Hospitals trust. If it had been the Department of Health, as in the case of many other trusts around the country, it would have been better off by a significant number of millions of pounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/3">The Minister responded to me on <phrase class="date" code="">17 July</phrase> last year regarding the market forces factor. I am sure that he would be surprised if I did not raise this issue, given that Cornwall is at the bottom of the league table for the income it will receive under that element of the funding formula. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The advisory committee on resource allocation (ACRA) is carrying out a review of the approach to calculating the staff market forces factor&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/5">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/6" class="indent">&quot;It is expected that the work will be completed by autumn this year. The publication of the findings will be considered later.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-17">17 July 2006</phrase>; Vol. 449, c. 245-46W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/7">We know that that work is completed and we are awaiting its outcome; it would be very helpful if the Minister could indicate when it is likely to be published and give us a timetable for making adjustments. Were the Royal Cornwall Hospitals trust to approach at least average funding and parity under the market forces factor, it could net at least &pound;6 million to &pound;8 million&mdash;that is just for that trust, let alone others in Cornwall and the health community generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/8">On positive proposals, I would like the Minister to consider the fact that under local government reform proposals in Cornwall we are looking closely at the possibility of bringing the health and social community far closer together. I know that the Minister would welcome that. I received a parliamentary answer that stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Local partnerships...under section 31 of the HealthAct 1999&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/10">can be used</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/11" class="indent">&quot;to deliver seamless services and develop close co-operative working.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-10">10 May 2007</phrase>; Vol. 460, c. 406W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/12">A week earlier, I was advised that powers exist for single pooled budgets to be established</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/13" class="indent">&quot;under section 75 of the NHS Act 2006 and for an application to be made to the Secretary of State to establish a care trust as permitted under section 45 of the Health and Social CareAct 2001.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-03">3 May 2007</phrase>; Vol. 459, c. 1842W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/14">We seem to have quite a bit of potentially conflicting legislation to achieve such pooled arrangements. The BMA's proposals for a new NHS framework stated that it wants a great deal more democracy introduced into the decision-making process for the future of that service. When considering bringing the two budgets together, I hope that the Minister will bear in mind the fact that health is free at the point of delivery, whereas social care is means-tested. It would be helpful to give some advice to the local community on how to ensure that those two budgets are brought together seamlessly and not fractured, which is the danger with the means-testing of certain activities but not others.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.1/15">That is particularly important with regard to, for example, the many cases in which an elderly person might end up in hospital, when really they require care at home, which cannot be provided. Providing that service in hospital might be much more expensive that providing it at home, which might also be more appropriate. I hope that the Minister will consider those elements when answering my questions.</p>
