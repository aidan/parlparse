<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-18a.353.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" speakername="Maria Miller" colnum="353"  time="014:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070118/halltext/70118h0001.htm#07011856000230">
	<p pid="a.353.0/1">I commend the Committee on its report, which highlights some very important issues. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody)</phrase> said in her opening statement, everyone has an opinion on parking. In my constituency, a great many opinions on parking are put to me on a regular basis but, all too often, the impact of Government policy on transport receives far too little attention. The work of the Committee in this area, and the others it has considered in the past few months, has done a great deal to highlight matters that have not received attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/2">Why is it important that we debate the report? In this country, 75 per cent. of households have cars, which amounts to 22 million cars. The hon. Lady said that car ownership was something that newly affluent people aspire to, but those figures suggest that it is more than just the newly affluent who aspire to a car. Increasingly, the vast majority of households have a car. In Basingstoke, more than 80 per cent. of households have a car, and a great many have more than that. The findings of the report are pertinent to the vast majority of people in this country, and it raises some important issues, about which I have received correspondence from my constituents. I have been told about problems with appeals to adjudicators, the role of local authorities and police&mdash;a dual role that causes increasing numbers of problems&mdash;and day-to-day issues, such as loading and pavement parking. The report has a particular emphasis on the enforcement of parking regulations and, as the hon. Lady has pointed out, on the issues to do with illegal parking.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/3">I was particularly pleased to see that the Committee sought a submission from the AA Motoring Trust, which is a Basingstoke-based organisation that does a great deal of good work on this subject and on other matters that relate to our roads and transport systems. In its submission, it particularly highlighted the issue of over-zealous enforcement, which is no longer peripheral but yields an income of more than &pound;1 billion a year. That is pertinent to many residents in many constituencies. The trust echoed many of the Committee's concerns about the use of draconian measures against people who park illegally and about the lack of proportion in the way in which enforcements can sometimes be put in place. I commend the trust for the work that it does on behalf of all motorists and all people who come into contact with our roads and transport networks. I share its view that there is a strong case for a thorough review of the powers of local authorities to make, administer and enforce parking regulations and that the report is a good first step in that direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/4">I want particularly to pick up on a subject that received a little less emphasis in the report, in order to highlight it to the Chairman and the Committee for future consideration. It was dealt with under the section on capacity and demand in the part of the report called &quot;Parking Accessibility&quot; and, in particular, in the paragraphs that dealt with planning policy guidance. The Committee's recommendations stated that it</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/5" class="indent">&quot;did not receive sufficient evidence to make specific recommendations&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/6">on the subject. I would have preferred to have seen that gap in the report filled. By considering planning policy guidance, we are considering how we can help people to park legally in the future rather than focusing on illegal parking.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/7">Planning policy guidance determines parking capacity, and so it is integral to the report. The Government's planning regulations clearly state the need to reduce parking in new developments, yet as the report shows car ownership is set to increase by up to 45 per cent. by 2030. The report shows clear evidence dating back as far as 1993 from the Transport Research Laboratory that</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/8" class="indent">&quot;people's determination to own cars seems to outweigh all other considerations, including the difficulty of parking.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/9">If one were to draw a conclusion from that, one might think that rationing parking as a way to control car numbers might not be a robust strategy for the Government to follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/10">We all know that there is a growing awareness of the link between emissions from vehicles and climate change and of the need to change our car-use patterns to reflect that. However, the figures that I have cited suggest that there is little evidence that that will result in a reduction in car ownership. Yes, it might result in a change in use or in car design, but not in a reduction in the number of cars that are owned.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/11">Planning regulations are perhaps not easing the situation but, if anything, exacerbating it. Although the Committee perhaps struggled to find time to take the evidence&mdash;I am sure that there were many other subjects that the report covered in depth&mdash;I want to provide a couple of examples of why the regulations should be considered further. Perhaps the Minister will pick up on that in her response. There is a perverse incentive under planning guidance for developers to cut car parking, because a higher density of development yields a higher level of profit to the developer, whether in the commercial sector or the residential sector. Planning policy guidance note 13 states:</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Car parking also takes up a large amount of space in development, is costly to business and&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/13">that reducing densities of parking in new developments is essential. That is worthy of consideration along with the report's findings.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/14">I have a couple of examples of where we need to consider revision when we consider parking policies in the future. My constituency, Basingstoke, is a growth point for the Government and an area of considerable housing development. We have experienced a number of problems with parking. A block of flats in my constituency called Crown Heights was built with no allocation of parking spaces for some of the residential units in a town where 80 per cent. of all households have a car. In another high-density housing block in Winterthur way, 484 flats were built with 12 visitor spaces&mdash;only 12 spaces, for probably nearly 800 residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/15">A broad figure of 1.5 parking spaces per household is used in my constituency yet more than 40 per cent. of households in Basingstoke have more than two cars. A great number have three or even four. That has caused immense problems in new developments with cars being parked on pavements.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-18a.355.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" speakername="Maria Miller" colnum="355"  time="014:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070118/halltext/70118h0002.htm#07011856000234">
	<p pid="a.355.3/1">I think that my hon. Friend faces in his constituency some of the issues that we face in Basingstoke. If the problem is not unique to towns that are expected to have a high level of housing development and that have high-density figures put forward, it certainly creates more problems in constituencies that are akin to ours.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/2">The problem is not confined to the residential sector but is an issue in the commercial sector. Basingstoke is ninth when it comes to jobs in the south-east, with 79,000 jobs. We are a diamond for growth; a growth point for the Government. Many companies are showing a considerable amount of growth in my constituency because it is a good place to do business. However, there are issues to consider. We have almost full employment in Basingstoke and, as a result, many people who work in our town have to travel in daily. Despite the fact that we have 79,000 jobs, we have not received a huge amount of investment in our public transport system in recent years. We have guidance in place that gives three parking spaces per 1,000 sq ft, which is in line with the Government guidance, and because of the problems that Basingstoke has with public transport, about 50 per cent. of its day-time population travel to work by car. That is exacerbated by the fact that a great number of the people who live in the rural areas surrounding my constituency work in Basingstoke, and the public transport links are insufficient for them to be able to use it as a viable alternative.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/3">The Government have made the problem worse by insisting that developers build motor cars out of new developments, in both the residential and commercial sectors, by the under-provision of parking spaces. The result in recent years, as residents and businesses know, is a dramatically worsening parking problem in places such as Basingstoke. As I said, it is causing a great deal of concern to many residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/4">So what is needed? First and foremost, investment in infrastructure should go hand in hand with development. Promised improvements, such as the new Chineham railway station, which we were promised a number of years ago but which has since been postponed, need to be put in place. That, however, is beyond the remit of our debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/5">On a more positive note, I am pleased that the Government, on page 30 of their response, say:</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/6" class="indent">&quot;The approach to planning for residential car parking provisions is...currently under review&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/7">Indeed, they continue, saying that draft guidance PPS3</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/8" class="indent">&quot;makes clear that local authorities should develop parking policies for their plan areas with local stakeholders and communities, having regard to expected car ownership for planning housing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/9">Does that change in emphasis indicate that the Government feel that their previous guidance was wrong? If so, it would be useful if my local authority, which would have to implement such things, and local residents and businesses could have that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/10">We have the opportunity to give local authorities more freedom to determine locally what is required for residential and commercial parking. As the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich said, it is important to use parking as a way of controlling traffic, but it needs to be done in a way that does not create problems, such as congestion and inappropriate parking, in other parts of our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/11">Basingstoke was built around the car&mdash;at a time, perhaps, when there was less pressure on our roads. As I said earlier, time moves on and our low level of unemployment and the high demand to live in what is a very good community mean that parking is becoming a distinct problem. I look forward to the Minister's response. One can help communities like mine to deal better with such issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/12">Finally, I touch on a slightly different issue&mdash;that of blue badges. The Committee considered their abuse in detail&mdash;and I expect that the Minister knows what I am about to say. I would have liked the report to cover other further issues, but particularly the eligibility criteria for blue badges.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/13">At present, children under the age of two with severe mobility impairments are not eligible for a blue badge. That might sound straightforward, as children of that age cannot possibly drive. However, they need to be moved around by their parents. Some suffer from the sort of illness that requires bulky medical equipment to be transported with them. My constituents Helen Grindrod and Kelli-Ann Wilkins have daughters, Mia and Jessica. They have hip dysplasia, which means that they have to wear full body casts. As a result, it is difficult to manoeuvre them in and out of cars. Not being eligible for blue badges considerably reduces the parents' ability to move not only the children but the whole family.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/14">The Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee recommended in 1999 that the rules should be changed. The Government accepted in 2002 that the rules should be changed. We should have seen some change before now; but no: four years on, and we have had no change in the rules. Yet more consultation is spoken of, but that is not good enough for Mia and Jessica, who are suffering as a result of the Government's inaction. I draw that case to the Committee's attention in the hope that it may be given consideration. I invite the Minister to fill me with joy by telling me that she will bring forward those much-needed regulations in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/15">I am grateful to have had the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Again, I commend the Committee on its report, and I hope that it judges my contribution today to have been positive and that it may consider picking up on it in future.</p>

	<p pid="a.362.0/1">I am a new member of the Transport Select Committee and I am disappointed not to have been on it earlier so that I could take part in the preparation of the report. I want to commend the Committee Chairman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1520" name="Gwyneth Dunwoody">the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody)</phrase>, on the report and to say how much I have enjoyed my first few weeks on the Committee. I congratulate the other hon. Members who have spoken in the debate, who made some extremely pertinent points.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/2">Paragraph 242 of the report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Parking management has the potential to help to enable us to manage our road system with sophistication, balancing a complex number of demands, reducing urban stresses, and mitigating congestion and the intrusion of traffic for local residents. But this vision is not yet being realised widely. In order to maximise the positive impact of parking policies and enforcement regimes on a council's transport objectives, it is essential that parking be properly planned and integrated into a comprehensive, clear, and local transport policy framework.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/4">That is the best paragraph in the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/5">The problem is that while we recognise what needs to be done, unfortunately in reality it is not being done. We have just had an excellent example from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> of the fact that we can sit in meetings and talk about the ideal, but in terms of actually living where we live and parking where we want to park, the reality does not live up to the ideal.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/6">The problem is that parking falls between too many Departmental stools and, in Kettering, the parking situation illustrates that. Kettering is a small and fairly typical town in Northamptonshire in the middle of England and it has the same typical problems as most towns of that nature. There are all sorts of different Government agencies, local authorities and other bodies involved in enforcing parking. First, there is obviously the police. However, the police have given up enforcing parking in Kettering. The two basic reasons for that are that parking enforcement is not a target set by the Home Office and they do not have the money to do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/7">Kettering has one traffic warden who works 16 hours a week. He is now largely paid for by the local borough council and if it did not do so there simply would not be a traffic warden. As an illustration that there has to be a practical approach to parking issues, instead of spending most of his time putting tickets on cars parked in the wrong place, on busy days&mdash;for example a Saturday morning&mdash;he quite rightly stands at the top of Gold street in Kettering, which is Kettering high street, and stops cars from travelling illegally down the pedestrianised area. He has to do that because of the red tape involved in trying to persuade the county council to put a barrier up to prevent cars from entering the pedestrianised area.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/8">It may be different in areas that have unitary authorities, but in Northamptonshire, like in most of England, we have a borough council and a county council. Despite the fact that we both want to achieve the same objectives, it seems very difficult to introduce a sensible traffic management system.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/9">My first point was that the police have given up, despite the fact it is their responsibility to enforce parking regulations until local parking is decriminalised.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-18a.364.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" speakername="Philip Hollobone" colnum="364"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070118/halltext/70118h0003.htm#07011856000242">
	<p pid="a.364.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely pertinent point as usual. She, like me, has young children and we are all too aware of explaining the dangers of crossing a road to them. However, when there are parked cars on either side of a road, the dangers are much greater. As the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley said, it is a real problem for disabled people when cars are not parked on the road but on the pavement, as the cars get in the way.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/2">We need to sort out planning policy guidance to make it far more relevant and practical. The Government want to try to prevent the sprawl of housing expansion and are reducing the road width so that the new housing estates can be built in a small area. I understand why the Government are doing that and that the intentions are good, but the effect will be very bad for many decades to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/3">I have mentioned the police, local authorities, the Department for Communities and Local Government. They are three stools between which parking policy is falling&mdash;another is the NHS. At Kettering general hospital there is outrage from the 3,200 staff at that magnificent facility because they are being forced to pay to park at their place of work. In many cases, they will have to pay more than &pound;200 a year. That might not sound a huge amount, but for a low-paid ancillary worker or nurse that is a real dent in their take-home pay. The reason that the staff car parking scheme was introduced was not because the NHS trust wanted to introduce it, but, quite simply, because it would raise about &pound;300,000 to go towards balancing the budget. That is because of the consistent under-funding of our local hospital&mdash;not an argument for this debate I admit, but a point I have made elsewhere. That under-funding has spilt over into charging staff to park at their place of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/4">Another area is supermarkets. Last year, I had the privilege to sit on the all-party parliamentary group for small shops. We published a report that said that unless appropriate action was taken, there would be no independent retailers on Britain's high streets by 2015. Part of the reason why that will be the case within a decade is that supermarkets are building big car parks, where it is in effect free to park, while up and down Britain, shoppers who want to shop in high streets have to pay ever increasing car parking charges, either in the car park of the local shopping centre or in the local council-owned car parks. That is certainly true in Kettering, and I am sure that it is true elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/5">Another side effect of the lack of an overall parking policy involves verges. Like many other issues that should be fairly simple and straightforward, roadside verges are covered sometimes by the local district or borough council and sometimes by the local county council. There seems to be no rhyme or reason why one verge should come under the ownership of one type of council and another under the ownership of another. In Kettering, because of the narrow width of the roads and the lack of car parking spaces, more and more people are taking to parking on verges, and in wet weather the verges are becoming like mud baths. I am sure that all of us recognise that from our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/6">There is some doubt about whether parking on a pavement is illegal and the local authority certainly has no funds available to put in hard-standing to prevent the grass verges from being dug up. I am sure that all of us would say, &quot;Well, cars shouldn't really be parked on verges&quot; and probably the law says that, but in Kettering, as in many other places, people simply have no option but to park on verges. Such parking can be selfish&mdash;for example, outside Wicksteed park in Kettering, which is a leading amusement park and leisure facility with a very strong reputation. Sometimes people do not want to pay the car parking fees in the park, so they park outside on the verges. That is illegal, but the law is simply not enforced by the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/7">Another issue is residents parking. There is huge demand in Kettering for residents parking schemes. However, all this is being held up by the arguments between the local councils about the extension of decriminalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.1/8">Kettering borough council is keen for the Government to allow local authorities to appoint generic street wardens. The idea is that a warden patrols his or her local street, able to perform all the functions that local residents would think it was sensible for him or her to be able to perform, such as issuing car parking tickets, alerting the police if a misdemeanour is taking place, calling in the local highways authority to fill a hole in the road and calling in someone to fix a street light. At the moment, however, the legislation is such that there is no ability for a local council to appoint a generic warden.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-18a.366.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="366"  time="015:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070118/halltext/70118h0003.htm#07011856000245">
	<p pid="a.366.1/1">First, I apologise on behalf of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase>, who would like to be here. He is doing something traditional, wild and Celtic for which he has grown a beard and goodness knows what else. I am moonlighting in a way, but hon. Members will know that it is not possible to come from Southport without having had a lot to do with parking in one way or another.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/2">The report confronting us is very important. It has been of immense public interest. As a Select Committee report, it has been very successful, because it has initiated serious dialogue with the media, the public and, of course, the Government. The Government response has been fairly positive, constructive and thoughtful. The issue of parking policy and enforcement clearly generates an enormous amount of strong feeling. It is also very important for road safety. The nearest I ever came to losing my life on the roads was when someone parked at a junction to rush into a betting shop to place a bet&mdash;I came out of said junction. When someone's head is bleeding and their car is written off, they think quite hard about where people do and do not park, although possibly more at the time about their own survival.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/3">It is impossible to do justice to the entire report and all the contributions in the debate, which have been most thoughtful, but I thought that I would speak specifically about the customer's experience, if I can call it that. Most people understand broadly what parking enforcement is about. It is about rationing parking space. That was never needed in the past, but now we have hundreds and hundreds of extra cars and people accept that space in town must be rationed. It is about safe parking and it is about reducing nuisance&mdash;moving away the awkward car that is blocking someone's driveway and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/4">There are, however, other wider objectives, possibly known only to councils. They worry about the economic effects of parking, the environmental goals of the parking system and maintaining traffic flow. In Manchester, they may even worry about issues such as liveability, although I am not quite certain what that is. The report highlights very well the limited evaluation of this important service done by councils and the Government. Both collect data and do some sort of evaluation, but it was pointed out forcefully in the report that they could not find a single example of an annual report from a parking authority. An annual report seems an excellent idea. It would include, according to the Select Committee, an account of the expenditure on the civil parking enforcement scheme, revenue collected, revenue outstanding, expenditure of surpluses, parking compliance statistics, the number of penalty charge notices issued, the number of informal representations received and so on. That information strikes me as being useful to evaluate the whole process, but, sadly, the parking departments in many local authorities are simply asked to get on with it, and the surplus is gratefully received.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/5">The lack of clarity about objectives and the lack of clear strategy lead to tension and, sometimes, to pointless enforcement on days when it simply is not required. That misuse of staff time often leads to motorists feeling that they are being deliberately penalised or financially exploited. Citizens might not agree with a council's strategy or use of surpluses, and that is a matter of genuine democratic debate, but often they do not even know that there is a strategy or set of objectives and so regard the people who enforce the parking regulations as an unpleasant force that makes their life awkward. In my constituency, the enforcers have been referred to not as being jack-booted, but as the Gestapo.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/6">It seems that when there is no strategy, there is no sensible use of discretion. That difficult area is dealt with quite well in the report. If there is no discretion, there is essentially no favouritism, no kerbside persuasion, no corruption and no bribery or bias, but it can also generate public ridicule and outrage. I can add to the tales of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>, who illustrated how that can happen with his example of the veterans who found on their return from a Remembrance day procession that they had received tickets. In my constituency, a wedding car parked outside the town hall received a ticket, and care workers making necessary calls have been fined for their trouble. I shall view with great interest the outcome of the Manchester experience, not simply in terms of how many appeals there are&mdash;I would expect there to be fewer&mdash;but in terms of general compliance with parking regulations in Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/7">One thing worse than there being no discretion is there being no discretion and no explanation of people's rights or how they can appeal or protest. If discretion can be operated only at office level and not on the streets, which is how some people claim things should be done, that should be made clear on the streets. People should be informed that there is an appeal system and of what they can do when they do not get a sensible or satisfactory response. There is certainly a need to penalise the parking authorities that do not use their discretion sensibly. That message to the adjudicator comes through in the Select Committee report.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/8">Having a clear strategy leads to a sensible approach to pricing, which is crucial to the success of any parking system. When a parking system was first introduced in my constituency in the 1990s, there was wholesale uproar at one stage. There were people marching through the streets and, believe it or not, people outside the town hall demanding my resignation. When the prices were adjusted to fit in with what people wanted and a sensible parking regime and set of tariffs were produced, much of the initial hostility died down. I do not say that there is no hostility today, but pricing could be controlled better if people knew what they were trying to do with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/9">Clear strategy is also crucial to evaluating the performance of outsourced contractors. We heard about the Manchester case; in my constituency we use the British Legion. There has to be an end to any growing fine-chasing culture. Perhaps we should start to develop the role that very few traffic wardens have as ambassadors and helpers: people who help the system to work better rather than simply enforcing those who cannot understand or who abuse the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/10">The report recognises that the enforcement process is becoming ever more sophisticated. Cameras are now used to settle issues that were previously settled through long and somewhat tedious correspondence, but technology does not always bring benefits. My son recently received a form from Transport for London stating that a car like his, which was said to have his registration plate, had not exited from a yellow box in time. When we looked into the matter, we found that both he and his car were in Runcorn on that day. They were surveyed by CCTV, so there could be no doubt about it. We contacted TFL, using the sophisticated system, and thought that the technology would take notice of our reasonable and rational representations. My suspicions were confirmed, however, when he was told a few weeks later that his fine had been doubled because he had not paid it. Clearly, the computer had not taken the message even if the person on the other end of the phone at TFL had heard it.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/11">The immovable fact remains that the wardens who enforce the regulations are dealing with humanity in the raw, which it is not always pleasant. I do not think that it has been mentioned so far that wardens put up with enormous amount of abuse from the public and receive occasional threats of physical violence. That is why training&mdash;another theme that was picked up well by the Select Committee&mdash;is crucial. Clearly, one needs a lot of judgment when clamping down on something like blue-badge abuse. One wants to deal with the person who leaps spryly out of their car having used someone else's badge, but one does not want to confront someone who has a genuine and valid reason for using a badge&mdash;someone who has a disability that they are trying to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/12">How does one give traffic wardens that real professionalism and help them to deal with the problems that they confront on a day-to-day basis? One answer that seems to be being tried in some areas is to make them look ever more like a military force and to parade them around in twos wearing quasi-military uniforms. A better answer, which is in the report, is to give them proper, professional training. I hope that the report is a big step towards there being a professional, fair, well managed service.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/13">I conclude on a different note. We have discussed overlapping police and council systems and adjudications. Sometimes they work seamlessly, but I am aware of cases in which councils have taken over and the police have absented themselves from every traffic issue, even when they are the only people who can resolve certain issues. I also know of people in my constituency who park cars that are for sale on the highway, and that is blatantly on the wrong side of the law. Parts of that problem should be solved by the police and parts by the local authority, but it is very difficult to get the integration needed to address what is a relatively straightforward problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/14">I repeat that the report is an important step toward improving parking services in this country and in opening up the debate on them, and I praise the Select Committee for producing such a good report.</p>

That causes a great deal of concern in my constituency and throughout the country, as evidenced by the fact that more than 50 hon. Members signed my early-day motion on the issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.378.3/1">Thank you.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.3/2">My hon. Friend shared with us his soft spot for a parking attendant in Scarborough. I am sure that they were glad to have been commended. The experience in Manchester that we have heard about shows that a balance needs to be struck between consistency and the provision of a framework for local authorities by central Government, and giving them the space to develop a system that best meets local needs. I think that the regulations will do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.3/3">My hon. Friend referred to parking charges, which, in my view, are for a scarce resource, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> said. I emphasis that enforcement of those charges does not generate general revenue. That would be the wrong incentive. The purpose of our parking enforcement policy is to keep traffic flowing and improve road safety&mdash;I cannot emphasise that enough. The regulations require that revenue be ring fenced for parking, passenger transport, environmental and road improvement projects, and, in London only, for road maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.3/4">A point was raised a couple of times about pavement parking. I agree with my hon. Friend that that is a serious local matter raising a lot of interest. Enforcement is the responsibility of the police or local authority. Where the local authority is responsible, enforcement is known to be much more effective when combined with publicity. We heard the example this afternoon of the campaign run by the <i>Evening Telegraph </i>in Kettering to get information across to which people responded. Of course, where there is a particular and ongoing problem, local authorities can use physical measures to prevent parking. They can also introduce bans on pavement parking using traffic regulation orders. The advantage is that those are for a particular area and a sign is necessary so people know about it. It is difficult to make signs for a wholesale ban because people tend to ignore them. But that is another possibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.3/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">The hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> referred to the local decriminalisation of parking. Once a local authority is responsible, enforcement will be in its hands. I take the point that of course the police often have higher priorities, which I imagine is one of the reasons that the Select Committee spoke out in favour of decriminalised parking. That is why we allow and encourage local authorities to have such powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.3/6">I was surprised by the hon. Gentleman's comments on staff parking at the local hospital. That is clearly a local decision. I wondered whether his party has made a commitment to pay for such parking using NHS funds. Those decisions need to be made. Although I do not have the figures for NHS funding in Kettering&mdash;regrettably&mdash;I would be surprised if it were the one area in the country that had not seen record levels of Government investment, a reduction in waiting lists or an increase in the number of doctors and nurses. However, if that is the case, I am sure that he will tell me and I shall alert colleagues. But I do not accept the link that he made.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.3/7">I shall refer again to the campaign run by the <i>Evening Telegraph</i> against what the hon. Gentleman called inconsiderate parking. That was about getting the co-operation of drivers and informing them. It emphasises a point in which I very much believe&mdash;prevention is better than enforcement. We spend a lot of time&mdash;understandably&mdash;talking about enforcement, but, of course, that takes place after the event. If we are to keep traffic moving, prevention is preferable. He raised another issue about road widths and suggested that they were being reduced to squeeze in more houses on new developments. I can assure him that local authorities must comply with design standards. If he has any particular concerns, I am sure that he will raise them as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.3/8">The hon. Member for Southport referred to training. We support strongly the need for training at all levels in the parking industry, as I said in my earlier remarks, and we are working with and support the British Parking Association's sector skills strategy to increase skills in the industry. That is welcome because many in the industry feel overlooked and that they get a bad press, in many cases. Training and support would be very welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.3/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> made a strong call for greater central control and regulation, which I was interested to hear. My intention is to introduce regulations and guidance that enable people to get parking right locally, rather than to run things from the centre. My feeling is that that is what people think is right&mdash;local solutions to meet local needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.3/10">I have dealt with the details of a number of the points that the hon. Gentleman raised in my comments about the regulation and guidance. However, he also asked where parking fitted in with our thinking on the economy, the success of business, and so on. Parking is of course key to our thoughts on local transport planning. The guidance on the second local transport plan brings about that integrated approach, because it focuses on four key outcomes, one of which is tackling the congestion. The approach to parking is of course part of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.3/11">I should also like to mention scrutiny, transparency and people understanding the situation, which are important. The Audit Commission can already scrutinise a local highways authority's parking management performance and has published a number of inspection reports of individual council's parking services. However, my hope and intention, through the guidance and the regulations, is that the message should be loud and clear&mdash;namely, that the approach should not be about hiding away from a parking policy, but about sharing with the general public what that policy is about and what it means, and about prevention, rather than dealing with enforcement after the event. In other words, the job is not to catch people out, but to inform, to keep traffic moving and to keep roads safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.3/12">I finish where I started, by saying that the Government very much welcome the Committee's report and largely share the views that it sets out. We have set out in the consultation how we plan to take forward the parking provisions in part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004. The Government are determined to introduce a parking enforcement system that is fairer, more consistent and more transparent. We believe that the regulations and the guidance to implement the parking provisions will achieve that. I hope that all hon. Members present will support the Government in our initiative, which I welcome, to strengthen the system of parking enforcement, to produce tough new measures to overhaul parking enforcement in England, and to enable local authorities to use powers to keep traffic moving and make the road safer.</p>
