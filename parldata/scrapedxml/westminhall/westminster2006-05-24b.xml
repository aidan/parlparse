	<p pid="b.455.2/1">Good morning,Mr. Cook. It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair today overseeing our proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.2/2">I am delighted to have secured this debate on nursing. The NHS is made up of many people who have created the fantastic, modern NHS of today, but I want to concentrate on the role of nurses, their practice and nurse education. Nurses are to be found in all sorts of settings, but often they are stereotyped&mdash;certainlyI was during my 25 years as a nurse in the health service&mdash;as someone who wears a nice blue dress, has an upside-down watch and struts up and down like Hattie Jacques. Of course that is not true&mdash;although, to be honest, I was quite bossy. In fact, nurses are to be found in all parts of today's NHS. We have acute nurses working in our hospitals, and community nurses doing an excellent job in the outside world. There are those who help people with severe learning disabilities and those who care for people with mental health problems, and then there is the fantastic work done by occupational health nurses.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.2/3">It would be great to tell the House of all the hideous and despicable things that I had to do as a nurse&mdash;not intentionally but in the course of my duties. I sometimes hear nurses say, &quot;Oh, things are not like they were in my day,&quot; but I hope to demonstrate that nursing has developed into a serious professional career, with opportunities for development that were never thought of even 20 or 30 years ago. It is important to set the scene and to lay to rest the belief that everything was wonderful 30 years ago and that life for nurses is now a piece of cake. I firmly believe that that is not true. Life can be extremely difficult and nurses are doing an excellent job in a very busy NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.2/4">Since the time of Florence Nightingale, nurses have been at the forefront of development and improvements in health care. We need only look out of the window to see&mdash;if the blinds were open, we could see it better&mdash;the first school of nursing, founded by Florence Nightingale at St. Thomas' hospital. It is appropriate to debate nursing today because nurses have responded well to change. On the whole, they have been at the cutting edge of innovation and development in patient care.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.2/5">Nursing has never been a job that anyone could do only for money. It has always been called a vocation, and that is how many speak of it, but I often thought that that was an excuse for paying nurses badly and for not respecting and understanding the work that they do. I am glad to say that nurses today are given the right resources and the money that they deserve, and that they have become part of a profession.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.456.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="456"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0001.htm#06052454000377">
	<p pid="b.456.0/1">My hon. Friend is right to point out the real increases in nurses' pay since 1997, but we also need to offer proper financial support to nurses and midwives during training. There is a high attrition rate in midwifery training and larger bursaries are needed, partly because entrants may be more mature and have caring responsibilities. It can be a financial struggle to get to the end of the course. Does my hon. Friend think that the new Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">our hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase> will announce something today that might improve that situation? We greatly admired the talents that he demonstrated in his previous post.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.456.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" speakername="Laura Moffatt" colnum="456"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0001.htm#06052454000378">
	<p pid="b.456.1/1">I remember well being involved, with other hon. Members, in campaigning for a decent bursary for student nurses. I am well aware of the issues that affect nurses, certainly mature nurses. We want people of all ages to join the nursing profession, because that enhances the richness of the profession, which should not be a career choice only for those in their late teens. I understand that there are issues that particularly affect older people with families who are trying to develop their careers. I hope that the Minister will comment on that subject this morning.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.456.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" speakername="Jim Devine" colnum="456"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0001.htm#06052454000379">
	<p pid="b.456.2/1">Probably when my hon. Friend and I did our training, we not only received a salary but had employment protection. We had protection against unfair dismissal, for example, and women, who might have fallen pregnant during their training, also had the protection of maternity leave. Should we consider going back to those days instead of having a bursary? Students would still attend university, but would be associated with a local health board.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.456.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" speakername="Laura Moffatt" colnum="456"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0001.htm#06052454000380">
	<p pid="b.456.3/1">I completely understand my hon. Friend's point of view. He has a long history of campaigning on behalf of nurses. Having a salary was attractive, but it was very small and I suspect that, if it were set at the same rate, it would be completely inadequate for nurses today. In addition, we immediately became part of the work force as nurses, but had enormous difficulties in getting the classroom education that we so desperately needed. I believe that there is a middle way: we can properly reimburse student nurses for the work that they do, even if they are supernumerary to the nursing team on the ward, because they play a huge role. We need to respect and understand that.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.3/2">Returning to why people become nurses, it is important to understand that nursing is a career of positive choice, with pathways of opportunity and clinical development. Nurses are no longer the handmaidens of consultants, doing as they are told. Life is very different for nurses today.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.3/3">As I mentioned, my experience is very much hospital-based; I served 25 years in my local hospital on both day and night duty. I am pleased to see the hon. Members <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" name="Ann Keen">here, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen)</phrase>, who has enormous experience in the community. I hope that she will be able to catch your eye, Mr. Cook, so that we can hear more about community nursing. Many other Members present also take a great interest in the issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.3/4">We must accept that things have changed for the better for nurses in respect of their stature and how they are regarded. However, we must also accept that life for today's nurses can be very hard. Their work load is much greater because we are treating people more successfully: thousands of people walking around today would probably not have survived 35 years ago. People are living longer, thank goodness, and many more are being treated through a whole range of interventions and treatments that were never seen before.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.3/5">I first started nursing on a 25-bed ward. In those days, I could probably rely on 10 of those patients being relatively well, up and about and able to help with the tea trolley. It was not unusual for a patient to spend 10 days in hospital after a hernia operation. Now such patients would leave hospital the next day. We can only imagine the pressure that that puts on nursing staff to ensure that the bed is clean and fresh for the next patient. We accept that nursing is a different kettle of fish now from what it was years ago. Hospitals are no longer places where people convalesce.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.3/6">I strongly support the aims of the White Paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&quot;. Recovering at home or in a setting other than hospital is by far the better option, but it must be well supported by good nursing staff and systems. That is why I am such a keen supporter of the proposals to broaden the opportunities for people to recover in their own home, where we know they do much better psychologically than if they were left in hospital. However, it means that today's 25-bed unit will contain 25 people needing intensive nursing and treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.3/7">Many of the changes that have taken place in the health service have been led by nurses. They understood that when a patient is recovering, being at home and being more active is the best option. We no longer condone patients being left in bed in hospital, waiting for the visiting hour when people can come to see them for a short while. Nurses have developed models of care to define nursing care in this century, and tremendous efforts have been made to ensure that nurse education leaves student nurses fit for practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.3/8">To return to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase>, 30 years ago a nurse would spend six weeks in the school of nursing and then go straight on to a ward. Obviously, other nurses would provide support, but that was a very scary situation to be in and we should never condone that practice again. In the days when 10 of the 25 patients were relatively well, we could support such a practice, but today it would be dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.3/9">Medicine has transformed what happens in the NHS. We no longer have generalist surgeons or medics and there are no generalist nurses, either. Nurses soon specialise in a particular area and deliver specialised care. I remember well the days when, for example, over-65s who had had a heart attack would see a consultant physician, who would say, &quot;Well, old chap, you've had a heart attack, so I'll ask you to go home and rest and we'll see how you are in a couple of weeks.&quot; Today's NHS would never treat anyone of that relatively young age in such a way; it ensures that all that can be offered is offered. I am glad to say that there has been a tremendous fall in the number of people dying of coronary heart disease, because of the specialist intervention. However, none of that can happen without nursing staff supporting innovations, ensuring that people have the intervention that they need and get the care and support that they need when they get home.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.3/10">Today's nurse education is very different from what it was years ago. Nurses are empowered through education, and not only to deliver excellent care. They are also encouraged to challenge what is offered to patients, to think of new ways of delivering care, to respond to patients' needs and to act as an advocate on their behalf. The Council of Deans and Heads of UK University Faculties for Nursing and Health Professions has been doing tremendous work to ensure that nurse education is of the highest standard. A recent statement on nurse education from the council said:</p>
	<p pid="b.456.3/11" class="indent">&quot;Education programmes should seek to ensure that students have the knowledge, skills and expertise to practise in a culturally diverse environment and develop lifelong learning skills&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.456.3/12">The statement refers to skills such as flexibility, scholarship, questioning, analysis, critique and the use of evidence. I was not taught to challenge or use critique&mdash;the very idea would have been frowned on when I did my nurse training.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.458.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" speakername="David Drew" colnum="458"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0001.htm#06052454000381">
	<p pid="b.458.0/1">My hon. Friend is in touch with the midwives at the Stroud maternity unit, which is threatened with closure. Yesterday, I received a letter from the university of the West of England saying that it was important to keep such facilities open so that they could provide training for midwives. Does my hon. Friend agree that nurses and midwives will not have proper training facilities for nurses and midwives if we contract NHS facilities?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.458.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" speakername="Laura Moffatt" colnum="458"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0001.htm#06052454000382">
	<p pid="b.458.1/1">As chair of the all-party group on maternity, I am very aware of the issues facing the Stroud birthing unit. I also know that my hon. Friend is a keen supporter of the nurses there and that he is keen to ensure that that excellent unit survives. He is right about nurse education and continuing education, and when trusts face difficulties&mdash;I shall speak a little more about this&mdash;they should be wary of cutting budgets in ways that result in their not training as many of those entering the profession or continuing their education afterwards. That would be a false economy, and none of the innovations that I described would have happened without a well educated, empowered work force. I thank my hon. Friend for raising the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/2">I have talked about how different training has become. Today's nurse education includes increased practice-based learning, which we called for very strongly. We felt that in the Nursing 2000 initiative there was an overemphasis on classroom activity and not enough emphasis on practice-based activity, and the change has been warmly welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/3">My hon. Friend mentioned training, and I want to put the issue to the Minister in the hope that we can have an ongoing dialogue to ensure that training budgets are secure and ring-fenced. That would give acute trusts and primary care trusts the ability to continue investing in their most precious commodity&mdash;their staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/4">Nurses who are in practice now are having a very different time from their predecessors, and I look with envy at some of the activities and innovations that are taking place. I like to keep in touch with what is happening and I have assisted in the Royal College of Nursing leadership programmes for modern matrons, which has helped me to understand some of the issues that those people face.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/5">Nurses continue to press for greater autonomy, and nurse organisations across the board, including trade unions, such as Unison, and the RCN, continue to ensure that nurses introduce new ways of practising. Talk of evidence-based practice is now typical in every nurse setting, as nurses ensure that they continue to deliver the best care to patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.1/6">Nurses who have been through nurse education have a responsibility to other team members. I am delighted that more than 80,000 more nurses are working in the NHS, but there has also been a huge increase in health care assistants, and nurses have a responsibility to ensure that those assistants receive the best training so that they can assist in care giving. No one is better placed than nurses to ensure that health care assistants receive the training, education and continuing development that they desperately need.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.459.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" speakername="Andrew Smith" colnum="459"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0001.htm#06052454000383">
	<p pid="b.459.0/1">I endorse what my hon. Friend says about the important role that health care assistants play. Does she agree that secondment, which offers health care assistants a route into qualified nursing, is enormously important? I read the accounts in the very helpful debate pack that the Library prepared for the debate, and it was alarming to find that getting a secondment place seems to be something of a lottery. Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be helpful if the Minister addressed those points?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.459.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" speakername="Laura Moffatt" colnum="459"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0001.htm#06052454000384">
	<p pid="b.459.1/1">I am deeply grateful to my right hon. Friend for that intervention, because I wanted to go on to talk about securing finance to ensure that workplace development goes on. The secondment programmes are excellent, and as he says, places are hard fought for, but there are other ways to get into practice. I congratulate Unison on its work with the Open university in helping people, including mature people, in the workplace who cannot afford to give up their jobs and start training for a completely new career. It encourages them through high-quality training, in partnership with the Open university, to develop their skills. An excellent programme was recently launched for social workers working in a care setting who choose to go on and develop their skills. There are routes other than secondment, and we should use those methods to make sure that people have an opportunity to develop. After all, what is better than someone who understands the profession becoming a health care assistant and then deciding to go on to become a registered nurse? The only way that we can truly guarantee quality of care is to secure the budgets and, once again, I ask the Minister to say a little about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.1/2">There have been fantastic innovations in nurse education, and I am particularly taken with the role of modern matrons. They have provided highly visible and accessible leaders for nurses and have given nurses the sense that there are tremendous career paths open to them, which will ensure that they stay in the profession. That has always been a problem&mdash;the health service used to lose many good nurses into management, because they felt that there was no reason to remain in practice as there was no sensible career path for them. It is different today.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.1/3">Modern matrons are there to drive up clinical standards and to empower nurses to take on a greater range of clinical tasks to improve care. Recently, the matrons charter, which was designed as an action plan for cleaner hospitals, has been warmly welcomed. Such nurse-led initiatives are beginning to make our hospitals a much better, nicer environment. In fact, Beverley Malone of the Royal College of Nursing has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.459.1/4" class="indent">&quot;we are pleased to see such a clear government understanding of how important it is to empower matrons.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.459.1/5">Another fine initiative is the role of nurse consultant. It was first referred to in 1999 in the strategy document, &quot;Making a Difference: strengthening the nursing, midwifery and health visiting contribution to health and healthcare&quot;. Those nurses came into being in January 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.1/6">I have examples of both a modern matron and a nurse consultant making a huge difference in their setting. Lynne Phair, a nurse consultant for older people in Crawley primary care trust, is doing tremendous work in ensuring that there is better care for older people when they leave hospital and go into the community. In addition, she is working in partnership with Crawley borough council to deliver education to groups including Age Concern, health care assistants or friends and family visiting older people at home, to ensure that older people do not become ill if there is a heat wave&mdash;although I am slightly worried that the weather will never warm up.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.1/7">There were many headlines in 2003 about how many people in France died as a result of the prolonged hot weather; estimates range up to 15,000, I believe. We should not forget that 2,000 older people are estimated to have died in the UK from heatstroke and heat exhaustion because they were not given the right equipment or treated as they should have been to reduce the threat of heatstroke. Lynne Phair is working in partnership with the borough to ensure that everybody understands what to do and what advice to give; she is producing really good information and certificates to get that message across&mdash;and it is getting across to many people. That is just another example of how the role of nurses has changed.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.1/8">Another fine example of a modern matron is Faye Butler, from the dermatology department of the Newcastle group of hospitals. People with dermatological problems face massive waiting times and it is extremely distressing if a patient suffering from a skin problem has to wait weeks to see someone. Thanks to Faye Butler's leadership and the work of the rest of the team, those waiting times have been hugely reduced. In fact, people are referred straight away to see the dermatologist and to get treatment that week. That is a huge change, which was made through nurses taking a lead.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.1/9">There are other innovations, such as nurse prescribing. We were just talking about it when I was leaving the profession in 1997, but now there has been a huge expansion in how nurses can prescribe drugs. We would like to see more, but that was a difficult argument fought in the face of a medical profession that was uncomfortable with it. I think the profession now accepts that it was the right innovation and that we are able to treat more people more quickly and fulfil our pledge to ensure that people have the care thatthey need.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.1/10">Many of us see the way in which cancer care has been transformed in our communities. The two-week waiting time is not achieved merely by a consultant, of course. The nursing staff are there to ensure that patients, mostly women in breast cancer cases, can attend the clinic and have a day there, get a diagnosis and either leave the department skipping and laughing or get the extra care that a breast care nurse can offer, and to provide that continuing care through treatment. Nurses are prepared to put that innovation into action and to ensure that we respond properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.1/11">The same applies to efforts to tackle methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Every nurse knows that the problem is not just the result of high bed occupancy. Anybody who does any serious work into health care-acquired infections knows that they are very complex. I was pleased to see the trade unions and the Royal College of Nursing come together with the Department of Health to develop an action plan to reduce the incidence of MRSA, which is proving extremely successful. It is dishonest to say that MRSA is caused just because hospitals are over-busy. That is not the whole picture and I hope that the Minister will be able to say a few words on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.1/12">As I have said, we have seen massive changes in the health service thanks to the nurses who have ensured that it can change. The number of qualified nurses working in the NHS has increased by 23.4 per cent. Recently, there have been concerns and many headlines about redundancies in the nursing profession. Distressing though it is to those affected by such redundancies, we should set that against the backdrop of more than 85,000 more nurses. None of us would support the loss of nurses just because of money issues, but we must accept that many more people are working in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.1/13">That is why I was completely bemused to see what looked like a staged event when the Secretary of State was greeted at the Royal College of Nursing conference. I was nursing at a time when the trust that I worked for suffered real-terms cuts: it did not merely have a standstill budget, but its allocation of money was cut. Yet whenever we saw on the news the Secretary of State at the time being greeted by the Royal College of Nursing, we never saw such events. I wonder whether we need to be a little more sensible about our campaigning.</p>

	<p pid="b.461.0/1">I apologise to my hon. Friend for being able to be here for only part of the debate, and I congratulate her on securing it.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.0/2">As a former nurse and a former president of Unison, I wonder whether she shares my concern about the way in which the Royal College of Nursing treated the Secretary of State for Health. During the debate, I have heard about the innovations and good things that are happening in health and nursing as a result of mature dialogue between the unions and the Government. It was appalling of the RCN to treat the Secretary of State like that. I suffered similarly when I was president of Unison, but that came from a Trotty militant element&mdash;<i>[Laughter.]</i> Unison had problems along those lines. I attended a congress as president and the shouting and heckling was a distressing experience that I did not deserve. The Secretary of State certainly did not deserve to be treated like that, and the RCN should be ashamed of itself.</p>

	<p pid="b.462.0/1">I am deeply grateful to my hon. Friend and delighted that she is able to be with us for a short time. I know that she wanted to take part in the debate, but faced time pressures.</p>
	<p pid="b.462.0/2">I agree that there is a time and a place for campaigning, and there is a role for nursing organisations, including Unison and the RCN. However, it is easy to lose the support of the House with negative campaigning. I have been reading in <i>Hansard</i> the criticism from hon. Members on both sides of the House about the way in which that campaigning was undertaken. It was damaging to nursing, particularly as the RCN in its evidence to the Health Committee seemed to say something different. We should bear that in mind.</p>

	<p pid="b.462.1/1">May I suggest that perhaps the frustration shown at the conference was about not just job losses but a range of other issues, such as vacancy freezes, graduate skills going to waste and a growing disillusionment in the profession following the RCN's survey, which suggested that many nurses are planning to leave the NHS? I do not think it was only about job losses; I think it was about wider issues also.</p>

	<p pid="b.462.2/1">I do not know the rationale for that staged event. I do not understand it and refuse to accept that it was beneficial. When I started my nursing training in 1972, I was told that nurses' morale was at the lowest ebb ever. In 1980, I was again told that their morale was at the lowest ebb ever. That has continued for many years. There has clearly been enormous investment, but we are still hearing that nurses' morale is at the lowest ebb ever. There is an issue and we must try to understand it because my understanding, certainly from Unison's work with nurse members, is that they are feeling much better about the profession, although recent events have made them feel more uncomfortable. We must get a grip on the budgets.</p>

	<p pid="b.462.3/1">I was a senior trade union official when the Conservative party was in power and we had real-terms cuts. Frankly, I do not understand why, with the increased budgets, there are redundancies in any hospital. In Scotland, we wanted to keep nationalpay bargaining. Turnover in Scottish hospitals is about 7 per cent., but turnover in some hospitals south of the border is 34 per cent. a year. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us on whether we should bring in chief executives, directors of human resources and finance directors before any announcements are made on redundancies and cuts. Questions should be asked about how the budgets are managed.</p>

	<p pid="b.463.0/1">I completely agree with my hon. Friend. The Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which serves my constituency, has one of the highest deficits in the country. I expect it to work with the turnaround team, which has greatly benefited the work of the trust, to examine areas where there is overspending. We need to keep the front-line staff in place to make sure that they continue to provide the care that is so desperately needed. Other ways of managing need to be considered. The turnaround team is doing innovative work and examining back office work rather than staff, so I agree with my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.0/2">As an old nurse who has left the profession, I do not view the nursing of the past through rose-coloured spectacles. I firmly believe that nurses today are better qualified and much better able to respond to today's NHS. They work extremely hard. I salute every single one of them and hope that they continue to work in this fantastic NHS.</p>

	<p pid="b.463.3/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> on securing this important debate, and on the eloquence, personal experience and knowledge that informed her excellent opening contribution. I am very proud to have in my constituency Oxford Brookes university, where there is a vibrant school of health and social care, which I had a hand in initiating many years ago when I chaired the university board. That school trains 2,000 students and its training facilities have been consolidated into a new centre with state-of-the-art teaching facilities including a professional and clinical skills centre, which does excellent work.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.3/2">My hon. Friend eloquently described the crucial roles that are involved in modern nursing skills, and which contribute to the work of a health team. She described from personal experience the difference between the present arrangements and those of many years ago. Hon. Members and the public are full of praise for the contribution of nurses and other health professionals. The progress and tangible difference that they make can be seen every day. I am sure that other hon. Members receive, as I do, positive feedback about people's personal experience of the national health service, based on the care that they are given.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.3/3">As my hon. Friend said, nurses are at the cutting edge of innovation in health care and have been driving many of the improvements in hospitals and other health facilities. She also pointed out that people do not go into nursing for the money; but it is a good thing&mdash;and I am very proud that the Labour Government are responsible&mdash;that nurses' pay has been significantly increased and that the number of nurses has been increased by 87,000. Opposition Members who fasten on difficulties in the health service would do well to remember that if they had had their way in voting against the extra money going to the NHS, we should not have had those extra nurses, and the pressures and difficulties would be greater.</p>

	<p pid="b.464.0/1">As a point of fact, Conservatives agree with the Government's Budget, which has been set to 2008, so peddling the line that we continually vote for cuts does not take account of the context. Neither the Government nor the Opposition parties have been able to predict beyond 2008, as it is simply not possible to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.464.1/1">I do not want to get into partisan fights on the matter. I simply made a passing reference to the fact&mdash;it is a fact&mdash;that the principal Opposition party did not vote for the resources that were necessaryto increase health funding in the way that the Government have increased it. Therefore, it is true that the position would have been worse, not better, if they had had their way. The change is to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.1/2">As I said, I wish to raise three key issues in this contribution. The first was touched on earlier when my hon. Friend discussed pathways into nursing and the importance of professional development. I wish to stress the point and invite my hon. Friend the Minister to respond on the question of health care assistants and opportunities to qualify, whether through secondment or the other routes to which my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley referred.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.1/3">The point is worth stressing because health care assistants are an enormously important part of the modern health care team. They bring experience and a set of life skills that can be invaluable in nursing.For many of them, especially those with family responsibilities, the secondment route is financially the most viable way into nursing. It is a great loss to the profession if people have that potential and want to qualify as nurses but are held back because they are unable to get a secondment place. That is why I invite my hon. Friend the Minister to set out the Government's thinking on how we can maintain and, where possible, expand that important route. Such opportunities are crucial to making the most of those individuals' potential.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.1/4">Those opportunities are also important in confronting nursing shortages, as we have done on many occasions in the past. Especially in areas of high-cost accommodation such as Oxford, the challenge for the future must be not simply to fill gaps by recruiting nurses from overseas, although they have made an invaluable contribution, or by increasing training for the future, although that is important, but to do more to retain the staff whom we have and to ensure that people who already live in an area and who have the potential to become qualified nurses have a route into nursing. Such people already have accommodation in the area, so they do not face the burden of high prices and rents. That is particularly important in constituencies such as mine.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.1/5">The second key area is the impact of current financial deficits. It is a coincidence that as we meet here today, staff at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford will be briefed on the likely implications for them of correcting the local deficit. Last week, headline leaked reports stated that as many as 600 posts might go, so staff are understandably apprehensive. I have met RCN representatives, Unison and others to discuss that difficult situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.1/6">The crucial thing is that patient care must be safeguarded. The nurses whom I met have undertaken to alert me if there is any threat to patient care so that I can raise it at the highest level, but it is unfortunate indeed that people are being subjected to anxiety. The situation is terrible for people who face losing their job. I believe that that apprehension informed some of the anger voiced at the RCN conference. Certainly the nurses who came to see me in the recent lobby said that that was the reason for it, although I echo what others have said about the impact that it had and how it came across.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.1/7">The other dimension to the deficits, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley referred, was covered in the excellent briefings from the Councilof Deans, which warn that the biggest cuts in commissioning of nurses going into training appear to be in those strategic health authority areas where the deficits are largest. In some areas, cuts of up to 30 or40 per cent. in the current financial year are being spoken about. After all that has been done to improve nurse training and recruitment, it would be an utter tragedy if we returned to the bad old pattern of feast and famine by allowing those short-term financial pressures to cut recruitment for the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.465.0/1">In fact, the Council of Deans has made it clear that the problem that we faced in the '90s, when the reduction was made in student numbers, was what we inherited as a Government in 1997 and beyond. We must not make those mistakes again. The Department must take the Council of Deans's remarks seriously, and I hope that the Minister will address that.</p>

	<p pid="b.465.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The problems that we faced in the past were the product of sharp cuts in nurse training intakes in earlier years. We must not go back to that situation, because it would mean that we would not have sufficient nurses in 2009, 2010 and 2011, which will be necessary both to staff the expanded services and to meet the important demographic challenge, as a substantial proportion of the existing nursing staff approaches retirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/2">I invite the Minister to acknowledge the important point that reductions in nurse training to meet short-term financial pressures do not necessarily bear any relationship to longer-term staffing needs. I would be grateful for an assurance that the Government will review overall nurse commissioning numbers to ensure that proper weight is attached to the medium and long-term requirement for nurses, taking account not only of the expansion in services, but of the demographics, as nurses come up for retirement. It is not clear to me that a strategic health authority basis for commissioning will necessarily achieve the total aggregate number of nurses that we need for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/3">As we have all been saying, the health service has been improving enormously, thanks to the extra resources that have gone in, the extra staff who have been recruited, the professional development that has been undertaken, and the hard work and dedication of teams of health care professionals. Just as it is a tragedy wherever that progress is damaged by financial deficits, which we must deal with, so it would be tragic indeed if we faced future nurse shortages because of short-term considerations.</p>

	<p pid="b.466.1/1">As I said, the evidence from the Council of Deans is that the reductions in commissioning appear to be most severe in the areas where the deficits are highest. That rather suggests that the financial pressures are being allowed to distort the pattern of recruitment. Ring-fencing is therefore an option that the Government ought to explore seriously; otherwise, they should assure us that the total number of nurses going into training will be adequate to meet future need.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.1/2">I started my speech by referring to the education and training in my constituency. It is also crucial to have stability in our important training institutions, so that they do not face very sharp shifts in numbers, because that would destabilise an important part of the infrastructure that, at the end of the day, supports the national health service. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid="b.466.2/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on nursing.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/2">May 1997 saw an historic event: the election of the first two nurses to join <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">the House of Commons&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> and myself. We were followed in 2001 by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase>, and more recently by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase>. Why did it take so long? I think that we had an image problem. People asked what nurses did and knew, and how they could become Members of Parliament when all they did was take temperatures and make beds. They said, &quot;Nurses are not very knowledgeable, so how can they possibly become MPs?&quot; Jane Salvage, who used to edit <i>Nursing Times,</i> wrote the book &quot;The Politics of Nursing&quot;, in which she expanded on many theories in relation to outbreaks of feminism in the nurse's home; there was certainly one in my nurse's home. I am proud and pleased that the electorate of Brentford and Isleworth put their trust in me. &quot;Trust me, I'm a nurse,&quot; was my slogan, and, of course, they did&mdash;and they still do.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/3">With regard to moving nurse education into higher education, my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley mentioned her training. The training used to be like preparing for war most of the time, because nurses never knew what they were going to face on the ward. On night duty, first-year student nurses were left on their own with patients coming back from theatre. That was unsafe and dangerous practice, but such practice did not happen under a Labour Government. Opposition Members should reflect on some aspects of the past.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/4">Academic snobbery about what a nurse's qualifications were worth was conveyed to me whenwe moved into higher education. I was told by one academic, who was in charge of the geography department, that my registered nurse qualification was not really worth one A-level. I suggested that if he was going to have a heart attack he should have it while I was around, because he would then probably welcome the fact that I was a cardiac nurse and would be unlikely to send for the professor of history to assist him. That measure of academic snobbery is still in existence. There are people who still say, &quot;Why do nurses need diplomas or degrees?&quot;, and ask what was wrong with the old-fashioned type of preparation&mdash;preparation for duty, vocation, obedience and tolerating aspects of health care that should never have been accepted. I am proud of today's nurses andtheir nurse educators, who prepare them for practice in a totally different way. Midwifery has always had a different tradition; midwives have been accepted as practitioners in their own right. We might secure a debate on midwifery for another time.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/5">The issues I am discussing are probably to do with the fact that nursing is a predominantly female profession, although I acknowledge that my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston bucked that trend and has made an impressive contribution to nursing. However, nurses are ideal MPs because we are good listeners and communicators, and problem solvers. We are all the things that an honourable Member of Parliament should be. I should say again in this context that we are trusted.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/6">Nurses are also crucial for the future of health in our country. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor commissioned the first report&mdash;the Derek Wanless report&mdash;on the future trends and needs of health care in our country. Much of that is to do with chronic conditions and a growing population of frail older people who are experiencing such conditions. It is the nursing work force who are taking on that challenge in respect of cancer, chronic diseases, cardiovascular conditions, trauma and paediatrics.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/7">We want to acknowledge the clinical excellence demonstrated by nurses. West Middlesex university hospital is in my constituency; I worked in it for many years, and I would like to thank Yvonne Franks, the director of nursing and midwifery, for helping me to prepare for this debate. Unfortunately, I cannot use all the material that she offered me. I could have taken up the whole morning in explaining the work that many of the leading nurse specialists in my trust are participating in, but I feel that I ought to mention a couple of examples.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/8">We are all familiar with the changing clinical work in relation to heart disease, and rightly so. My hon. Friend the Member for Crawley mentioned the differences of some years ago, such as being told to go home and rest. That is certainly not the case now. I pay tribute to Phillip Eardley, acute coronary syndrome charge nurse, who works in association with Cas Shotter, a cardiology nurse specialist, in the accident and emergency department, leading the management of patients with chest pain. Those nurses prescribe diagnostic tests, implement treatments and deal with the transfer of patients. They decide whether patients are transferred to the Hammersmith hospital for primary angioplasty, and they also teach junior medical staff. That is the job of the advanced practitioner. I pay tribute to them, and apologise that, because of time restraints, I am unable to give examples of other nurses.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/9">The advanced practitioner in the UK is well advanced. We are a model for other countries. Other nursing schools and universities come to the UK to look at how we are practising in that advanced way. However, the advanced practitioner needs continuing education and training. We need to evaluate the real contribution that nurses make. We have made an investment in them which must be looked after. They now have the opportunity for child care provision that they never had in the past, and flexible working and proper rota systems have been put in place. In West Middlesex university hospital, Yvonne Franks is doing pioneering work into matching the appropriate skill of nurses to particular patient need. That seems obvious, but sadly, it is not taking place in all areas of health care.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/10">We have evidence of a better educated work force. The challenge is evaluating the payback from the investment. Professor Anne Marie Rafferty whom I know as a nurse, heads the Florence Nightingale school of nursing and midwifery at King's college, London. I cannot end on a better note than quoting her words:</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/11" class="indent">&quot;Educated and well trained health workers save lives.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/12">That is what the nursing profession in our health service is doing. They are on duty 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, giving care. I know that the House supports them, and I hope that we always demonstrate that with all-party support, and that we continue to recognise the work of people in the nursing profession and the quality of care that they give.</p>

	<p pid="b.468.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">the hon. Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> on her opening speech in this important debate, to which she contributed a good deal of expertise. I marvel at her commitment&mdash;there is hardly a health meeting that I go to in this building to which she does not show up and make a valuable contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.0/2">I am not an expert, like the hon. Lady, but I have something in my CV that is vaguely relevant. In a gap year, when I was a student, I worked as a nursing assistant in an old-fashioned mental hospital in Maidstone, Kent called Oakwood hospital. I started there with not a day's training and no secondment. I was simply given a white coat and set off, and I ended up on refractory and block wards. There must be few other MPs who have shown people into padded cells, administered electroconvulsive therapy and seen a straitjacket used.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.0/3">In those days, I was familiar with the division between state-enrolled nurses and state registered nurses&mdash;one could tell them apart by their varying epaulettes and colour-coding&mdash;and the further division between them and the lower grade of nursing assistant, which I was. As such, I was completely unqualified and untrained, and I muddled through as best I could. We were aware that SRNs were the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me, who were going somewhere. They would become the charge nurses and, for those who were very fortunate, the matrons. However, my impression was that the training then was not anything like as intensive as it now is and that monitoring of performance was somewhat weak. I was aware at only one stage in my work of being inspected, and that was when the boards of hospital visitors, or whoever they were, trooped through from time to time and took more interest in the state of the floors than in the condition and happiness of the patients. That seemed to be their major and fundamental preoccupation.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.0/4">In those days, one was aware of the clear demarcation between the nurses, who saw the patients very often, knew a great deal about them and could do much for them, and the doctors, who were of course the experts without whom nobody could move, who none the less saw patients relatively infrequently.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.0/5">My brief experience of nursing before going off to study philosophy at university was intensely interesting and enjoyable. It was also a good preparation for other career moves. I say that because someone recently described this place as the last Victorian asylum. That may be a little unfair, but this place is full of people talking out loud to no one in particular.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.0/6">Things have changed radically in nursing. I start on a good note by saying that the Government and the profession are to be congratulated. We have an increased supply of nurses&mdash;more than ever before&mdash;and we depend less on foreign staff, who ought to be working and providing health services in their own countries. We have increased salaries and improved career paths for nurses and others in the nursing profession. We also have improvements in the quality and variety of nursing education, and the link with higher education is an important boost in status, which the hon. Lady said was much needed and which is firmly to be welcomed. Nursing training also encourages career development and builds on nurses' skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.0/7">I warm to the concepts of nurse practitioners and of nurses being able to prescribe. Those long overdue and necessary reforms will break down the strict divisions that hitherto existed between nurses and doctors and their relevant areas of expertise. If we are to have decent medical care in the community, we need greater qualifications among the nursing profession. If we are to take pressure off the accident and emergency departments by having more minor injury units, we shall need nurses who can deal with a variety of unexpected conditions. If we are to advance the healthy living agenda and have flexible and effective care we will need expert and skilled nurses, and we are getting them stage by stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.0/8">The Government's strategy is essentially correct. I doubt whether anyone would speak against it. The strategy is correct and the profession is to be congratulated on endorsing it. However, it is a long-term strategy, as evidenced by the comments that we remember hearing when we remember our own experiences, and my concern is that it will be blown off course by short-term financial needs, or that it will be cross-grained with other initiatives. I think specifically of payment by results, and the drive to turn every NHS unit, whatever it be, into a financially autonomous, solvent, trading and entrepreneurial unit almost overnight.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.0/9">The system cannot bear that sort of stress, because it effectively asks organisations to wipe out in one year deficits that have been built up over many years. That is what led to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> talking about feast and famine in nursing training in relation to recent resource cuts. It was also referred to as stop-go in a briefing that we all received. They are all phrases that will be familiar to the Minister after his Treasury experience. Boom and bust is another. I assume that he is agin it.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.0/10">It is clear that SHA training budgets are often raided, that they are sometimes underspent, and that they are only notionally ring-fenced. They can therefore become a source of brokerage, top-slicing or centre-saving. Whatever one calls it, the money just goes&mdash;especially in those areas that have the biggest problems. It is in those areas with larger deficits that existing staff are most fearful, job security is declining and additional training prospects are worsening. To cite a personal example, the acute trust in my constituency has a substantial deficit. It has announced 200 redundancies, but it has said that nurses will not be made redundant, which is welcome. I should declare an interest. My son's partner, who has trained as a children's nurse, cannot gain employment and is looking for a job outside nursing that will use her considerable talents.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.0/11">Setting that against the general complaint of the royal colleges and the strategic liaison group about the lack of clinical academic pathways, one can begin to see a problem emerging. They complain about the difficulty of combining the service and the education roles. That can only bring about a reduction in effective mentoring. People's experiences cannot easily be traded in both areas as effectively as they might. They also complained&mdash;this point, too, was made by the right hon. Gentleman&mdash;about a lack of work force planning and the fact that we have not linked training places to needs, as has happened for the medical profession.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.0/12">What is happening is not something that could be dressed up in tabloid headlines as a meltdown, collapse or crisis in nursing; however, it is a genuine and serious problem, which can and should be tackled, and which calls into question the coherence of what the Government are doing and the haste with which they are acting. Hon. Members have spoken warmly about the Government's support of the nursing profession and nurse training, but they are in danger, on this issue in particular, of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.0/13">What is required is a broad view, consistency and sensible pragmatism&mdash;all of which I associate with the Minister and elements of the ministerial team. The strategy can be right, and we agree that it is, but if the tactics are wrong we end up with a bit of a mess.</p>

	<p pid="b.471.0/2">As we all know&mdash;we have all mentioned it&mdash;nurses perform an invaluable role. The NHS could not run without the hard work and dedication of its work force. Nurses more than anyone else are on the front line of patient care. However, I suggest to the Minister that there is growing frustration in the nursing profession. That was particularly brought home at the recent rally and lobby of Parliament. Many nurses are questioning what is happening. We all accept that extra money has been put into the NHS and welcome it, but not enough has reached front-line services and nurses increasingly point to the administrative burdens that they must undertake and the fact that the number of managers in trusts has grown faster than nurses' numbers.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/3">One cannot dispute that the number of nurses has increased, and we welcome it, but nurses make the point that not enough of the new money reaches front-line services. They feel they labour under an increasing burden of bureaucracy and political interference from a Government who insist on micro-managing the NHS through targets and red tape. I suggest that a fair number of the current frustrations and concerns are inevitably linked to NHS deficits. I ask the Minister not just to dismiss that point as party political, but to take on board those concerns expressed by nurses, and deal with them in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/4">Nursing training has been mentioned a few times in the debate so far. The concern is that places on courses are being cut and that clinical placements are being cancelled.</p>

	<p pid="b.471.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that in the 1990s nurse training was dramatically reduced, which caused the shortage that we inherited in the late 1990s? Will he at least acknowledge that that is what happened?</p>

	<p pid="b.471.2/1">Yes, there were cutbacks at times. There is no doubt about it. Yet what seems not to be accepted is that over the entirety of that period there were real-terms inflation-beating increases in the budget of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.2/2">By way of illustration of that, and to deal with one of the points that the hon. Member for Crawley made about improvements in cancer provision, the improvements that have been made since 1997 have not, despite all the extra money that has been put into the NHS, broken the trend of decreasing mortality rates that goes back to the early 1980s. Yes, improvement has continued, but despite all the money, there has been no marked improvement on decreasing cancer mortality rates. That is one example of how the money has indeed been provided, but not enough has reached front-line services, because much has been soaked up by the bureaucracy that has been created in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="b.472.1/1">May I make some progress? The hon. Lady may want to intervene again later, although I want to leave the Minister some time to respond.</p>
	<p pid="b.472.1/2">Let me give an example. According to <i>Nursing Standard </i>magazine, half of all the SHAs in England that responded to the survey admitted to cutting training posts, and the average reduction in England as a whole was 10 per cent. That must cause concern, because it means that fewer student nurses will get the practical experience that they need to qualify and the NHS will be poorer for not having fresh talent to replenish an increasingly ageing work force. That is a particular concern given that the RCN's own study has shown that about 100,000 nurses are due to retire in the next five to 10 years. Meanwhile, the Council of Deans and Heads has suggested that the reduction in the number of students who are being commissioned is greater in areas where SHAs report larger deficits, so there can be no dispute that deficits are having an impact on training places.</p>
	<p pid="b.472.1/3">In addition to the cuts imposed by SHAs, there is already a high drop-out rate among trainee nurses, and about one in four students are thought not to be completing their courses. Perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to outline what studies, if any, have been done of nurses' reasons for walking away from training opportunities. I expect that inadequate access to bursaries has something to do with it, but the flexibility and family-friendliness of training hours are also important, because the average age of nursing students is about 29, and many of them have young children. Those problems must be addressed, although difficulties at the NHS student grants unit last year did not help matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.472.1/4">However, the problems in nursing are not confined to students. Even when nurses do qualify, many find it difficult to get jobs, because NHS trusts are riddled with deficits, as we have heard. The Royal College of Nursing regional director recently claimed that, in the west midlands alone, about 4,000 student nurses who were due to graduate in the next two months will not have jobs to go to. That is symptomatic of the growing problem of graduate unemployment in the NHS as a whole, of which physiotherapists are another example. Indeed, the problem of vacancy freezes seems to be getting much worse. Given that it costs about &pound;100,000 to train a nurse, it is a great waste of public money and a missed opportunity to enhance patient care if nurses do not find work in the NHS soon after graduating.</p>
	<p pid="b.472.1/5">Vacancy freezes and graduate skills going to waste are one concern, but to return to a point made by the hon. Member for Crawley, it cannot be denied that the nurses who heckled the Secretary of State last month were also worried by the prospect of redundancies.The RCN has estimated that at least 13,000 posts are due to be lost as a result of the financial pressures on the NHS.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.473.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" speakername="Jim Devine" colnum="473"  time="010:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0003.htm#06052454000407">
	<p pid="b.473.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the language used is important? If someone is given compulsory redundancy, they know that they have been told that they are going, but I have looked at the figures and I do not see 13,000 redundancies&mdash;I see a freeze on vacancies, a reduction in the number of agency nurses and management of the financial problems.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.473.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" speakername="John Baron" colnum="473"  time="010:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0003.htm#06052454000408">
	<p pid="b.473.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. The problem is that we do not know for sure what the number is. Locally, we are seeing job cuts and people being made redundant, but I agree with him about the validity of the 13,000 figure. I have not checked that figure, but have the Government come up with figures that reflect the true state of affairs? At the moment, nobody knows, and all we hear are headline figures for job cuts. Broadly speaking, therefore, I agree with the hon. Gentleman and I ask the Minister to give us a better estimate, rather than just relying on the RCN figure.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.1/2">When the scale of the deficits crisis did become known&mdash;this is where I will take the Government to task&mdash;the Government argued that job losses in NHS trusts and acute hospital settings were broadly justified by the shift in emphasis towards care in the community. However, perhaps the Minister would care to explain how&mdash;taking the RCN figure&mdash;13,000 job losses can be made up when there 4,000 fewer full-time equivalent district nurses in the NHS than there were in 1997, with a 3 per cent. fall last year alone? Those weaknesses in primary care must be addressed before acute nursing posts are cut.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.1/3">The Government White Paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot; argues for transferring NHS activity from acute to primary care. There is much in the White Paper to be commended, but the Government will not be able to make good their pledge unless they develop capacity in the community, and at the moment that is not happening. Instead, the number of district nurses is decreasing; there is a shortage of school nurses; and birth centres and community hospitals are closing. Capacity is being shut down without any proper assessment of whether it is required. I suggest to the Minister that that could be storing up problems for the future and I would appreciate his response on that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.1/4">Those problems illustrate nurses' concerns about the security and status of their profession within the NHS. The bottom line seems to be that many nurses are still leaving the profession because their expertise and hard work are not being respected. An RCN survey published last year showed that more than a quarter of nurses' time was spent on clerical or administrative duties. Half of all nurses who left the NHS in the previous year cited stress and the work load as reasons for changing job, and those problems are likely to become more acute as the work force contracts. Is it any wonder that 30 per cent. of all respondents to a recent RCN survey&mdash;up from 27 per cent. in 2003&mdash;said that they would leave their employer within the next two years? That is the RCN's own survey.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.1/5">Conservative Members have long called for a different approach&mdash;one that would reverse the recent rapid growth in the number of managers and administrators and force politicians to withdraw from the day-to-day running of the health service. We would reduce the need for central control and leave hard-working nurses to get on with the job. In short, we would seek the re-emergence of nursing as a respected and largely autonomous health care profession.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.1/6">Nurses deserve our support, but the crisis in NHS finances has placed burdens on staff. We can do a great deal to promote nursing in the medium and long term, but the immediate task is to assess the damage caused by the consequences of deficits and to address the concerns of nurses themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.474.0/1">It is always a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate and on the passionate and knowledgeable way in which she described the development of nursing over a relatively short period. She described experiences that she had when she was a front-line nurse in the national health service and some of the challenges and difficulties that nurses faced. She also described the sense of reward that she got from being a nurse and recognised how significantly things have changed in recent times.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/2">It was good to hear it highlighted that it is the Labour party that, since 1997, has welcomed the election of not only my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" name="Ann Keen">my hon. Friends the Members for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen)</phrase>, for East Lothian (Anne Moffat) and for Livingston (Mr. Devine)&mdash;all serving nurses who have been elected to the House of Commons. That is a step forward for democracy. When my hon. Friends the Members for Crawley and for Brentford and Isleworth were elected, it was the first time in history that nurses had been elected to Parliament. I am very proud that all of them are Labour Members of Parliament. They are some of the best colleagues in the parliamentary Labour party, as I am sure everyone agrees.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> always turns up to make a contribution. However much he goes on about my talents as a Minister, I am not in a position to make announcements today on additional resources for midwifery bursaries, but I take on board the general concern that he expressed about retention of midwives, particularly on some courses. What are the obstacles getting in people's way and what issues do I need to address in my new role to deal with that?</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">My right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> made a very important contribution to the debate. I think that the last time we both participated in a debate in Westminster Hall, we were discussing cash machines and access to cash. This is a slightly different subject&mdash;such is the nature of government. He referred to health care assistants and secondment programmes. As I understand it, that is very much left to local discretion, depending on the market and on supply and demand. However, I am willing to look into secondment programmes for health care assistants&mdash;that specific opportunity to get into nursing&mdash;and into what is happening and what we want to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/5">My right hon. Friend also drew attention to the important role that Oxford Brookes university plays. It is a centre of excellence for social and health care and has been for some time, offering significant training opportunities. He also referred to the sad news that some of his constituents will receive today at John Radcliffe hospital. Although I cannot comment on the specific circumstances, I am sure that he will be making very strong representations about the decisions made by the hospital management, particularly in the context of any impact on patient care, and that he will maintain a dialogue with members of the ministerial team on those issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/6">My right hon. Friend and others talked about cuts in training in certain areas and asked what the pattern was. We should begin by saying that there has been a massive increase in the number of training places made available since the Labour Government came to power. As a consequence, there is a massive number of new entrants into nursing. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> was good enough to acknowledge that. However, in every public service there is a tendency to regard the training budget as the first to go&mdash;the soft target&mdash;and as former Minister with responsibility for skills, I am highly aware of that. We need to monitor the impact of decisions on training budgets, and we will do that, but it would be wrong to use words such as crisis and decline; we have to adopt a measured approach and should always look at the issues in context.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth talked from personal experience about the realities of nursing in the past. What she said about academic snobbery is absolutely true of the way that this country treats vocational education and training generally. Frankly, if we are to be successful in our public service ambitions and in the economic challenges that we face, we have to change that almost uniquely English snobbish approach to vocational education and training&mdash;I can feel myself making one of my speeches as a former Minister with responsibility for young people and adult skills. That is a real problem that is endemic in the culture of this country, and we have to attack it in every way that we can.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/8">My hon. Friend also referred to the Chancellor's role in ensuring unprecedented levels of investment in the national health service, year on year. Frankly, it was an act of political leadership for him to tell people not long ago that increasing national insurance by 1 per cent. was merited and morally right if we wanted the kind of national health service that this country deserves. What was interesting about that decision and that leadership is that&mdash;if we remember the political climate at the time and the electoral consequences of that decision&mdash;people actually endorsed it. It was right to be honest and to say that to achieve the growth in NHS investment required, difficult decisions would be necessary. People in this country cherish and value the national health service and believe that there is nothing more important than investing in it and ensuring that it continues to be something that we can be proud of in any international context.</p>

	<p pid="b.475.0/1">The Minister is multi-talented. He referred to his time at the Department for Education and Skills, so he will be aware of the need to ensure that training places fit the needs of industry and commerce. In nursing, there is a question whether the commissioning of places actually reflects hospital needs. That has not been touched on so far; will the Minister do so?</p>

	<p pid="b.476.0/1">It is common sense to look into that and make sure that the content of training reflects the needs of the health service, not just now but in future. That links to the point that the hon. Gentleman made about primary and community care, which I shall address in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.0/2">My hon. Friends the Members for Brentford and Isleworth and for Crawley talked about the heroes and heroines who work on the front line of our national health service every day, making a difference to the quality of people's lives, and indeed saving lives, and it is important to mention them in an abstract, general debate such as this. We cannot possibly mention them all today. However, for family reasons, I have recently experienced what they do, so I know that not only their expertise and specialist knowledge, but their sensitivity and compassion make a tremendous difference when a person has health difficulties. We are very fortunate with the quality and calibre of the people who nurse on the front line in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.0/3">The hon. Member for Southport described this place as the last Victorian asylum, and most of us would agree, although inmates&mdash;at least some of them&mdash;are allowed home at weekends. The hon. Gentleman was good enough to acknowledge the Government's and the profession's success in work force development in the context of nursing. He said that it would be disingenuous not to welcome the long-term strategy, but expressed concerns about what is happening now and how that might undermine it. I certainly regard one of my responsibilities as keeping a close eye on ensuring that the challenges that we face do not end up undermining that long-term strategy, which, as the hon. Gentleman said, enjoys a tremendous amount of consensus.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.0/4">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" name="John Baron">the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase> for welcoming me to my new position. That is probably where we part company; I do not think that we shall agree on much else. It is difficult for Labour Members to hear Conservative spokespeople talking about financial and resourcing difficulties in the national health service. It sticks in the throat a little, not because of naked, tribal party politics, but because of the real-life history of the national health service between 1979 and 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.0/5">There were real-terms cuts, a dramatic decline in morale and a belief that people who worked in public services were leaching the public purse rather than making a massive contribution to the well-being of this country. The criticisms and challenges from the Conservative party do not have the same credibility and legitimacy as genuine concerns expressed by trade unions, members of the professional bodies and Labour Members of Parliament. As a Government, we have been willing to match rhetoric, passion and a belief in the health service with hard, real additional resources&mdash;and reform and modernisation&mdash;to recognise the needs of patient care in the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.0/6">The hon. Gentleman talked about the Government's micro-managing the NHS and so on. Actually, under the NHS reforms, we have been devolving more and more responsibility and power to the front line. Equally, I do not believe that we should take politics entirely out of the national health service; in my view, it is one of the great dividing lines of British politics. No wonder the Conservative party wants to take politics out of the national health service.</p>

	<p pid="b.477.1/1">I cannot give way, as I do not have enough time. The hon. Gentleman mentioned micro-managing the national health service. When we say to trusts and managers, &quot;You have deficits, and it is about time you brought them under control. You have to make difficult decisions. We cannot allow the situation to go on because it destabilises the national health service,&quot; we get criticised. We leave people to make some of those difficult choices at a local level in local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/2">We shall take no lessons on the national health service from the Conservative party. I shall listen to constructive suggestions, comments and even criticisms. However, to pretend that the NHS is in some kind of meltdown or crisis is disingenuous and dishonest from a party that starved the service of resources and demoralised it.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/3">The hon. Gentleman says that there has been a decrease in the number of primary care and community care nurses. I shall correct that for the record. The number of nurses in primary and community care in this country has increased by 37 per cent. since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/4">The health service is in a good position. There are daily challenges; demography itself means that we face an ever-growing elderly population with acute health needs. However, we can be proud&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.478.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="478"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0004.htm#06052454000415">
	<p pid="b.478.1/1">It is a pleasure to lead this debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. I am on the Opposition side of the Chamber because of the defects of this room: only from here can one look straight into the eyes of the Minister to assess the reaction to the comments that one has made. The possibility of my having defected is roughly equivalent to that of Lord Adonis making warm and complimentary comments about community comprehensives.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/2">I am glad to have secured this debate. Animal welfare is perhaps my highest personal political priority, and indeed this Government have a good track record on it in the legislation, regulation and changes that they have introduced since 1997. Nevertheless, there is more to be done in respect of laboratory animals and especially animal husbandry, which is at the core of today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/3">The Government's position on the common agricultural policy is rightly to move away from direct payments to farmers, which reward them for production, towards setting incentives for the delivery of public goods. England is to be congratulated as the only one of the four devolved regions to have moved immediately to a system of decoupled payments to farmers under pillar one of the common agricultural policy, but it is difficult to reconcile that position with the proposals in the draft England rural development programme, which aims to deliver public goods, but in which the ability to make payments for better animal welfare has not been utilised.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/4">The Government say repeatedly that the United Kingdom is the leading country in Europe on animal welfare, and I go along with that view to a considerable extent. If that is the case, however, the ERDP ought to present an opportunity to demonstrate that leading position in Government policy, and to provide further incentives to continue to improve welfare standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/5">Let me review the background to opportunities for RDPs. New rural assistance measures were agreed by the European Union in June last year under regulation 1698. There are six elements in axis 1&mdash;membership of food quality schemes, food quality promotion, training, farm advisory services, investment in agricultural holdings and meeting Community animal welfare standards&mdash;and one in axis 2: payment for higher animal welfare standards. Under the European regulation, member state Governments can include those seven measures in their RDPs.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/6">The first ever European animal welfare strategy was agreed by Farming Ministers as recently as January this year. It set down, for the first time, how the EU believes animal welfare should develop in the 2007-13 period, and the goals for the Commission and Farming Ministers. The strategy sets five areas of action, including updating minimum standards for animal welfare, introducing animal welfare indicators so we can measure progress and better informing animal keepers and handlers of current standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/7">At the UK level, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs set itself two public service agreement targets on animal welfare: PSA 5, to deliver a more competitive and sustainable farming industry, and PSA 9, to improve the health and welfare of kept animals. I strongly support both those targets. Additionally, strategic indicators relating to animal welfare are being developed in the DEFRA animal health and welfare plan and in the Curry commission plans. In other words, there is an overarching commitment at the European and domestic levels to drive forward improved animal welfare standards, and of course I welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/8">So what features in the draft ERDP, which is currently out to consultation? It includes only one reference to improving animal welfare, and that one, which deals with training, has existed under pillar two opportunities since 1999. I am sad to say that DEFRA has apparently ignored measures central to the theme of making agriculture more competitive, which would provide crucial links with other opportunities while being measurable and providing value for money, which are both important characteristics.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/9">There appears to be a manifest misunderstanding of animal welfare and what seeking improved standards can achieve, as there is no joined-up thinking between the animal welfare part of DEFRA and the team responsible for drawing up the ERDP, whose expertise appears to be in environmental measures only. Animal welfare has been ignored, even in areas where it could be easily incorporated. For instance, paragraph 47 of the draft lists</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/10" class="indent">&quot;innovation for marketing of high value products&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/11">as a priority, but it does not list any scheme or incentive to achieve that priority for animal welfare. That could simply be rectified by including the words &quot;and those promoting higher welfare standards&quot;. I hope that the Minister will undertake to consider that point with a view to rectification or explain why DEFRA has decided to ignore almost all the measures available to improve animal welfare standards in that regard, in a misunderstanding of what improved animal welfare can deliver and a failure to match up with its own public service agreement targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/12">Of course, we need to measure animal welfare objectively and assess outcomes before they can feature effectively in the ERDP. Measurable indicators and outcomes for animal welfare do exist. The EU is funding a &euro;5 million academic project involving centres from the member states, including those in Scotland, Wales and England, to establish single indicators to measure good welfare, which will report in 2009 and form the basis of future EU legislation. It is an integral part of the Commission's action plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/13">Indicators have been drawn up by Bristol university for pigs, cattle and laying hens and they are already used on Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals freedom food farms to assess welfare. I contend that objective measures exist that could be used to measure animal welfare improvements, ensure value for money and provide a goal-oriented approach. We are told that England is a continental leader for animal welfare, so let us see how the draft ERDP measures up against the RDPs of other countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.480.1/1">It is a pleasure to intervene on my hon. Friend. Does he agree that part of the problem is that at the time of the last European budget round, every country, including the UK, made some of the cuts from rural payments and at the expense of some of the changes that we need to see in the rural economy? Is it not right that the Government should reconsider those cuts and lead the charge to say that if the CAP means anything, it should mean a different CAP that will invest in the rural economy rather than on production subsidies?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.480.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="480"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0004.htm#06052454000419">
	<p pid="b.480.2/1">I agree. When DEFRA is seeking cuts and reallocating resources, it tends to concentrate too heavily on rural payments&mdash;a point that I shall refer to later.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.2/2">I was considering how the ERDP measures up against other RDPs. With devolution, probably more than 50 RDPs will be drawn up in the EU. Most are still in consultation, but some have been announced and show how innovation can help. The Scottish RDP has three budget lines for encouraging animal welfare, including membership of an assurance scheme, completing a veterinary health plan and training. The response to those measures has been extremely positive, and they form the second most popular of all incentives given under the development plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.2/3">The existing Welsh RDP has animal welfare measures such as payments to reduce stocking levels, membership of an assurance scheme, improving knowledge of animal welfare through training and investing through the farm improvement grant to improve welfare standards in holdings. Finally, it has measures to improve the marketing of farm products that adhere to minimum animal welfare standards. The consultation on the Welsh RDP highlights the animal welfare pyramid scheme and the intention to give incentives to farmers who enter into agreements committing to higher welfare standards than the baseline ones under agri-environmental schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.2/4">Finally, to deal with our third fellow country, the Northern Ireland draft plan has three measures for animal welfare, including marketing and processing grants and grants to change over to higher standards of animal welfare. In Germany, the RDP provides intensive grants for investment costs in nine sectors: laying hens, turkeys, pigs, beef and dairy cattle, broilers, suckler cows, goats and sheep&mdash;this sounds like a farming report&mdash;providing that higher welfare standards are met. Those standards include not exceeding stocking densities of 25 kg per square metre for broiler chickens, as opposed to the proposed 38 kg per square metre under the draft directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.2/5">Another example is Austria, which recently submitted its RDP for agreement with the Commission and highlighted a number of ways to promote innovation and the marketing of higher welfare products. As a final exemplar, the RDP budget in France has rewarded farmers who have produced a higher welfare standard. The animal welfare measures that have been used have again included reducing stocking density, enlarging pig stalls, reducing live transport times and giving access to green pastures. Incidentally, all those measures have proved successful and&mdash;this is an important characteristic&mdash;cross over into promoting French produce.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.2/6">I feel that the ERDP as drafted is unimaginative in comparison with many others in Europe and the UK, and that it risks putting English farmers at a competitive disadvantage. We would expect the draft ERDP to align closely with DEFRA strategy, would we not? So let us just see whether it does. One of the measures in the DEFRA animal welfare strategy is higher animal welfare incentives. The strategic policy driver is the sustainable food strategy PSA 9. What action is mentioned in the ERDP? None. The second of the four measures is a more competitive farming sector, as set out in the sustainable food strategy PSA 5. How much reference is there in the ERDP? None. The third of the four measures is sustainable farming, including animal health and welfare, which is again a DEFRA strategic priority, addressed in PSA 5. What reference is made in the ERDP? None. Fourthly, encouraging innovative approaches to farming, such as knowledge transfer, skills training and so on is part of the UK sustainable development strategy, in article 201. What ERDP action is there? Not none, but it is unclear whether any will be animal welfare specific. The ERDP as drafted is a poor match with the strategic drivers for animal welfare policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.2/7">What other drivers are there? The ERDP has no measures for supporting animal welfare, yet there are many other drivers for improved standards that have economic implications for farmers. Many directives have started to phase out certain intensive methods of farming, such as 1999/74 and 2001/88, which phase out the battery cage system and sow stall respectively, and directive 1997/2, whose prohibition of the veal crate system is finally fully operational in member states. Itis important that we measure and ensure cost-effectiveness. All those changes have economic implications for farmers. They have all been costed, but the legislative drivers are currently missing from the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.2/8">I conclude with the tightness of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the budget, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> referred. For the ERDP, the provisional figures show that &pound;1.48 billion of payments are committed for 2007-13, and that &pound;1.8 billion is available. There is therefore still some scope, despite a cut of 22 per cent. for the pillar 2 budget, as announced and agreed in December 2005, which means that some &euro;19 billion will not be available. There is a tight budget, but there are still some incentives that have win-win consequences for more than one issue, and which deliver measurable goals against the national agricultural strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.2/9">There is no section in the ERDP that shows howthe measures will have more than one positive consequence. I fear that no imaginative thinking has gone into establishing how that could occur. Naturally, any policy suggestions must be carefully costed if they are to be proposed as effective measures. The RSPCA has provided costed figures for four measures that have been proposed as indices for inclusion in the ERDP. I will only list those indices, and not indicate the nature of the costings. They are as follows: first, the animal health plan; secondly, training for stockmanship; thirdly, conversion of slatted floors to solid; and fourthly, improved forage for pigs. So there are clear economic data on which to base policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.2/10">Do the public care? EU citizens regard animal welfare as an important part of rural development responsibilities. A recent survey showed that 88 per cent. of the public regard animal welfare as a priority issue of funding for RDPs. In the UK, protecting animal welfare was seen as the most important issue for the public under the RDP. Farmers also want the measures. They are not being dragged into this unwillingly. The review of the Welsh RDP scheme, Tir Mynydd, found that schemes concerning two of the three animal welfare objectives&mdash;stocking density and assurance&mdash;had the highest numbers of uptake of the seven options available. That is a small example to show that farmers are seeking such measures, and will warmly sign up to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.2/11">What will the Minister say in a moment or two? Of course, he might now be tempted to say, &quot;Well sit down and let me say it.&quot; He will probably argue that England already has excellent standards of animal welfare&mdash;I have not seen his civil service brief lying on a photocopier on an upper floor&mdash;and that further improvements will be delivered by the market. He may claim that English farmers already exceed EU baseline standards. In anticipation of those remarks, I ask him to address three key points. First, I ask the Minister, who has a highly urban seat&mdash;I know that he will get out a lot from now on&mdash;what is the evidence that farmers exceed baseline standards? Secondly, does he agree that there is a significant risk that the ERDP as drafted will disadvantage English farmers? Finally, does he agree that it is important that policy should continue to develop under his stewardship, with his talents, perception and energy, to demonstrate a commitment to higher welfare standards to join the pantheon of successes that we have proudly witnessed under this Government in the past nine years?</p>

	<p pid="b.482.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> on securing this debate, which is timely given the end of the consultation and the importance of animal welfare to the Government and all hon. Members present.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.0/2">I am encouraged that our consultation on the priorities for the next rural development programme in England, which closed on Monday, has provoked a debate about the best way to use the funding available to tackle the challenges facing rural communities in England. In addition to the feedback that we have received from regional events during the consultation, I understand that at the last count we had received about 150 written submissions. Of course, we will carefully analyse those responses, and we will make our decision on the priorities for the next programme in the light of the comments received and my hon. Friend's remarks today.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.0/3">In the consultation, we set out a number of key principles for the use of rural development funding. What I want to get across today is that one of the most important of those principles is that programme funding should demonstrably add value. I am sure that the budget available for the next programme will be limited, as budgets always are, so we must be aware of the need to spend money where it will have maximum impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.0/4">We are still not clear exactly how much will be allocated to the UK, and we have yet to take decisions on what use to make of voluntary modulation and associated match funding. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">My hon. Friends the Members for North-West Leicestershire and for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> both asked about the December budget. I have received the RSPCA briefing on that issue, which I know other hon. Members have also received, but it does not take into account the fact that the budget is to be supplemented by compulsory modulation and the EU budget for rural development in the EU15. Because of that supplement, which must be co-financed by member states, we expect that the amount of EU funding available for the next RDP in England will be slightly higher than for current programmes. I want to correct any misunderstanding on that situation, because the briefing was perhaps misleading in that respect, although not intentionally, I am sure.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.0/5">The key point to stress is that we acknowledge that December was the occasion for cutting a deal and, as my hon. Friends suggested, whenever a deal is cut there are compromises to be made, but we must not lose sight of the great victory that we won then: the review of the common agricultural policy in 2008 and all that that will mean for the pattern of spending in rural communities that we have piloted. We are establishing the approach and we are at the forefront in Europe in trying to pull money away from pillar 1 and into pillar 2 precisely on the areas of spending that we have all said are so important.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.0/6">As my hon. Friends have highlighted, the framework for the next programme&mdash;the rural development regulation&mdash;is broadly drawn, allowing for a wide range of activities. That flexibility recognises that rural development needs vary across the EU. New member states may need to focus the available funding on achieving basic community standards, including those on animal welfare, but that may not represent the best value for money in other member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.0/7">I take up the challenge that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire laid down in his three final points. I am happy to write to him on the first point: what evidence there is that farmers exceed baseline compulsory legal minimum standards of animal welfare in England. In my discussions with ministerial colleagues in the Department who have responsibility specifically for animal welfare, I was assured that they are confident that many farmers in England achieve higher&mdash;in some cases substantially higher&mdash;standards of animal welfare.</p>

	<p pid="b.483.0/1">I do not want to condensethe Minister's reply, but may I ask whether he acknowledges that in our fellow countries of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland those higher-than-baseline standards exist, but those countries have also found it possible within their own draft suggestions to incorporate animal welfare, which is incredibly difficult to value as a public good? I acknowledge that that is the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.484.0/1">My hon. Friend leads me on to my next point. I recognise another point that was made clearly in the RSPCA briefing: in the programmes put forward in Scotland and Wales there are variations in emphasis. I stress that I believe that they are variations in emphasis and, in some cases, variations in decision. That is what I would seek to explain.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/2">One should not be surprised&mdash;certainly not in this Chamber&mdash;that the outcome of devolution is that each part of the United Kingdom determines its own priorities and takes account of the evidence of need, farming practices and environmental circumstances that is specific to them. Our countries are different and our rural development programmes will be different. Exactly how we use the new programmes to support animal health and welfare objectives is, of course, one of the areas where there may be a divergence, not because we have a different view of the importance of the objective, but because we may have different ways of reaching it.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/3">As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud in the House last week, we recognise the importance of good animal health and welfare standards in the farming industry, but we are confident that farmersin England achieve animal welfare standards thatmeet and sometimes exceed the minimum legal requirements. We therefore want to target the resources that we have not towards existing good practice, but on new ways of making agriculture more competitive and sustainable, through a focus on skills and innovation. In line with that approach, we proposed that we could use funding&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.484.4/1">It would be difficult to do that within the parameters of this debate, but I shall certainly write to my hon. Friend and elaborate on his point.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.4/2">I think we all agree that we face major environmental challenges, such as protecting and enhancing biodiversity, protecting the quality of our waterways and mitigating the effects of climate change. The agri-environment schemes have a proven track record, but they must cover a greater proportion of farmland if we are to meet those future challenges. Aside from rural development programme funding, there are no alternative sources of funds available in sufficient quantity to meet those major challenges. Our focus for the next programme is therefore to sustain our commitment to environmental stewardship as a scheme that is open to all farmers.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.4/3">My hon. Friends will recognise that the environmental stewardship programme and the funding that it will make available will have an impact on stocking levels&mdash;a point that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire said was specifically mentioned in other countries' programmes. The fact that that may not be specifically mentioned here does not imply that it will not be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.4/4">We decided to focus on those key environmental challenges. An independent report conducted for DEFRA in 2004 found that the cost of a national animal welfare scheme was likely to be high due to various factors, such as diversity among livestock farmers, variability of welfare incidents and the need for assessment and monitoring. We decided not to divert our rural development funding away from that core environmental priority. However, we recognise that there are potential links between particular agri-environment measures such as stocking densities and animal welfare outcomes. Indeed, colleagues referred to the proposal made by the Welsh Assembly in its consultation to consider animal welfare issues in its forthcoming review of agri-environment schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.4/5">In England in 2007-08, we will review progressunder environmental stewardship. The RSPCA has considered how incentives for animal welfare could be provided under the rural development programme. It has done so in its report, &quot;Into the fold&quot;, and that work will provide valuable input to our thinking, but to return to where I began, we must be able to demonstrate the added value of what we are spending. I am sure that colleagues will recognise that not only we, but the EU as a whole, have a significant amount of work to do on animal welfare and we must work together to take that forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.4/6">My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire referred to the support provided under farm assurance schemes. Farmers who participate in food quality schemes generally do so either with a view to obtaining a price premium, when their participation is rewarded through the market, or because they need to do so to sell to a specific market, as is often the case with baseline assurance schemes and which is also rewarded through the market. The RSPCA's freedom food scheme is an assurance scheme that promotes high animal welfare standards and is a good exampleof what can be achieved without Government intervention. Given that fact and the high proportion of farmers who already belong to assurance schemes, we believe that relatively little additional public benefit would be gained from supporting such schemes financially through the programme for England. That has been our thinking. It is not that we think the schemes are not valuable ways of achieving animal welfare outcomes, but that we think we should put our money where it will achieve added value and where there is a market failure. In this case, we do not believe that to be so.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.4/7">Encouraging innovation aimed at developing new markets and new value-added products is one way of helping to make our farming industry more competitive. That could include support for marketing on the basis of higher animal welfare standards, either alone or in combination with other innovative ways of improving farm competitiveness. We have proposed that support for such innovation could be an area of focus for the next programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.4/8">I have been speaking about animal welfare in the context of the rural development programme, but I want to remind colleagues of the wider picture in England on animal health and welfare issues, which we feel is important, and our approach to addressing those issues. We are working in partnership with industry to promote wider use of a proactive approach to health planning on farms, including management of livestock diseases that have welfare implications. We are doing that by supporting a culture change in the industry with consistent messages and better communication about the benefits of a risk management-based approach at farm level. Our approach supports greater use of the farm health and welfare plans, to which the codes of recommendations for the welfare of livestock refer.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.4/9">My hon. Friend said that the proposals for the next programme are a missed opportunity as they focus on limited traditional areas and do not look widely enough at Government objectives&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.487.2/1">Thank you,Mr. Bercow, for this opportunity to raise the issue of community hospitals. First, I would like to pay tribute to workers in the national health service, especially those who are involved in patient care. I am sure that anyone who has been directly involved personally or through a family member will wish to join in that tribute to NHS workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.2/2">A local journalist asked me on the telephone, &quot;Will this be your usual Haslar speech, Peter?&quot; I said that it would not be my usual Haslar speech, but I would of course be referring to Haslar, specifically the Royal hospital Haslar, which I would claim has become one of the best known hospitals in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.2/3">The background is that the Royal Naval hospital Haslar, which had become the only hospital within the armed forces, became the Royal hospital Haslar. It was, in effect, operating as a second district general hospital in the Gosport area when in 1998, to everyone's astonishment, it was announced that it would close not earlier than 2000. That caused serious problems in the armed forces. They studied various sites where they might locate a hospital and eventually settled, not with great enthusiasm, on the Selly Oak site in Birmingham. They were cheered by the fact that &pound;200 million would be spent on an all new, all-singing and dancing centre that would provide them with messing, sports and other facilities in Birmingham. Unfortunately, however, that project was cancelled. Within the armed forces now, there are serious shortages in most of the important faculties. I shall return to the issue of armed services medicine later in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.2/4">The reaction in the south Hampshire area to the closure was one of anger and disbelief. I shall not recount all the facts, as they are very much on the parliamentary record, but there was an unprecedented march of some 22,000 people demonstrating against the closure of the hospital. We demonstrated in every way we could think of to catch the public eye. Wehad &quot;Save Haslar&quot; in lights photographed from a helicopter, we had a relay taking a petition to Downing street, we had demonstrations outside Downing street, and we had many debates in Parliament. After much pressure was applied, a deal was cobbled together with the health authorities whereby Haslar would indeed be saved and would continue to be used for local medical facilities and for the armed forces as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.2/5">Unfortunately, in what I regard as a shameful chapter in the history of health care in south Hampshire, the primary care trust went back on the agreement. It &quot;consulted&quot;. Whenever one uses that word in connection with the NHS, one has to put it in inverted commas, because the result of a consultation is usually well known before the consultation takes place. There was local discussion, aided by the consultation, of whether Haslar or Gosport War Memorial hospital should continue as the local community hospital. The votes for Haslar were overwhelming, but at a meeting in a church in Fareham, the PCT unanimously voted against popular wishes and decided to close Haslar and continue the Gosport War Memorial hospital, on the basis of what I have to say was some very unreliable information on matters such as costings, car parking and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.2/6">Later, I chaired a packed meeting in St. Mary's church, Alverstoke, in Gosport. I believe that 800 people were present, with many standing at the back of the church. We took a vote on whether we wished Haslar or Gosport War Memorial hospital to continue. To my disbelief, every single hand went up in favour of Haslar. I remember asking, &quot;Is there no one here who wishes to say anything in favour of the primary care trust's proposals?&quot; but not a single soul supportedthe PCT.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.2/7">We went through the statutory procedure. Hampshire county council's overview and scrutiny committee referred the matter to the Minister for reference to the Independent Reconfiguration Panel. I went to see the Minister, who turned down reference to the IRP. The Minister's veto means that Gosport is the only place in the whole of the United Kingdom that the IRP cannot investigate. It has widened its brief, but the only place in which it cannot take an interest is Gosport.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.2/8">So there we stand. The Royal hospital Haslar is to have its Ministry of Defence support withdrawn with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>. Arrangements are in hand for the local hospitals trust to take over responsibility for the hospital until summer 2009, when the private finance initiative bid at Queen Alexandra hospital will be completed, and the plan is that Haslar will close thereafter. However, the plan was that Haslar would close in 2000; it is now 2006 and Haslar is still there.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.2/9">I turn now to the general picture in the national health service as it relates to hospitals. Spending has increased&mdash;it has almost doubled&mdash;from &pound;40 billion to &pound;76 billion, but most of that increase has gone on salaries, drugs and compensation, and there has been a 66 per cent. increase in the number of managers. There have been various problems: we all know, for example, that it is much easier to admit someone to a district general hospital than to transfer them out of one, particularly because the Government, in their wisdom, have changed the standards for nursing homes and required them to widen their doors, raise their ceilings, put in en-suite bathrooms and so on. As a result many nursing homes have closed, and the loss of nursing home places has made it difficult to get people out of district general hospitals and into nursing homes. The Government have therefore resorted to the rather shabby process of fining councils that do not have enough nursing home places. Hampshire county council, to give one example, has had to build places in nursing homes.</p>

	<p pid="b.488.0/1">Although I do not agree with all the hon. Gentleman's preliminary comments, does he agree that one of the problems is that the market has, in a sense, been created the wrong way round? It does not give PCTs sufficient powers or resources and does not allow them to be big enough to be comparable in power to acute hospitals. Where acute hospital trusts have had problems, they have, in their enfeebled position, transferred financial pressures into areas over which they have more control, such as community hospitals. Perhaps the Government have now addressed that by allowing larger PCTs to emerge, similar to the one that has always been present in North-West Leicestershire, which is more comparable to the acute hospitals in the area. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.489.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" speakername="Peter Viggers" colnum="489"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0006.htm#06052454000430">
	<p pid="b.489.0/1">I do agree. PCTs have been required to pay so much of their budget to hospital trusts that it has been difficult for them to develop the community facilities that are needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/2">I would describe some of the difficulties in the national health service as tactical problems, which derive from the Government's obsession with micro-management. Let me give three examples of that micro-management in the setting of targets. A cancer specialist was sitting in her consultation room, when a manager burst in and said, &quot;You must see the woman in the waiting room immediately.&quot; The cancer specialist said, &quot;I cannot possibly see her. She hasn't been referred to me by a GP. I haven't got her notes. She has not been given any tests. It would be absolutely pointless for me to see her.&quot; The manager said, &quot;You must see her immediately. She's been booked in. Every minute that she sits there runs against our averages. You must see her now.&quot; I can vouch for the truth of that story because I am married to the doctor in question.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/3">I can also vouch for the truth of my second example, although I will spare the blushes of the person involved. I went to see a hospital manager, who told me, &quot;I know, Mr. Viggers, that you have not received the service that you need from this hospital group, but I can assure you that the situation will change. We have doubled the size of our complaints department and put three new people in the public relations department, so I am sure that you will get a much better service in future.&quot; People simply do not understand.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/4">I can vouch for the truth of the third example, as well. An accident and emergency unit had to meet its targets and set a period in which to do so. For weeks in advance and for weeks afterwards, there was distortion and difficulty and the unit was all over the place, but it met its targets during the relevant period. The important thing, however, is not meeting the target, but giving a good service.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/5">Let me also give an example of the manner in which the Government have messed around with primary care trusts. In my area, we had Gosport primary care trust, Fareham primary care trust and East Hampshire primary care trust. Then Fareham and Gosport were merged. Then, in an incredible move, it was decided that the two primary care trusts should share management facilities with another primary care trust. Then both were merged with East Hampshire. Now there is to be a merger for the whole of Hampshire. That is very bad management.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/6">I also have serious reservations about the PFI process. I was in the Treasury as a Parliamentary Private Secretary many years ago when the PFI process was first thought up. The point then was to bring private sector skills into the public sector. Now, however, the Government use the PFI process to get borrowing off balance sheet. It is a notable fact that about &pound;2 of borrowing is off balance sheet compared with every &pound;1 on balance sheet. That is very worrying.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/7">Another point is that the contractor who takes the risk under a PFI scheme is in the private sector&mdash;he is there to make money, not to lose money. Therefore, in assessing the risk over the 30 years or whatever the period is, he has to assume the worst from his point of view. Almost by definition, that means that the price will be at the higher rather than the lower end of the range. It would take a great deal of skill to make up for that higher price.</p>

	<p pid="b.490.0/1">Hearing &quot;PFI&quot; triggers in me a sort of Pavlovian response. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, despite all the wonderful things that the present Government have done in the NHS in the last nine years&mdash;I mean that seriously&mdash;the PFI is a blemish on that record? It is prohibitive in cost, flawed in concept and intolerable in consequence for taxpayers and the patients and staff in the NHS. More traditional and conventional forms of financing would have avoided some of the difficulties that the hon. Gentleman is illustrating so effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.490.1/1">Although I am spiritually in tune with some of the criticism made by the hon. Gentleman, I have to say that the PFI inevitably has some disadvantages. I remember attending a meeting addressed by Sir John Bourn, the head of the National Audit Office. He pointed out that contractors who had undertaken PFI arrangements over the past 30 years had done so before the invention and use of the MRI scanner, which blew all the estimates sideways. None of us knows how medical technology will evolve in the next 30 years, so it is impossible to take a clear and firm view about the next 30 years. There is much to be said for PFI schemes if they are properly administered, but they need to be reviewed every five years or so.</p>

	<p pid="b.490.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that if cottage hospitals such as Swaffham and Thetford in my constituency are to continue their excellent work, Government funding must take into account their position in relation to county hospitals? In Norfolk, the Queen Elizabeth hospital in King's Lynn, the Norfolk and Norwich hospital and others used by constituents in my area face a shortfall in funding. That has a profound effect on the services that they deliver and in turn puts more pressure on the cottage hospitals that serve the same community.</p>

	<p pid="b.490.3/1">My hon. Friend is an assiduous campaigner on behalf of his local hospitals and he makes a fair point on behalf of his constituents, for which I thank him.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.3/2">On a strategic basis, because there will always be unlimited demand for medical care, a mechanism is needed to govern its use. The present Government will never be able to get that right: their commitment is to central control, including central control of spending, which will always hamper them. The Government ranks are notably short of business skills and experience and notably full of those who have only spent rather than ever earned money. Conservative principles will be to seek harmonious arrangements with the national health service and an integration of the private sector. We need to choose good managers and then to trust them.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.3/3">As it is, we have a cash crisis. The health services in Hampshire overspent by &pound;80 million in the year before the election, and we are told by Sir Ian Carruthers that after adjustments they will need to recover some &pound;160 million, preferably during the current year. That leads to intolerable pressures and the closure of hospitals. At present, there are about 350 community hospitals and 80 or 90 are under threat.</p>
	<p pid="b.490.3/4">That brings me to January 2006 and the document &quot;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&quot;. I am sure that I and my hon. Friends would support many of the principles that are articulated in it. To quote a statement from that document:</p>
	<p pid="b.490.3/5" class="indent">&quot;Some community hospitals are currently under threat of closure... we are clear that community facilities should not be lost in response to short-term budgetary pressures&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.491.1/3">I very much welcome that, and I would like to fold in another reference to the armed forces, which I mentioned earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.1/4">In 1998, the Government decided to sever the link between armed forces personnel and the armed forces medical services, so that instead of persons in the Army, Navy and Air force automatically being treated by Army, Navy and Air Force doctors, nurses and paramedicals, they are now given initial primary care at the front by their own personnel and then shipped back, after which they are reliant on the national health service. There is therefore no necessary link between armed forces personnel and those who are injured, which can have some extremely disadvantageous effects.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.1/5">To cite an example from a newspaper on Sunday, a reservist who had severe spinal injuries was given a walking stick and told to find his way to his own general practitioner. He has had nine operations on his back, which is still causing him extreme difficulty. That has happened because although personnel in the regular armed forces have priority in the national health service, reservists do not.</p>

	<p pid="b.492.1/1">I was pointing out that armed service personnel are no longer treated within the armed forces but are treated within the national health service, where they are supposed to receive priority. There are two problems with that. First, reservists, when they are dismissed from active service, do not get priority. Secondly, there is no point in having priority if there is no service to have priority within. I specifically cite mental health services. A significant number of service personnel, particularly reservists who have served in Iraq, are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder but there are no facilities within the national health service to treat them and the only residential unit has closed. Within the Hampshire Partnerships NHS Trust, which treats mental health patients in the south of Hampshire, there were no new consultations at all for many months last year. For both those reasons, I maintain that the present arrangement is not satisfactory. I know that service chiefs are seriously worried about the medical provision for armed services personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.1/2">There is such a difference between the Americans' attitude and ours. In America, the attitude is, &quot;If we put our boys and girls in harm's way, we will do anything to put them right if they are injured.&quot; The attitude in the British armed forces is that if someone is injured, facilities are available in the national health service and one must go and seek them. It is not satisfactory and service chiefs are worried.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.1/3">There is a model that we could develop. The Aldershot centre for health is a partnership between the Army and Blackwater Valley and Hart primary care trust. It provides excellent facilities, including GP practices and nursing teams, health promotion, diagnostics, counselling services, and drug and alcohol teams. It also has an Army medical reception ward, general practice and psychiatric services, and a standing medical ward. That is the kind of facility that I believe should be used as a model for the constituency hospital of Haslar in Gosport.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.1/4">I tabled a question last week asking the Secretary of State</p>
	<p pid="b.492.1/5" class="indent">&quot;whether his Department has assessed the Aldershot Centre for Health as a model which could be followed at The Royal Hospital Haslar.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.492.1/6">Rather encouragingly, the Ministry of Defence states that it</p>
	<p pid="b.492.1/7" class="indent">&quot;will be assessing options for innovative partnerships...particularly in the light of NHS developments and future military basing. However, it would be premature&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.492.1/8">not wrong, but premature&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.492.1/9" class="indent">&quot;to model another facility on the Aldershot Centre for Health until the functional success of the project has been evaluatedand any lessons have been identified.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>,<phrase class="date" code="2006-05-17">17 May 2006</phrase>; Vol. 446, c. 958W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.492.1/10">I hope that the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Health will work together and, even now, find a way ahead for the Royal hospital Haslar.</p>

	<p pid="b.493.1/1">I take careful note of what you say, Mr. Bercow. I will keep my remarks as brief as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.493.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase>. I, like him, want to talk about local problems. That is the best way to approach the difficult debate on how we can save our community hospitals and enhance our community services. I have a series of questions for my hon. Friend the Minister that relates largely to how &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot; is to be implemented, about which the hon. Gentleman spoke.</p>
	<p pid="b.493.1/3">I am the fortunate possessor of a document that was sent to all strategic health authority chief executives and directors of performance. It is a public document, so I am in no way leaking information, and it is entitled &quot;Moving care closer to home&quot;. It takes up two sides of paper, which is wonderful, because the issue does not need to be spelled out any more clearly, and it highlights community hospitals. I shall read two paragraphs from it:</p>
	<p pid="b.493.1/4" class="indent">&quot;In many parts of the country, community hospitals are an important part of the strategy of moving care closer to home. This vision for the future of community hospitals was set out in chapter 6 of the White Paper and the new generation of community hospitals could be either new or refurbished existing facilities. Further guidance will be available in the summer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.493.1/5">It would be nice to hear from the Minister when that further guidance will come. The letter goes on:</p>
	<p pid="b.493.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Where reconfiguration proposals of existing community hospitals relate to facilities that are clinically not viable, or which local people do not want to use, or which cannot economically be raised to modern standards, then local reconfiguration is right but we need to ensure that all such proposals are consistent with the long term strategy of the White Paper to move care closer to patients' homes. This is why the White Paper makes a commitment that&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.493.1/7">this is the important bit&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.493.1/8" class="indent">&quot;'PCTs taking current decisions about the future of community hospitals will be required to demonstrate to their SHA that they have consulted locally and have considered options such as developing new pathways, new partnerships and new ownership possibilities. SHAs will then test PCT community hospital proposals against the principles of this White Paper.' (para 6.43)&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.493.1/9">That is an important mechanism for primary care trusts, and in Gloucestershire all the trusts are facing cuts as a result of problems that I would argue are not of our making. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Well, that is not entirely true of my own primary care trust; I shall be very careful. However, I have always argued that it was wrong to create three primary care trusts in Gloucestershire; there should have been two, and we are now moving to one. Cotswold and Vale primary care trust&mdash;my local PCT, which I share with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>&mdash;was created with a deficit. That deficit has not got any worse; the problem is that we are in the strategic health authority from hell, and I look at <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> as I say that. It is continually overspent, and I could share some of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">my problems with the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.493.1/10">It is because of those problems that Gloucestershire, which has largely kept in balance, is being penalised. It is being asked to make good some of the problems of the strategic health authority and to come into balance very quickly. There is an argument going on&mdash;and I shall advance it with the Secretary of State&mdash;about how quickly we are expected to get into balance. That is a key debate, but I shall not say much more about that now. In my area, there is a proposal to shut Berkeley hospital. That proposal has been round the circuit before, but it is being eagerly progressed now.</p>

	<p pid="b.494.0/1">I have been following the story closely in the <i>Stroud News and Journal</i> and read the hon. Gentleman's remarks assiduously. I am sure that he is as confused as I am about whether his trust is required to balance the books in-year or over three years, because there appears to be conflicting advice coming from his hon. Friends on the Front Bench. Has he considered that, particularly in the context of Stroud maternity hospital?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.494.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" speakername="David Drew" colnum="494"  time="015:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0006.htm#06052454000441">
	<p pid="b.494.1/1">Absolutely; I shall come to Stroud maternity hospital in a minute, because I want that clarified. I have certainly made it clear to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that there is confusion about the difference between being brought into balance this year, and being brought into balance while dealing with historical problems, of which there are some in Gloucestershire, although they are nothing compared with those elsewhere in the strategic health authority. That is part of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/2">Shutting Berkeley in the south of my constituency and trying to relocate those facilities would be a highly dangerous path to take. I can see Berkeley being shut but there still being no money available to create new facilities in the Cam and Dursley area. I want to maintain Berkeley hospital. I am willing to look at the argument for a community hospital with a changed series of objectives. Berkeley hospital has done that well over the past decade and more but, for a population of 50,000 people, we cannot shut a facility until we open something else. I accept that Berkeley serves a smaller proportion of the population in the southern part of my constituency, but it can still fulfil a number of key objectives. If Berkeley were to close tomorrow, that would cause dramatic pressure elsewhere, on Stroud general hospital and, again, the acute facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/3">The cuts are being driven forward at a relentless rate&mdash;we are talking signed, sealed and delivered in five weeks, which is abhorrent. People cannot consult and come up with alternatives in that time. I intend to bring forward alternatives and we will test the model.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/4">It is good that the hon. Member for Westbury has gone to Stroud maternity hospital. I am glad he reads my local paper regularly&mdash;it usually quotes me correctly, so that is all well and good. The maternity unit is also being sacrificed, so my simple question for my hon. Friend the Minister is this: do the same criteria&mdash;which basically say that a better way forward has to be proven&mdash;apply to maternity units or are they purely to do with community hospitals? I am trying to elicit a reply because I have tabled a parliamentary question to that effect. I hope that the same criteria do apply and that we go through the same process, because there is a huge amount to do in Stroud already.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/5">We must know by which criteria we are to judge whether it is right to close and what the alternatives are. I state categorically that the proposals are wrong. We have defeated them before and I think that we will defeat them this time. Now things are more difficult, because of the backcloth of huge cuts, but I want clarification on whether those cuts are real and necessary, and have to be met within the time scale that some are suggesting. That is the basis of the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/6">&quot;Moving care closer to home&quot; is a useful document. It expresses in very precise terms what I think the Government want to happen. They want more facilities devolved to more local areas. However, the problem is that if facilities do not exist in a local area, it is difficult for services to be devolved to them. That is why I want some clarification about what we are doing and why. I want clarification about the funding streams and the alternatives if we lose the facilities. I would argue that funding and provision in Stroud are imbalanced, yetwe are still being asked to lose vital facilities. Consideration is even being actively given&mdash;although this is not part of the formal cuts&mdash;to hiving off Stroud hospital to a private enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/7">As someone who has worked through a health mutual, which I did for the Standish hospital site, I know a bit about the issue. I am not against looking at alternative models; what I am against is salami-slicing the NHS and saying, &quot;That's all well and good&quot;, when in fact we are losing facilities and nothing is being put in their place. I would want to test out the model and the notion that the surgical work at Stroud hospital can be removed and replaced with medical beds. They might be needed, because people have to go somewhere, but that would have a huge knock-on effect on what the Gloucestershire royal hospital and Cheltenham general hospital can cope with. More particularly, if we are talking about choice, there is not much of it when the choice is between the acute hospital and nothing, because that is what most people face.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/8">Those are my questions. I have written to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, but have not had an answer, although I have managed to talk to her privately about some of the issues. I shall continue to do so. We are lucky; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> has secured an Adjournment debate for Thursday on health services. If business works as it might, some of us will say more about this issue then.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/9">Community hospitals really matter. Stroud in particular has a wonderful league of friends, which is offering hundreds of thousands of pounds to rebuild the maternity unit, or parts thereof, and to work on other parts of the Stroud hospital estate. It seems contradictory&mdash;on the one hand, we say that we want partnership with the community; on the other, when the community brings forward such a partnership, the facilities in which it is prepared to invest are cut.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/10">The Government have to get a grip. They must be clear that such cuts are not necessary. There has to be some balancing of the books, but I want the Government's case to be proved to me. We should not be losing community hospitals, because they are the very things that we should enhance. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister has good things to say, at least about how the arguments on the health service in my area and the area around it should be taken forward. People should not just relentlessly drive the cuts forward over a short period. That is unacceptable.</p>

	<p pid="b.496.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase> on securing this debate; it is the second in which I have participated that emphasises the importance of our community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.496.0/2">In January, I joined the trustee group of community hospitals acting nationally toge<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">ther, which is chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase>; a number of other hon. Members have also joined. The group identified that of 322 hospitals in England, 80 were at risk of service cuts or closure at the point when it did that work. Three of those hospitals were in my constituency, and I want to draw the Minister's attention to what has happened in them so that he gets a picture of what is going on in some of the more remote parts of the country, where the issues are particularly relevant.</p>
	<p pid="b.496.0/3">As we have heard, the Government publishedtheir White Paper in February. It gave considerable comfort to those of us who are concerned aboutour community hospitals, as it suggested thatthe Government were listening to the concerns of the people who used those hospitals. Many of the arguments that we had put forward in the months leading up to the White Paper's publication coincided with those of the Government, so we had some sense that our message was getting through. It was disappointing, to say the least, that very little of the Government's message seemed to filter down to the bureaucrats who run strategic health authorities and primary care trusts that are responsible for running our community hospitals.</p>

	<p pid="b.496.1/1">I endorse the hon. Gentleman's remarks about <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the initiative taken by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase>, on which I congratulate him, to ensure that fragmented voices were turned into an organised chant.</p>
	<p pid="b.496.1/2">Some months ago, we were reassured about the apparent new direction for community hospitals; effectively, 5 per cent. of general hospital expenditure was to be transferred over 10 years. However, there is, was and will be a risk that the finances of those acute hospitals will be destabilised by the proposal. Perhaps the funds should not be top-sliced from their expenditure. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.496.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" speakername="Philip Dunne" colnum="496"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0007.htm#06052454000444">
	<p pid="b.496.2/1">Actually, the experience in Shropshire has been the reverse: the primary care trusts are helping to fund the acute hospital deficits. In Shropshire, the deficits have been created in the acute trusts. To repair their budgets, they are looking to extract money from the primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.496.2/2">In March, the primary care trust in my area eventually announced that it would not close any of the three hospitals in my constituency. That was a great relief to the community. The primary care trust then produced a document at the beginning of May. As I said directly to the trust when it presented the document to the overview and scrutiny committee, the service plan for Shropshire County primary care trust is a thin, weak document. It fails both to give the context in which the savings are supposed to be made and to provide any clear guidance about whether the proposed savings will be sufficient to meet the deficits that it seeks to identify.</p>
	<p pid="b.496.2/3">Bridgnorth community hospital has had a great deal of investment by the NHS over the previous 12 months and is currently in the process of being rebuilt, which is welcome. The document said that it would be saved and that it would face no job or bed cuts. That is a great tribute to the people of Bridgnorth, who campaigned actively to save it. The leader of Bridgnorth district council is listening to this debate, and I pay tribute to Councillor Elizabeth Yeomans for the work that she and many others did to save their hospital. That is the good news.</p>
	<p pid="b.496.2/4">The bad news relates to the other two hospitals. Ludlow community hospital is threatened with the closure of two of its wards, with the loss of more than 30 beds and many jobs&mdash;as yet, the detail has not been enunciated by the PCT. The hospital is faced with the closure of the final mental health ward in the Shropshire community, with the exception of a small number of beds in Whitchurch in north Shropshire. Bishop's Castle community hospital&mdash;the third hospital&mdash;will close; at least, there are plans for that to happen. The site will be handed over to a nursing home operator who currently operates on part of the site. The number of NHS-funded beds will be reduced from 24 this time last year to 12.</p>
	<p pid="b.496.2/5">The mental health aspect particularly worries me and many of my constituents in Ludlow. The primary argument is that this is a value-for-money exercise, as the mental health ward has not been operated in Ludlow at full capacity and should therefore be closed. The director of mental health in Shropshire County PCT has admitted in public meetings that it is not his preference to have to close the ward and that the decision is entirely driven by efficiency savings required by the PCT to help shore up the financial deficits in the remainder of the Shropshire health economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.496.2/6">One of the reasons why the mental health divisionin the PCT has operated so successfully within budget in recent years is that its primary provision is at the Shelton hospital. I understand that it is the second to last Victorian mental health asylum still operating in the UK, and it will be the last remaining one, because there are no plans to redevelop it for some time. While its staff do the best that they can, the provision is acknowledged to be substandard. The impact on patients who require acute care of going to that facility is likely to be significant and the impact on the carers who look after them is likely to be even more so, because the geography involved in travelling from the Ludlow catchment area to Shrewsbury is significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.496.2/7">I shall briefly illustrate that point. Yesterday, a group of concerned residents led by John Nash undertook a journey from Ludlow to Shelton for a theoretical one-hour visit by public transport. The six of them caught the 435 bus from Ludlow to Shrewsbury at 11.50 am. They had to change in Shrewsbury to catch the bus to take them to the hospital at Shelton. One of the group is a frail lady in her 80s who is a former physiotherapist, and she got home to Ludlow at5.40 pm, which represents a journey of almost six hours for a one-hour visit. She would currently be able to walk around the corner to her local community hospital. The ability for the carers of our most vulnerable mental health patients to continue to provide such family contact, as it were, will be severely reduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.496.2/8">I should like to dwell briefly on the impact of the closure of the other rehabilitation wards. The NHS has argued that it should justify the closures on the basis of an equity audit. The equity profile of primary care and community services for Shropshire County PCT, published in May 2005, argues that</p>
	<p pid="b.496.2/9" class="indent">&quot;NHS improvement, expansion and reform should narrow the health gap by ensuring that service planning is performed by an equity audit.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.496.2/10">The equity audit that has supposedly been carried out to justify the reduction of rehabilitation beds has not been made public. It has been argued that attempts are being made to provide a fairer allocation of beds across the county, which is why beds are being cut in Ludlow and Bishop's Castle. Yet the document also covers the question of need, which was not addressed in the PCT's latest analysis, among the 18 catchment areas in Shropshire. Four of them serve the Ludlow community hospital area, and they all have a higher need for the 65 to 74-year-olds, as identified in the summary, and all bar one are in the higher category for the 75-plus group. Three of the four catchment areas have the highest dependency ratio per catchment area in Shropshire. Three of the four have the lowest ratio of GPs per head of population in Shropshire, and two of the four have the lowest number of patients per practice nurse.</p>
	<p pid="b.496.2/11">There is a clear need for beds to be available in Ludlow, and for long-term beds in Bishop's Castle. I have been pressing the PCT to commit itself to a 10-year contract for NHS-funded beds. Experience elsewhere in Shropshire shows that it will commit to much shorter contracts, but that once they end, the number of beds is cut. That salami slicing cannot continue, or our community hospitals will all be closed within a short time.</p>

	<p pid="b.498.2/1">Thank you,Mr. Bercow. I will try to be brief.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.2/2">The NHS in Oxfordshire is in freefall. Today, the Oxford Radcliffe NHS Trust is telling its staff that between 650 and 700 posts will be lost&mdash;the exact number will be known tomorrow. By my calculation, that is equivalent to about 8 per cent. of the work force. The loss is occurring as a consequence of &pound;33 million of savings imposed on the trust, in addition to the&pound;17 million of savings that Oxfordshire PCTs have been obliged to make. As a result, the new and enlarged Bicester community hospital promised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" name="Alan Milburn">the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase> when he was at the Department of Health has now become a complete fantasy.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.2/3">The White Paper was another fantasy. &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot; repeated the promise made at the previous general election about having a new generation of community hospitals. Can the Minister tell the House where that new generation of community hospitals is? It is figment of the Minister's and the Department's imagination. There are no community hospitals. Then we are told that community hospitals no longer need beds and that the Government's new concept of primary care centres&mdash;better, larger GP practice centres&mdash;are somehow new community hospitals. It will not wash.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.2/4">Last week, I met the acting chief executive of the PCT, who said that because of the enormous squeeze on its budget it is concerned only about acute care. Anything that can be moved off into social care&mdash;anything that can be means-tested by the county council&mdash;will be moved. An article in one of the Sunday newspapers referred to a new kind of nursing home in Hampshire, in which people are moved from NHS beds simply to die under the responsibility of social care.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.2/5">We will see an increasing number of people who would have expected in the past to be treated at community hospitals shunted off to somewhere else in means-tested social care, because the NHS no longer has the funds to manage such cases. The PCTs say that they no longer wish to look after such patients. Somehow, they will become lost in the community. It is a disgrace. We are not going to see a new community hospital in Bicester. If we were to have a new generation of community hospitals of the sort that was promised at the Dispatch Box by the Secretary of State in the mid-1990s, one would have expected it to have been delivered. It is a fantasy.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.2/6">I want to know this from the Minister: what from this White Paper has ever been delivered? It is a public policy disgrace that Ministers come along and waste taxpayers' money with a fake consultation. No public meetings were ever organised in Oxfordshire on &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;; what the Government had was a fake meeting in Birmingham with a hand-picked audience. People are becoming increasingly cynical about what the Government are delivering, and I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> that the part of the Stroud newspaper that he ought to start reading is the appointments page, because given the way the Government are cutting&mdash;he used terms such as cuts and sacrifices&mdash;come the next election I fear he will be looking for another job. Clearly, as is evidenced in our debate, across the country, county by county, this Government are waging war on community hospitals and community medical services.</p>

	<p pid="b.499.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase> on securing the debate. Many useful points have already been made. The hon. Gentleman said that the Royal hospital Haslar is one of the best known in Parliament. That is true; it comes a close second after West Cornwall hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/2">I wish to raise a single issue, which I hope the Minister will respond to. It is to do with the thesis&mdash;or, as I would argue, mantra&mdash;that has been coming from the NHS Confederation, which is, as I understand it, the provisional wing of the NHS; it certainly puts out a lot of the arguments that Ministers might not be prepared to argue. Its argument is that the acute sector requires fewer hospital beds. It is a thesis that has become a mantra in the style of the management consultant culture that seems to have pervadedthe NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/3">What worries me is the way in which that approach relates to the future of community hospitals, which is a very pertinent question. When I have debated this matter with GPs nationally and locally and with the trusts that argue that we should push for such an approach, I can understand the frustration of those running the acute sector about large numbers of patients going into acute hospitals who, they argue, should not even be going through their front doors. In other words, they are saying that there are unnecessary admissions to acute hospitals. That may well be the case, and there is also another argument that has been made today and which is repeated regularly with regard to the difficulty of discharging patients once they have come into acute hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/4">The approach taken by the NHS Confederation&mdash;and supported by Ministers, I would argue&mdash;is causing a great deal of difficulty for acute hospitals and nursing staff, who have to cope with other Government targets on communicable diseases. In many acute hospitals, bed pressures mean that there is a lot of hot-bedding. Severely and acutely ill patients are being moved around hospitals or discharged from them, and other patients are moved in. One of the best ways of getting on top of infection control issues is to manage beds so there are surplus beds in acute hospitals, not too few.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/5">In order to achieve the outcome of fewer acute hospitals, which may be desirable in the longer run, the Government need to address such issues, many of which they have in fact contributed to. The way in which the primary care GP out-of-hours service is currently managed means that many patients are not seen by their GPs out of hours. Given an environment in which there is an increasingly litigious public, ambulance-chasing lawyers and so forth, on the precautionary principle many patients are admitted to acute hospitals when they do not need to be. That trend will inevitably continue, and it may get worse.</p>

	<p pid="b.500.0/1">As my hon. Friend will be aware, the out-of-hours service in our county of Cornwall has recently changed from a locally based service to a service provided by a much larger company. Does he agree that there are concerns in communities that the provisions under the new contract perhaps do not deliver as local people expect them to?</p>

	<p pid="b.500.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend, although in view of the time available I shall not elaborate. There is a scenario in which clinicians appear to be overruled by bed managers, while chronic conditions are still not well managed in the community and many patients who could be managed in the community therefore go into acute hospitals. Crucially, in the light of social services and primary care funding, it is not possible to discharge patients from acute hospitals to social services care or community hospitals, because beds have been cut. In my constituency and in many parts of the country it is becoming impossible to discharge such patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.500.1/2">To achieve the desired outcome I urge the Minister to recognise those factors and reflect on the need to front-load the argument by ensuring that investment is made in primary care and community hospitals and that there are sufficient social services resources to enable patients to be discharged safely to community hospitals or the community, away from acute hospitals.</p>

	<p pid="b.501.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">the debate and to my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase> for ensuring that it was called. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> has said, the survival of community hospitals in Oxfordshire is a huge issue&mdash;probably the most important in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.0/2">There are three community hospitals in my constituency: one in Wallingford, one in Didcot and one in Wantage. My constituents are also served by a fourth, in Abingdon. As the people of Oxfordshire are now well aware, we are suffering an acute financial crisis. Oxfordshire is part of the Thames Valley strategic health authority, which has the lowest funding per head in the country. By contrast, I understand that the strategic health authority that covers the Prime Minister's constituency is among those with the highest funding per head. I wonder whether that is a coincidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.0/3">The Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust is the most efficient large hospital trust in the country, yet it is being asked to make &pound;33 million-worth of cuts. My hon. Friend the Member for Banbury alluded to job losses. I understand that it may tomorrow also announce up to 150 bed closures. What will the result be? The answer is obvious: more pressure on our community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.0/4">The reason why those hospitals are called community hospitals is that they were built by the people who used them. They were built 70 or 80 years ago, by their communities, to serve their communities. Now they serve as an overspill for the John Radcliffe hospital, and just as they are under threat they are being asked to take on yet greater burdens.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.0/5">Every hon. Member who has spoken in the debate and has alluded to a sham consultation process is right. People who have made their feelings known and want community provision and a community hospital are completely fed up with the fact that every year a consultation is held to try to persuade them to want something that they do not want. The debate that goes on between the high-ups&mdash;the professionals who claim to know what they are talking about&mdash;and the people is about whether community care should be closer to home or in the home. It is put about that care in the home will be superior and better. I do not buy that. Most people in community hospitals are grateful for ready access to medical care and grateful to be with other patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">The vital thing, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> alluded, is that those hospitals remain in their communities. Particularly in predominantly rural counties, the idea that elderly relatives can easily visit relatives in a hospital that is 10, 12 or 15 miles away is ludicrous. The mayors in Wantage, Wallingford and Didcot did the same exercise as that in Shropshire, and they spent six hours getting from A to B and back again. Such easy visits are simply not possible. Two weeks ago, the A34, the main trunk road in my constituency, was closed after an accident. The scene was like something from a disaster movie. People took four hours to travel from Wantage to Didcot. We need community hospitals in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.0/7">It all comes down to money, I am afraid, and nothing angers people more than when the Government put out a White Paper saying that they will not close hospitals for financial reasons and that the money is there if the clinical case can be made. It is quite clear that these hospitals are being closed for financial reasons&mdash;there is no other reason. What particularly sticks in the craw of the people of Wantage is that they have just bought the land from the PCT to build a nursing home for &pound;800,000. It is being built and paid for by the community. The money has gone to the PCT, which is now going to use it for what? The PCT will try to close down their community hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.0/8">The idea that a county such as Oxfordshire can be served by one huge hospital and nothing else is laughable, and I have told my PCT again and again that it could have a far more reasonable debate with the people of Wantage, Wallingford and Didcot if it accepted the principle that people want a community service. Instead of saying, &quot;We are closing your hospital&mdash;let's consult about it&quot;, it should give some clear, credible, alternative proposals that people can sign up to.</p>

	<p pid="b.502.0/1">There have been a number of interesting contributions to the debate and I hope that the new Minister will take on board the strength of feeling of Members from all parties. As Members have mentioned, I am the chairman of CHANT&mdash;Community Hospitals Acting Nationally Together&mdash;which is an umbrella group for Members of all parties in the House of Commons, and those in the House of Lords, who are concerned about the future of community hospitals. They are concerned because they share precisely the aspirations of Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.0/2">Many hon. Members have already referred to &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;, but we do not just need to consider that document. The new Minister may have seen the previous primary policy instrument for this Government on health, the 2003 document, which was called&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;&quot;Keeping the NHS local&quot;. Before that, in 2000, we had the NHS plan, in which there was a commitment to bringing care closer to home. For six years, the Government have espoused views that Labour Back Benchers, Liberal Democrats, independents and Conservatives all agree make up precisely the vision that we need.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.0/3">However, when we look around the country, we find that the very community facilities needed to make the change from acute hospital-centred care to care given much closer to home&mdash;either in the home, where appropriate, or in the community close to home&mdash;are being closed down. Hundreds and hundreds of beds have been closed in community hospitals during the past six years, while the Government are espousing a need for care closer to home.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.0/4">The NHS Confederation has been mentioned. A few days ago, bizarrely, it issued a slim document called &quot;Why the NHS Needs Fewer Beds&quot;. In Hornsea community hospital in my constituency, the number of beds has been cut from 22 to 12 and there have been regular waiting lists. An elderly lady who could see the community hospital from her front room in Hornsea could not be admitted because there was a waiting list. Meanwhile, the chief executive and chairman of the acute trust in Hull told me that the hospital is often running at more than 100 per cent. capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.0/5">We have a bizarre conflict between stated Government policy and the reality on the ground. The Government should make good their position on health; all hon. Members recognise the near doubling of expenditure on the NHS. I hope that the new Minister might be like the new Home Secretary, coming to the Department with fresh eyes and able to see that it needs serious change. Members throughout the House want the Minister and the Department to defend our community hospitals and support them, because they will deliver the Government's policy for them. Until now, we have questions that have not been answered.</p>

	<p pid="b.503.1/1">It is a privilege to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase>, who has done an outstanding job in setting up the national co-ordinating campaign. All those of us who were fighting our individual campaigns knew that that needed to be done, and I take my hat off to him&mdash;he has done an excellent job and a service to us all.</p>
	<p pid="b.503.1/2">Earlier today, Mr. Bercow, you renewed your efforts to save the Nuffield speech and language unit in Ealing. A couple of days ago, I received a delegation of mental health users from the emergency clinic at the Maudsley hospital in south London who were desperate that their specialist centre should not be closed down. Every so often a collective, pseudo-ideological mania seems to take over some of our public services, and it can be seen in the way in which children are taught to read or taught through play; in the wholesale closure of mental hospitals and the decanting into the community of far too many people who are unable to cope; in the closure of special schools, which has been gathering pace; and in the current determination to say that the NHS needs fewer beds.</p>
	<p pid="b.503.1/3">I have time to make only one point to the Minister, and it is this: when he winds up the debate, will he please not tell us that it is for local decision takers to take responsibility? The Government are at the top of the tree, the community is at the bottom, and the so-called local decision takers, who staff the PCTs' bureaucracies, are in between. Which group is the odd one out? It is the one in the middle&mdash;the one that is not elected. It is the Government's responsibility to ensure that the systems that they set up are responsive to the communities that they are supposed to serve.</p>
	<p pid="b.503.1/4">Finally, the Minister should not tell us how much money he has been putting in. That is like saying that we are pouring more and more water into the bath when there is a great hole in the bottom of it. The bath will never be full, because the water will drain away faster than we can pour it in. We are interested not in the resources that are going in, but in the outcomes that are not coming out.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.504.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="504"  time="016:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0008.htm#06052454000454">
	<p pid="b.504.0/1">It is appropriate that the final contribution before the winding-up speeches should highlight the issue that underlay many of the other contributions, but which was not made explicit: accountability. What has run throughout the debate is the notion that local people are clearly expressing their preferences&mdash;the term &quot;sham consultation&quot; keeps coming up in these Westminster Hall debates&mdash;but that we can do nothing about it when nobody listens.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/2">That causes me to ask the fundamental question of whether we need to look at accountability in the national health service and decide whether we are satisfied with the present arrangement, whereby just one person&mdash;obviously, she is not present today&mdash;is accountable for the 1.3 million people who work in the NHS, or whether there needs to be closer, more local accountability. We have that in embryo form in local authorities' overview and scrutiny committees, but they are weak, and one of the few things that they can do&mdash;this links to the introductory remark made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase>&mdash;is to refer a decision to the Secretary of State and ask her, in turn, to refer it to the independent reconfiguration panel.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/3">I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's remarks, because his experiences are identical to mine. I had a hospital closure in my area, and the local authority asked the Secretary of State to have it looked at independently, but she refused. There is history in that respect. Although there is an independent panel, it does not, on average, get asked to look at the things that local authorities want it to consider, because the Secretary of State stands in the way. We therefore have no serious local accountability, and the one bit of local accountability that we do have gets overridden by the Secretary of State, who refuses to let someone independent look at things.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/4">We therefore need to look at serious local, democratic accountability in the NHS, and it will be interesting to find out in the Conservative winding-up speech whether there is anything in the Conservatives' plans, to the extent that they exist, to deal with local democratic accountability and to determine whether the people who make the decisions&mdash;it is rude to call them faceless, but they are the people whom we cannot get rid of&mdash;should be replaced or answerable to elected representatives, because, at the moment, they are not. That is the frustration.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/5">We have heard some important points. The hon. Member for Gosport, who secured the debate&mdash;I congratulate him on that&mdash;gave some powerful examples of micro-management and of targets distorting the NHS. I met a woman only this morning who had a specific need to see a particular consultant. She said that she was happy to wait to see the right person, but was told that she could not wait because she would go past the target. She was told that she would be sent to someone else and said that that specialist would not know about her. She was told that which did not matter and that she had to see a consultant so that she would be off the list. She went to see the other consultant, who asked, &quot;What are you doing here? I cannot help you.&quot; She said that she knew that but that she had been sent so that the box could be ticked. That is the sort of absurdity that arises.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/6">I was interested to hear from my constituency neighb<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">our, the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, about the situation in his area. He came up with a criterion with which many of us have sympathy. None of us is emotionally wedded to bricks and mortar. Buildings that were once fit for purpose may no longer be so or may be in the wrong place. No one is saying that nothing must ever change, but we want proper public engagement without a preconceived agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/7">It was good to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>&mdash;the Statler and Waldorf of the Labour Back Benches&mdash;pointing out that Government health policy rhetoric is fine, but the disjunction between the rhetoric and reality shows that the Department of Health is out of touch with what is really happening. The classic example is the White Paper on community hospitals. The disjunction is that when something goes wrong locally, the decision was made locally, but when 500 new or upgraded community hospitals are planned, they are the Government's responsibility. How can both be true simultaneously? The Government are responsible for good news and new hospitals, but bad news and closed hospitals are due to local decision making and nothing to do with the Government. Both cannot be true, so which is?</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/8">In t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">his very Chamber the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> properly raised the issue of his local community hospitals and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> raised another critical point about the absurd division between health and social care. While we have different budgets and something can be shunted into someone else's budget, the welfare of the individual will come second to the financial pressures. Again, the logic of the argument that we have heard today is that budgets should be merged and pooled with a single stream of health and social care funding and democratic, local accountability. Those are two big steps, but that is what I want and it would deal with many of the points raised. We would then have responsive public consultation and effective social and health care.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> properly raised the issue of capacity and the extraordinary situation that when beds are cut, occupancy rates rise well beyond the level at which even experts in infection control believe they can do a good job. There will then be another Government target, initiative and action plan to tackle MRSA or whatever the bug of the day happens to be. There is no joined-up thinking in the whole process.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">The hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase> made an important and incisive point about the difference between care closer to home and care in the home. People often slide between the two. It is assumed that we all want care closer to home, but many of us need specialist and local NHS facilities close to where we live which we can get to even when the A34 is blocked. The Government increasingly do not mean beds close to home; they mean people going from their homes to a super-GP clinic or something like that. There is no intermediate step.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/11">What is it about community hospitals that we favour? It is localness. Being treated close to home has a medical benefit, because loved ones can pop in and friends and family are nearby. It is the human scale of such hospitals. People do not want one dirty great hospital for the whole county. They want local hospitals where they know the names of the staff and can build a relationship. Caring for people locally is evidence-based medicine on a human scale and takes pressure off the large acute trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/12">We must not allow the myth to continue that community hospitals are inefficient and bad value for money. Putting someone in a small community hospital instead of tying up an expensive acute hospital bed is good value for money and good for the individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.504.0/13">We need a merger of health and social care budgets to avoid cost shunting and we need serious local accountability. We also need funding&mdash;funding is not irrelevant&mdash;and I have supported that, but we need more than funding and the Government should listen to what local people are saying because, at the moment, local people have no voice.</p>

	<p pid="b.506.0/1">We need to be clear about what we are dealing with. We are dealing with closures that have been prompted by deficits, which is the responsibility of Ministers. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> asked what the Conservatives would do to improve accountability. Accountability rests squarely with the Secretary of State for Health who, ultimately, is responsible for the closures that we have seen. Most Conservative Members would, for reasons to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase> alluded, attribute the deficits to the actions of the present Government, and I would like the Minister to answer for the 80 or so closures that are threatened up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.506.0/2">I admit a constituency interest. On Friday, I visited the four community hospitals in my constituency, all of which are threatened with the axe. There was a fifth&mdash;Bradford-on-Avon&mdash;but it has already closed. I also visited an EMI&mdash;elderly mentally infirm&mdash;unit for 26 in-patients in Trowbridge, which caters for a large part of Wiltshire. That, too, is threatened with closure, together with the maternity unit, so I have some sympathy for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>. All those facilities will go.</p>
	<p pid="b.506.0/3">The hon. Member for Northavon talked about evidence-based medicine. I do not think he really understands what evidence-based medicine is. There is no evidence that the plans that the primary care trust has produced would do anything other than destroy what we have traditionally enjoyed in my part of Wiltshire&mdash;good local health care. All the evidence suggests that we would lose a great deal and pick up very little in return. The PCT, in the spirit of the age, will talk about taking health care closer to patients, and of course we would all wish to be treated in our home if that were possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.507.0/1">I apologise for not being present for the whole debate&mdash;it is not possible to do everything in this place. My hon. Friend is aware of the announcement made in Gloucestershire on black Wednesday, as I call it, that 12 institutions would be closed or have their services severely curtailed. That was to involve a loss of 250 beds and more than 200 staff. In Gloucestershire, we will not have many health facilities left other than the two acute hospitals. That is what the present Government have reduced the health service to in Gloucestershire. Does he agree that what needs to be considered is people's welfare, not just bottom-line budgets to rake back last year's and this year's deficits?</p>

	<p pid="b.507.1/1">I agree. What my hon. Friend describes is what Ministers have told us should happen. It is clear from the White Paper that short-term budgetary fixes should not result in the closure of community hospitals, so he is right. I have visited a couple of his local community hospitals and I am as distraught as he is to hear of their closure. We are told that intermediate care teams will sally forth and look after people in their own homes. Come on, we live in the real world. We all know that people will not receive proper hospital care at home. The best that people can hope for is health care in homely settings in the community. That is what people have at the moment in areas that are blessed with community hospitals. I understood from the White Paper that the community hospital model would be expanded across the rest of the country, but it appears that that will not happen. We hear about new-generation community hospitals, but the reality is that well before they appear, we see hospitals such as Bradford-on-Avon and those in my hon. Friend's area closing. At the very least, we are putting the cart before the horse.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/2">We have to accept that when those institutions close, a whole generation of health care workers will be lost. People who work in community hospitals are very special. They are often seen to be on the margins of health care, and often they are. They usually work in community hospitals for particular reasons. They choose to work in those hospitals, yet there seems to be an assumption that when the hospitals close, the workers will all march off and rebadge themselves as community nurses or district nurses, or perhaps work in acute centres. Clearly, many of them will not do so and many of the particular skills that they have will be lost. I do not think that the Minister has thought that through adequately.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/3">I shall not dwell at length on sham consultations. Suffice it to say that I am as incensed as most other hon. Members who have spoken that a culture of cynicism should be built up around what should be a perfectly reasonable thing for us to do&mdash;ask people what they want in terms of health care delivery in their locality. I now have to say to my constituents, &quot;Please respond to the primary care trust's consultation because it will take your silence as assent to the plans.&quot; However, most people are reluctant to take part, because they see themselves putting a great deal of time and effort into consultation in good faith and then finding the PCT simply proceeding with an agenda that it created beforehand.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/4">The White Paper makes a number of referencesto community hospitals, and it actually refers to Trowbridge community hospital, which is interesting, because under the primary care trust proposals, that is one of the community hospitals that will close. It says, in bold, that</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/5" class="indent">&quot;PCTs taking current decisions about the future of community hospitals will be required to demonstrate to their SHA that they have consulted locally and have considered options such as developing new pathways, new partnerships and new ownership possibilities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/6">There is very little room for weasel words there.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/7">There is a delicious irony, because many of the hospitals had what I suppose, in retrospect, were new partnerships, which were created by the communities that they served. They were often the gift of a local benefactor and they have been supported royally over the years through local effort. I am intrigued and, in all candour, I am interested to hear the Minister's take on exactly what those words mean, and to hear how he will encourage new partnerships and new ownership possibilities. What does he have in mind, and how will he make sure that those partnerships happen? I actually think that partnerships are quite an imaginative solution for the future, but they will not happen if the Government do not support them, and they will certainly not happen if PCTs do not support them. His comments on that point would be most welcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/8">On Monday, the NHS Confederation produced what is best described as a leaflet. It was much trumpeted but it contains very little apart from anecdote, and it does not mention community hospitals at all, really. The issue of what on earth will be done as the number of acute hospital beds continues to be reduced is left hanging in the air, but people will have to go somewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/9">Interestingly, a couple of months ago, Dr. Foster, a body that is in some level of partnership with the Department of Health, published a paper in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> that compared health care in America with health care in this country. Of course there are differences between the two countries, but it is instructive to note how much more reliance America puts on intermediate care, and how little time people spend in acute hospitals in America compared with people in this country. America also has greater reliance on intermediate care beds, which of course are cheaper.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/10">Health maintenance organisations that manage health care in America are, of course, run by accountants, and they are very exercised by how much health care costs. Primary care trusts are getting it all wrong in trying to save costs by disestablishing the intermediate care level. The Minister looks surprised, but I am surprised that he has not been given the paper by members of Dr. Foster&mdash;they came to see the Opposition Front Bench team earlier this week&mdash;because it has a partnership arrangement with the Department of Health, and it seems that the research is crucial to what we are discussing today. I can send it to him, but I point out that it is in the BMJ of March this year, so he can look it up for himself. It seems that we have been given a false prospectus by primary care trusts, which hold that we will save money, as we will, of course, in the very short term, in terms of balancing the books in-year, but in the longer term the result will simply be more cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/11">We are rusticating cost from one part of the public purse to another. We heard earlier about how social services will bear much of the burden for all this. Likewise, voluntary organisations will pick up the bill for things such as palliative care, and of course carers will pick up a lot of the burden, as well. So when we talk about cost, we must ask: the cost to whom? That is extremely important.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/12">I apologise to the hon. Member for Stroud for intervening on him, but we take a particular interest in what is going on in Stroud. I am pleased that his contribution was so powerful, because it is all very well for my hon. Friends to debate the issue, but the fact that someone on the Labour Benches is doing so will, I hope, have more impact on the Minister than we have had hitherto. In connection with Stroud maternity hospital, it will be particularly interesting to hear which of the following holds: the January 2006 operating framework for 2006-07, which said:</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/13" class="indent">&quot;All NHS organisations should plan to recover deficits for previous years and balance their books for 2006-07</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/14">or the Secretary of State's letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-12">12 April</phrase> to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>, who was here earlier. That letter says that</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/15" class="indent">&quot;organisations which are overspending will be required to show improvement and by the end of 2006-7 be in monthly balance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/16">That is, monthly expenditure should cancel out or equal monthly income. It will be interesting to know which one of those propositions holds true, because clearly both of them cannot be true. There appears to have been something of a difference, and clearly Gloucestershire is working to the former proposition, not to the latter. That is important in the context of Stroud maternity hospital.</p>

	<p pid="b.510.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1596" name="Peter Viggers">the hon. Member for Gosport (Peter Viggers)</phrase> on securing the debate. He raised a number of interesting and important issues that deserve a proper response. We have heard good contributions to the debate, particularly from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase>. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase>, as always, made a good contribution and some important points. The good turnout this afternoon shows the depth of feeling about community hospitals in communities across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.510.1/2">I do not doubt the sincerity of the hon. Member for Gosport, but I doubt the quality of some of the analysis he gave us about what is happening in the national health service today and since 1992. I have doubts about some of the statements that have been made in the course of the debate, such as the suggestion that the Government are doing nothing to support community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.510.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> made something of a rant, which was uncharacteristic&mdash;if that helps, as I do not think he is normally associated with such speeches. He talked about the Government &quot;waging war&quot; on community hospitals. That is simply not borne out at all by the facts on the ground. I have a quote for him from the Community Hospitals Association, an organisation with which he will be familiar. On its website, it states:</p>
	<p pid="b.510.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Despite common belief there are still, in Great Britain, over 470 Community Hospitals. And for every closure in recent years there has been a new hospital opened.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.510.1/5">The hon. Gentleman's views are simply not borne out by the facts.</p>
	<p pid="b.510.1/6">A number of hon. Members have mentioned the NHS Confederation's analysis that was put before us this week. I refer the Chamber to a table in that report that shows the number of hospital beds lost in the20 years from 1984 to 2004-05. If we consider the figures for 1997-98, we see that there were 148,828 beds in the national health service. In 2004-05, there were 145,218. That is broadly the same figure, with a small reduction. If we look further down the table, we see in the period from 1984 to 1997-98 a reduction of 63,000 beds during those years of Conservative Government. A little more humility tempering the strident comments of Conservative Members might not have gone amiss.</p>

	<p pid="b.510.3/1">I do not have a great deal of time, so I will press on.</p>
	<p pid="b.510.3/2">Our manifesto made absolutely clear our commitment to a new generation of community hospitals, rebuilt or refurbished, with state-of-the-art NHS facilities. Our commitment to the future of community hospitals was further highlighted by the recent White Paper, to which many hon. Members have referred. &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot; firmly placed community hospitals, old and new, at the heart of achieving the shift in care and resources that the White Paper signalled. I say to Conservative Members that during the period when they were in government it was very much the trend that the acute sites began to draw in more and more services. That is what we saw in communities up and down the country, not least in my own, where the accident and emergency department at Leigh infirmary was closed. That was the direction of travel in the '80s and '90s.</p>

	<p pid="b.511.4/1">I reject the suggestion that I have misled Members. I was giving figures from the NHS Confederation, issued this week, which show the true state of our national health service. Raising a frivolous point of order when I have been left with little time does not help our debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.511.4/2">We made our commitment to community hospitals because that was what the public told us strongly in the consultation, &quot;Your health, your care, your say&quot;. People want services to be available closer to where they live, and they want health and social care to become more seamless with more personalised and integrated care. That point was fairly made by the hon. Member for Northavon. It is true that people want to be treated in familiar, comfortable surroundings.</p>
	<p pid="b.511.4/3">England is unusual among developed countries in that a high proportion of care is accessed through large, acute hospitals on-site, particularly for out-patients. That is why the White Paper laid out clearly our intention to move toward more local and community provision. We want the NHS to challenge the status quo that has seen care increasingly centralised in large institutions. If we are serious about shifting care, we need to make sure that the facilities out in the community are fit for purpose, and that they are not simply bricks and mortar that have been there for a long time, but modern, good quality facilities in which the kind of care for our constituents that we all aspire to can be provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.511.4/4">Picking up on the NHS Confederation theme, there is a challenge for all elected politicians, in this place and locally, to get beyond some of the emotion. Thatis what it is challenging us to do. The NHS Confederation called for a well informed debate on these matters. It is incumbent on every one of us, as leaders within our communities, to lead that debate rather than follow it. We, too, should put informed positions into the public domain about hospital reconfiguration. Let us make no bones about it: from time to time there will need to be reconfiguration of services to reflect modern standards and aspirations. The duty to lead that debate is incumbent on us all.</p>
	<p pid="b.511.4/5">I will now pick up on a point made by thehon. Member for Gosport. There is an onus on the NHS to listen to local opinion when it is expressed ina moderate and reasonable way, where local representatives have gone out to listen to their communities and taken the trouble to work through the detail of proposals. The NHS needs to be good at hearing that debate and the argument coming back the other way. I accept that it might not have done that well in the past, and that we need to make sure that our consultation within the NHS is true consultation, but that is a two-way street. All hon. Members should reflect on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.511.4/6">A new generation of facilities is already being put in place. The hon. Member for Banbury asked where they are. Examples include Colchester and Tendring PCTs, which have recently seen a primary care centre and a community hospital open under the NHS LIFT&mdash;local improvement finance trust&mdash;initiative. There are other examples with a number of other services: Colchester primary care centre is providing a renal dialysis unit that will provide local facilities for patients who currently travel to London or Cambridge three times a week for treatment. Harwich hospital is a new facility constructed on the grounds of an outdated community hospital. It will provide numerous specialist primary care and diagnostic services, as well as an operating theatre, in-patient beds and a maternity unit. They are the evidence of the new generation of facilities that the hon. Gentleman asked for. It is there, on the ground, and it is benefiting patients across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.511.4/7">I was asked for evidence of the manifesto commitment. There is capital: a significant sum of money has been set aside to enable communities around the country to come forward with plans for new community provision. More information will be made available and a statement will be made soon as to how that capital can be accessed. It is not possible to build new hospitals within a year of our manifesto commitment, but the commitment will be honoured.</p>
	<p pid="b.511.4/8">I shall pick up on some of the specific points raised by the hon. Member for Gosport, because he deserves a detailed response to them. I understand the concerns in his communities about the transition in service provision; we all acknowledge that that can be difficult to understand. The hub-and-spoke model that is proposed for his area&mdash;given the geography of his constituency&mdash;must respect all the communities in it. To be viable, the hub-and-spoke system needs to consider all the communities, not just one in isolation. A new facility is being constructed at Fareham. Seeing the health economy in the round is important, and it is crucial to ensure that one community's aspirations do not cut across the legitimate aspirations of another for modern health care facilities in their area.</p>
	<p pid="b.511.4/9">I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud(Mr. Drew)</phrase> that we will make an announcement on the White Paper in due course, which will apply to all kinds of services, including maternity units; it will cover the breadth of services. We want PCTs to look carefully at the White Paper; it is not just words, and we want them to see clearly the direction of travel and provide the kind of services that his constituents and mine want on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="b.514.1/1">I am pleased to have this short debate on home information packs, better known as HIPs. This is not the first time that they have been debated in this place and it will probably not be the last. Given the number of hon. Members who wish to speak, I shall try to be brief and not cover all the objections that I and others have to HIPs. Suffice it to say, they are included in early-day motion 2240, which is entitled &quot;Introduction of home information packs&quot; and was tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase>. I also pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" name="Ian Liddell-Grainger">my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger)</phrase> for his recent excellent ten-minute Bill on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.514.1/2">Having spoken to a variety of groups from all sides of the HIPs debate in recent days, I have picked up a common theme, which is perhaps best described by an individual whose role it is to promote and sell HIPs but who unsurprisingly does not wish to be named this afternoon. He told me that doing something to help house buyers was long overdue but that with HIPs,like other new Labour policies, the execution was fundamentally flawed.</p>
	<p pid="b.514.1/3">HIPs are a new stealth tax, dressed up as a proposal to help hard-pressed buyers in the housing market. However, rather like the huge stamp duty hikes seen in recent years, which were introduced in the name of cooling down the housing market, while netting the Chancellor huge amounts of additional funds, HIPs will create a whole new tax scheme for the Treasury. Assuming annual home sales of around 1.3 million, it will take an average HIP price of only &pound;770 to create a new billion-pound industry in this country. That would result in an additional &pound;175 million going to the Chancellor each year in VAT. Moreover, the tax is regressive, as it seems quite possible that the cost of putting together a HIP for a studio flat might be the same as for a mansion.</p>
	<p pid="b.514.1/4">My first objection to HIPs is therefore that they add another part to the complex process of buying and selling a property and will probably not remove any of the other hurdles. Currently, some 80 per cent. of buyers do not have a formal or second-level survey. Those who are borrowing to fund the purchase&mdash;that is, the home buyers&mdash;consider the lender's valuation survey, which is, after all, designed solely to protect the lender's interest, to be sufficient. However, lenders are not compelled to accept the new home condition report as a basis for valuation, and many lenders have signalled that it will be no substitute for a full valuation.</p>
	<p pid="b.514.1/5">The Government say that the pack will have &quot;very little impact&quot; on the number of completed sales taking place each year, yet research has suggested that up to 30 per cent. fewer properties would come to the market if the seller had to pay for a pack. Even if only 10 per cent. of properties were taken out of the supply side of the market, the likely result would be inflationary to house prices. In turn, the decline in the volume of homes coming to the market would doubtless exacerbate many of the problems in the housing market, such as having too many empty homes, and increase the pressure for more new homes to be built, because of supply shortfalls of existing homes in the market.</p>
	<p pid="b.514.1/6">It is tempting to think of the housing market as constantly rising, as it has been over the past decade, but even more alarmingly, HIPs will have a deeply negative impact in the event of a falling housing market. Liquidity will dry up. Those facing negative equity who might be forced by their financial circumstances to sell&mdash;thanks to a job loss during a recession, for example&mdash;will be hit with a charge of up to &pound;1,000 to create the HIP, on top of all the other miseries involved in a distress sale of one's ownhome. Others affected could include those needingto downsize in the event of changed personal circumstances, such as job relocation or disability.</p>
	<p pid="b.514.1/7">The potential cost of the HIP is made worse because the pack has no shelf life. As some of the information to be contained in it is date-sensitive, such as local authority searches, the pack will need to be updated, at further expense to the seller, especially in a slow market. No responsible estate agent, surveyor or lawyer would recommend that a purchaser should rely on a potentially outdated report. I foresee that when the market is slow, a lot of money will be spent on updating the pack.</p>
	<p pid="b.514.1/8">As to enforcement, as we know, the duty to provide a HIP lies with the estate agent. However, the penalty for not doing so is only &pound;200. If the transaction fee for the estate agent is a few thousand pounds, the temptation to skim the HIP or not provide it at all may be too great. That links into enforcement, which presents a further problem. According to my information, enforcement will be down to council trading standards officers, who are thin on the ground these days.</p>
	<p pid="b.514.1/9">In my experience in Hammersmith and Fulham under the outgoing and very incompetent Labour council, it is tough to get such officers to investigate things such as prima facie examples of dodgy builders who, having given promises about loft extensions, make off with tens of thousands of pounds from old ladies. Generally, the trading standards officers are not interested in knowing. The fine for not providing a HIP is only &pound;200, and my expectation&mdash;it is only that&mdash;is that many in trading standards will simply not bother to pursue the matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.515.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his help in preparing my ten-minute Bill, which, as he is aware, comes back in October. I am sure that the Minister will be interested in one of the problems that we both faced&mdash;the number of HIPs providers there in the first place. There are so few. Does my hon. Friend agree that not only can we not enforce HIPs, but they cannot be provided in the first place? The people to provide them are not there, and such people cannot be trained before HIPs come into operation.</p>

	<p pid="b.515.2/1">Given that situation, does my hon. Friend not think that it would be eminently sensible for the Minister to delay the onset of HIPs by holding a meaningful pilot so that we can see their impact on the housing market and consider how we can develop more HIPs consultants?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.516.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1610" speakername="Greg Hands" colnum="516"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0010.htm#06052462000161">
	<p pid="b.516.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. It would be helpful to have a real pilot, although I was not going to go down that route, given the limited time available. My personal view is that HIPs should be abolished entirely rather than reformed.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.0/2">I come back to trading standards. I have also not heard of any additional funding for local authority trading standards to finance effective policing. I bring another interesting consequence of the HIP to the attention of the Chamber. Statistically, the majority of properties in Britain will have changed hands in 20 to 25 years' time, and the Government will then have an extensive and detailed database of all those properties. It would be cynical to suggest that that could form the basis of a tax, but the temptation would be there; in the hands of the current Chancellor of the Exchequer, there would certainly be the potential for a new Domesday Book in this country, although I doubt whether he would have that job by then. On a similar issue, anybody&mdash;not only those genuinely interested in buying the property&mdash;will be able to access the information given in a HIP. I see a field day for snoopers intrigued by the homes of their outgoing or incoming neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.0/3">Finally, I turn to the likely impact on my constituency of Hammersmith and Fulham. It has a huge number of flats, which make up 71 per cent. ofits homes. That compares with a national average of19 per cent. Even without HIPs, the young professional flat owner gets a very raw deal under new Labour; that is part of the reason why Hammersmith and Fulham turned a dark shade of blue earlier this month. In marginal wards, the number of flat owners is even more stark. In North End ward, 88 per cent. of homes are flats; in Avonmore and Brook Green ward, the figureis 86 per cent.; in Addison ward, it is 79 per cent.;and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.0/4">Such areas are characterised by people who have bought a one or two-bedroomed flat. They already pay hugely more in taxes generally, but when it comes to a home sale under HIPs, the buyer in my constituency will already be whacked by stamp duty of 3 per cent. or occasionally 4 per cent. on the price&mdash;cash that they need to find up front. The seller will now also be hit by an up-front tax of up to &pound;1,000 to buy a HIP.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.0/5">I spoke to one prospective HIP provider yesterday, who thought that for the larger firms, the turnaround time to build the HIP might be as short as four to five days. However, it would take weeks or even longer if the property were leasehold, as there is currently no provision to force a managing agent to supply the information. Yet that is crucial in my constituency and across London, where there are tens of thousands of leasehold properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.0/6">The problems really begin when it comes to getting information out of a managing agent. I spoke to a London estate agent yesterday who told me that HIPs are particularly feared in London because of the large number of leasehold properties. Managing agents are often notoriously unresponsive unless their financial interests are directly threatened; they have no real incentive to provide the relevant information for a HIP. Rightly, the big fear is that they simply will not deliver it on time, the market will get slowed up and the reputation of HIPs in general will start to suffer in London, which could have a disastrous impact on the reputation of the whole scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.0/7">There are well-rehearsed arguments against HIPs, and I have not detailed all of them, as I am sure my colleagues would agree. I am yet to see, other than directly from the new billion-pound-a-year HIP industry, any real answers from the Government to those concerns. I and my constituents want to see not more promises but, if hon. Members will excuse the pun, a complete HIPs replacement.</p>

	<p pid="b.517.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship today, Mr. Bercow. May I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1610" name="Greg Hands">my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands)</phrase> and the Minister, who is in her place, for giving me permission to speak in this debate?</p>
	<p pid="b.517.0/2">As my hon. Friend said, home information packs mark a significant state intervention in the property market, with potentially disruptive consequences for consumer confidence. That is why I would like to give the Minister the opportunity today to try to reassure consumers. Her work is formidable; if one examines the scale of opposition to HIPs, one will see that nearly every interested group in the property market has deep worries about the implementation of the scheme. Independent estate agents, and indeed the National Association of Estate Agents, have outlined deep opposition to the scheme. Only this week, 80 per cent. of building society chief executive officers have said that they believe that HIPs will have a negative impact on the housing market.</p>
	<p pid="b.517.0/3">Why does the Minister believe that that is so? Building society chief executive officers say that HIPs will add costs to the home-buying process, not reassure prospective buyers or speed up the process, and reduce the number of properties in the market. If those with a direct stake in the effective functioning of the market are so worried, what can the Minister say to reassure them? It is not just building societies; the Law Society has also signalled its concern, as has the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.</p>
	<p pid="b.517.0/4">The Council of Mortgage Lenders has also tried its best to ensure that the scheme will work, but only this week it spelled out its concerns again. The majority of lenders have made it clear that in a significant number of cases the home condition report, to which my hon. Friend referred, will simply not be enough to guarantee a loan; an evaluation or survey will be required. There will be additional costs for both seller and buyer, additional taxation for the Chancellor and additional pain in the market.</p>
	<p pid="b.517.0/5">The Minister is fond of saying that consumer groups favour the home information pack. Will she tell us which groups&mdash;in the plural&mdash;actually favour the pack? As far as we can see, only one organisation representing consumers has made representations in favour of the pack. Will she tell us on what statistical basis she can say with confidence that consumers welcome it?</p>
	<p pid="b.517.0/6">Talking of a statistical basis, the evidence basis for the introduction of the HIP is, as I am sure we all know, the &quot;Key research on easier home buying and selling&quot; document produced by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in 1998. However, that evidence was based on fewer than30 transactions. Will the Minister tell us what evidence base she has for her belief that HIPs will bring the benefits of which her Department has boasted?</p>
	<p pid="b.517.0/7">Talking of rigorous evidence, my hon. Friend referred to the need for a dry run. In an answer that the Minister was kind enough to give me, she said that a dry run would operate on an entirely voluntary basis. Indeed, we understand that it will be overseen by the HIPs providers themselves. How can the providers sit as judge and jury in their own case?</p>
	<p pid="b.517.0/8">In November 2004, the Lord Rooker indicated that a compulsory dry run would take place in a local area. Has that promise now been abandoned? Will clear benchmarks and criteria be published by which we can judge the success of the dry run or will providers of the packs simply be encouraged to give them to buyers, say they have been a tremendous success and allow the Department to proceed willy-nilly without the firm guarantee of consumer confidence that we need? If we are to have a successful dry run we need home inspectors. How many home inspectors are qualified? We know that there are only 200, because of the extensive investigative work of Valerie Elliott, the consumer affairs correspondent of <i>The Times</i>.</p>
	<p pid="b.517.0/9">The Minister says that 4,000 home inspectors are in training. It takes only five days for someone who knows something about property to qualify. However, before Christmas 1,750 people were in training, and five months&mdash;not five days&mdash;later, only 200 have qualified. What guarantees do we have that there will be enough home inspectors and that those people will have any real background in the construction industry, surveying or any of the skills required to provide consumer confidence? Those matters go to the heart of ensuring that the housing market functions effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.517.0/10">The Minister will be aware that there is a new consensus, led by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1868" name="George Osborne">my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne)</phrase>, on the need to increase housing supply and help first-time buyers. It would be a tragedy if that new consensus were disrupted by the introduction of an ill-thought-through intervention in the market. I invite the Minister to join me and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>, who have signed my early-day motion, and to forge a new cross-party consensus to find a voluntary way forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.519.0/1">I take your stricture absolutely, Mr. Bercow, and I amlooking carefully at <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1610" name="Greg Hands">the clock. I congratulate myhon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands)</phrase> and declare to the House an interest in the matter as a chartered surveyor.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.0/2">I want to raise one or two points that have not yet been raised in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase> referred to Valerie Elliott's article quoting the figures obtained fromthe Minister's Department, showing that there are currently only 196 trained inspectors, and that 4,000 are in training and 7,000 are needed for the 1.5 million sales that take place each year. The problem is obtaining inspectors of the right quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.0/3">That brings me to my next point. Many of the inspectors will be of low quality, and have low-quality training. It takes five years to train a chartered surveyor. The people involved will be trained in a year and will be required to carry out at least four home surveys a day, whereas I as a chartered surveyor would probably deal with only two a day, because I would be much more thorough.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.0/4">The next question to arise is how the inspectors will obtain professional indemnity insurance, especially given that that is likely to be expensive because of their low quality and because purchasers will be able to sue them if their inspections are deficient. Also, how does the Minister think that the energy efficiency reports system will be ready to come into full operation for1.5 million houses next year?</p>
	<p pid="b.519.0/5">I end with a quote from Valerie Elliott, who says in her article that there could be</p>
	<p pid="b.519.0/6" class="indent">&quot;a year of panic selling to avoid the extra costs that will be incurred with the pack&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.519.0/7">which is</p>
	<p pid="b.519.0/8" class="indent">&quot;likely to be followed by a stagnant market&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.0/9">I recommend to my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath that when he is in the Minister's place in four years' time he should drop sellers packs and instead concentrate on speeding up the efficiency of electronic searches and conveyancing. That will do more to help the market than the home sellers packs will ever do.</p>

	<p pid="b.519.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1610" name="Greg Hands">the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands)</phrase> on securing today's debate and choosing such an interesting and important subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.1/2">Opposition Members are opposed to home information packs. That is obviously not news; I know that many of them have been opposed to them for a long time. It is perhaps a shame, however, that they have not taken advantage of their change of leader and change of direction to the compassionate conservatism that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase> is very proud to proclaim at every opportunity to have a rethink about this policy issue. They may claim to be compassionate Conservatives, but they are still clearly not consumers' Conservatives. They are still, on this issue, the party of the vested interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.1/3">The hon. Member for Surrey Heath said that there was concern on the part of interested groups. That is certainly right; there is concern from groups with vested interests. There is concern among groups that make money from the current process and do not want to innovate and to change the way in which they operate. We recognise that those concerns exist. However, it is also right for us to take consumers' interests seriously. The biggest consumer group in the country, Which?, has been campaigning for home information packs for a long time. Frankly, Opposition Members are unwise to set themselves against such a major consumer interest group, because that independent voice has been calling for the change for a long time.</p>

	<p pid="b.520.0/1">I asked the Minister directly if she could name more than one consumer group that supported the introduction of home information packs, and what the evidence base was. Apart from the Consumers Association, can she name any other groups?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.520.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="520"  time="016:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0010.htm#06052462000168">
	<p pid="b.520.1/1">Let me give the hon. Gentleman the evidence base to which we refer. The Consumers Association conducted a survey in which it asked 1,000 people who had bought or sold their homes at the end of 2003 how useful they thought it would be to receive a HIP, including details about the condition of their property, and 82 per cent. said that they thought it would be very useful. A year later, in a follow-up survey, 1,824 people were asked for their views on HIPs, but on the assumption that they would have to pay for them. They were specifically asked whether they would be in favour of HIPs if they had to pay for them as sellers, and 78 per cent. said that they would be a good idea. Not only has Which? done its consumer research; it has considered the process in some detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.520.1/2">I shall respond to some of the points made in the debate. We have to start from the perspective that the current system is not working. It is madness, as we waste &pound;350 million a year on failed transactions. That is the case partly because people make an offer based on limited information. They then start paying for more information through searches and a survey, and the legal fees start ratcheting up&mdash;and then the sale falls through. Along comes another potential buyer who has to pay again for all that information. That can happen again and again. Such duplication is hugely inefficient.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.521.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="521"  time="016:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0011.htm#06052462000173">
	<p pid="b.521.0/1">That is complete nonsense. The fact is that the information provided by HIPs is largely provided in the current process. However, it is now provided at the end of the process and only after a huge amount of money and time has been spent trying to get hold of information that may not be needed because the sale has fallen through.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/2">That is a waste. It is a market inefficiency and a classic example of a market failure, with a lack of proper transparency and proper information. Let us try to imagine making an offer for a car without knowing whether it had passed its MOT. People would not do it. Why should we have a system in which someone makes an offer, the seller accepts it, but the deal is done on the basis of very limited information? With such a huge asset and when so much information is required before the deal can be completed, why should we use a system that causes inefficiency and protracted delays and that has such huge costs?</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/3">Those who seek to defend the existing system are trying to defend the indefensible. The question is how to improve it. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" name="Ian Liddell-Grainger">The hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger)</phrase> has started to list those who want to defend the current system, all of whom currently make money from it. It is important to consider the consumer's perspective. The approach is about preventing duplication, providing information up front and dealing with the lack of transparency.At the moment, when somebody is waiting for information, they do not know whether it is the fault of their solicitor or the other party's solicitor, or even whether it is the estate agent's fault. People can spend much of the time in a fog, but if the information is provided up front in a home information pack, they will know exactly what the information is, and also who will be responsible if it is not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/4">The pack also makes it much quicker to get a mortgage valuation. I know that people are complaining that mortgage lenders will not use home condition reports, but those reports will be far more robust and comprehensive than the valuations and surveys on which mortgage lenders now base their valuations. In practice, mortgage lenders will take home condition reports seriously because they will be based on the work of home inspectors, who will be properly certified.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/5">Hon. Members have made important points about the number of home inspectors, and it is clear that home inspectors need to be in place in time for the commencement of the home information pack system on <phrase class="date" code="">1 June 2007</phrase>. The time that it takes surveyors to complete the courses is relatively limited. Hon. Members are right to say that we must ensure that home inspectors are in place, but it is now May 2006, and there are still 12 months to go before the new system is in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/6">Another benefit is that home information packs will be free to first-time buyers. Opposition Members have expressed a sudden interest in the fortunes of first-time buyers. They are suddenly concerned and claim to want to represent and improve the lot of first-time buyers. First-time buyers will get for free the information that they currently have to pay for. Most of us are buyers and sellers, so there will not be that much difference for us, but the new system will make a difference to first-time buyers, because they will get the same information for free.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/7">We will also prevent first-time buyers facing huge bills after the process, as many currently do, because of problems with the property of which they were not aware. That affects many first-time buyers. People may be prevented from taking on debts that they cannot sustain or afford because they did not know something about the property in advance.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/8">Energy performance certificates will also be provided. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> referred to energy efficiency information. That is extremely important. The new system is a great opportunity to provide people with information about the energy efficiency of a home at the beginning of the process. Opposition Members are supposedly interested in the environment now, too. Is it their official policy to support energy performance certificates? If they do not, many of their warm words on energy&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.522.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="522"  time="016:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0011.htm#06052462000175">
	<p pid="b.522.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. There is no requirement to have a home information pack in the European system, but under the European system we have to bring in energy performance certificates by 2009. Home information packs allow us to introduce them in 2007 and in a cost-effective way. Rather than expecting people to pay separately and additionally for energy performance certificates, we can incorporate them into the home condition report at a much cheaper cost for consumers. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is saying that he is still in favour of energy performance certificates, although I notice that he did not take the opportunity to say whether his party is in favour of them. Perhaps he needs to clarify his position and tell us whether he believes that the certificates should be paid for separately and additionally, rather than incorporated cost-effectively into a home condition report, as we have advocated.</p>
	<p pid="b.522.1/2">Opposition Members are right: this is about a transformation in the home buying and selling market. The new system is an important aspect alongside e-conveyancing and provides us with a way of making e-conveyancing more effective. Significantly, it is also about encouraging new entrants into the market and making it more transparent. Hon. Members may be aware that Asda has said that it wants to enter the estate agency market and will provide home information packs for consumers for free. The reason why Asda is saying that it can do so is that estate agents' fees have, in many cases, remained the same. The proportion has remained the same at a time when house prices have doubled, so estate agents have had big increases in the fee that they receive per transaction. Because of the lack of transparency in that area, it is right to encourage new entrants and to promote home information packs as an important part of creating greater transparency.</p>
	<p pid="b.522.1/3">Hon. Members expressed concern about whether the new system will have an impact on the market. The hon. Member for Bridgwater has quoted the Danish estate agents association as saying that the packs would have a big impact on the market. The man who was chief executive of Denmark's estate agents association until the end of February this year has written to the hon. Gentleman and has copied me into his correspondence. He says:</p>
	<p pid="b.522.1/4" class="indent">&quot;I notice that you are quoting me&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.522.1/5">as saying that</p>
	<p pid="b.522.1/6" class="indent">&quot;'there are 25 per cent. fewer houses now on the market as a direct result of HIPs.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.522.1/7">He continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.522.1/8" class="indent">&quot;May I ask you from where you have got this rubbish?...The number of houses sold in Denmark has gone up all the time since the beginning of the 90s...I can inform you that IBM and Public Affairs Group published a huge report about the Danish HCR-system in January 2006...90 per cent. of the consumers were...pleased with the system and they came up with suggestions on how to make the system even better...I would only be pleased to send the report to you&mdash;it's only a couple of hundred pages...in Danish.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.522.1/9">I concede that I have not read the report myself, because it is in Danish&mdash;</p>

	SOLVENT ABUSE
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-24b.524.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1992" speakername="John MacDougall" colnum="524"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060524/halltext/60524h0011.htm#06052462000177">
	<p pid="b.524.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate and to have this opportunity to raise the subject of solvent abuse, particularly abuse of cigarette lighter fuel.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his new responsibilities. I wish him well and every success.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/3">I welcome the document from the Home Office and the Department of Health, in partnership with the Department for Education and Skills, entitled &quot;Out of Sight?...not out of mind&quot; on children, young people and volatile substance abuse. It is difficult to work out the reason for trends, but I note from page 6 of the document that they seem to exist. In 1993, there was a tremendous amount of substance abuse, particularly in males, which increased slightly in 1994, but generally fell in 1997. I cannot say that that was because of the change in Government, because there seems to have been a dramatic increase from 1997&mdash;with the exception of 1998 when no male deaths were evident&mdash;when the trend increased again, as opposed to that from 1993 to 1997 when it fell. There must be a reason for that trend and that reason is important in trying to assess how we can deal with this serious matter more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/4">I bring this Adjournment debate before the Chamber because of the tragic death of my constituent, Lee O'Brien, who died in January 2003 after inhaling lighter fluid. Lee was only 16. I pay tribute to Lee's father, John O'Brien, and his family who set up the Lee O'Brien Solvent Trust&mdash;LOST is, sadly, an appropriate name. I believe, as do Lee's family, that highlighting such tragic cases is educational for young people. The message&mdash;not just legislation&mdash;must go out to young people that solvent abuse, even the first time, can cost them their life, because it is a life-threatening practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/5">Lee's family immediately started a campaign calling for a change in the legislation on the sale of solvents so that the terrible tragedy that happened to Lee would be less likely to happen to other young people. The family have campaigned tirelessly and have achieved a great deal. The Queen gave her seal of approval at a gala dinner not long ago to honour pioneers of the nation.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/6">I was pleased to receive John O'Brien and the LOST campaign here in Westminster when we presented a massive petition with more than 15,000 signatures to the Prime Minister at No. 10 Downing street. I tabled an early-day motion, which, with no effort, instantly gained the support and backing of more than 70 MPs who wanted to show that we are dealing with a serious issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/7">Lee's death was not an isolated incident. According to Re-Solv, a national organisation that was set up in 1994 to prevent solvent abuse, volatile substances kill more young people than any controlled drug. I would like to thank Re-Solv for all its work on this matter. It works hard with the all-party group on solvent abuse and was established because of the scale of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/8">Figures from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reveal that one in seven 15 to 16-year-olds in Britain abuse solvents. Thousands of teenagers are putting their lives at risk by sniffing glue, lighter fluid and other substances. I have heard of some remarkable and inventive cases of youngsters setting fire to plastic bins because the make-up of the bins and the toxic fumes from them can give them a kind of high. Sadly, that inventiveness is all going to the wrong purposes&mdash;purposes that can bring about tragedies.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/9">Some 1,700 deaths related to such substances were recorded among young people in the UK between 1983 and 2000. On average, more than one young person dies in the UK every week because of solvent abuse. More worryingly, great concern remains about the level of deaths among under-18s from the abuse of cigarette lighter fluid. Statistics gathered before 1999, prior to the introduction of regulations on cigarette lighter refills, show that the figures almost doubled in 2000. Butane cigarette lighter refills now account for 64 per cent. of all substance abuse deaths. The statistics go on and on. St. George's hospital medical school's current report provides figures for 2001 on deaths from solvent and volatile substance abuse. For the first time, there was strong evidence that disposable cigarette lighters were involved in substance abuse deaths.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/10">For under-18s, there has been no sustained decrease in deaths since 1999. It is therefore clear that we face a nationwide problem. It is not confined to one area of the UK. Young people remain the group most associated with solvent abuse. Between 1971 and 2000, most deaths from substance abuse occurred in the 14 to 18-year-old range. There are even recorded cases of children under the age of 10 dying from the effects of solvent abuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/11">The statistics in the graph show that solvent abusers can be male or female. There seems to be no connection, other than a general trend up and down over the years. However, the graph indicates higher numbers of solvent-related deaths among boys. There is no stereotypical solvent abuser. People who abuse solvents can come from any social, cultural or ethnic background, and we have to take that into account in addressing the problem. We cannot tackle the issue by targeting one problem area. It covers a range of areas and does confine itself to one location or type of person. We must therefore combat the problem nationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/12">One of the most distinctive factors about solvent abuse is that the products involved have a legitimate everyday use. The age at which young people experiment with such substance abuse is generally much younger than for controlled substances. We all know that there have been many debates, questions and early-day motions in the House on solvent abuse, and it is time to ask the Government to strengthen the regulations even further, particularly on the sale of cigarette lighter fuel.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/13">Re-Solv was started 10 years ago to combat the problem, and young people are still dying despite its best efforts. There are great antisocial behaviour problems, as well as crime-associated problems, with substance abuse. There are many reports of serious crimes being committed while people are high on lighter fuel. That is not to mention the impact that solvent abuse has on the people around those involved, such as their family, and the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/14">In Scotland, the LOST campaign has already prompted the introduction of a test-purchasing scheme, which was piloted in my local region of Fife. It was aimed at stamping out the illegal sale of lighter fluid to young people. Test purchasing should be increased. One crucial method of preventing deaths by inhalation is to investigate vigorously the prospects of making the habit abhorrent. Reducing the cans' capacity would result in there not being enough lighter fuel to achieve a temporary high.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/15">On the preventive side of the problem, a retail campaign working with the British Retail Consortium, the Government and schools is essential to make clear through educational programmes the dramatic and immediate threat that exists, even when someone is inhaling for the first time. It does not take a number of occasions to cause death, as Lee O'Brien showed, tragically.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/16">Encouraging vigilance among shopkeepers not to sell several canisters of lighter fuel at once should be paramount in any campaign by the British Retail Consortium. We have to increase awareness of the tragedy behind the fact that a shopkeeper may make a profit from selling six tins of lighter fuel but the youngster who has purchased them has no intention of using the fuel for lighting cigarettes&mdash;although that in itself would kill them, never mind the inhalation of the fuel. It is quite clear why that purchase is being made, and through the British Retail Consortium we must seek co-operation with shopkeepers to ensure that they are vigilant and wise about discouraging such purchases.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/17">The way forward is much tighter and stricter enforcement of the law. In Staffordshire, the council has three trading standards officers to police the sale of cigarette lighter fuel. Perhaps, therefore, consideration should be given to the nomination of an enforcement agency, which could well be trading standards. It would achieve a great deal if consideration were given to such a measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/18">I am sure that the measures that I have outlined, taken together as a package, will make less likely unnecessary deaths such as that of Lee O'Brien. I re-emphasise that there are no safe levels with solvent abuse; as I said, it can kill the first time or the 100th time. As I mentioned, education is vital on the preventive side. With that in mind, I gave evidence to the Scottish Parliament's Public Petitions Committee, recognising, of course, the role of the devolved structures and the differences in terms of the educational role. However, solvent abuse is a UK issue, and consumer legislation is UK-wide. My efforts in Scotland and in Glenrothes have included working with the voluntary sector, and I congratulate all of those bodies on their important, unselfish and caring work.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/19">I congratulate the Home Office and the Department of Health on their findings in the document &quot;Out of Sight?...not out of mind&quot;, which recommends better education, and that we should deal with volatile substances locally and reduce their availability and accessibility. They are commendable areas to emphasise and concentrate on for the future. If we do so collectively, that will make a profound difference in reducing the number of deaths from this appalling practice; young people do not realise the life-threatening nature of the experience that they are about to encounter.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.1/20">I call on Government agencies and Departments to implement the recommendations as soon as possible. All too often, we reach an awareness stage, we collate and note the information and the drive is there to amass the information&mdash;I hope that that drive does not end and that the Minister, in his new position, will take the matter forward with great vigour. It is our task to make children and young people aware and to protect them from such dangers.</p>

	<p pid="b.527.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1992" name="John MacDougall">my hon. Friend the Member for Glenrothes(Mr. MacDougall)</phrase> on securing this important debate, and on the way in which he presented his points. Before I forget, may I also thank him for welcoming me to my position? It is kind of him to give me his good wishes.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/2">I acknowledge the work that my hon. Friend has done to highlight this important issue on behalf of his constituents and other families who have the experienced tragic consequences of volatile substance abuse, or VSA, as I shall call it. On behalf of the Government, I pay tribute to the O'Brien family for the way in which they have tried to do something following Lee's awful and tragic death.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/3">Tackling the use of drugs and other substances by young people, including VSA, is a key element of the Government's national drug strategy. As my hon. Friend will know, some responsibilities for tackling VSA are devolved to the Scottish Executive and others are UK-wide. Broadly, the regulations under the Consumer Protection Act 1987 regarding offences of selling butane lighter refills are UK-wide, although there are some differences in Scottish law. Shopkeepers in Scotland can be prosecuted under common law if it can be proved that they knew that the product would be abused by the purchaser irrespective of age.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/4">My hon. Friend made the point well that it is important that laws are enforced. I hope that, through this debate, the message will go out loud and clear that the law is there to protect people. Let us see that law enforced to prevent the tragedies that he talked about.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/5">Education and health make important contributions to the comprehensive approach required to tackle this issue. Those areas are also devolved, but we work closely with the devolved Administrations, sharing experience and good practice, and where appropriate, achieving economies of scale with joint work. My hon. Friend will be aware that his work to secure the piloting and introduction of test purchasing in Scotland, which is a technique used successfully in England by trading standards officers to control the supply of volatile substances to under-18s, alongside other age-restricted products, has been quite successful. The Lord Advocate has announced that test purchasing can now be used in Scotland following a successful pilot involving under-age sales of tobacco. Alongside other action, the Scottish Executive are funding a training programme for trading standards officers on test purchasing. I hope that that training will make that action much more effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/6">I shall outline the action that we have taken in England under the wider drugs strategy, as well as specific action on VSA in both parts of the UK. Helping young people avoid the harms and risks associated with drugs and other substances requires a comprehensive approach. I know from my work before I came to the House that that approach is important: I was a teacher with specific responsibilities for drug education, which involved trying to encourage young people to avoid the lure of substance abuse. A comprehensive approach was needed not only in what the school was doing, but more widely across all the agencies and including the family from which the young person whom one felt was at risk came.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/7">We need tough action to crack down on dealers, particularly where young people are at risk. We need to provide effective substance misuse education and credible information to young people and their parents. We also need to ensure that those most at risk are identified and targeted early, and that specialist support and treatment are available for those already using drugs and other substances. Sometimes the joined-upness of the system could be improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/8">We have made good progress in England through our young people and drugs programme, in which the Home Office is working hard with the Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Healthto deliver evidence-based interventions designed toreduce the impact of drug and substance misuse on individuals and the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/9">The use of class A drugs by young people is stable, with encouraging reductions in the use of some other drugs. For example, as compared with 1988, the proportion of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting the use of cannabis in the past year has fallen by 16 per cent. Acquisitive crime, to which drug related crime makes a significant contribution, fell by 12 per cent. in the year to April 2005. Therefore, within our overall approach to drugs, we are taking specific action on volatile substance misuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/10">We introduced the Cigarette Lighter Refill (Safety) Regulations 1999, which banned the supply or sale of butane cigarette lighter refills to people under the age of 18. It is incumbent on us to ensure that people are aware of those laws and, as my hon. Friend pointed out, that the law is enforced and action is taken against offenders. Where we have training for trading standards officers, it is to be hoped that they will use the law to full effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/11">Although VSA is not an offence in itself, the supply or sale of any product to a person under the age of 18 with the knowledge that they are going to inhale it for the purposes of abuse is an offence. We need to ensure that people are aware of the law as it stands and that that law is enforced.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/12">We have also introduced a system of voluntary warning labels for aerosols and other abusable products. We published the first ever national framework for VSA in July 2005, which sets out an action plan aimed specifically at reducing deaths and harms associated with VSA. The action plan identifies new interventions and drives forward those for whose effectiveness we already have good evidence. There is not much point in having a strategy, for all its fine words, unless we think that it is going to work. That is the point. My stay in the Home Office will be related to trying to ensure that what we have written down in paper translates into action in communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/13">The key priority areas identified in the framework include providing better information about VSA. The Frank campaign has become a credible source of information and advice for young people and their parents. More than 1.3 million calls have been made to the Frank helpline, and there have been 11.3 million visits to the talktofrank.com website and more than 82,000 e-mails sent to and replied to by Frank.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/14">In 2005-06, about 4 per cent. of calls to the Frank helpline were about solvents. In response, the Frank website has increased the information that it provides on VSA. Frank leaflets are in the process of being revamped, with a greater emphasis on VSA. In addition, Frank helpline operators have received extra training on VSA better to equip themselves with calls from young people, parents and people working with those at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/15">The Scottish Executive also have a comprehensive programme of action under way. That includes providing advice on solvents through the &quot;Know the score&quot; information line, the distribution of materials to retailers in 2005 to raise awareness of the law governing sales of the items in question and the provision of drug education, including about solvents, in nearly all schools. The Scottish Executive have also supported the development of the Young Scot card, accredited under the British Retail Consortium's proof-of-age standards scheme. To date, 160,000 PASS-accredited cards have been issued. My hon. Friend will be interested to know that there will be a full roll-out of the scheme to all 32 Scottish local authorities in the next few months. As part of the package, the Scottish Executive have funded the production by the Scottish Retail Consortium of a leaflet that reminds retailers of the age restrictions applicable to the purchase of various goods, which covers the point we made earlier about people knowing about the law. The Scottish Executive have also provided Re-Solv with a three-year training grant with effect from 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/16">Schools have a key role to play. More young people need drug education in schools, including on VSA. Nearly 10,000 schools have achieved the national healthy schools standard, which includes substance misuse education. We need to ensure that drugs education is fully effective. The Home Office is funding the blueprint programme, which is the UK's biggest drug education research project. A key element of the blueprint programme is a health policy component designed to reduce the availability of age-restricted products, including volatile substances, where the programme was delivered. That included proof-of-age schemes, training for retailers and, where necessary, test purchasing activity. Final results from the research will be available by the end of 2007, and they will help to inform the future development of effective drug education.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/17">We are ensuring that those whose work brings them into contact with VSA in the health, education, social care, community and youth justice sectors have the confidence and skills to identify and respond to VSA. We are also ensuring that those who need help with drugs and other substances can receive specialist support.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/18">More young people are accessing targeted interventions through children's services and the youth justice system. More than 110,000 young people have engaged in &quot;Positive Futures&quot;, a social inclusion programme that uses sport and leisure activities to engage with disadvantaged and socially marginalised young people. There are 116 &quot;Positive Futures&quot; projects running in high-crime and deprived areas. &quot;Positive Futures&quot; provides training for project staff on substance misuse, including VSA. It is important for us not only to have the enforcement, but to work to tackle some of the deprivation and other causes that may lead disaffected young people to abuse substances.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/19">In England, 80 per cent. of local authorities have identified tackling substance misuse as a key priority in their plans for children and young people as part of the local delivery of &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;. The VSA framework has identified butane as a priority. It is imperative that we make butane cigarette lighter refills as far as possible impracticable for abuse by inhaling, especially by children and young people, as that is still the biggest cause of VSA deaths among under-18s. Action in that area could have a dramatic effect, and I am pleased that the VSA framework has targeted it as a key priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/20">It is important that all those working with vulnerable children and young people play their part in addressing the VSA needs of those in their care, and that all children and young people receive effective education about VSA. As my hon. Friend has pointed out, statistics from the St. George's hospital medical school show that deaths from VSA are at an all-time low.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/21">However&mdash;this is the important point&mdash;51 deaths in 2003 are still far too many. That means that in our country, approximately one young person every week dies from VSA. Six of those deaths were in Scotland, which is the lowest number for several years&mdash;but it is still far too many. As my hon. Friend pointed out, VSA is responsible for more deaths in young people under 15 than illegal drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/22">To conclude, the Government take very seriously the points that my hon. Friend made. We will consider reducing the capacity of the fuel cans, as he mentioned. We are reviewing that. It is about enforcing the law and ensuring that we make our young people aware, and the message that has to go out from here today is that one death a week among our young people from VSA shows that this is an important debate. My hon. Friend was right to raise this subject and the Government are trying to give it the priority that it needs. Far too often, other illegal drugs are mentioned and VSA gets forgotten. That is something that we must ensure does not happen, and my hon. Friend's debate has given us the opportunity to put forward what we are doing. Working together, we can ensure that we reduce the number of deaths still further.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/23" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/24" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-nine minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
