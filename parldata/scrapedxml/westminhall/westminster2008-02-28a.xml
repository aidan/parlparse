<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.321.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="321"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000221">
	<p pid="a.321.2/1">I assume that we have a low representation of Back-Bench Members, with the exception of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, because it is Thursday afternoon and there is only a one-line Whip today. It might also reflect the fact that there has already been enormous and extensive debate on the subject of this report. I shall get the joke in before anyone else does, which is that we are all going to be talking rubbish this afternoon&mdash;more so than usual.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.2/2">There has been enormous debate on the reports both within and outside Parliament, and perhaps people feel that the points that need to be made have been exhausted. The debate is on the fifth report of the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government, but we also draw hon. Members' attention to our sixth report of 2007-08 on the much narrower topic of waste reduction pilots, which is also relevant.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.2/3">I shall start by putting the fifth report in context. Although refuse collection is the responsibility of local authorities, and therefore of the Department for Communities and Local Government, it sits within the Government's general waste strategy, which is the responsibility of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The waste strategy places an imperative on us all, but particularly on local authorities, to reduce the amount of waste generated, to reuse and recycle, and only then to think about using landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.2/4">There are several powerful incentives for local authorities to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill. Such a reduction would make an important contribution to protecting the environment and to reducing energy use, thereby helping the country to meet its commitments on climate change. We are landfill junkies in this country, and if we carry on using landfill at the current rate, we will use it all up within 12 years. That fact alone&mdash;holes in the ground are going to run out&mdash;means that councils have to do something about reducing the amount of waste going to landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.2/5">There are also two financial imperatives on councils, the first of which is the landfill tax. The tax has been operating for some time, but the charge has been escalating, so it is becoming ever more expensive to put waste into landfill. The second is the landfill allowance trading scheme and the imperative that every council has to reduce, by 2010, the amount of waste that it sends to landfill against an individual ceiling. That ceiling is set by the past performance of that local authority area, and if it is not met by 2010, the relevant authority will receive large fines, which will end up being paid by council tax payers.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.2/6">Although much of the debate about refuse collection and charging has focused on the so-called bin taxes, people must bear it in mind that if we do not collectively reduce the amount of waste going to landfill, we will all pay more to our councils anyway. The issue is more about whether we can reduce excess charges than whether we should add charges, or whether all council tax payers should pay or only those who do not make much effort to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.2/7">The report, which was published in May 2007, covers refuse collection policy in England, because the DCLG is responsible only for England in these matters. It touches on several points on which I shall not expatiate because I want to concentrate on relatively few. I have made the point about cost pressures on authorities. If we continue to produce waste at the current level, there could be an extra &pound;150 on everyone's council tax bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.2/8">The report looks at the various ways in which councils have responded to that challenge. One of the most interesting parts of the inquiry was the sitting attended by representatives from different local authorities, all of whom had taken different decisions in response to the situations in their areas. They argued the case out in front of us, each trying to explain why they had made those choices and why they thought other councils had made other choices. That was particularly interesting because it was not a party political matter. There were huge differences of opinion between council leaders, but, without knowing, it would have been difficult to say which ones were from which party. People feel strongly about this subject, but it is not party political.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.322.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="322"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000222">
	<p pid="a.322.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on the quality of the report. She talks about the various borough initiatives. Does she agree that there is one large untapped area in which savings can be made? Some 8 million disposable nappies are disposed of every day in this country; that is 1 million during the three hours of this debate. I calculate that this Chamber, which is about 50 ft by 30 ft by 20 ft, would be filled every hour by the disposable nappies thrown away in this country. What did my hon. Friend learn from the local authorities mentioned on pages 25 and 26 of the report in relation to encouraging the use of reusable nappies in the way that the Nappy Alliance and others have been promoting for some time?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.322.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="322"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000223">
	<p pid="a.322.1/1">I sense a press release coming. My hon. Friend paints quite a disgusting word picture of piles of disposable nappies. We did not go into this issue in great detail, but disposable nappies are one of the smellier waste items. In a moment, I shall discuss AWC&mdash;alternate weekly collection&mdash;or fortnightly collections, as they are popularly known in the press. Obviously, a major issue in that regard is smell. Disposable nappies are a particularly smelly form of waste that causes particular problems, and several local authorities have introduced schemes to support and encourage parents to use traditional rather than disposable nappies.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/2">We had a little discussion about this before the debate, and it is a difficult area of personal behaviour to influence, because people have strong views on it. I am of an age that I used reusable nappies on my children and viewed disposables as an unhappy modern invention with unfortunate environmental consequences. However, both my daughters are wedded entirely to using disposable nappies for their children, and they cannot imagine how I managed with having to wash the reusable ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/3">There are some good initiatives, but there has also been debate, which we reproduced in the report, as to whether the environmental damage is all on one side. If one reuses nappies, one has to wash them, which uses enormous quantities of water. I applaud councils that have addressed this delicate matter, as parents need to be aware of the possible environmental problems with disposable nappies. Incontinence pads, which nobody talks about, are even worse in one sense, as they are usually rather larger.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/4">I shall speak in a little while about the different collection methods chosen by different councils, and about the perception of health risks that may be associated with some choices that have been made.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.323.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="323"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000224">
	<p pid="a.323.0/1">Do not all local authorities share the same problems and have to solve them in rather similar ways? The hon. Lady says that refuse collection is not really a party political matter, and no solution is owned by any one political party. None the less, this is often a matter of local party political debate, and all parties are prone to use it as a political weapon against an incumbent party that sincerely endeavours to solve the problem.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.323.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="323"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000225">
	<p pid="a.323.1/1">That is indeed the case. We compiled our report in the run-up to the local elections, and many assertions were made in the press at about that time that nemesis would arrive for certain parties&mdash;different parties in different places&mdash;in May, when the electorate would take revenge on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.1/2">The interesting thing about the local election results is that some parties that introduced fortnightly collections lost control, but the changes of control were more to do with the political swing across the country. Some councils that had just introduced fortnightly collections, and whose main opponents ran on the platform that that was a big mistake and that they would reverse the policy, retained power. There is no evidence from the elections that AWC was quite the vote-losing policy that was suggested in the popular press.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.323.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1395" speakername="Jacqui Lait" colnum="323"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000226">
	<p pid="a.323.2/1">I, too, congratulate the hon. Lady and her Committee on a very good report. It focuses entirely on refuse collection, which is the right thing to do, but there is the immediate interaction with disposal. The issue is being driven by the landfill tax. Did the Committee at any stage consider innovative methods of refuse disposal, or has it any plans to do so? Some methods would incentivise communities differently. To produce electricity, they would need a continuous flow of waste-to-power anaerobic digesters, gas plasmification systems or incinerators.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.323.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="323"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000227">
	<p pid="a.323.3/1">No, we did not, because the matter was not within the purview of our report or, indeed, our Committee. However, my view as an MP who resisted an incinerator in her area is that although energy from waste is an important option that could be investigated and considered, in general, most people agree that it would be a mistake to allow energy from waste to encourage people to be more cavalier about the amount of waste that they produce. We should still try to reduce waste generation, but also look at what we can do with the residual waste that will, inevitably, be produced. Energy from waste may be a sensible proposal along those lines.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.3/2">One thing that I will touch on later is how the choices that have already been made in different areas for treating refuse have reduced the options available in those areas for refuse collection. For example, large investments are being made in a particular form of waste treatment plant, which then limit the choices that can be made by local authorities in that area in respect of waste collection.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.324.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"  colnum="324"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000228">
	<p pid="a.324.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend on her report. On the point that she raises, may I make it clear that the Government's large investment programme&mdash;&pound;2 billion for private finance initiative credits for investment in waste infrastructure&mdash;is now designed in such a way that the conflict to which she refers, which is historical, will no longer arise? There is no question that authorities that brought such plants on stream would be allowed to have recycling rates that were jeopardised or kept down because of the potential for energy from waste.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.324.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="324"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000229">
	<p pid="a.324.1/1">Excellent. Perhaps I had better get on to the key points that I intend to make. I shall pass over most of the statistics that I had planned to give&mdash;many are in the report anyway&mdash;except to reiterate that Britain's recycling rates are relatively poor compared with those of many other European Union states. In particular, we have historically sent much more waste to landfill. I believe that everybody in this country is trying to achieve a large culture shift and a huge change in how each of us behaves, which is very difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/2">The report exclusively concentrates on refuse collection by local authorities. Most of that is domestic waste. Although local authorities can charge for and take away commercial waste, most commercial waste is not collected by them, and we note that. Important though domestic waste is, it is still a relatively small proportion of the waste that is produced; indeed, it is only a tenth of it. That is not a reason for us not be serious about it, but we need to keep it in perspective.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.324.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" speakername="Daniel Rogerson" colnum="324"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000230">
	<p pid="a.324.2/1">I, too, congratulate the hon. Lady and her colleagues on the Committee on the report. Clearly, they had some fairly tight terms of reference to do with refuse collection, but did they consider whether there was any role for local authorities in reuse schemes, as well as recycling schemes, to try to push people up the waste hierarchy?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.324.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="324"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000231">
	<p pid="a.324.3/1">We mentioned reuse in the report, but did not consider it in depth. We said that local authorities need to be thinking about what they can do to promote all three aspects&mdash;waste reduction, reuse and recycling&mdash;but we did not look into reuse in detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.3/2">Turning to the part of the report on collection methods, there has been a gradual shift towards AWC, which is the slightly more accurate way of describing what are popularly known as fortnightly collections. In almost every case, what is described as a fortnightly collection is a weekly collection in which the same things are not collected every week. Some things may be collected fortnightly, but there is a weekly collection.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.3/3">There has been a gradual shift towards AWC over the past decade, but it has accelerated in the past three years as councils have tried to boost recycling. There is a great debate as to whether the introduction of AWC has contributed to an increase in recycling. The Committee concluded that although there is an undoubted association between the introduction of AWC and an improvement in recycling rates, there is no demonstrable cause and effect. Councils that have introduced AWC have, quite properly, done so as part of a huge public education campaign in their area to explain what the change is, how it will work and why they are doing it. That may have contributed to the improvement in recycling rates as much as the waste being collected in a different way, although a number of councils that have introduced AWC were clear that, essentially, they were making it more difficult for householders to dispose of the residual waste left after they recycled.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.3/4">Those councils were seeking to engage householders' attention and get them to reduce the amount of residual waste, either by providing them with smaller bins, so it was more difficult for them to create large quantities of residual waste, or by deliberately having the residual waste collected only once a fortnight to make it more difficult and to encourage householders to reduce the amount of waste. However, councils that have not introduced AWC did have high recycling rates.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.325.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="325"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000232">
	<p pid="a.325.0/1">The hon. Lady gives credibility to the persuasive powers of councils, which surprises me. Is she aware of any councils that have doubled their recycling rates purely by persuasion?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.325.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="325"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000233">
	<p pid="a.325.1/1">That would be difficult to demonstrate; that is the point. Every time AWC has been introduced, there have been a large number of changes and it is difficult to decide which was responsible for the change in household behaviour and the improvement in recycling. However, the one thing that the Committee could say was that any council thinking of introducing AWC needed to involve itself in an extensive, effective public information campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.1/2">Otherwise, it would be highly likely that the scheme would descend into chaos with&mdash;as we all saw on our television screens, although I cannot remember which council was involved&mdash;people on an estate pursuing a refuse lorry and throwing their rubbish at the refuse collectors, such was their frustration at the introduction of AWC, which was clearly, in that case, done without the necessary public education or back-up.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.1/3">The Committee was not convinced that AWC is essential to improve recycling rates, but recognised that many councils introduced it because they believed that it would improve those rates. We debated whether it was simply a cost-cutting measure. That is difficult to work out. Essentially, when a council moves from an ordinary weekly collection to AWC, it is giving the householder the option of putting rubbish out in lots of different bags or boxes; if it does not introduce AWC, it will need twice as many refuse lorries as it had in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.1/4">Accordingly, introducing the change to AWC and having more separate collections can be done without doubling the number of vehicles. It is not so much that councils save money through AWC, but that they reduce the additional investment needed to start collecting glass, plastic, paper and residual waste separately. To that extent there is a cost saving, but mainly the additional costs that those councils would otherwise have had to meet are reduced in respect of a system that allows them to recycle more.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.326.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="326"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000234">
	<p pid="a.326.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it has been difficult for local authorities of all party political persuasions to introduce revised arrangements against the backdrop of the middle-market national tabloids jumping on a bandwagon, suggesting that AWC is the end of civilisation as we know it and conflating it with taxation and electronic chips in the bins at work, which, according to them, can track&mdash;in the south-west, for example&mdash;every last cider bottle, pasty and &quot;Focus&quot; leaflet that people throw away? It is difficult for local authorities to operate in that climate, is it not?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.326.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="326"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000235">
	<p pid="a.326.1/1">I agree. I was amused that, after our report was published, even though it did not back up what the tabloids had been saying, they nevertheless managed to say that it entirely vindicated them and the campaign that they had been running. Of course, it does not do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/2">The Committee's view on the subsequent report on the Government's waste reduction pilots is that they have pulled back on the original proposal to allow all councils to introduce charging if they wish and have instead focused only on five pilots precisely because of the vitriol in the tabloid press, which has made it difficult to have a sensitive debate about charges for residual waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/3">It became clear to us that the collection method had to vary depending on the nature of the area served. Most obviously, it is difficult for a council in a dense urban area with lots of flats and houses in multiple occupation to have an alternate weekly system, which relies on individual households having a significant amount of space to store the recyclables, or whatever, for the fortnight before the collection. Alternate weekly collections have rarely been introduced in dense urban areas because they do not work well, whereas they seem to work well in more suburban or rural areas, where space per household is not at quite the same premium and people have a reasonable amount of outside area where they can stash stuff until it is collected. Instead, many councils in urban areas have collective recycling facilities dotted about closer to people's homes, so people living in a flat can get rid of a lot of their rubbish themselves by taking it to the nearest recycling bin on the corner of the street. Clearly, it is horses for courses, which is why it is best to leave such decisions to councils, because they know their area better than anybody else possibly can.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/4">Food waste, along with disposable nappies, is the problematic bit of residual waste. Food waste is problematic because it is smelly and attracts vermin and other problems and because when it gets into landfill it, above all, generates methane gas, which causes enormous problems in managing landfill sites. We recommended that food waste should be collected weekly. I am glad that the Government accepted that that recommendation was the right way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/5">The Committee also considered the evidence on health risks from alternate weekly systems. There is no credible evidence that there are health risks, although the public prejudice is that there are. We had a terribly interesting discussion about the life cycle of maggots, which demonstrated that even a weekly collection is too slow for the average maggot. We probably do not wish to go into that subject any further. However, that shows that even a weekly collection may not come often enough to deal with that problem. In addition, individual householders need to take some responsibility for wrapping their waste so that it is not so easily accessible to flies, foxes or magpies, which seem immediately to distinguish which colour bag has all the goodies in it and leave the recycling bags well alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/6">I want to mention financing refuse collection and unofficial charging, which some councils seem to be pursuing at the moment, then I shall deal with a number of other points. Financing refuse collection is the issue that is concentrating everybody's minds. As I pointed out at the beginning, costs are inevitably rising due to the pressure on landfill. Sir Michael Lyons, in his report on local government finance, recommended that councils should be able to charge for waste collection and disposal and that that should be done separately from council tax, so that householders could see what they were paying for. Of the original 15 members of the European Union, the United Kingdom is the only one that does not allow local authorities to charge for refuse collection.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/7">The Government initially decided to introduce a limited power for local authorities to charge for waste collection, but hedged that in a number of ways. First, the incentives to households that reduced the amount of waste for landfill had to be balanced exactly by the fines on other households. The scheme had to be self-financing, so that there would be a redistribution of money from households that were not reducing waste to those that were. Secondly, the administration costs of the scheme could not be included in that self-financing envelope, and would have to be borne by the council. As I understand it, it was argued that that was acceptable because the point of introducing incentives and fines was to encourage households overall to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill, so the overall cost to the council of disposing of waste would be reduced, and that reduction could then be offset against the cost of administering the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/8">The Government were so concerned about the bin charges argument that the then Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" name="Phil Woolas">the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas)</phrase>&mdash;the predecessor to the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" name="Joan Ruddock">the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase>&mdash;indicated in Committee that the maximum incentive, and therefore the maximum charge, could be of the order of only &pound;30 or &pound;50 a year. The Committee felt strongly that such a sum was so small that it was unlikely to encourage householders to recycle more and to reduce waste, or to be a sufficient penalty on those who were not bothering, particularly as that sum in the context of their overall council tax was not very large.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/9">We felt that local authorities should be left to decide, that every local authority should be given the freedom to charge if they wished, that it could be done through the council tax if councils wished to do so, and that it should be for councils to decide how big or small the incentive or charge should be. We are obviously disappointed that the Government have subsequently decided not to give the power to all councils, but to go ahead with only five pilots. We are particularly concerned about the timing, because the pilot schemes would not come in until 2009 at the earliest, yet the thresholds that councils must meet for the landfill allowances trading scheme will come in in 2010. We think that the pilot schemes are just causing delays, because they will last three years, and then be reviewed and brought back to Parliament, when Parliament may decide to give the power to all councils. That will be well past 2010. If charging works, many councils will copy the few that act as trailblazers, and if it does not work, most will think, &quot;Thank goodness we decided not to do that and left the council next door to try it out.&quot; That is how it should be taken forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.328.0/1">I am following with interest the hon. Lady's comments about variable charging. Did the Committee look into how those incentives on local authorities might differ between unitary authorities and two-tier systems in terms of the different responsibilities for disposal and collection, and whether there are any differences in the way in which those costs might filter through the system, and act as more of an incentive in some areas than in others?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.328.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="328"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0002.htm#08022875000237">
	<p pid="a.328.1/1">No, we did not. We looked at the way in which decisions by the waste disposal authorities reduce the options available to waste collection authorities, and I shall give one example. There is a great debate about whether the amount of recyclables that people put out are maximised by making it simple and asking them to put out all their recyclables in one bag, which the council subsequently sorts, or whether householders should be required to do some of the pre-sorting. Making it simple so that the amount of recycling is maximised means that the recyclable products are more mixed up, so the quality of the end product, which is then recycled or sold to someone who recycles it, is poorer.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/2">Those options are closed down, depending on the infrastructure in which the waste disposal authority has invested for dealing with recyclables. Some waste collection authorities have fewer choices available to them than others because of waste collection costs. The Committee thought that there should be a lot more co-operation between councils to obtain economies of scale, and we endorsed the proposal to allow joint waste authorities because there is a lot of merit in that, although, again, it should be left to local authorities to decide whether they wish to do that. We are pleased that that option is available for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/3">I want to touch on unofficial charging. At the moment, waste collection authorities are not legally allowed to charge for refuse collection, which is why the Government are proposing the pilot schemes, although they can charge for collection of bulky items. They can refuse to collect waste that has been left outside the containers provided, or to introduce an additional charge. In fact, some local authorities have tried to limit the amount of refuse that householders can throw away by restricting the amount that can be put out each week, or by introducing charges for additional waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/4">I believe that Broxbourne in Hertfordshire is piloting a scheme under which it issues households with one purple refuse sack a week, and then charges, but only 28p, for each additional sack if required by the householder. North Dorset, more realistically, charges &pound;1 for additional sacks. The Committee thought that that was a good idea, but was slightly doubtful about whether it was legal. DEFRA apparently wrote in the autumn to all local authorities reminding them of the current legal position, but it is obviously still a grey area if Broxbourne feels safe about going ahead and charging for a service that it could be argued it should provide out of the council tax. That is an interesting way in which councils are, effectively, already using charges as a mechanism to try to encourage householders to produce less waste. The Broxbourne scheme is reducing waste by charging on volume, and there is the alternative of doing that by weight. The simplest way is through wheelie bins with a chip in them, which weighs the waste when it is tipped into the refuse lorry. Many councils have already introduced that so that they know how much waste is in the van and how much they are taking to landfill. The technology is not new; it would be used for a different purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/5">I want to draw attention to a couple of other points that came up during our inquiry and which relate to what might be deemed to be slightly perverse incentives that have arisen from the systems that have been put in place to encourage more recycling, particularly more diversion from landfill of biodegradable waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/6">First, it was pointed out to us that councils that encourage households to compost garden and kitchen waste on their own properties are removing green waste from the waste stream that the council picks up to be recycled or put into landfill. That means that the council's ability to reduce the amount of biodegradable waste going to landfill has been reduced, because the waste is out of the system. That creates a perverse situation, in which councils that have encouraged home compositing make it more difficult for themselves to reduce the proportion of biodegradable waste that they divert from landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/7">A side argument was made by some urban authorities. They said that where people have big gardens it was easy for authorities to reduce the proportion of biodegradable waste that goes to landfill because most of the biodegradable stuff is garden waste. Such waste is easy to handle, because it can be collected in a separate bin and taken away, which leads to a big reduction in the biodegradable waste that goes to landfill. In urban areas, however, nobody has big gardens, so they do not produce garden waste; all the biodegradable waste is food waste, which is much more difficult to divert. I merely repeat the arguments.</p>

	<p pid="a.329.0/1">Good gardeners, whether in urban, suburban or rural areas, would not put anything that could be composted into the system. Did the hon. Lady have any evidence to indicate whether local authorities in such areas had already had biodegradables discounted from their totals? If so, we would be talking about a reduction in what they were already collecting&mdash;rather than a notional increase&mdash;caused by the fact that people in their areas had gardens, leading to a higher target quantity of biodegradables. I hope that that makes sense.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.330.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="330"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0002.htm#08022875000239">
	<p pid="a.330.0/1">I think so. Nobody produced the numbers to demonstrate that point, but I know from my own council&mdash;I am not criticising it&mdash;that it collects garden rubbish and gives out free compost bins. The issue is how we strike the right balance, and I wonder whether there should be a greater concentration on getting people to compost in their own gardens, rather than seemingly encouraging them just to think that garden waste is like any other waste and that they can stick it in the bin to be taken away. That is a difficult balance for councils to strike.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/2">The point that I was trying to make earlier, however, is quite difficult&mdash;I had to write it down. The perfectly reasonable incentives that the Government have introduced to get councils to reduce biodegradable waste give rise to a slightly perverse incentive, in that they encourage councils to collect garden waste and compost it themselves, rather than letting the individual householder compost it. That also increases transport costs, which is not environmentally sensible.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/3">Another issue related to London. At this point I need to declare a constituency interest. The Mayor of London has criticised a number of London boroughs for shuffling off responsibility for commercial waste in a way that makes them appear to have reduced the amount of refuse that they send to landfill. That also highlights the fact that a great deal&mdash;two thirds&mdash;of London waste goes to landfill in the south-east, not in London. One of the landfill sites used is in my constituency, which explains my constituency interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/4">The Mayor of London provided us with a great deal of information to try to back up his claim that a number of London boroughs that had previously collected a lot of commercial waste, as well as residential waste, had deliberately reduced the amount of commercial waste that they collected either by putting up their charges so that businesses went elsewhere or by stopping collections. They therefore diverted away from themselves a lot of the landfill waste that originated with businesses, and the waste went instead directly from those businesses to a commercial operator and into landfill. In other words, there appeared to be a reduction in the amount of waste from London boroughs going to landfill, but that was simply because authorities had removed it from their collections from businesses and encouraged those businesses to deal with it through the private sector and to let it go to landfill without the council's mediation.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/5">It is a contentious point, and the data we received, which are reproduced in our report, do not prove the case one way or the other. Clearly, a debate is going on, because I have seen correspondence between the Mayor, the Department and, indeed, the European Commission. The Mayor is continuing to try to make his point and is pressing the Environment Agency to audit more closely what the London boroughs are doing. All that the Committee said was that as we could not work out what was going on, it would be a good idea if the Environment Agency made a proper audit so that people could be clear about whether such practices were occurring.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/6">That issue pointed up the fact that we need to look at both commercial and domestic waste when talking about the waste that goes to landfill. The only disincentive for sending commercial waste to landfill is the landfill tax escalator&mdash;such practices are not governed by the LATS threshold.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/7">Speaking as a south-east MP, I can tell Members that the issue of London waste going to landfill in the wider south-east is extremely unpopular with people who live near landfills in the region. My constituents may accept that we have to provide a hole in the ground for our own waste, but they are not particularly keen on lorry loads of London waste coming to landfills near us, with the problems that that causes. They are certainly with the London Mayor on the issue and want to persuade London boroughs not only to reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfill, but to deal with that waste within their own boundaries, rather than exporting it to the wider south-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/8">I have reached the end of the major issues that I wanted to raise in relation to our report. The Committee has carried out quite a number of interesting inquiries recently, but this one was particularly interesting, and all the members of the Committee have become much better informed about the various issues relating to refuse collection. It is extremely important that councils across the country do their best to ensure that their refuse collections not only meet the needs of their local populations, but help every local community to think seriously about the amount of waste that we generate. Councils must work together to reduce the amount of waste we create, to ensure that waste is recycled as much as possible and to reduce the amount that goes to landfill. I will be very interested to hear the contributions of other hon. Members.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.331.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="331"  time="015:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0002.htm#08022875000240">
	<p pid="a.331.0/1">It is disappointing to see so few hon. Members in the Chamber to discuss this important subject. Individually, and leaving aside the communities to which they belong, every Member of the House of Commons generates a fair amount of waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/2">This is an important debate, which has been politically highly charged, although it may be on the cusp of becoming a little more sensible. When we talk about the various strategies for disposing waste, I can think of a political party somewhere that will have opposed them, while the same political party will have proposed them somewhere else. A lot of political opportunism is riding on the back of what is a serious issue for us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/3">The report is good in part, but I have to be slightly critical of some of its conclusions. If people consult the document, they will see that I was not present at the final stage when the text and the press release were agreed. In retrospect, I felt that a sensible report was slightly distorted in the press.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/4">The prelude to the report is fairly well understood. There has been considerable churn in refuse arrangements throughout the land, brought about by the landfill tax and the escalating burden that it imposes on local authorities, by the very genuine and serious environmental concerns relating to methane emissions and the shortage of landfill and by our horrific record of generating rubbish, because our society is extraordinarily wasteful by European standards. I think <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> described our recycling rate as rather poor. It is actually disgracefully low.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/5">Some authorities have responded with what is now referred to as the alternate weekly collection, which they couple, by and large, with an increased recycling push, generally collecting such things as bottles, paper and compostable material, which are heavy and save an appreciable amount in landfill tax for council tax payers. I accept that the option is entirely up to local authorities, in their particular circumstances, and the communities that they represent, but I must record that the strategy has been going on for some time. It dates back to 2004 and 2005. However, the debate over it really lit up when the <i>Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> weighed in and took up the issue in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/6">I concede that the <i>Daily Mail</i> is a brilliantly laid-out newspaper. It has an intelligent mix of articles and is very clever in what it does, but ostensibly&mdash;in fact obviously&mdash;it has agendas, and it has a particular agenda on the issue that we are discussing. As with most of the media, when there is an agenda, the facts and reporting are subsumed into it. The <i>Daily Mail</i> was solidly against alternate weekly collection and these days where the <i>Daily Mail</i> goes the BBC supinely follows, so the issue went up the political Richter scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/7">The Minister, when interviewed, was obviously acutely sensitive about the issue, and was hard pushed to say anything positive about it. I asked him a simple question about whether research showed as a general trend that alternate weekly collection boosts recycling. The somewhat evasive answer was:</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/8" class="indent">&quot;As a general trend, recycling has more than quadrupled since 1997&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/9">I emphasise that I do not mean the current Minister, to whom I apologise; I am sure that she will be absolutely frank and forthright on the issue. I asked the then Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Has it anything to do with the alternate weekly collection?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/11">He replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/12" class="indent">&quot;I think the LGA has suggested that is the case. I think the LGA suggested that on average local authorities that have alternate weekly collections have 25 per cent. higher recycling rates than those that do not.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/13">Then quite touchingly he added:</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/14" class="indent">&quot;That is the Local Government Association saying that, please, journalists in this room, not us.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/15">He was obviously conscious of the effect that he might have on the media.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/16">The Committee concluded&mdash;perhaps following the Minister's evidence&mdash;that there was no direct causal link between the AWC and high rates of recycling. We said that such a direct causal link was unproven. It would not be unfair to say that the Committee's conclusion mystified the waste industry, the experts and people from organisations such as the Waste and Resources Action Programme, to whom I have spoken. Why? Because the evidence seems to show that 19 of the top 20 recycling councils use alternate weekly collection.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/17">I do not want to deliver a lecture on causality. I could, but it would detain Members for too long, and with few speakers present there is a good chance of our all getting away a little early. However, the AWC is not a necessary or sufficient condition for a high recycling rate. It is not necessary because the odd borough&mdash;usually a very middle-class borough&mdash;sometimes has high recycling rates, without the alternate weekly collection. Those are the exceptions, however. The AWC is not a sufficient condition because some local authorities introduce it so badly that it does not significantly boost recycling rates; the expected jump in rates does not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/18">That is the fact; but the same is true of the connection that can be made between lung cancer and smoking. People do not need to smoke to get lung cancer; it is not a necessary condition. Furthermore, some people who smoke, such as my 86-year-old aunt, who has smoked 20 a day since she was about 16, do not get lung cancer&mdash;at least, as far as we know she has not got it. Nevertheless, smoking increases the probability of lung cancer, and the evidence seems to suggest that AWC increases the probability of higher recycling rates, because it influences choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/19">We can all choose to be environmentally virtuous and recycle as much as we can, but we do not invariably do so. I have bins in my room for recycling materials, and I have bins for other stuff, as do all Members. It would be nice to think that I and my staff always put recyclable material in the recycling bin, and that we do not follow the path of inertia and throw it in the nearest bin. However, from observation of my staff, myself, and other Members, that is not invariably the pattern. Our choices are influenced by our opportunities, and if our opportunities to recycle exceed our opportunities to dump, we tend to recycle more. That is usually, although, I rush to add, not invariably, a feature of the AWC.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/20">Sensibly&mdash;and this is a point on which I agree wholeheartedly with the Committee's conclusion&mdash;AWC should be part, as I am sure the Minister will say, of a package of measures including education and the opportunity to recycle, rather than the opportunity to get one's rubbish picked up less frequently than before. As the Committee said, the system must be variable according to local circumstances. Members with constituencies where there are large numbers of flats or houses in multiple occupation&mdash;or areas in their constituency with lots of flats or HMOs&mdash;will know of the necessity for tailor-made solutions for those areas and the environments where rubbish is collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/21">We have moved on in our understanding of what makes AWC work better, to insist that it should include food waste. We do not want people to put all their food waste down the sink, which might be the alternative to leaving it lying around for another week. We should prefer that it be collected weekly, and in the best schemes it is. We do not want it pushed down the sink or hanging about rotting&mdash;although, as the report states, we did not find evidence of increases in maggot and vermin infestation. The Committee called for more research, and it will be interesting to see what research reveals, but so far all we have to go on is anecdotal evidence. On the basis of that, we called for more research. I venture to suggest that wheelie bins present greater challenges to rats, in many areas, than the old black-bag system did. I do not know a great deal about the psychology or abilities of rats, but that is my supposition, and wheelie bins are normally part of the AWC system.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/22">I want to turn briefly to a real problem with current AWC regimes. Often, although not always, they exclude adequate arrangements for plastic and cardboard, which are big elements in the residual waste stream and are rarely collected door to door. Normally, people must travel to dump them somewhere, but they are of course by and large recyclable&mdash;not all, but most, plastic can be recycled, and certainly all cardboard. A feature of the situation is that those materials are light, so their contribution to a council's reduction in the landfill tax is relatively small. They take a lot of transporting around. If someone is carrying plastic bottles about in a lorry, they are driving a lorry full of air with not much material. There is also the environmental argument that a plastic bottle has the advantage of being chemically inert, so that it does not degenerate and give off carbon dioxide and methane emissions in landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/23">The problem is a serious one for the householder, but is not so serious for the council, which is not affected in the same way as it would be by failure to recycle bottles, compostable material or other heavy stuff; although, self-evidently, compostable material need not be transported to be dealt with in an environmentally sound way. Plastic and cardboard are a transport headache for the council, requiring many lorries to shift not much, by weight, plastic and cardboard. They are a sorting headache at the end of their journey, because there are various perplexing kinds of plastic that need to be sorted by type before they can be usefully recycled and reused. They are also a disposal headache, because people do not always know of an end use for some of the products. In other words, the markets are relatively immature and insufficiently developed at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/24">Facilities need to be developed&mdash;I think that the Under-Secretary was alluding to this&mdash;on a sub-regional basis, so that a number of local authorities can have access to adequate ways of sorting out and making further use of unwanted plastic in particular. Encouragement is also needed from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for the end-use market. Various things are thrown out in very large quantities&mdash;for example, CDs and DVDs&mdash;that do not at present have a valid alternative use but can have one, given the right circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.0/25">The report is largely about collection policy and how it is carried out, but collection policy cannot be divorced from a sub-regional environmental strategy that encompasses both facilities to make use of what councils collect and end uses for the products of collection. There is a need for massive co-ordination&mdash;a job for DEFRA or whoever. If there is local decision making&mdash;a good thing which I am in favour of&mdash;but an absence of sub-regional co-ordination, the whole process will become infinitely more complex and less worth while.</p>

	<p pid="a.334.0/1">I reiterate my compliments to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> and her Committee on putting together the report and at least considering the issue that we are debating. In addition to speaking for my party on local government issues, I am a member of the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and I dare say that in due course that Committee will examine waste issues in general. Perhaps the EFRA Committee will consider disposal issues to a greater extent than this report does, but it will inevitably inform any work that the Committee chooses to do, so it is very valuable from that point of view.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.0/2">I am also engaged in a fellowship with the Industry and Parliament Trust. Unlike other Members who may have had sexy assignments in different industries, I have been doing mine in the waste industry, but it has been fascinating working with the Waste Recycling Group of Northampton. I thank Mike Snell and all the other people at the company for giving me an induction into the culture of the waste industry. Every sector has its own language, history and culture, and it has been interesting getting to grips with some of the issues. The company focuses more on disposal than collection but, as we have heard from the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase>, the two are inextricably linked. Perhaps further research and work by the Government will explore ways in which that relationship can be made even more beneficial in terms of recycling rates and landfill diversion.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.0/3">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West focused on a number of key issues in the report and, through interventions, was drawn into other areas, too. Before I consider the report's recommendations and the Government's initial response last autumn, I note that some of the points that she raised are crucial; for example, we must recognise that municipal waste is only a tiny part of the total waste burden that we have to address. The last recommendation needs much more exploration with a view to the contribution that could be made to giving small and medium-sized enterprises a greater opportunity to recycle in a way that is affordable for them and accessible to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.335.0/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman's view that small and medium-sized businesses should be given greater encouragement to recycle. Is he aware that the Government and DEFRA have cut the budget for WRAP, which has now withdrawn all the work it was doing with small and medium-sized enterprises?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.335.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" speakername="Daniel Rogerson" colnum="335"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0003.htm#08022875000243">
	<p pid="a.335.1/1">I am aware of all the problems that the various agencies that work with DEFRA and rely on it for their funding have experienced. I know that you will not want us to step outside the bounds of the debate, Mr. Amess, but we could talk about the Rural Payments Agency and various other things that have affected DEFRA's budget. As the hon. Lady focused on WRAP, I will mention the work that NISP&mdash;the national industrial symbiosis programme&mdash;is doing with larger bodies, too. It would be a great shame if that work, which has been undertaken, is not allowed to be pushed forward to effective conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/2">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West raised issues relating to integration of the strategies of disposal authorities and collection authorities. That is a crucial question. I have had the opportunity to visit some disposal facilities, so I have seen where recycling is sorted, in fairly unpleasant circumstances. Companies such as WRG and others are excellent employers and do a great deal to look after the work force who carry out the sorting, but inevitably it is not the most glamorous of jobs. Other authorities have concentrated on encouraging the sorting of materials at source&mdash;in other words, by the householder&mdash;which leads to an easier process further down the chain, so the hon. Lady was right to focus on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Southport, a member of the Communities and Local Government Committee, spoke strongly about his belief that alternate weekly collections have a significant role to play in meeting our targets as a nation and in terms of improving recycling rates. He made a very powerful argument for that. Although he is a philosopher, he did not delve too deeply into causality, but he made it clear that he believes that there may be a stronger link between the two than the final report or debate on it in the media may have indicated.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/4">I shall deal with some of the recommendations. There are a great number of them and although time is available to us, I sense from other Members that they may wish me not to explore every recommendation in detail, so I shall pick out just a few. The first issue is local authority targets and whether, under the new regime for local authorities, waste should automatically be one of those targets. My party welcomes the approach that the Government have taken on simplifying targets, although it remains to be seen how it will work in practice. The targets ought to be agreed as part of a bottom-up process. There are difficulties with insisting that, in all circumstances, waste ought to be one of those, although in most cases, as waste is moving up the agenda, waste issues are likely to be key targets for local authorities through their own priority setting, rather than having to be imposed from above. I think that was the Government response: they were cautious about imposing a target on all local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/5">Recommendation 3, which relates to the clear and straightforward guidelines that should be provided to householders to encourage their participation and co-operation in recycling, is very important. The Government response is that through work with WRAP they are encouraging good practice on collection systems, including advice on engagement with residents. That is important, but it does not go quite far enough in terms of providing that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/6">The report talks about our historical problems. Now that many flowers bloom across the country in terms of systems, it is difficult to turn the clock back and simplify things, but I hope that the possibility exists of building on WRAP's work, as the report suggests, in relation to colour coding and so on to make the system easier for people to understand. The Government response to that recommendation may not go quite far enough to meet what the Committee said about guidelines and providing clearer information to householders.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/7">The knotty problem of food waste is, in many cases, one of perception. As part of the IPT fellowship, I had occasion to visit Bracknell council and talk to the council leader&mdash;who speaks for the Local Government Association on some of these issues&mdash;about Bracknell's experiences with AWC. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southport said, if there is effective communication with local residents and people are made aware of the benefits, that will address some of the perception problems, which I think have informed some of the rumours about what might happen&mdash;the horror stories about vermin and maggot infestations and so on. People occasionally see the worst in a system if they are told that that is the likely outcome. Councils that have invested significantly in winning people over to a system before its introduction seem to have had far better results in terms of people's acceptance. That is an important lesson to be learned, whatever changes occur with waste collection. Waste is one of those services where, as long as it is working well, no one wants to talk about it or consider it. On the other hand, if there is a problem it moves quickly up the agenda. That is part of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/8">The report makes several recommendations about the need to allow local authorities flexibility to develop their own schemes. I have already referred to the need for principles that people can get used to, so that when they move from one area to another&mdash;people change jobs far more often, they move around the country more and are more mobile&mdash;they can expect to find some basic ideas in operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/9">My local authority of Restormel is in a rural part of north Cornwall; our circumstances are very different from those in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase>. We should not expect the circumstances of collection to be the same. That is an important principle, and I am glad that the report focused on it in some detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/10">The issue of minimum standards is interesting. The idea that core definitions of what householders should expect from their refuse collections is to be found in recommendation 15. Encouraging people to think more about what they receive from the waste service and what contribution they can make to develop the service and make recycling more useful and effective would be most beneficial. The recommendation on incentives is a crucial part of that engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/11">I turn to the question of varying charges. Unlike alternate weekly collection and promotion schemes, in which people are encouraged to look creatively at what they can do to increase recycling, the moment one starts to raise issues of finance a negative connotation is unfortunately put on it. People think that they may be worse off rather than thinking that they might be better off if they were to adapt to such a system. We should recognise that people may be able to take advantage of the system in different ways, so we must ensure that taxation does not become more aggressive. The report also deals with the small amounts involved and whether they will be significant enough to effect change. That is an important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/12">Treating waste as a utility is a fascinating idea. In my part of the south-west, water charges are a huge issue, but the fact that they are separate from other household charges focuses people's attention on them and has pushed people into using water meters, because they think such things are efficient. Considering waste as a utility is a tempting prospect; it could encourage people to consider how to be more efficient and thus become part of the solution, and educate them on how little we spend on waste. We have heard about the recycling rates in other countries, but in many countries people pay far more for waste collection and waste disposal than we do. We have been somewhat spoilt by the availability of landfill and the low costs that councils have managed to achieve. Although we congratulate them on the efficiencies they have been able to achieve, people have been somewhat spoiled in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/13">I would prefer councils to make more of an effort to say how little of the council tax is spent on waste. As I said earlier, it is a visible service when things go wrong, and people tend to see it as a core service and assume that a vast amount of their council tax goes towards providing it, but we know that is not the case. In fact, when I was a member of Bedford borough council, the chief executive often said that whenever he spoke to local organisations and groups that were concerned about costs, he used to lay out just how much of their council tax went on some of the key services, and they were stunned to find that they were getting such good value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/14">The idea of considering waste as a utility an interesting one, but I would be cautious about fettering councils in that way. It could take away another function from local authorities, rather as education funding is now entirely discrete. It might undermine the flexibility of local authorities in that respect and I hope that the information could be provided to local residents without necessarily saying that waste collection had to be treated as a discrete system.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/15">Finally, I return to the question of recycling for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly for new businesses and for people who have not been involved in business before, whose only experience of waste has been dealing with domestic waste. They are often surprised at the lack of accessible services for commercial recycling. There are huge gains to be made; for instance, in my constituency glass bottles could be far more effectively reused or recycled.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/16">There is more work to be done. The Communities and Local Government Committee may return to the question in future, although I know that it is considering a great many other inquiries, as the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West said, or another Select Committee may consider the matter. As well as giving answers, the report raised some interesting questions, and I certainly welcome it.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/17">I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in expanding on the issues raised in the Government response in October, although on some issues they seemed not quite to have got the point that the Committee was making and they could go a little further in providing a way forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.338.0/1">I reiterate my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> and her Committee on two excellent reports on refuse collection.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.0/2">As a child of parents who lived through the second world war, I find an awful lot of the comments made on waste seriously familiar. All my life I have recycled; my pocket money used to be made up of returned penny deposits on bottles. In a sense, much of this is familiar in a personal way. However, as a reaction to the second world war, as we became richer we became more profligate with our waste. We are now trying to re-impose a regime of frugality in the midst of wealth, which is not the easiest thing to do. I therefore have enormous sympathy with local authorities, which have responsibility for waste collection and disposal, in trying to change what has become a fundamental aspect in people's psyche&mdash;as we got richer, it became an indicator of greater wealth that we could throw our waste away.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">The hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase> is right: this may not be a pleasant topic, but it is fascinating because it is an industry in the midst of innovation. We see new thinking and new science being brought to bear on how to deal with our inevitable waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.0/4">From the 1960s onwards, being relatively young then, I remember being chastised by older people, who said, &quot;Why do the supermarkets pack everything in so many layers?&quot; or, &quot;Why can't we have loose biscuits?&quot; I had to tell them about health and safety and keeping the germs away from the tins of biscuits, and tell them that the packaging was necessary because people would buy the biscuits only if they looked pretty. Even then, they said, &quot;This is nonsense. We don't need all this packaging.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.338.0/5">There is a real and very human response to what is seen as wasteful. It is encouraging that the whole of society is now coming to recognise that waste is a problem that has to be dealt with, and dealt with intelligently.</p>

	<p pid="a.339.0/1">I hate to put in a good word for those involved in the packaging industry, but they would probably make the point that an awful lot of stale biscuits were wasted under the old regime. Therefore, as the hon. Lady says, an intelligent approach is required.</p>

	<p pid="a.339.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. I remember being able to buy bags of broken biscuits. Those who are old enough&mdash;I suspect that he possibly is not&mdash;will remember that bags of broken biscuits were a wonderful thing on a Saturday afternoon. However, even in that heyday, there were difficulties.</p>

	<p pid="a.339.2/1">To put a counter point, does the hon. Lady accept that one reason why there is so much food wastage is because much food is pre-packaged, and therefore individuals have to buy quanta of food. If the food is perishable, there may be more than they can consume within the time available. That is another reason why returning to people being able to choose how much they buy might be more effective.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.339.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1395" speakername="Jacqui Lait" colnum="339"  time="015:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0003.htm#08022875000248">
	<p pid="a.339.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her intervention. At some point, I was going to congratulate the Government&mdash;which, as she knows, is rare&mdash;on responding to the pressure for proper cooking to be taught in schools, because that is how we will fundamentally reduce the amount of food waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/2">There was a time when people had roast on Sunday, cold on Monday, shepherd's pie on Tuesday, sandwiches on Wednesday, soup on Thursday and fish on Friday. Where is the waste in that? We should all start to apply that mental regime, as it is common-sense management of the family larder&mdash;I will sound like Mrs. Thatcher soon. There does not have to be food waste, although I am grateful to have food waste for my garden because I compost it. That is enough home-grown philosophy.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/3">If we can move our society much more in that general direction, we will be able to deal with an awful lot of issues concerning waste in general and food waste in particular without having to put in place enormously expensive recycling and disposal systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/4">I am feeling slightly schizophrenic. Long before I became a Member of Parliament, my constituency had a weekly recycling collection. All waste is collected once a week and is divided into non-recyclables, bottles, plastic and cans, and paper. That has been happening in the borough of Bromley for more than 10 years, and it has worked very effectively. As a London borough, Bromley has long been at the forefront of recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/5">I also live in Rye, as my husband is leader of East Sussex county council, which has just introduced alternate weekly collection. If there is one problem that I have on a Sunday night, it is remembering what is being collected that week. I am sure that I am not alone in that. I am conscious that, because this is a new system, it has taken a long time for people to adjust, although I give credit to the local council for providing first-class publicity and information. People knew what was happening, what they had to do and how they were going to do it, and the boxes were broadly delivered in good time.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/6">The fact that the new vans were the wrong size and could not get down the lanes in rural areas was a management problem for the company that took the job on, and it had nothing to do with the publicity programme of the local council, which I thought was first class, even though I looked at it with a critical eye.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/7">However, the information that we extracted from DEFRA, under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, on the responses to its consultation shows that many issues have emerged in relation to the knock-on effects of the complexity of AWC. Whether people have a fortnightly or a weekly collection, evidence is emerging that there is a big increase in fly-tipping. We are very lucky that last summer was cool. We cannot use last summer as an indication that there is unlikely to be greater infestation by animals. In cooler weather, the attraction of food smells is less than in a hot summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/8">Some years ago, during a hot summer, I remember carefully wrapping up some prawn shells, which even I cannot recycle or cook with. When I got home a week later, the shells were a mass of maggots. I knew what I had to do; I did it and it did not work. We have not had a hot summer. I hope that we have a hot summer, but people who live in the country will be hoping and praying that we do not. In terms of infestation, it is unproven that a weekly food collection will not cause health problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/9">The other factor that irritates so much is the sheer volume of food that goes into plastic containers, which has been mentioned. Few of those containers are recyclable. I am sure that every Member in this Chamber looks for the number on the bottom of such containers. If they can spot it, often it is not 1, 2 or 3. That is grating for everybody. We must do more work with the supermarkets, which are the prime users of plastic containers, and the packaging industry to ensure that we have many more recyclable containers.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/10">What concerns me more than anything is ensuring that council tax payers do not have to be charged further for the collection of waste. I heard this morning that, on average, band D council tax will be about &pound;1,400, which is an enormous increase in what local people have to pay. We are already on the cusp of a council tax payers' revolt and people do not want to have to pay even more for their waste collection, which many people regard as about the only service that they get from their local council. We should ignore that fact that people have access to social services, because many people do not use them. If people do not have children, they feel that they are not using the education service. In many cases, the only thing that people think that they pay council tax for is waste collection.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/11">I sympathise with the views expressed in the <i>Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>: if people feel that they will have to pay more tax because of waste collection, there will be a revolt. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i>Daily Mail </i>do not run articles that do not chime with their readership. If they believe that their readership is not interested in the issue of extra taxation, they will not run articles about it. Yes, that is a circular, chicken-and-egg argument, but we cannot blame those two newspapers for highlighting the bin taxes. They would not do so if they did not believe that their readers were very likely to revolt against any form of bin taxation.</p>

	<p pid="a.341.0/1">How does the hon. Lady regard an article that appeared in the <i>Daily Express </i>suggesting that the charges proposed by the Government for the incentive schemes would be up to &pound;1,000 per family?</p>

	<p pid="a.341.1/1">That could well be what the Government plan to impose; we do not know. We have been told that the amount could be &pound;30 to &pound;50. I am no expert in the economics of the waste industry, as I hope I have made clear&mdash;the hon. Member for North Cornwall might be able to talk us through that topic&mdash;but if one were to work out the total cost of disposing of the extra waste, including the new investment in incinerators, anaerobic digesters and gas plasmification systems, that might well be the genuine cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.341.2/1">The hon. Lady is being disingenuous. She knows that the indicative amounts, which my predecessor quoted, were in the region of &pound;30 to &pound;50. I am on record as saying that the point of piloting is to see what would be the appropriate amount. I suggested that it could be as high as &pound;100, but does the hon. Lady really think that it could be &pound;1,000&mdash;that any local authority would wish to charge that amount, when, as she says, it is the entire cost of the council tax?</p>

	<p pid="a.341.5/1">We are not going to get much further with this argument. I replied in terms of the potential true economic cost. It would be up to each local council whether they took it on the chin. I do not know the true economic cost, but I would be interested to know&mdash;perhaps the Minister can introduce this to her remarks, rather than have our debate turn into a dialogue&mdash;the potential for the Government to get on stream the anaerobic digesters and gas plasmification systems, quite apart from the incinerators, that will fundamentally deal with the waste in an environmentally friendly way.</p>
	<p pid="a.341.5/2">On the continent, anaerobic digesters are going into full production, so why do we not have them in this country? In East Sussex, we have just received approval for an incinerator, the community is being incentivised by a reduction in electricity prices and there is the potential for an anaerobic digester to go into East Sussex. That is part of the contract with the provider.</p>

There is a chicken and egg situation, or a problem, with initiating those new technologies, because companies tend to undertake them only when they are proven and those companies are entering into contracts with local authorities. Does she agree that the Government have a role in encouraging pilots with companies to develop such technologies? Once the first is up and running and shown to be effective, others may follow.</p>

	<p pid="a.342.3/1">I am in the middle of some waste disposal, I am afraid.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.3/2">I am concerned about the time it will take to introduce the bin tax pilots, which have been referred to. I am concerned that, by then, people will have made up their minds about being charged for waste. They probably do not believe that they will ever be rebated, and there will be deep scepticism about bin taxes. As they already pay council tax in full, they do not believe that they should be charged further for their waste, so we do not wish the pilots to go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.3/3">We believe that well introduced and variable forms of waste collection will work, and that there is a clear correlation between the collection and effective disposal of waste. Until we get a genuine system of modern waste disposal, we will not see the full impact on household collection. There will be many unforeseen changes in people's waste disposal habits long before the introduction of bin taxes, so I would be much more comfortable if the Minister reassured us that there will be a serious and connected examination of investment in waste disposal, involving the highest levels of new technology, so that we can move forward much more effectively to ensure that we not only increase our waste recycling, but use disposable household waste much more effectively to compost, pelletise and heat homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.3/4">There are many other ways of thinking of waste as a commodity that can be used, rather than as something to be disposed of.</p>

	<p pid="a.343.0/1">I am trying to follow the hon. Lady's argument, but I would be grateful if she clarified it. Am I to understand that she thinks that the way forward&mdash;I am paraphrasing&mdash;is to use waste as a resource, and to try to extract energy from it or recycle it? Is she not interested in measures that would encourage householders to reduce the amount of waste that they generate?</p>

	<p pid="a.343.1/1">I would have thought that our earlier exchanges demonstrated that I am keen to reduce the amount of waste that is produced. I am very keen that it should as much as possible be recycled, but I want investment in modern technology so that waste that cannot be recycled may be used more effectively and profitably for the benefit of communities. That technology includes anaerobic digestion, which produces further compost, and incineration, which produces heat. We should not be morally dismissive of the opportunities to add value to waste, and we should not regard it purely as waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.1/2">We want to hear from the Government that they have decided that bin taxes are a waste of time and effort, which is what the evidence from most local authorities and many organisations shows, and that the Government are much more focused on the effective disposal of waste using modern technologies. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.343.2/1">I am grateful to the Communities and Local Government Committee and to the Liaison Committee for the opportunity to debate the vital matter of waste collection, and to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>, for the manner in which she presented the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.2/2">Since the publication of the report and our response to it, there has been a second report. In between, we responded to further requests for information. Most of the points made in the reports and in further questions have been repeated in the debate, and I need to repeat some of the Government's responses, which are already on record. I shall also attempt to respond to the points that have been made in the debate and update Members on recent developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.2/3">Recommendations 1 and 9 in the report endorse the Government's plans for local authority indicators on waste and recommend that they should be prioritised by local government. The three main waste indicators that we said we would bring in have been included in the new performance framework, and we have given particularly strong encouragement to poorly performing authorities to include them in their area agreements. A technical consultation has been completed since we last corresponded with the Committee, and the final indicators are due to be published tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.2/4">Recommendation 2 endorsed the Government's recognition of local authorities' autonomy, but recommended that the Government commission research and evaluate best practice. DEFRA's waste and resources evidence programme has funded the Waste and Resources Action Programme to undertake such work, and its report will be published at the end of next month. We expect it to include new advice to local authorities on food waste and related matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.2/5">Recommendation 4 relates to WRAP's &quot;Love Food Hate Waste&quot; campaign, which I helped to launch some time ago. I am pleased to report that the campaign is already identifying early indications of measurable behaviour change. A growing number of local authorities are actively engaged with the campaign, and although figures will not be validated until April, indications are that well over 1 million additional households are committed to reducing the amount of food waste that they produce.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.2/6">Recommendations 3, 5, 6, 7 and 12 are all on the type and frequency of household collections&mdash;a matter, as we have heard, of some controversy in the media, but on which, I am glad to say, the Committee and the Government substantially agree. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, will probably agree that whoever coined the phrase &quot;alternate weekly collections&quot; did a huge disservice to waste management. It implies that services are reduced. Far from it; the changes would better be labelled &quot;alternating collections&quot; or &quot;multiple collections&quot;. As hon. Members are aware, and have said today, they are designed to give a better service through the collection of dry recyclables one week and residual waste another, thus preserving a weekly service. As the Committee recommended, it is crucial that they are introduced properly. Comprehensive advice on them is available from WRAP.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.2/7">Although my hon. Friend expressed the Committee's finding that there was no direct correlation between alternate weekly collections and an increase in recycling, it is a fact&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> mentioned this&mdash;that of the top 20 recycling authorities in England, 17 have such collections. I think that he said 19, but 17 is the up-to-date number. In the other three, which are county councils, the majority of districts have alternating collections.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.2/8">Cost-cutting has been mentioned in the debate. I can assure the Committee and its members that that is not the motivation of local authorities, and there is no direction about it from the Government. Of the total efficiency gains that local authorities have reported, they put about 0.1 per cent. down to alternating collections.</p>

	<p pid="a.344.0/1">The Minister makes the point that local authorities have invested any savings in developing services, which is good. Will the Government take a similar approach to the landfill tax that goes to the Treasury, by ensuring that it is spent on waste minimisation?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.344.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" colnum="344"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0004.htm#08022875000263">
	<p pid="a.344.1/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows full well that the initial increase in landfill tax of &pound;3 was hypothecated and has provided considerable sums to support a range of waste minimisation and other waste strategies. That programme was designed, through the business resource efficiency and waste programme, to last three years, and it has done enormously good work. Although there is to be a substantial increase in the tax, the money from it will not be dealt with in the same way. It is important to remember that the increase will be the major driver of diverting waste from landfill. We have talked a lot about household waste, but commercial and industrial waste represents the majority of waste, as hon. Members have said.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/2">Lurid reports of vermin infestations as a result of alternating collections continue to be reported in the media. We cannot find evidence of such infestations, and the National Pest Technicians Association has just reported that there has been a significant decrease in rodent numbers. Its belief is that the use of rodent-proof wheeled bins is the probable cause of that. That bears out what WRAP, the Committee and the Government have said: that there must be appropriate receptacles if food waste is to be collected and waste left for longer than we have been used to. That is an important lesson, and the Government continue to say that good management is the key. Clear information and education for householders, and particularly the provision of sealable containers for food and kitchen waste, must be at the heart of a successful programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/3">In that context, I am delighted to report that 19 councils are participating in the DEFRA-funded weekly food collection trials that are being carried out by WRAP. Early results of the trials have shown that separate collection of food waste is popular, with 60 to 80 per cent. participation and about 3 kg of food waste collected per household per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/4">I turn to the most contentious issue in the first report and the subject of the second: the Government's proposals to remove the general prohibition on charging for waste. As my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, noted, the UK is the only country in the EU15 that has that rule. In recommendation 24, the Committee asserts that:</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Breaking the link with council tax and establishing refuse collection as a utility, like gas or sewerage, might have the radical impact the Government say they want.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/6">My hon. Friend and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase> mentioned that point. If our plans are judged against such a radical departure from current practice, of course they will not find favour&mdash;that is absolutely clear. But there is no evidence, including from the Committee, to suggest that such a dramatic change is supported in local government, or even less by the public. I make no apology for restating the Government's intention to go ahead with piloting waste incentive schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/7">Let me be clear about taxation, on which hon. Members had a little sport at my expense in the report, although not in the debate. There could be reward-only schemes&mdash;those based only on rewards, not on charges. Deciding on such things is the point of having pilots. Where charges are applied, they will not behave in the same way as traditional tax. When I gave evidence to the Select Committee, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-17">17 December</phrase> last year, I had not been advised that the charges could be deemed to be a tax. The Treasury has now clarified that they will, and that information was conveyed to the Committee by the Department for Communities and Local Government in a letter on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/8">Unlike other taxes, no revenue will accrue to the Treasury or the local authority, because the schemes will be revenue neutral. Money collected from those who fail to recycle will be paid back to all those who do. We have found in our consultations that people believe that that is intrinsically fair. It is accepted that if people do what society requires of them, they will get that service free through their council, but that if they do not comply, it is reasonable to be charged.</p>

	<p pid="a.346.0/1">We have considered that carefully. I depart very much from the argument that the hon. Lady made earlier about the enormous costs that she wants to heap on to the collection system that were all about disposal&mdash;costs to cover anaerobic digesters, incinerators and so on. The actual cost to the local authority of administering such schemes will obviously be analysed during piloting. However, we have looked at schemes operating elsewhere and believe that up to &pound;18 per household will be saved by the local authority from not having to send so much waste to landfill. These schemes are not dreamt up to give local authorities something new to do, but are based on proper consideration of what is done in countries where recycling rates have increased dramatically as a consequence of charge and reward schemes. We make no apology for the fact that the pilots are included in legislation currently in the House of Lords.</p>

	<p pid="a.346.1/1">I am interested to explore a little further why the Government support pilots rather than opening it up for local authorities to experiment. We have talked about innovative authorities coming up with their own systems. I am intrigued about why there are only five pilots. Will that not hold back other authorities?</p>

	<p pid="a.346.2/1">I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm, and that of other Committee members. I understand why the Committee wanted all local authorities to have the power to get ahead. However, we had to listen very carefully to all who have continued to engage in this debate. That is why we felt that, if there is uncertainty and people are not convinced about our evidence, it is reasonable to say, &quot;Let's pilot schemes in this country and see how they work&quot;. Piloting is a good way in which to learn lessons about best practice before deciding whether to roll out any of the schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.2/2">I remind hon. Members that the schemes are strategy proposals that local government can choose to take up. They are not to be imposed. If no local authorities come forward, there will be no pilots. However, we believe that we should offer the opportunity, which is why we are legislating.</p>

	<p pid="a.346.3/1">I have an entirely practical question. How does the Minister envisage charging larger families and in poorer areas?</p>

	<p pid="a.346.4/1">Poverty is no reason why people cannot recycle. People can avoid charges in such schemes by doing what is required of them. There is no reason why people with less money should not want to do their bit for society and to recycle along with those of us who have more money. Poverty is not an issue. Indeed, poorer people tend to have fewer products and expenditures, and probably less waste, although I have not carried out an analysis of that. However, I suggest that they are likely to have less waste than those of us with greater purchasing power. On larger families, we have said that pilots&mdash;this is another reason for piloting&mdash;need to consider those who might find it more difficult to increase recycling and reduce residual waste. That could include larger families, and we expect that to be looked at.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/2">In recommendation 20, the Committee raised the question of linking waste incentive schemes to council tax, which is a point that I myself raised when I took over the portfolio. I am glad to report that we have listened to stakeholders, including the Select Committee and the Local Government Association, on this point and that pilots will be able to administer waste rebates and payments through the council tax system if the authority wishes. Much of what has been said on this subject today is found in the Committee's second report of <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-21">21 February</phrase>. The Government have yet to respond formally to that report, but will do so in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/3">However, I think I can tell hon. Members today that we totally reject the Committee's 14 conclusions, all of which fly in the face of earlier responses to the Government's own information gathering on this subject. We remain confident that local authorities will want to pilot such schemes and I remind hon. Members that in our consultation 80 per cent. of respondents supported bringing in these powers. I am afraid that we will not agree&mdash;we will have to differ&mdash;and there is little point in going further over this well-trodden ground. Waste incentive schemes are being proposed in order to increase waste minimisation and recycling. Current measures have raised recycling rates to more than 30 per cent. and reduced residual waste going to landfill. We are on course to meet our 2010 targets and although we are not complacent, we are heading in the right direction in order to meet the 2013 targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/4">Things get harder as progress is made and we believe that local authorities are likely to want such schemes as they move to meet challenging targets beyond 2013. However, we continue to listen and to refine our proposals. In the Lords we are currently proposing amendments to allow schemes to be based on frequency of service and on identifying tags applied to bins or bags. We are also proposing an amendment requiring the Government to report to Parliament on all pilots within three years of Royal Assent, which is expected in the summer. The reports will be transparent, taking account of the fact that the pilots were supported by DEFRA funding, and we will work with stakeholders to establish success criteria by common consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/5">The Committee expressed concern about timing&mdash;the fact that pilots will not begin until next spring. We make no apology for that either, because we want to ensure that they are well designed. However, we will not require that all pilots be technically completed and wound up before we report on them. If pilots prove to be successful, we can act with appropriate pace to make the powers available to all local authorities, which is what the Committee wants.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/6">Whatever the differences between the Committee and the Government, I hope that members of the Committee, perhaps with the exception of the hon. Member for Beckenham, who spoke for the Conservatives, will reject the irresponsible reporting of some national newspapers on incentive schemes. Scaremongering that so-called bin taxes could cost ordinary families up to &pound;1,000 a year is absolutely and utterly wrong. I hope that that was simply the product of an innumerate journalist but, of course, what was said has not been retracted.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/7">I shall address some of the points that Members made. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West made a number of points&mdash;she did not ask me any direct questions&mdash;and I shall comment on them. She asked about charging that is happening now and referred to the fact that the Government have written to the chief executive of every authority. She suggested that there was a grey area, but I must tell her that there is not. Charging for collection services is illegal, and that is what we have told local authorities. Under section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, authorities are allowed to charge for the provision of receptacles. It is on the interpretation of the provision of receptacles and the charging that she raises some questions for individual authorities&mdash;it is not for me to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/8">The hon. Lady referred to home composting services and said that she thought that they could be a disincentive. As she was speaking, I tried to work the issue out in my head and I concluded that a local authority does not have to collect home compost if it encourages home composting. If local authorities had a statutory recycling and composting rate imposed on them, they could argue that they needed the compost to reach a target. However, they will no longer have that target. If people compost at home, local authorities benefit because they have less to send to landfill. The hon. Lady said that it was a question of balance, and I agree, but it does not seem that there are contradictions.</p>

	<p pid="a.348.0/1">The interesting question that the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West addressed earlier was on garden as opposed to kitchen waste. Some of the latter can be composted, such as vegetable waste, but some cannot, such as meat waste. Clearly, if people composted kitchen waste, the weight of the municipal waste collection would fall. However, the issue is more about garden waste. We have all heard examples of areas in which green waste was not collected until targets were imposed and authorities had the incentive to put more lorries on the road to collect garden waste; it is a heavy and bulky item. We should draw a distinction between the two. When it comes to encouraging home composting, there is no recognition for people who compost garden waste, but perhaps there is for kitchen waste.</p>

	<p pid="a.348.1/1">I have some sympathy with that point. We need to look further at the issue of garden waste. I am a keen gardener&mdash;I have given up my lawns because they are too much&mdash;and many homes produce huge amounts of waste from lawns, shrubs and so on. We should look further at whether collection is the best environmental option, and whether there should be more emphasis on it. There has been a great deal of work and WRAP has been heavily involved in home composting arrangements. The hon. Gentleman said that it is not possible to compost meat waste, but I have a food digester in my garden in which I can put all my waste food every single day. I am glad to say that it disappears and that those awful bugs that we complain about can be productive.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.1/2">The hon. Lady made a number of points on commercial waste and recommendation 29. The Government have no evidence of deliberate evasion of responsibilities. DEFRA wrote to all local authorities, as I said, to remind them of their duties to collect commercial waste if they are asked to do so. Local authorities must also report all the waste that they collect, including commercial waste. We have not been able to find evidence of the things of which some local authorities in London are being accused, particularly by the Greater London Authority. However, the Environment Agency was asked to do some auditing as a result of recommendation 29 of the fifth report, which suggests that London local authorities need to be audited because of their current waste disposal programmes and the</p>
	<p pid="a.348.1/3" class="indent">&quot;higher-than-average proportion of non-household waste collected and disposed of in the capital&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.1/4">The agency states:</p>
	<p pid="a.348.1/5" class="indent">&quot;There is no evidence that London boroughs are deliberately evading their reporting responsibilities. There are however a number of lessons learnt from the audits that will improve the consistency and quality of future reports...We are in the process of publishing additional guidance to ensure that local authorities are in no doubt as to our views on what should be reported as collected municipal waste. From 2007/8 onwards we will use this guidance in the audit process...We intend to audit all remaining authorities over the next two years, which will include the remaining London authorities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.1/6">On that basis, we can see that it has not been possible to substantiate whatever suspicions there are on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.1/7">The hon. Member for North Cornwall asked questions about DEFRA grants to WRAP and NISP, which was the subject of a previous debate in which I was involved. I was unable to comment then because we did not have the final settlements, but we now have them. Perhaps it would be helpful if I quoted what WRAP has said about its final settlement. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.348.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The final budget of &pound;43.2 million remains a substantial sum with which we will deliver our important and stretching work programme geared to help lessen the impact of climate change, maximise resource efficiency and help deliver Defra's Waste Strategy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.1/9">I value the work of WRAP and NISP, which has undertaken some extraordinary innovation. NISP's budget will be somewhat more than &pound;5 million&mdash;it would have liked more, but I am confident that it will be able to continue its important work with that amount.</p>

	<p pid="a.349.0/1">Has the Minister heard what Steve Creed of WRAP said when he announced the end of the funding support programme? He said:</p>

	<p pid="a.349.1/1">We are conscious of the important work that has been done by a variety of delivery bodies, including WRAP, with small businesses over the years, but we are re-orienting that spending. We will ensure that support is given in different ways across Government, and it is important to small businesses, particularly because of their size, that they do not have to approach or be approached by a lot of different agencies and Departments. We should be channelling a much more holistic service for small business.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.1/2">The changes are a rationalisation and what has been said is absolutely accurate. In other circumstances, there might have been a longer period over which support was redirected, but we have taken the steps now because we are in a tight budgetary situation. It makes sense. We do not expect small businesses to be in difficulty as a consequence, and I think neither does WRAP.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.1/3">The hon. Lady asked about anaerobic digestion, incinerators and a whole raft of disposal technologies. In particular, she asked why it is that they are all on the continent and not here. The fact is that we have had, for far too long, too many holes in the ground and landfill has been too cheap. Countries such as the Netherlands, which have not had the potential to put their waste in holes in the ground, have had to develop alternative solutions at great speed. That is why the technologies are so much more advanced in other countries than they are here. We have now made our decisions. We have been following the landfill directive, and we know where we are going. We will constantly reduce the amount of material going to landfill. That means that these other technologies become cost-effective and of interest to big business, which means that they will be coming on stream. In order to incentivise and assist with that process and ensure that there is appropriate and sufficient waste infrastructure in place, the Government have provided, as the comprehensive spending review settlement indicated, PFI credits worth &pound;2 billion to facilitate the provision of such infrastructure over the next three years. That is an unprecedented amount of money. We believe that many technologies will be put in place as a consequence of that support. It has to be said that private industry itself is already on this path.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.1/4">In DEFRA, we have contributed to the development of anaerobic digestion and we have made it very clear that we think that it is one of the preferred technologies. It has great potential for not just taking a variety of biodegradable waste, but also ending up with a digestate that can be used in agriculture or, alternatively, with bio-gas.</p>

	<p pid="a.350.0/1">The Minister referred to anaerobic digestion on the continent. I am sure that it exists on the continent, but has the Department made a study of how prevalent it is and how much waste is moved via that method?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.350.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" colnum="350"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0005.htm#08022875000275">
	<p pid="a.350.1/1">If the Department has made a study of it, I have not got the information. I will write to the hon. Gentleman. I was not thinking so much about anaerobic digestion, but more about conventional incineration and, of course, combined heat and power, which is a very positive technology that we see a great deal of on the continent.</p>
	<p pid="a.350.1/2">Let me look at the other questions that I want to respond to. The hon. Member for Beckenham referred to a freedom of information request that had been successful on a consultation that I understood her to say was on alternate weekly collections. We have not done a consultation on AWC that has been subject to an FOI, so I am not sure how she was able to substantiate her claim that there has been a huge increase in fly-tipping. The AWC collections were around long before there was a documented increase in fly- tipping, which I acknowledge that there has been. Our view in relation to fly-tipping, like all crimes for which there is a requirement to report&mdash;Flycapture, which collects the data, is very new&mdash;is that we will see an increase. We have also seen much more activity by local government in tackling fly-tipping and in taking forward prosecutions.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.351.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1395" speakername="Jacqui Lait" colnum="351"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0005.htm#08022875000276">
	<p pid="a.351.0/1">The FOI request to her Department was for the responses to the consultation on bin taxes. The responses included one from the Environment Agency, which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.351.0/2" class="indent">&quot;We are concerned that the proposals may give rise to an increase in fly-tipping of household waste.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.351.0/3">Hertfordshire Waste Partnership said:</p>
	<p pid="a.351.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Municipal waste does not recognise boundaries...there will be a knock-on effect across neighbouring areas when residents seek to find free or cheaper means of disposal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.351.0/5">I can go on. There are very many references to fly-tipping. The statistics show, separately, that there has been a very large increase in fly-tipping, but that is not necessarily shown in the response to the hon. Lady's consultation.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.351.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" colnum="351"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0005.htm#08022875000277">
	<p pid="a.351.1/1">We need to be very clear about this. First, there has not been a consultation on AWC, which has been subject to an FOI. Secondly, there has been a consultation&mdash;obviously&mdash;on incentive schemes. It is correct to say that on that consultation, concerns were raised. The Government never failed to acknowledge that. What we have said is that it would be essential in any scheme&mdash;again this is why pilots are important&mdash;to have a good fly-tipping strategy in place. That is common sense and a good recycling service would have to be in place, otherwise such a scheme would make no sense. As to fly-tipping, we acknowledge that the data show an increase. However, one also has to look at one's own experience. In my borough, in which there is a very good strategy for tackling fly-tipping, fly-tipped waste is collected very fast. We are seeing much better outcomes than some years ago. At that time, when there was much more visible fly-tipping on my streets, no data were being collected at all. It is the collection of data on crimes that makes it appear that incidents of fly-tipping have gone up.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.351.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="351"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0005.htm#08022875000278">
	<p pid="a.351.2/1">Does the Minister also accept that a significant amount of fly-tipping is done by small business enterprises, notably builders, which are attempting to evade the landfill tax and are dumping builders' rubble or hedges or whatever around the place? The statistics quoted would be for fly-tipping overall, most of which, I suggest, is likely to be from the commercial rather than the domestic sector and, therefore, entirely unrelated to any proposals on domestic refuse collection.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.351.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" colnum="351"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0005.htm#08022875000279">
	<p pid="a.351.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. It is a combination of things. Around half of fly-tips contain material from households, and that material is often collected by people such as she describes. What we would say is that the householder has a duty to be sure that those who pick up their waste intend to dispose of it appropriately and not fly-tip it. We all have a duty to be careful about who we give our waste to. If we are being offered something that clearly looks very different from the regular collection services, for which in the case of bulky items one may today have to pay the council, we ought to be aware that it is probably going to be fly-tipped. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The relationship between the potential for fly-tipping and waste incentive schemes is in no way proven.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.3/2">The other thing that I have just been notified of by my officials is that apparently&mdash;I should know this&mdash;all of the responses to the consultation on the waste incentive schemes were published on our website and so they did not require an FOI request. Therefore, this will remain a bit of a mystery.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.3/3">I have some more questions to which I want to respond. I think that I have dealt with all of them, but I have been provided with some additional information about anaerobic digestion. For the benefit of hon. Members, I will just say that there are already three AD plants in England that are treating source-separated waste at the present time. Six are being built and the electricity generated by AD&mdash;this is a very important point&mdash;is eligible for renewables obligation support. That is a particularly important new development, and banding is one of the ways in which the Government are incentivising the whole concept of the development of anaerobic digestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.3/4">I hope that I have managed to tackle most of the points that have been raised today. Apart from the one point on which I have undertaken to write, I will be delighted to write to hon. Members if there is anything else that we spot from the debate record.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.3/5">In her opening remarks today, my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, the Chairman of the Committee, referred to our waste strategy 2007. She referred to its hierarchy, which we all now know so well, and to how we should reduce, reuse, recycle and recover before we think of ever disposing entirely of the waste and losing those very precious resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.3/6">My hon. Friend also spoke about the various levers that the Government have already put in place. Of course, these are much wider issues that are outside the ambit of our debate today. However, I would just like to assure hon. Members that the Government take waste and our waste strategy very seriously indeed and waste is a real priority for DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.3/7">We face a great challenge; it is a historic one. Earlier, I referred to our use of landfill and the fact that it was so cheap to dispose of waste in that way. We all have a responsibility to meet that challenge, both in our personal lives, in the way we dispose of our own waste, and in the way we support our local authorities. At the end of the day, local authorities are the vehicle through which most of us will see our waste disposed and we owe it to them to have a sensible debate, to understand what the issues are, what the incentives might be and what the penalties might be, if we as citizens do not behave in an appropriate way, given the need to meet this challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.3/8">I look forward to continuing our dialogue on all of these subjects, as I am sure we will, in further debates and in further discussions with the Select Committee. Again, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West for her presentation today and I thank other hon. Members for their involvement in these debates. I will just end by saying that I am sure that, whatever differences we might have in our thinking on the appropriate strategies, we all remain committed to proper, environmentally responsible collection and disposal of waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.3/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.3/10" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at nine minutes to Five o'clock.</p>
