<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.326.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="326"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0001.htm#08022875000235">
	<p pid="a.326.1/1">I agree. I was amused that, after our report was published, even though it did not back up what the tabloids had been saying, they nevertheless managed to say that it entirely vindicated them and the campaign that they had been running. Of course, it does not do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/2">The Committee's view on the subsequent report on the Government's waste reduction pilots is that they have pulled back on the original proposal to allow all councils to introduce charging if they wish and have instead focused only on five pilots precisely because of the vitriol in the tabloid press, which has made it difficult to have a sensitive debate about charges for residual waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/3">It became clear to us that the collection method had to vary depending on the nature of the area served. Most obviously, it is difficult for a council in a dense urban area with lots of flats and houses in multiple occupation to have an alternate weekly system, which relies on individual households having a significant amount of space to store the recyclables, or whatever, for the fortnight before the collection. Alternate weekly collections have rarely been introduced in dense urban areas because they do not work well, whereas they seem to work well in more suburban or rural areas, where space per household is not at quite the same premium and people have a reasonable amount of outside area where they can stash stuff until it is collected. Instead, many councils in urban areas have collective recycling facilities dotted about closer to people's homes, so people living in a flat can get rid of a lot of their rubbish themselves by taking it to the nearest recycling bin on the corner of the street. Clearly, it is horses for courses, which is why it is best to leave such decisions to councils, because they know their area better than anybody else possibly can.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/4">Food waste, along with disposable nappies, is the problematic bit of residual waste. Food waste is problematic because it is smelly and attracts vermin and other problems and because when it gets into landfill it, above all, generates methane gas, which causes enormous problems in managing landfill sites. We recommended that food waste should be collected weekly. I am glad that the Government accepted that that recommendation was the right way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/5">The Committee also considered the evidence on health risks from alternate weekly systems. There is no credible evidence that there are health risks, although the public prejudice is that there are. We had a terribly interesting discussion about the life cycle of maggots, which demonstrated that even a weekly collection is too slow for the average maggot. We probably do not wish to go into that subject any further. However, that shows that even a weekly collection may not come often enough to deal with that problem. In addition, individual householders need to take some responsibility for wrapping their waste so that it is not so easily accessible to flies, foxes or magpies, which seem immediately to distinguish which colour bag has all the goodies in it and leave the recycling bags well alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/6">I want to mention financing refuse collection and unofficial charging, which some councils seem to be pursuing at the moment, then I shall deal with a number of other points. Financing refuse collection is the issue that is concentrating everybody's minds. As I pointed out at the beginning, costs are inevitably rising due to the pressure on landfill. Sir Michael Lyons, in his report on local government finance, recommended that councils should be able to charge for waste collection and disposal and that that should be done separately from council tax, so that householders could see what they were paying for. Of the original 15 members of the European Union, the United Kingdom is the only one that does not allow local authorities to charge for refuse collection.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/7">The Government initially decided to introduce a limited power for local authorities to charge for waste collection, but hedged that in a number of ways. First, the incentives to households that reduced the amount of waste for landfill had to be balanced exactly by the fines on other households. The scheme had to be self-financing, so that there would be a redistribution of money from households that were not reducing waste to those that were. Secondly, the administration costs of the scheme could not be included in that self-financing envelope, and would have to be borne by the council. As I understand it, it was argued that that was acceptable because the point of introducing incentives and fines was to encourage households overall to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill, so the overall cost to the council of disposing of waste would be reduced, and that reduction could then be offset against the cost of administering the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/8">The Government were so concerned about the bin charges argument that the then Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" name="Phil Woolas">the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas)</phrase>&mdash;the predecessor to the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" name="Joan Ruddock">the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase>&mdash;indicated in Committee that the maximum incentive, and therefore the maximum charge, could be of the order of only &pound;30 or &pound;50 a year. The Committee felt strongly that such a sum was so small that it was unlikely to encourage householders to recycle more and to reduce waste, or to be a sufficient penalty on those who were not bothering, particularly as that sum in the context of their overall council tax was not very large.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/9">We felt that local authorities should be left to decide, that every local authority should be given the freedom to charge if they wished, that it could be done through the council tax if councils wished to do so, and that it should be for councils to decide how big or small the incentive or charge should be. We are obviously disappointed that the Government have subsequently decided not to give the power to all councils, but to go ahead with only five pilots. We are particularly concerned about the timing, because the pilot schemes would not come in until 2009 at the earliest, yet the thresholds that councils must meet for the landfill allowances trading scheme will come in in 2010. We think that the pilot schemes are just causing delays, because they will last three years, and then be reviewed and brought back to Parliament, when Parliament may decide to give the power to all councils. That will be well past 2010. If charging works, many councils will copy the few that act as trailblazers, and if it does not work, most will think, &quot;Thank goodness we decided not to do that and left the council next door to try it out.&quot; That is how it should be taken forward.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.328.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="328"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0002.htm#08022875000237">
	<p pid="a.328.1/1">No, we did not. We looked at the way in which decisions by the waste disposal authorities reduce the options available to waste collection authorities, and I shall give one example. There is a great debate about whether the amount of recyclables that people put out are maximised by making it simple and asking them to put out all their recyclables in one bag, which the council subsequently sorts, or whether householders should be required to do some of the pre-sorting. Making it simple so that the amount of recycling is maximised means that the recyclable products are more mixed up, so the quality of the end product, which is then recycled or sold to someone who recycles it, is poorer.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/2">Those options are closed down, depending on the infrastructure in which the waste disposal authority has invested for dealing with recyclables. Some waste collection authorities have fewer choices available to them than others because of waste collection costs. The Committee thought that there should be a lot more co-operation between councils to obtain economies of scale, and we endorsed the proposal to allow joint waste authorities because there is a lot of merit in that, although, again, it should be left to local authorities to decide whether they wish to do that. We are pleased that that option is available for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/3">I want to touch on unofficial charging. At the moment, waste collection authorities are not legally allowed to charge for refuse collection, which is why the Government are proposing the pilot schemes, although they can charge for collection of bulky items. They can refuse to collect waste that has been left outside the containers provided, or to introduce an additional charge. In fact, some local authorities have tried to limit the amount of refuse that householders can throw away by restricting the amount that can be put out each week, or by introducing charges for additional waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/4">I believe that Broxbourne in Hertfordshire is piloting a scheme under which it issues households with one purple refuse sack a week, and then charges, but only 28p, for each additional sack if required by the householder. North Dorset, more realistically, charges &pound;1 for additional sacks. The Committee thought that that was a good idea, but was slightly doubtful about whether it was legal. DEFRA apparently wrote in the autumn to all local authorities reminding them of the current legal position, but it is obviously still a grey area if Broxbourne feels safe about going ahead and charging for a service that it could be argued it should provide out of the council tax. That is an interesting way in which councils are, effectively, already using charges as a mechanism to try to encourage householders to produce less waste. The Broxbourne scheme is reducing waste by charging on volume, and there is the alternative of doing that by weight. The simplest way is through wheelie bins with a chip in them, which weighs the waste when it is tipped into the refuse lorry. Many councils have already introduced that so that they know how much waste is in the van and how much they are taking to landfill. The technology is not new; it would be used for a different purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/5">I want to draw attention to a couple of other points that came up during our inquiry and which relate to what might be deemed to be slightly perverse incentives that have arisen from the systems that have been put in place to encourage more recycling, particularly more diversion from landfill of biodegradable waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/6">First, it was pointed out to us that councils that encourage households to compost garden and kitchen waste on their own properties are removing green waste from the waste stream that the council picks up to be recycled or put into landfill. That means that the council's ability to reduce the amount of biodegradable waste going to landfill has been reduced, because the waste is out of the system. That creates a perverse situation, in which councils that have encouraged home compositing make it more difficult for themselves to reduce the proportion of biodegradable waste that they divert from landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/7">A side argument was made by some urban authorities. They said that where people have big gardens it was easy for authorities to reduce the proportion of biodegradable waste that goes to landfill because most of the biodegradable stuff is garden waste. Such waste is easy to handle, because it can be collected in a separate bin and taken away, which leads to a big reduction in the biodegradable waste that goes to landfill. In urban areas, however, nobody has big gardens, so they do not produce garden waste; all the biodegradable waste is food waste, which is much more difficult to divert. I merely repeat the arguments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.335.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" speakername="Daniel Rogerson" colnum="335"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0003.htm#08022875000243">
	<p pid="a.335.1/1">I am aware of all the problems that the various agencies that work with DEFRA and rely on it for their funding have experienced. I know that you will not want us to step outside the bounds of the debate, Mr. Amess, but we could talk about the Rural Payments Agency and various other things that have affected DEFRA's budget. As the hon. Lady focused on WRAP, I will mention the work that NISP&mdash;the national industrial symbiosis programme&mdash;is doing with larger bodies, too. It would be a great shame if that work, which has been undertaken, is not allowed to be pushed forward to effective conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/2">The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West raised issues relating to integration of the strategies of disposal authorities and collection authorities. That is a crucial question. I have had the opportunity to visit some disposal facilities, so I have seen where recycling is sorted, in fairly unpleasant circumstances. Companies such as WRG and others are excellent employers and do a great deal to look after the work force who carry out the sorting, but inevitably it is not the most glamorous of jobs. Other authorities have concentrated on encouraging the sorting of materials at source&mdash;in other words, by the householder&mdash;which leads to an easier process further down the chain, so the hon. Lady was right to focus on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Southport, a member of the Communities and Local Government Committee, spoke strongly about his belief that alternate weekly collections have a significant role to play in meeting our targets as a nation and in terms of improving recycling rates. He made a very powerful argument for that. Although he is a philosopher, he did not delve too deeply into causality, but he made it clear that he believes that there may be a stronger link between the two than the final report or debate on it in the media may have indicated.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/4">I shall deal with some of the recommendations. There are a great number of them and although time is available to us, I sense from other Members that they may wish me not to explore every recommendation in detail, so I shall pick out just a few. The first issue is local authority targets and whether, under the new regime for local authorities, waste should automatically be one of those targets. My party welcomes the approach that the Government have taken on simplifying targets, although it remains to be seen how it will work in practice. The targets ought to be agreed as part of a bottom-up process. There are difficulties with insisting that, in all circumstances, waste ought to be one of those, although in most cases, as waste is moving up the agenda, waste issues are likely to be key targets for local authorities through their own priority setting, rather than having to be imposed from above. I think that was the Government response: they were cautious about imposing a target on all local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/5">Recommendation 3, which relates to the clear and straightforward guidelines that should be provided to householders to encourage their participation and co-operation in recycling, is very important. The Government response is that through work with WRAP they are encouraging good practice on collection systems, including advice on engagement with residents. That is important, but it does not go quite far enough in terms of providing that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/6">The report talks about our historical problems. Now that many flowers bloom across the country in terms of systems, it is difficult to turn the clock back and simplify things, but I hope that the possibility exists of building on WRAP's work, as the report suggests, in relation to colour coding and so on to make the system easier for people to understand. The Government response to that recommendation may not go quite far enough to meet what the Committee said about guidelines and providing clearer information to householders.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/7">The knotty problem of food waste is, in many cases, one of perception. As part of the IPT fellowship, I had occasion to visit Bracknell council and talk to the council leader&mdash;who speaks for the Local Government Association on some of these issues&mdash;about Bracknell's experiences with AWC. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southport said, if there is effective communication with local residents and people are made aware of the benefits, that will address some of the perception problems, which I think have informed some of the rumours about what might happen&mdash;the horror stories about vermin and maggot infestations and so on. People occasionally see the worst in a system if they are told that that is the likely outcome. Councils that have invested significantly in winning people over to a system before its introduction seem to have had far better results in terms of people's acceptance. That is an important lesson to be learned, whatever changes occur with waste collection. Waste is one of those services where, as long as it is working well, no one wants to talk about it or consider it. On the other hand, if there is a problem it moves quickly up the agenda. That is part of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/8">The report makes several recommendations about the need to allow local authorities flexibility to develop their own schemes. I have already referred to the need for principles that people can get used to, so that when they move from one area to another&mdash;people change jobs far more often, they move around the country more and are more mobile&mdash;they can expect to find some basic ideas in operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/9">My local authority of Restormel is in a rural part of north Cornwall; our circumstances are very different from those in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase>. We should not expect the circumstances of collection to be the same. That is an important principle, and I am glad that the report focused on it in some detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/10">The issue of minimum standards is interesting. The idea that core definitions of what householders should expect from their refuse collections is to be found in recommendation 15. Encouraging people to think more about what they receive from the waste service and what contribution they can make to develop the service and make recycling more useful and effective would be most beneficial. The recommendation on incentives is a crucial part of that engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/11">I turn to the question of varying charges. Unlike alternate weekly collection and promotion schemes, in which people are encouraged to look creatively at what they can do to increase recycling, the moment one starts to raise issues of finance a negative connotation is unfortunately put on it. People think that they may be worse off rather than thinking that they might be better off if they were to adapt to such a system. We should recognise that people may be able to take advantage of the system in different ways, so we must ensure that taxation does not become more aggressive. The report also deals with the small amounts involved and whether they will be significant enough to effect change. That is an important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/12">Treating waste as a utility is a fascinating idea. In my part of the south-west, water charges are a huge issue, but the fact that they are separate from other household charges focuses people's attention on them and has pushed people into using water meters, because they think such things are efficient. Considering waste as a utility is a tempting prospect; it could encourage people to consider how to be more efficient and thus become part of the solution, and educate them on how little we spend on waste. We have heard about the recycling rates in other countries, but in many countries people pay far more for waste collection and waste disposal than we do. We have been somewhat spoilt by the availability of landfill and the low costs that councils have managed to achieve. Although we congratulate them on the efficiencies they have been able to achieve, people have been somewhat spoiled in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/13">I would prefer councils to make more of an effort to say how little of the council tax is spent on waste. As I said earlier, it is a visible service when things go wrong, and people tend to see it as a core service and assume that a vast amount of their council tax goes towards providing it, but we know that is not the case. In fact, when I was a member of Bedford borough council, the chief executive often said that whenever he spoke to local organisations and groups that were concerned about costs, he used to lay out just how much of their council tax went on some of the key services, and they were stunned to find that they were getting such good value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/14">The idea of considering waste as a utility an interesting one, but I would be cautious about fettering councils in that way. It could take away another function from local authorities, rather as education funding is now entirely discrete. It might undermine the flexibility of local authorities in that respect and I hope that the information could be provided to local residents without necessarily saying that waste collection had to be treated as a discrete system.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/15">Finally, I return to the question of recycling for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly for new businesses and for people who have not been involved in business before, whose only experience of waste has been dealing with domestic waste. They are often surprised at the lack of accessible services for commercial recycling. There are huge gains to be made; for instance, in my constituency glass bottles could be far more effectively reused or recycled.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/16">There is more work to be done. The Communities and Local Government Committee may return to the question in future, although I know that it is considering a great many other inquiries, as the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West said, or another Select Committee may consider the matter. As well as giving answers, the report raised some interesting questions, and I certainly welcome it.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/17">I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in expanding on the issues raised in the Government response in October, although on some issues they seemed not quite to have got the point that the Committee was making and they could go a little further in providing a way forward.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.339.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1395" speakername="Jacqui Lait" colnum="339"  time="015:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0003.htm#08022875000248">
	<p pid="a.339.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her intervention. At some point, I was going to congratulate the Government&mdash;which, as she knows, is rare&mdash;on responding to the pressure for proper cooking to be taught in schools, because that is how we will fundamentally reduce the amount of food waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/2">There was a time when people had roast on Sunday, cold on Monday, shepherd's pie on Tuesday, sandwiches on Wednesday, soup on Thursday and fish on Friday. Where is the waste in that? We should all start to apply that mental regime, as it is common-sense management of the family larder&mdash;I will sound like Mrs. Thatcher soon. There does not have to be food waste, although I am grateful to have food waste for my garden because I compost it. That is enough home-grown philosophy.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/3">If we can move our society much more in that general direction, we will be able to deal with an awful lot of issues concerning waste in general and food waste in particular without having to put in place enormously expensive recycling and disposal systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/4">I am feeling slightly schizophrenic. Long before I became a Member of Parliament, my constituency had a weekly recycling collection. All waste is collected once a week and is divided into non-recyclables, bottles, plastic and cans, and paper. That has been happening in the borough of Bromley for more than 10 years, and it has worked very effectively. As a London borough, Bromley has long been at the forefront of recycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/5">I also live in Rye, as my husband is leader of East Sussex county council, which has just introduced alternate weekly collection. If there is one problem that I have on a Sunday night, it is remembering what is being collected that week. I am sure that I am not alone in that. I am conscious that, because this is a new system, it has taken a long time for people to adjust, although I give credit to the local council for providing first-class publicity and information. People knew what was happening, what they had to do and how they were going to do it, and the boxes were broadly delivered in good time.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/6">The fact that the new vans were the wrong size and could not get down the lanes in rural areas was a management problem for the company that took the job on, and it had nothing to do with the publicity programme of the local council, which I thought was first class, even though I looked at it with a critical eye.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/7">However, the information that we extracted from DEFRA, under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, on the responses to its consultation shows that many issues have emerged in relation to the knock-on effects of the complexity of AWC. Whether people have a fortnightly or a weekly collection, evidence is emerging that there is a big increase in fly-tipping. We are very lucky that last summer was cool. We cannot use last summer as an indication that there is unlikely to be greater infestation by animals. In cooler weather, the attraction of food smells is less than in a hot summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/8">Some years ago, during a hot summer, I remember carefully wrapping up some prawn shells, which even I cannot recycle or cook with. When I got home a week later, the shells were a mass of maggots. I knew what I had to do; I did it and it did not work. We have not had a hot summer. I hope that we have a hot summer, but people who live in the country will be hoping and praying that we do not. In terms of infestation, it is unproven that a weekly food collection will not cause health problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/9">The other factor that irritates so much is the sheer volume of food that goes into plastic containers, which has been mentioned. Few of those containers are recyclable. I am sure that every Member in this Chamber looks for the number on the bottom of such containers. If they can spot it, often it is not 1, 2 or 3. That is grating for everybody. We must do more work with the supermarkets, which are the prime users of plastic containers, and the packaging industry to ensure that we have many more recyclable containers.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/10">What concerns me more than anything is ensuring that council tax payers do not have to be charged further for the collection of waste. I heard this morning that, on average, band D council tax will be about &pound;1,400, which is an enormous increase in what local people have to pay. We are already on the cusp of a council tax payers' revolt and people do not want to have to pay even more for their waste collection, which many people regard as about the only service that they get from their local council. We should ignore that fact that people have access to social services, because many people do not use them. If people do not have children, they feel that they are not using the education service. In many cases, the only thing that people think that they pay council tax for is waste collection.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.3/11">I sympathise with the views expressed in the <i>Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>: if people feel that they will have to pay more tax because of waste collection, there will be a revolt. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i>Daily Mail </i>do not run articles that do not chime with their readership. If they believe that their readership is not interested in the issue of extra taxation, they will not run articles about it. Yes, that is a circular, chicken-and-egg argument, but we cannot blame those two newspapers for highlighting the bin taxes. They would not do so if they did not believe that their readers were very likely to revolt against any form of bin taxation.</p>

Does she agree that the Government have a role in encouraging pilots with companies to develop such technologies? Once the first is up and running and shown to be effective, others may follow.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-28a.344.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" colnum="344"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080228/halltext/80228h0004.htm#08022875000263">
	<p pid="a.344.1/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows full well that the initial increase in landfill tax of &pound;3 was hypothecated and has provided considerable sums to support a range of waste minimisation and other waste strategies. That programme was designed, through the business resource efficiency and waste programme, to last three years, and it has done enormously good work. Although there is to be a substantial increase in the tax, the money from it will not be dealt with in the same way. It is important to remember that the increase will be the major driver of diverting waste from landfill. We have talked a lot about household waste, but commercial and industrial waste represents the majority of waste, as hon. Members have said.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/2">Lurid reports of vermin infestations as a result of alternating collections continue to be reported in the media. We cannot find evidence of such infestations, and the National Pest Technicians Association has just reported that there has been a significant decrease in rodent numbers. Its belief is that the use of rodent-proof wheeled bins is the probable cause of that. That bears out what WRAP, the Committee and the Government have said: that there must be appropriate receptacles if food waste is to be collected and waste left for longer than we have been used to. That is an important lesson, and the Government continue to say that good management is the key. Clear information and education for householders, and particularly the provision of sealable containers for food and kitchen waste, must be at the heart of a successful programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/3">In that context, I am delighted to report that 19 councils are participating in the DEFRA-funded weekly food collection trials that are being carried out by WRAP. Early results of the trials have shown that separate collection of food waste is popular, with 60 to 80 per cent. participation and about 3 kg of food waste collected per household per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/4">I turn to the most contentious issue in the first report and the subject of the second: the Government's proposals to remove the general prohibition on charging for waste. As my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, noted, the UK is the only country in the EU15 that has that rule. In recommendation 24, the Committee asserts that:</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Breaking the link with council tax and establishing refuse collection as a utility, like gas or sewerage, might have the radical impact the Government say they want.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/6">My hon. Friend and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase> mentioned that point. If our plans are judged against such a radical departure from current practice, of course they will not find favour&mdash;that is absolutely clear. But there is no evidence, including from the Committee, to suggest that such a dramatic change is supported in local government, or even less by the public. I make no apology for restating the Government's intention to go ahead with piloting waste incentive schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/7">Let me be clear about taxation, on which hon. Members had a little sport at my expense in the report, although not in the debate. There could be reward-only schemes&mdash;those based only on rewards, not on charges. Deciding on such things is the point of having pilots. Where charges are applied, they will not behave in the same way as traditional tax. When I gave evidence to the Select Committee, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-17">17 December</phrase> last year, I had not been advised that the charges could be deemed to be a tax. The Treasury has now clarified that they will, and that information was conveyed to the Committee by the Department for Communities and Local Government in a letter on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/8">Unlike other taxes, no revenue will accrue to the Treasury or the local authority, because the schemes will be revenue neutral. Money collected from those who fail to recycle will be paid back to all those who do. We have found in our consultations that people believe that that is intrinsically fair. It is accepted that if people do what society requires of them, they will get that service free through their council, but that if they do not comply, it is reasonable to be charged.</p>

	<p pid="a.346.4/1">Poverty is no reason why people cannot recycle. People can avoid charges in such schemes by doing what is required of them. There is no reason why people with less money should not want to do their bit for society and to recycle along with those of us who have more money. Poverty is not an issue. Indeed, poorer people tend to have fewer products and expenditures, and probably less waste, although I have not carried out an analysis of that. However, I suggest that they are likely to have less waste than those of us with greater purchasing power. On larger families, we have said that pilots&mdash;this is another reason for piloting&mdash;need to consider those who might find it more difficult to increase recycling and reduce residual waste. That could include larger families, and we expect that to be looked at.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/2">In recommendation 20, the Committee raised the question of linking waste incentive schemes to council tax, which is a point that I myself raised when I took over the portfolio. I am glad to report that we have listened to stakeholders, including the Select Committee and the Local Government Association, on this point and that pilots will be able to administer waste rebates and payments through the council tax system if the authority wishes. Much of what has been said on this subject today is found in the Committee's second report of <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-21">21 February</phrase>. The Government have yet to respond formally to that report, but will do so in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/3">However, I think I can tell hon. Members today that we totally reject the Committee's 14 conclusions, all of which fly in the face of earlier responses to the Government's own information gathering on this subject. We remain confident that local authorities will want to pilot such schemes and I remind hon. Members that in our consultation 80 per cent. of respondents supported bringing in these powers. I am afraid that we will not agree&mdash;we will have to differ&mdash;and there is little point in going further over this well-trodden ground. Waste incentive schemes are being proposed in order to increase waste minimisation and recycling. Current measures have raised recycling rates to more than 30 per cent. and reduced residual waste going to landfill. We are on course to meet our 2010 targets and although we are not complacent, we are heading in the right direction in order to meet the 2013 targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/4">Things get harder as progress is made and we believe that local authorities are likely to want such schemes as they move to meet challenging targets beyond 2013. However, we continue to listen and to refine our proposals. In the Lords we are currently proposing amendments to allow schemes to be based on frequency of service and on identifying tags applied to bins or bags. We are also proposing an amendment requiring the Government to report to Parliament on all pilots within three years of Royal Assent, which is expected in the summer. The reports will be transparent, taking account of the fact that the pilots were supported by DEFRA funding, and we will work with stakeholders to establish success criteria by common consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/5">The Committee expressed concern about timing&mdash;the fact that pilots will not begin until next spring. We make no apology for that either, because we want to ensure that they are well designed. However, we will not require that all pilots be technically completed and wound up before we report on them. If pilots prove to be successful, we can act with appropriate pace to make the powers available to all local authorities, which is what the Committee wants.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/6">Whatever the differences between the Committee and the Government, I hope that members of the Committee, perhaps with the exception of the hon. Member for Beckenham, who spoke for the Conservatives, will reject the irresponsible reporting of some national newspapers on incentive schemes. Scaremongering that so-called bin taxes could cost ordinary families up to &pound;1,000 a year is absolutely and utterly wrong. I hope that that was simply the product of an innumerate journalist but, of course, what was said has not been retracted.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/7">I shall address some of the points that Members made. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West made a number of points&mdash;she did not ask me any direct questions&mdash;and I shall comment on them. She asked about charging that is happening now and referred to the fact that the Government have written to the chief executive of every authority. She suggested that there was a grey area, but I must tell her that there is not. Charging for collection services is illegal, and that is what we have told local authorities. Under section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, authorities are allowed to charge for the provision of receptacles. It is on the interpretation of the provision of receptacles and the charging that she raises some questions for individual authorities&mdash;it is not for me to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.4/8">The hon. Lady referred to home composting services and said that she thought that they could be a disincentive. As she was speaking, I tried to work the issue out in my head and I concluded that a local authority does not have to collect home compost if it encourages home composting. If local authorities had a statutory recycling and composting rate imposed on them, they could argue that they needed the compost to reach a target. However, they will no longer have that target. If people compost at home, local authorities benefit because they have less to send to landfill. The hon. Lady said that it was a question of balance, and I agree, but it does not seem that there are contradictions.</p>

	<p pid="a.349.1/1">We are conscious of the important work that has been done by a variety of delivery bodies, including WRAP, with small businesses over the years, but we are re-orienting that spending. We will ensure that support is given in different ways across Government, and it is important to small businesses, particularly because of their size, that they do not have to approach or be approached by a lot of different agencies and Departments. We should be channelling a much more holistic service for small business.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.1/2">The changes are a rationalisation and what has been said is absolutely accurate. In other circumstances, there might have been a longer period over which support was redirected, but we have taken the steps now because we are in a tight budgetary situation. It makes sense. We do not expect small businesses to be in difficulty as a consequence, and I think neither does WRAP.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.1/3">The hon. Lady asked about anaerobic digestion, incinerators and a whole raft of disposal technologies. In particular, she asked why it is that they are all on the continent and not here. The fact is that we have had, for far too long, too many holes in the ground and landfill has been too cheap. Countries such as the Netherlands, which have not had the potential to put their waste in holes in the ground, have had to develop alternative solutions at great speed. That is why the technologies are so much more advanced in other countries than they are here. We have now made our decisions. We have been following the landfill directive, and we know where we are going. We will constantly reduce the amount of material going to landfill. That means that these other technologies become cost-effective and of interest to big business, which means that they will be coming on stream. In order to incentivise and assist with that process and ensure that there is appropriate and sufficient waste infrastructure in place, the Government have provided, as the comprehensive spending review settlement indicated, PFI credits worth &pound;2 billion to facilitate the provision of such infrastructure over the next three years. That is an unprecedented amount of money. We believe that many technologies will be put in place as a consequence of that support.
