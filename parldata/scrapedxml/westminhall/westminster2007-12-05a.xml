<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-05a.257.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" speakername="Mark Pritchard" colnum="257"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071205/halltext/71205h0001.htm#07120550000459">
	<p pid="a.257.0/1">My right hon. Friend, as always, makes an excellent point, on which I will touch later. Sometimes the problem arises from a misrepresentation of the Christian faith, or a misunderstanding of what other faith communities perceive Christmas to be. As far as I can see, there is no offence in the minds of people of other faiths and of no faith, unless they are perhaps zealots, humanists and secularists in relation to this country celebrating and commemorating Christian traditions such as Christmas and Easter. What is offensive to people of other faiths is when secularists, society's liberals and the politically correct brigade use the names of other faith groups as a bogus cover from which to launch attacks on Britain's Christian traditions and festivals. Not only are those assaults divisive, but they undermine this country's hard fought for freedoms&mdash;important freedoms, such as freedom of speech and freedom of religion. The Government should not allow themselves or their agencies to be intimidated in such a way.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/2">Let me give the Minister more examples from both the private sector and the public sector. In the retail sector, many shoppers find it increasingly difficult to purchase greetings cards that refer to Jesus. My constituent, Mrs. Patricia Smyth of Wellington, Shropshire, has e-mailed me in the last few days to say that, while shopping for her grandchildren, she found that</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/3" class="indent">&quot;there are plenty of Santas and snowmen but nothing to do with the real meaning of Christmas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/4">I like Santas and snowmen as well, but I think that we also have to have more about what Christmas is about. Advent calendars are also extremely hard to find. I hope that the British Retail Consortium ensures that its members do not inadvertently fall into the trap of political correctness, but meet the needs and wants of its diverse&mdash;including Christian&mdash;customer base. Christ has been and always will be at the very heart of Christmas. Without wishing to be irreverent, taking religion out of Christmas is like serving the Christmas turkey without the stuffing.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/5">Other examples include some charity organisations banning Christmas messages or nativity scenes from their shop windows and displays; some&mdash;not all&mdash;Government Departments banning the word &quot;Christmas&quot; from all official celebrations; and the Home Office spending tens of thousands of pounds a year on celebrating Muslim and Hindu festivals, but very little on celebrating Christmas. The Department for Transport has admitted sending staff to minority religious events, but did not &quot;officially&quot; participate in Christmas celebrations. At the Foreign Office&mdash;I am a fan of the Foreign Office&mdash;Muslim and Chinese religious events are marked with VIP receptions. I have no objection to that, or to the Home Office celebrating Muslim and Hindu festivals, but why is Easter completely ignored? Such discrepancies in using public money potentially divide, alienate and frustrate, rather than unite.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/6">There are other inconsistencies. Today, many people from the Christian tradition feel that any religious allegiance is permissible as long as it is not the Christian tradition, and that everything is tolerated except a Christian world view. It cannot be right that all views are valid in the public arena as long as they are not traditional or orthodox Christian views. That is both intellectually inconsistent and socially unviable. I hope that the House agrees that no individual, group or organisation should be discriminated against on the grounds of their race, gender or sexuality, and that, equally, Christians should not be discriminated against on the grounds of their beliefs, however counter-cultural or unfashionable those beliefs might be. The lack of Government or public consensus on such issues should not be an excuse or the ground for anti-Christian discrimination. Turning to secularists, it is wrong of the anti-Christian lobby, whether atheistic, humanist or secularist, not to afford the level of tolerance to the Christian faith that they rightly demand for their own world view and beliefs or lack of belief.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/7">If the Government and their institutions continue to marginalise the Church, to try to remove it from public life and the public square, and to fail to acknowledge the Christian traditions that have weaved the very fabric of our nation and its heritage, a faith that espouses love and hope may be hijacked by extremist parties that espouse nothing more than hate and despair. According to an e-mail that I received, this week the British National party in Staffordshire despatched a Christmas card&mdash;I have not seen it&mdash;which portrays the Holy Family on the front cover and inside are the words &quot;Heritage, Tradition and Culture&quot;. Are the Government prepared to stand by and surrender the nation's Christian heritage and traditions to parties of hate and division? In a cross-party consensus, we cannot allow that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/8">I call upon the Government to ensure that, henceforth, laws against discrimination on grounds of religious belief will be applied equally to people of all faiths and none, and that those people who profess a Christian faith will not be the exception to the law and will not be marginalised and intentionally hurt. It is time for the dragon of political correctness to be slain, and I invite the Government to take the first body blow in the name of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I can, however, provide an alternative for the Minister. If the Christian Church is now seen by the Government as a minority, then the Government should declare it so, and then afford Christians full minority rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/9">The creative industries also need to be consistent on how they treat religion&mdash;in print, online and in the broadcast media. So do the television companies and regulators. Regulators need to ensure that they apply equally the rules and criteria on faith issues in programming. I ask the creative industries to listen carefully to my next comment: the fear of violence from a particular faith group should not be the ground for hand selecting or targeting other faith groups who may choose to protest peacefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/10">I hope that the Government will confirm that Government Departments and agencies will recognise and celebrate Christmas. The Government must avoid pandering to a secular minority. I also hope the Minister will put it on the record that Christianity remains a central part of this nation's heritage. To say the opposite is to polarise communities rather than bring them together. I hope the Minister will also make clear that public bodies and institutions should not discriminate against Christian groups and organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/11">I have a question for the Minister: would our nation be safer, happier, wealthier and more at peace with itself if our Christian traditions and heritage were recognised and celebrated in a more even-handed way, rather than marginalised and scorned? As I said at the outset, this debate is not about &quot;doing God.&quot; Politicians, especially one as flawed as I am, need to tread carefully in this area. This debate is not about asking for special rights for the Christian tradition, but for equal rights. I hope the Government will today send out a clear and unequivocal message from Parliament to Departments, agencies, local authorities, and institutions that the Government condemn all religious intolerance, including rising Christianophobia.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-05a.261.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="261"  time="009:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071205/halltext/71205h0001.htm#07120550000467">
	<p pid="a.261.1/1">Obviously, it is up to the bodies that make such decisions to come to their conclusions. They will look at different bids, but not having been party to the bid that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, I cannot go into too much detail about it. However, even when public money is being spent, the fact that something might offend a particular group is no reason to say that it cannot proceed. There are always sensitivities, and they are not necessarily always predictable. As we have heard in the news over the past few weeks, Gillian Gibbons named a teddy bear Mohammed, and many people, particularly in Sudan, saw that as offensive&mdash;indeed, it was so deeply offensive to some that they felt the need to take to the streets to demand the execution of this teacher from Britain, who had gone out there to do a job and contribute to the country. Clearly, however, she fell foul of sensitivities there, which demonstrates that we cannot always be certain that we will not offend anybody. In our culture, naming a teddy bear is not easily understood as something that would cause offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/2">It was a positive thing that British newspapers did not print the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, but I would absolutely have defended their right to do so, had they chosen to. I like the fact that they showed their judgment on that occasion and did not print the cartoons, but it is not for politicians to make such calls. We live in a free society, and if we are to preserve freedom of speech, we must allow the organisations that fund the arts&mdash;whether they are private or even public bodies&mdash;to make their decisions based on the merit of the art that they seek to promote. There were similar tensions over the play &quot;Behzti&quot;, which caused many protests. The play, which was by a young writer, raised important issues. Politicians should not get into censoring and judging what the arts should be, because artistic output will not necessarily improve.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/3">On freedom of speech, we had the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, which included proposals to make it a crime to threaten or insult religion. I am pleased that my party, along with others, opposed that proposal and that the offence was reduced to only threatening behaviour or language. It is right that that happened, because it is not for the state to determine people's beliefs or to intervene in such issues. Indeed, the Act, which purported to protect freedom of religion, was strongly opposed by many Christians and people of other faiths, because of a well grounded fear that it could impact on their ability to say what they wanted to in praise of their religion, and that it could interfere with what was said in churches and other holy places.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/4">When we introduce legislation to protect one group of people, it is important that we do not inadvertently destroy another group's freedom of speech. Obviously, when we go beyond beliefs&mdash;when actions discriminate against people on the basis of sex, race or so on&mdash;the state has a responsibility to protect its citizens. However, we must take care not to enter a Big Brother world of thought crime, where what is in somebody's mind can lead to their being guilty of an offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/5">The hon. Member for The Wrekin was right to point out the great benefits of Christianity to this country. It is all very well for us to hear about the negative side of religion, as we often do, particularly in relation to conflict around the world, but, as he pointed out, many of the great artists, musicians and architects of our past were inspired by the Christian faith. We all live with the benefits of that. Christians continue to make a great contribution to our communities locally, nationally and internationally&mdash;for example in the work of Christian Aid. Nearer to home for me, a recent study in Glasgow showed that a great hidden contribution was made by Church groups, with more than 2,000 Church-funded projects working in the area to improve individuals' life chances in some of our most deprived communities. In my constituency, a group of young people are keen to set up a youth caf&eacute; in Bishopriggs. The place where they are meeting to do their planning and the support that they are getting from a youth worker are provided by one of the churches in the area. A great deal is contributed by the Church in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/6">Campaigns such as Make Poverty History or the movement for more fair trade products show the impact that the Church has had on getting issues to the top of the political agenda and creating a critical mass of people campaigning and taking action on those issues. It can also companies change their mind&mdash;for example, by putting pressure on big supermarkets to stock more fair trade products. The hon. Gentleman understandably mentioned the difficulty of getting Jesus or Christian-related Christmas cards, gifts and advent calendars and so on, and perhaps that might be the next campaign that some members of the Church wish to work on. With its network across the country, it can be a powerful lobbying group, and we all know that companies are most likely to listen to numbers on what they will sell.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/7">Christianity has brought great benefits to this country, which is why it is regrettable to see anti-Christian sentiment. I do not think that it is as pervasive and widespread as the hon. Gentleman suggested, but it certainly happens. We need only to examine the case about this time last year of British Airways employee Nadia Eweida, who was told that she could not wear her cross around her neck as a simple demonstration of her faith. I am sure that many Members present signed early-day motions and protested against that ridiculous decision, which was an example of far too much consideration being given to sensitivities that probably do not exist. I cannot imagine people being offended by such a demonstration of somebody's faith.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/8">The hon. Gentleman mentioned that fewer nativity plays are taking place. That is a great shame; I fondly remember taking part in various nativity plays and I am sure that, as Members, we all get the opportunity to see a few. Next Friday, I shall be delighted to go to Oxgang primary school in Kirkintilloch to watch the children perform their nativity play, which is one of the lovely traditions of our education system. Alongside education about other faiths and religions, it is entirely appropriate that such events should happen. Schools should not feel the need to demur from such fabulous celebrations. I have not met people who have been in any way offended by the putting on of nativity plays.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/9">It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that we treat people of all faiths and none fairly. I believe that that is all that Christians are asking for, and it does not seem too much to ask. We recognise that Christianity is an important religion with a great tradition, and it is now operating in a different, 21st-century Britain, where there are more and more faiths as the make-up of the country changes, and more people who choose not to subscribe to any one faith but to pursue their beliefs and way of living differently. As individuals, it is incumbent on all of us to get along together and to respect each other's beliefs, whether we are of a particular religion or not. Some of the best examples of that are seen in ofur schools. Young children do not have those prejudices and thoughts of discrimination in their minds, but often learn them from the adults around them. If we promote more integration and understanding at that age, it will help us to deal with some of the problems mentioned by the hon. Member for The Wrekin.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/10">When drafting legislation and considering the equality agenda we need to bear in mind the importance of people's freedom of belief. That will often mean a balancing act, because of the conflicts between different beliefs, but in a liberal society that is what we must aim for. I thank the hon. Gentleman for introducing the debate and congratulate him on its timeliness.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Williams. I want to make a short contribution. First, I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the subject that he has raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/2">Many, including some of the columnists and newspapers, will say that this is just another case of extremism and of someone wishing to push their particular faith beliefs down other people's throats. However, it is important that we set out clearly the fears that are shared by the vast majority of people in not only this part of the United Kingdom, but the part of the United Kingdom that I represent, that the foundations of our Christian traditions in this country are slowly being eroded.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/3">Many anecdotes and examples have been given so far. In Northern Ireland, many Christians believe that the authorities, because of fear of various groups, have turned a blind eye to some of the things that have happened. Just last year, the gay pride march marched through the centre of Belfast carrying posters that read, &quot;Jesus is a fag&quot;. That was deeply offensive to Christians, but the police were prepared to do nothing about it. The Parades Commission, which would deal harshly with parades of other sorts that were deemed to have caused offence, did nothing about it. Indeed, those in the homosexual community who would rail against any restrictions or attacks on their community by people with strong religious convictions seemed to think that it was all a bit of a joke.</p>

	<p pid="a.264.1/1">I agree; unfortunately, it seems that the apologies are all wanted in one direction. That example was one illustration from Northern Ireland of the authorities' apparent unwillingness to listen to the legitimate protests of Christians who feel that their faith is being put under pressure and attack. Another example that has been given is the public money that went to &quot;Jerry Springer&mdash;The Opera&quot; because of falling ticket sales.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/2">In Northern Ireland, one magazine, which claimed to be an arts magazine, went round various churches in Belfast. It attended the church service that I would go to on a Sunday, where committed Christians bring people who are excluded from society because of their disabilities to church on a Sunday. They will take them to their homes beforehand for a meal. Many of those people are mentally disabled and many are physically disabled. In the interest of art, that magazine mocked those attending the church, using terms such as &quot;imbeciles&quot; and &quot;the lame&quot;, and expected to receive public money. When I opposed that money, I received some amazing hate mail, including some from people living as far away as London, saying that that was censorship of the worst kind. That is despite the fact, of course, that if Christians had said such things about other groups, there would have been a massive outcry.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/3">Some local councils, Government Departments and schools have tried to suppress references to the festival that we will celebrate in a few weeks' time: Christmas. The &quot;Christ&quot; in Christmas appears to cause offence. Other religions have not said that it is offensive. However, we live in an increasingly aggressively secular society in which some wish to make Christianity a private matter and to ensure that it is not manifested publicly, despite the fact that this remains a predominately Christian country. If those people get away with that, this country will be the poorer for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/4">We have heard already about the contribution that the public face of Christianity has made to shaping this nation and to ensuring social justice. About six months ago, there was a huge protest by Christians outside Parliament. They feel that the Government increasingly lend their ears to those in the secular community who wish to promote secularism aggressively and introduce laws that will make Britain a more secular nation and erode Christian traditions. The Minister will deny it, but that is increasingly the perception of many from the Christian tradition. Laws and public policy tend to be directed towards secularism, and the country will find itself poorer for that. The laws that go through Parliament will reflect that increasing secularisation and, perhaps, a straying away from some of the guidelines laid down by Christian tradition.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.2/1">Well, at the start of the Prime Minister's period in office, there were certainly indications that he might do so. I would welcome it if the kind of Christian tradition that he comes from were to be reflected in some United Kingdom public policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/2">With regard to our attitude towards Christian traditions and influences, there are a couple of practical things that could be good for society. First, as the two previous speakers have mentioned, we must get away from the nonsense of thinking that we should try to dilute the Christian aspects of Easter and Christmas, whether in Christmas cards, school nativity plays, or terms that are used. Secondly, public policy and the use of public resources must reflect the fact that, in many areas of our country, Christians and the infrastructure that they have through churches provide many important and necessary facilities. If it were not for the work of churches in vast areas of Northern Ireland&mdash;not even in a proselytising way, but simply in providing facilities&mdash;there would be no community activities or work with young people. However, there seems to be an unwillingness in public policy to make resources available to churches to carry out such activities. I should like action on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/3">This is an important debate and I welcome the fact that the hon. Member for The Wrekin secured it. I trust that some good will stem from it.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.3/1">I join others in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> on securing the debate. Perhaps I may, as he did, risk a measure of irreverence. When I saw the title &quot;Christianophobia&quot;, I wondered whether Manchester United had pre-empted the January transfer window and secured another striker. However, I take his point.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/2">Each year I go to visit every nursing home in my constituency. There are about 800 residents in total, and I take them each a small Christmas card. I choose cards with different scenes in different years, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> does, but each year I ensure that there is a stamp saying that every good gift comes from above. In the six years that I have been doing that, no one has taken offence&mdash;indeed, nor should they. Equally, when I get cards from members of the Sikh community and those of other faiths, I do not take offence, no matter what cards they send. No offence is intended or taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/3">As for the direction in which the hon. Member for The Wrekin is endeavouring to ensure that the Government go, the overriding factor for us, as a society, should be developing tolerance that is not mutually exclusive. We must demonstrate tolerance. Our society in the United Kingdom in 2007 has come about through Christian values. We have the freedom to express opinions. Sometimes people express opinions that many do not accept, cherish or share, but they are entitled to express them, precisely because of the values underpinning our society that allow the expression of such opinions.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/4">The hon. Gentleman and others are not paranoid. They have expressed quite a balanced view, and that should be the outcome of this debate. While we do not accuse the Government and certain elements of society of wanting to close down or eradicate those of us with a Christian view, a political correctness is appearing more frequently that is aimed particularly at those values that we want to espouse and preserve to allow people who do not share them to express their opinions.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/5">I am delighted that this debate is taking place. It is timely, not just because it is the Christmas season, but because many people feel that such values are being eroded year on year in this society. We want to ensure that they are again central to our society so that people who do not share them may continue to have the freedom to express their culture, views and ideas, precisely because the Christian ethos allows them to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.266.0/1">It is nice to have you preside over this interesting debate, Mr. Williams. Before I respond, I must declare a few interests. I am a practicing member of the Church of England and a member of the council of the Evangelical Alliance, a group of about 1 million Christians from a variety of denominations. I was also in the same college chapel group at St. John's, Oxford as my friend&mdash;I use the word perfectly properly&mdash;Tony Blair. Accordingly, although I speak from the Conservative Front Bench and shall be as objective as I always try to be, I make no pretence of being neutral in relation to the Christian faith or its importance to the country yesterday, today and tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> on securing this debate and making his case with passion and honesty. I have known him for many years, since before he became a Member of the House, and I know his concerns and beliefs to be sincere and deep.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/3">This is a highly topical and controversial debate. The combustible nature of the Christian faith and politics and the relationship between the two has been well illustrated by the former Prime Minister. He was not wrong about hesitating to profess his faith too openly, and nor was Alastair Campbell, who, whatever his failings, knew the press pretty well. I doubt that anyone in the public realm was at all surprised when he said that to talk about Jesus in public leaves a cynical media with the target of a politician as a nutter. Why such a sentiment is the norm in a country where, within living memory, a Prime Minister led this House in a day of national prayer ought to arouse more interest than it does. This debate allows us to explore the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/4">On hon. Members' contributions, it is interesting that we all tend to come from the same position&mdash;I would be surprised if the Minister were to come from a different one&mdash;in expressing a degree of support for my hon. Friend's main contention that there are some instances in modern times in which the Christian faith has appeared to be unfairly attacked.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/5">My hon. Friend was right to raise issues that surface occasionally in the newspapers&mdash;whether about nativity plays, the changing of the names of festivals or people taking offence in ways that we find difficult to understand. He made a coherent case. Importantly, he also raised the point that those at the margin of politics are willing to pick up the mantle of Christianity. He referred to the Christmas cards produced by the BNP in some areas. It would not be the first Nazi party to attempt to use faith for its own purposes, which is a disturbing development of which we should all be well aware. It uses faith as a smokescreen to cover its true nature and activities. That illustrates the risk that if those in society who uphold Christian values are not prepared to do so openly and straightforwardly, others might do so in their place.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> spoke about the importance of freedom of speech in relation to the Christian and other communities, and she was right. Members present have mentioned the significant contribution made to British life by a variety of faiths&mdash;indigenous ones and those that have arrived over a number of years&mdash;and their contribution to our quality of life. She was right to pick up on the contribution of Christian groups to, for example, the Make Poverty History campaign and the Jubilee campaign. In particular, international development has risen enormously up the political agenda partly owing to the efforts of the Church and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">The hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> referred to problems in Northern Ireland, which is not unused to such difficulties, such as the fact that, when offence is caused to Christians by the display of certain material, the law seems unwilling to act as it might had the offence gone the other way. He and others spoke about aggressive secularism, rather than other faiths, and about attempts being made to drive Christianity away from the public square and into the private realm. That reminded me of a remark made by Jim Wallis, the American evangelist, who occupies an interesting position for an American evangelist by being on the left of centre of American politics&mdash;he is a great man. He said that whereas faith is often personal, it is never private, because the expression of faith and what people do with it inevitably interacts with the world around them. The Christian faith cannot be pushed into the private sphere, because it cannot exist under such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" name="Gregory Campbell">The hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> made a strong point about the basis of tolerance in this country often being related to what the Church and Christians have achieved over the centuries, before anyone else was there to defend the rights and privileges of society. All hon. Members who have spoken have recognised, therefore, a particular grain of truth in the debate raised today by my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/9">This debate is very difficult to pin down, because there are so many issues to cover. I shall content myself, therefore, with trying to answer a couple of questions: does Christianophobia exist, and if it does, does it matter to faith and the nation? I made the point at the start of my remarks that, within living memory, a Prime Minister has led a national day of prayer supported by other political leaders, newspaper editors and the monarch. That day was, of course, <phrase class="date" code="1940-05-26">Sunday 26 May 1940</phrase>, when Winston Churchill led the nation in a day of prayer in the light of the grave threat from Germany and as our troops gathered on the beach at Dunkirk.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/10">We know what happened over the following few days&mdash;the miraculous lifting of troops from the beach, their return to the United Kingdom and Hitler's inexplicable decision not to invade Britain. Back then, a Prime Minister could call the nation to prayer in a way that would be very difficult to do today, which tells us something about changes that have occurred in society over a relatively short period. I wonder how newspapers would react today if the Prime Minister declared a day of prayer for a particular purpose. I am sure that quite a number of newspapers would question the man's sanity and look in detail at what had happened to British society. When the same thing happened only 60 years ago, however, the nation thought it in no way strange that it should be called to prayer. So what has happened?</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/11">Does Christianophobia exist? Yes, it does. My hon. Friend makes a fair case that there is some misunderstanding at the margins of what faith is about, and people have taken decisions that they might regret with hindsight. It is undeniable that society now views the Christian faith differently from the way it did in the past, but it is uncertain how much of that is due to a more general questioning attitude towards many institutions and how much is due to active hostility.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/12">I agree with my hon. Friend that few people of other faiths are actively hostile to Christianity. As hon. Members know, I had the good fortune to represent my home town of Bury in the House for 14 years. The town has a strong community from Kashmir, in Pakistan, and its members were delighted to have a Member of Parliament who had a faith, which was something that they could relate to and understand. In their discussions with me about where society was going, they were much less concerned about my faith than about their young people associating with others who had no faith, no sense of what the world was about and no God to refer to in shaping their conduct or understanding what might happen to them in the future. I therefore agree that hardly anyone with faith seems to take offence at matters relating to Christianity.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/13">It is also true that there is a modern-day culture of those with no faith seeing offence where it does not exist and misinterpreting support for Christian heritage as an attempt to promote the Christian faith, and we need to deal with that misunderstanding. A huge amount of these things are not done malevolently, but some are, and a number of very left-wing, socialist local authorities in the '80s were afraid of dealing faith groups. There is evidence to suggest that that is changing markedly, and that is important, but it is certainly true that such things existed. The fact that people misunderstand the relationship between Christian heritage and Christian faith and therefore believe that supporting Christian heritage somehow gives unequal treatment to the Christian faith is at the heart of some of the decisions by bureaucrats and officials who believe that they are treating people equally by taking away one of Christianity's privileges. In fact, that is not the case at all, as I will explain in a second.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/14">Christianophobia therefore exists to some degree at the margins, although this is not the only country to face the problem. My second question, however, is whether that matters to the Christian faith. In itself, it does not. I say that because the Christian faith has faced much more serious attacks than the odd rant from secular or humanist groups in British society. Last year, I prayed with Ministers in Albania, which became the world's first self-proclaimed atheist society under the lamented Enver Hoxha&mdash;he built mushrooms all over the country for protection, but that is a different story. That society declared itself an atheist society, but a handful of years after the collapse of that brand of communism and atheism, I was praying with Christian Albanian Ministers in their offices. So can the Christian faith survive the odd attack by Christianophobics in Britain? Yes, it can. I can testify to the power of Jesus Christ in Albania and all over eastern Europe, where attempts were made to suppress it.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/15">Despite the pressures, there is evidence of strong growth in particular Churches in contemporary Britain, including the Evangelical Church and the black Church, which is particularly strong and powerful in urban communities and which is making a great contribution to society. Our society has become more pluralistic, and the place of faith in contemporary British society as a result of that is a wider issue, but, again, Christians should not be troubled or worried about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/16">A couple of years ago, the Evangelical Alliance produced a report on a commission of inquiry, called &quot;Faith and Nation&quot;, which considered some of those issues. On pluralism it said:</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/17" class="indent">&quot;It is doubtful that Britain was ever a truly Christian country, if by this it is meant that the majority of the Britons were committed believers in Jesus Christ. But in earlier ages Britain's cohesiveness as a nation owed much to a public framework of Protestant Christianity that shaped its laws, moulded its constitution, governed its moral life and underlay national identity. Christianity was in a virtual monopoly position, and those who dissented from it were seen as political, social or intellectual deviants. This overarching consensus has now dissipated, challenged by an increasing diversity of worldviews and faiths&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/18">I think that that is a pretty honest assessment, and, accordingly, the fact that in a more pluralistic society the Christian faith must argue its case more strongly is not, in my view, wrong. It should not fear such a challenge, so that is not a problem to the Christian faith. My answer to the question whether Christianophobia harms the Christian faith is therefore no. I think that it is strong enough to survive, without any question.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/19">Does, however, what my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin and other hon. Members spoke about affect Christian heritage in this society, and is that damaging? The answer is probably yes. I think that there is a difference between what Christians believe&mdash;their faith&mdash;and the faith heritage of the country, without which it cannot be properly understood. That is at the heart of my hon. Friend's concerns. There is evidence that the country today retains a strong and active Christian heritage. Secularists would point out, if there were any here, that the House of Commons and the House of Lords begin their sittings each day with prayer; that at the conclusion of the Queen's Speech the Queen calls for the &quot;blessing of Almighty God&quot; on the efforts of Parliament; that 26 bishops still sit in the House of Lords; that there is religious worship&mdash;predominantly Christian&mdash;in schools; and that that is all evidence of Christian heritage remaining strong in modern society.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.1/1">Yes, I do. My hon. Friend has anticipated me, and I shall come to that in a second, if I may.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/2">My point is that there is still evidence of a strong Christian element in modern society, which reflects heritage and which is important. However, there is also evidence that that is being slowly squeezed out of modern society, and that is a matter for concern. Some of what is happening is sheer laziness, and we run the risk of losing what we neglect to value. I am not talking about children being indoctrinated in the Christian faith, but I am concerned about children leaving school unaware of the importance of the ten commandments, the basics of the Christian story, key hymns and not only the role of the Church as an institution, but Christian lives that changed history, from Bede to Wilberforce. Knowing those things is a fundamental right as a part of children's education in this country, and it enables them to understand where their country came from, prior to working out where it should be going.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that although it is important for young people in school in 21st-century Britain to understand the Christian tradition, it is equally important for them to learn about other faiths, to prepare them well for the multicultural society that we live in, and to help them understand other countries, given the way society is shrinking globally?</p>

	<p pid="a.270.3/1">The hon. Lady is absolutely right. It is essential, if people are to understand today's world, that children should leave school aware of the major faiths in this country, and worldwide. The lack of that awareness would be a deficiency. My point is that if they do not understand the Christian heritage of their country, which is so deep and which affects virtually every institution and walk of life that they will encounter, that will be an equal deficiency. There is evidence to suggest that that is what is being lost through fear of some sort of inequality, while the importance of the history and heritage is missed.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/2">Let me bring the issue up to date. The Government have a duty. They do not have a duty to promote the Christian faith and should not feel any concern about that. Christians are not worried that the state does not require children to have a Christian faith, and we would be concerned if it did. However, it is important that the state should protect that understanding of Christian heritage and history.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/3">The IPPR report has been mentioned, and the fact that it has not yet properly surfaced, despite the kite that was flown about it, because of the reaction probably tells the story. The IPPR went way too far by trying to suggest that in order to accommodate new people into our society, we should take swingeing action against the Christian faith. That was wrong, as the public reaction showed. The report stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/4" class="indent">&quot;If we are going to continue as a nation to mark Christmas&mdash;and it would be very hard to expunge it from our national life even if we wanted to&mdash;then public organisations should mark other religious festivals too.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/5">It talked about a birth ceremony or something similar where</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Parents, their friends and family and the state agree to work in partnership to support and bring up their child.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/7">That is as worrying an echo of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; as I can possibly imagine. That that report has disappeared and not surfaced tells us much. It is a misunderstanding of the role of the Christian faith in society to try to equate it to some form of equality and tolerance for other faiths. We are not comparing apples and pears.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/8">Where are we going in society? I shall turn, briefly, to a report by the think-tank Theos entitled &quot;'Doing God'&mdash;A Future for Faith in the Public Square&quot;. The introduction, by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of Westminster, spoke about the ills of modern society and about people losing their place in society. It is true that research into happiness shows that the correlation between happiness and religious faith is strong. Society is immeasurably wealthier than it was, yet it would proclaim itself not to be any happier, and so the place for faith at the centre of society has never been stronger.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/9">The two primates wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/10" class="indent">&quot;Our society is experiencing a...'moment of perplexity'. Issues of belief and faith, of how human beings perceive the world, have rarely been so important in society, or so badly misunderstood. In international affairs, in education, in the most pressing debates in medical ethics, the modern mind may identify&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/11">with Tolstoy's words&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/12" class="indent">&quot;I felt that what I had been standing on had collapsed and that I had nothing left under my feet. What I had lived on no longer existed, and there was nothing left.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/13">The primates were quoting from Tolstoy's &quot;A Confession&quot;, in which he talked about his loss of faith, equating it to contemporary Russia, and then about how he had regained faith and therefore an understanding of society. He was showing that the loss of faith in his society was leading to significant damage. That is the point that the two archbishops made.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/14">There is an argument that in the public square there is more room for faith than ever before, with the revival of civic society spoken of by the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire, and the fact that faith groups are actively involved in civic society&mdash;they have seen the gaps in people's happiness and are trying to reassure people that there is some point to life in the midst of despair. That those with faith can do that in a way that secular agencies find difficult cannot be doubted. There is hope for those of faith that that will become more important in the future, rather than less so.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/15">That the Christian faith has been fundamental to the development of our country is undeniable. Recognising that does not require any commitment to any religion, but is basic to our understanding of our nation and is required of Christians, Jews, Sikhs, Muslims, Hindus and others of faith and of no faith. Recognition of that gives no privilege in conventional terms, but is an acknowledgment of the fact that the Christian faith is woven into the very fabric of our society. There are bishops in the House of Lords not because it is unequal for them to be there, but as an acknowledgment of the role of the Church in protecting the very values and freedoms that we rely on. That we have so many faith schools is not due to an Act of Government; it is because the Church created schools and ran them when the state did not even think about providing them, which is why they are important.</p>

I confess that, as the Minister with responsibility for the fire and rescue service, my card this year is the Fire Services National Benevolent Fund Christmas card. I agree with her about the importance of the Nativity. When I was five&mdash;many years ago&mdash;I was the king who got to deliver the gold in my nativity play.

For reasons that are probably best not gone into, Opposition Members voted against legislation to provide the greater protection that the Sikh faith and Jewish faiths have historically had.

He makes a fair point about offensive slogans&mdash;it strikes me that they were offensive. He referred to &quot;their community&quot;, but I sure that he will agree&mdash;it is important to get this point across&mdash;that one can be both Christian and gay. He also spoke about Christians wanting to protect the most vulnerable in society. I agree with him, but that is true of not only Christians. Every faith with which I work day by day, as a Minister linked to and working with faith communities across the board, shares those values.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.3/1">Indeed&mdash;that is something that the humanists say when they visit me. We want to be as open-door as possible for all faiths and those with no faith when developing our policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.3/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" name="Gregory Campbell">The hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> made a balanced contribution about the need to develop tolerance. That is the thrust of the debate. As the hon. Member for The Wrekin said, this is not about policy or the shape of legislation, but about people's understanding of each other, and of each other's faiths, in the wider country, and what we can do collectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.3/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase> kicked off with some warm remarks about our former Prime Minister, Tony Blair. I, too, have been watching &quot;The Blair Years&quot; on television. We saw an interesting and candid interview on Sunday in which he spoke of his religious faith and its importance to him. He also spoke about what people's perception of him would have been if they were aware of how important his faith was to him. I wonder whether that was because he is a devoted Christian, or because he was more afraid of people thinking that he had a religious zeal, full stop. He might have felt that the media would be concerned about that, but the hon. Gentleman made a fair point.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.3/4">The hon. Gentleman also spoke about the local contribution of faiths, particularly the Christian faith. The Government very much support faith-based regeneration. He talked about the Make Poverty History and drop the debt campaigns. Members of Parliament have seen those faith-based campaigns making a huge difference over the past few years. They show the Christian faith at its very best, delivering on the ground to make a difference not only in this country, but worldwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.3/5">Many view the UK as an increasingly secular society. However, we must remember that the Christian Churches have had an immense and historic influence in shaping our society, and that they make significant contributions in a wide range of areas, including community development, education, social inclusion and heritage. I fully recognise the central, historical and cultural significance of Christianity in our country's story. We should all be aware of that and celebrate the fact. The UK has a strong tradition of respect for others, justice, the right to freedom, the right to belief, and a strong sense of right and wrong. The Christian tradition has had a significant impact on the way in which those freedoms and traditions have been shaped, and that continues today through its role in contributing to and shaping Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.3/6">As I said, I work closely with faith-based organisations. Later this month, we will be launching our inter-faith strategy, which is about strengthening the role of faith in all localities and communities. The Christian faith will be a key player. I make that commitment to the House and to all faiths in our land.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.3/7">In the short time left, may I conclude where I started? I wish everybody a very merry Christmas.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-05a.276.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="276"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071205/halltext/71205h0004.htm#07120550000495">
	<p pid="a.276.3/1">Indeed, Mr. Williams, I will do exactly that in my next sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/2">In his statement, the Chancellor pointed out that financial institutions have confirmed that</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/3" class="indent">&quot;the missing data are not enough in themselves for someone to access a person's bank account for fraudulent purposes, as additional security information and passwords are always required. However, we have to recognise the increased risk caused by these missing data.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-11-20.1103"><i>Official Report</i>, 20 November 2007; Vol. 467, c. 1103</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/4">That is not as reassuring as it sounds. It is frankly bizarre that in his statement the Chancellor made no reference to the risk of identity fraud&mdash;the subject of today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/5">Before I move on to highlight the individual case to which I originally intended to refer, I would like to ask the Minister a couple of questions relating to the case involving Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs that I think are pertinent. Will she monitor the take-up of benefits so as to be able to identify any decrease in claims that might arise from people's concerns about the loss of data? I see the Minister shaking her head. I am happy for her to reply in writing. I also see that you are about to rise to your feet, Mr. Williams, so I will concentrate on issues relating to identity fraud. The case clearly has implications for the arrangements for data sharing between local authorities and the Department for Work and Pensions where they are to work together on benefit fraud. There will be concerns about the amounts of data that will be transferred between the two, the risk that those data may be lost, and that identity fraud may arise from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/6">It is worth concentrating on one individual case to see what can happen when only someone's address is used and how that can be abused, because that will enable one to draw conclusions as to what might happen should the data disc with 25 million cases on it end up in the wrong hands. I have a constituent who has repeatedly received at his address letters in the names of a variety of people. They have arrived from a variety of Government agencies. There was clearly a concerted attempt to defraud the benefits system, whether through tax credits, child benefit or the like. My constituent wrote repeatedly, using recorded delivery to return the documents to HMRC, because he was worried about how his address, name and potentially other personal details were being abused.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/7">Having taken up the matter with HMRC, we got a response. My constituent started the correspondence this January and came to me some months afterwards. We got a response in July in which HMRC confirmed that it had a number of IT tools to help identify fraudulent claims, although one must question how effective they are at preventing someone's identity from being abused, given the number of letters that my constituent received in the names of various people from various organisations. We received assurances that my constituent would receive no further correspondence from Government Departments, but unfortunately that was not what happened in practice. He received further correspondence at his address in the names of various people for various purposes, including details from banks about bank accounts being set up.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/8">Having had to take the matter even further, I got a response from the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, who apologised for the fact that my constituent had corresponded with HMRC on a number of occasions using recorded delivery, and that it had taken many months before he eventually extracted a response. In that case, however, the only thing being abused by fraudsters was the person's address. We know that the data discs that have gone missing contained a large amount of data, which dramatically increases the risk of identity fraud of a scale and sophistication that we have never seen before if they get into the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/9">I wish to broaden the debate to other risks of identity fraud. I thank the all-party group on identity fraud, which sent me a copy of its report that was published in its final version in October. I wish to highlight two things from that report, the first of which is phishing&mdash;not of the line with bait variety. There are two types of phishing: one involves social engineering schemes&mdash;I am sure that we have all received e-mails encouraging people to go to a website that they think is for HSBC, NatWest bank and so on&mdash;and the second is the technical type that involves planting software on people's PCs to capture details while they are using their accounts, and that information is then passed on. Such technical subterfuge is about stealing people's credentials, intercepting online user accounts, passwords and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/10">In its report and recommendations, with which the Minister might be familiar, the all-party group calls for significant police resources to be devoted to the matter. Apparently the Metropolitan police has a fraud alert website, which in 2006 received no fewer than 10,000 hits a month. They also received about 300 e-mails a day. According to the all-party group, that part of the Metropolitan police is resourced with only one police officer, who is faced with the huge challenge of dealing with that volume of e-mails and complaints. There is also an international aspect to the problem, and I hope that the Minister will say what is happening internationally to deal with scams, particularly as many of them originate abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/11">The second key matter that I wish to take from the all-party group report is spyware, which is software that allows people covertly to monitor and obtain details from an individual's computer. I understand from the all-party group that there is a question mark over whether the use of such technology is illegal. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that point. If she could put it on the record once and for all, the knowledge would help the all-party group and others to ensure that appropriate action is taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/12">The all-party group raised other points that I do not have time to go through in detail. They include other ways in which identity fraud can occur, such as through online shopping. People can also access information left on second-hand computers, and fraudsters on social networking sites can capture people's personal details, such as date of birth. A less sophisticated type of crime, although it is not identity fraud, can arise from such sites, when people advertise that they are going on holiday and someone breaks into their property. We do not have time to deal with those points today.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/13">I have received a couple of briefings worth mentioning in passing. The first is from CIFAS, the UK's fraud prevention service, highlighting two ways that it thinks the Government could be more proactive. One is by introducing better controls to diminish the apparent ease with which fraudsters can obtain birth certificates and national insurance numbers, and the second is by clamping down on websites that provide what can be described as novelty or spoof forms of ID. The latter is challenging, because many such websites are not based in the UK. They offer ID that appears to be genuine but is open to fraud. I hope that the Minister will explain, either now or later in writing, what action the Government can take on those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/14">Some of these matters are the Government's responsibility and some are not&mdash;they are the responsibility of financial institutions and other commercial organisations. I received an interesting briefing from the REaD group, which focuses on ensuring that direct mailings are sent only to people's current addresses and that they are not sent to deceased persons. Fraudsters often create identities from direct mail, such as credit card applications, sent to people who have died. If they get their hands on such mail, they can create new identities from it and commit fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.3/15">I apologise if the Minister has not had advance notice of the range of my points, but I hope that she can respond to most of them now or later in writing. One of the positive consequences of the saga of the lost CDs has been a greater focus on the need to keep data safe and to protect our identities from fraud. I have asked a number of straightforward questions about the impact of the loss of HMRC data and what measures could be implemented to tackle identity and internet fraud, and I am certain that she will want to provide comprehensive and straightforward replies.</p>

	<p pid="a.279.3/1">Thank you Mr. Williams. I will not be drawn on the ins and outs of the Chancellor's statement. He was responding in the House to a particular incident, and I think he gave a full statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.3/2">The hon. Gentleman has raised the case of a constituent whose address was used to carry out multiple crimes, and later he discussed false IDs available via websites. Both demonstrate exactly why we need identity cards in this country to better lock people to their identity. The fact that someone's address alone is currently enough to enable people to make fraudulent claims in some cases&mdash;although I think that most institutions will require further proof&mdash;is unfortunate.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.0/1">Let me develop my point first. Once we have identity cards that lock a biometric fingerprint and a facial image into a digital chip which can then be checked to prove that the person is who they say they are, and by protecting the data we will have a much more secure system. We will no longer have to rely on trust, which we have&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;relied on happily for a long time. Trust is no longer enough to protect against identity fraud.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.2/1">Without straying too far off the subject, Mr. Williams, I will deal briefly with that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/2">A person can only have one identity through the identity registration system, because it has to be linked to a very unique identifier&mdash;one's fingerprint. That means that anybody attempting to use something fraudulently will only ever be able to have one identity. But we would also make sure, as we do with our passport interviews for new adult applicants, that we have rigorous checks to make sure that the person in front of the interviewing officer is who they say they are. We can make sure that we can bottom that out. There are a number of checks that can be done at the early stage and we need to make sure that they are absolutely correct. The hon. Gentleman raises an important point, but the core principle of identity cards is that the unique identifier links someone to their identity information.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/3">In terms of security, the information that we hold on the passport database, for example, covers 80 per cent. of British citizens, and all that information is exactly what will be on the national identity register, with the addition of a national insurance number. There have not been great examples of loss of those data. Security is important and we are not complacent about it. The Government have a good record of protecting data and information, notwithstanding the unfortunate loss of the CDs.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/4">Moving on to the points raised by the hon. Gentleman about the all-party report on fraud, we have established the national fraud reporting centre, and the City of London police is to be the specialist force dealing with fraud up and down the country. Only last week I met with single points of contact on identity fraud in police forces and other organisations, including the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. Every year they get together in a forum, which was set up in 2005, to share best practice and information on cutting-edge techniques used by criminals attempting to use identity fraud to commit other crimes. We are also waiting for a detailed proposal from the Metropolitan police about an e-crime unit and whether or not we need to establish a separate body at another point to look into the specific issues of e-crime that the hon. Gentleman has raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/5">The hon. Gentleman talked about phishing, which has now been criminalised by the offence of fraud by false representation under the Fraud Act 2006. Law enforcement and private sector organisations and Government work together to combat the spread of phishing. It is, at the very least, a nuisance to people, but has far more serious consequences for those who are caught. The term &quot;spyware&quot; covers a range of software, some of which may be illegal and some of which may not. It is a matter for the police to consider in each case whether anything can done about it, in line with the legislation available. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform leads on the matter, so I point the hon. Gentleman in that direction if he wishes to know more about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/6">Online fraud is clearly a growing issue as more people undertake banking, shopping and a range of other activities online. They do need to be aware of the methods used by fraudsters to try to access online personal details, which can then be used to commit offences. He also raised the social sites on the internet such as Facebook and MySpace. I think a lot of people, when they sign up to them, are unaware that any personal information can be used by people with malign intent. They are also unaware that when they put material on such sites, they give away the copyright. All of those are things that people do not always think about when they go online.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/7">We are now working on getting advertising on these sites to alert people to the risks of putting personal information on those very open forums and to help them to deal with the nuisance of spam messages. We are trying to tackle all these things with the &quot;Get safe online&quot; public awareness campaign&mdash;a partnership between the Government, various law enforcement agencies and the business sector, which has now been running for two years. The campaign aims to increase internet security and provide authoritative, trustworthy and independent advice and information from the Government, the police and other law enforcement authorities. In the end, the best way to protect people's identity is for them to do it themselves, while the authorities are left to tackle the worst transgressions.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/8">It is worth highlighting the many measures that the Government have taken to combat identity fraud and related crime. The identity fraud steering group was set up four years ago by the Home Office; it brings together law enforcement agencies, and private and public organisations to implement measures to counter identity fraud. One of those measures is the network of single points of contact that I met with last week. They raised some valid and interesting points about the action we were taking. They were very keen to ensure that legislation kept pace with the challenges presented to them daily by fraudsters who try to push at the edges of what is possible. That network is important to tackling identity fraud. By working together, they are developing greater knowledge and understanding of the issue and sharing information, which can help to prosecute and convict the fraudsters and so protect the public. We are always looking for ways to build on that good practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/9">As well as increasing public awareness, we are also as a Government engaging in a lot of activity in both investigation and enforcement. The prevention work is critical because it is the first line of protection of the individual's information. The identity fraud steering group manages the identity fraud awareness campaign and two years ago set up a website that has now had 300,000 visits&mdash;approximately 16,000 a month&mdash;by people looking for advice. It has focused on the public, but it is now providing information for businesses, too, so they can learn how to keep their information and that of their customers secure, and how best to protect the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/10">I do not usually like to give a litany of legislation, but I think it is important today to outline some of the legislative changes that have been made to tackle problems of identity theft the related fraud. There is no single offence of identity theft or fraud: it is what someone does with that information that then leads to prosecution. It is important that our legislation keeps pace with changing techniques. So we have introduced new legislation. The Fraud Act 2006, which came into force in January of this year, replaced the deception offences in the Theft Acts and introduced a new offence of fraud. The new offence includes false representation, failing to disclose information, abuse of position, possession of equipment to commit fraud&mdash;passport-factory type equipment&mdash;and making and supplying articles for use in fraud. In my local area, last week, two Brazilian men were imprisoned for three years each, I think&mdash;at least one of them was&mdash;for running a passport factory in Hackney. Since January, therefore, prosecutions have been made under that Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/11">The Identity Cards Act 2006 criminalised for the first time the possession of false identity documents. Unbelievably, in the trusting world in which we used to live, it was okay to carry, say, 30 passports in a bag; that was not a criminal offence. Clearly, that is suspicious activity and very rarely would anyone need to do it. The criminalisation of the possession of false identity documents does not relate just to volume, but to the possession of a genuine document belonging to someone else without good reason. That would not affect a parent carrying a child's passport, but if the hon. Gentleman was carrying my passport around, most people would wonder why, and he could be prosecuted under the Act. Those are small but important measures that help to tackle this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/12">The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, which has just finished its Committee stage, will increase from six months to two years the penalty for the wilful misuse of personal data. That will be very significant and I look forward to prosecutions under that measure when it is enacted. In 2006, the Computer Misuse Act 1990 was amended to tackle unauthorised access or changes to computer data&mdash;another important change. We are also introducing legislation to allow public and private data sharing to combat identity fraud. Although critics of our approach to the national identity register imagine that there is a lot of communication between information systems across Government and sectors, sometimes that link is not there when it is needed to prevent and tackle fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/13">The Police and Justice Act 2006 allows the General Register Office to share information on recently deceased people and we will begin to grant approvals for organisations to access that information from January next year. That should tackle some of the &quot;Day of the Jackal&quot;-type frauds, where someone takes the identity of someone who has died. That will come into force properly next April, once the registered bodies are in place. The Serious Crime Act 2007 allows public authorities to disclose information for the purposes of tackling crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/14">The Attorney-General is also considering the issue&mdash;quite rightly, a wide range of people in Government are examining identity fraud, as it is a growing concern. Earlier this year, the then Attorney-General published a review that recommended that the Government work with the police and businesses to tackle fraud. The Government have recently announced &pound;28 million over the next three years to implement those recommendations, which shows that they are putting their money where their mouth is and working to ensure that the problem is tackled not just through legislation but through the necessary practical means.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/15">The Attorney-General's recommendations included the setting up of a national fraud strategic authority, which is at the proposal stage, and we hope that it will come into existence next April. Comments from hon. Members will be welcome as we bring together Government, the criminal justice system, business and public bodies to consider the matter with the City of London police.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Williams, for giving me the opportunity to raise a very important issue. I look forward to contributions from hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber, because I am sure that it is a common concern. The main reason why I have initiated the debate is a tragic case involving the death of my young constituent, Kyle McDermott, last year in Mexborough.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/2">I presented a petition to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-29">29 October</phrase> this year with more than 5,500 signatures. I shall quickly read out the petition:</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/3" class="indent">&quot;To the House of Commons</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/4" class="indent">The petition of Mrs. Catherine McDermott and residents of S. Yorks.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/5" class="indent">Declares that 7 year old Kyle McDermott was killed by a hit and run driver on 11/09/06. The driver had 2 previous convictions for drink driving but was sentenced to just 5 months in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/6" class="indent">The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urge the Secretary of State for Justice to urgently review the current sentencing policy for this type of offence with a view to introducing much stiffer penalties.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-10-29.620"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 October 2007; Vol. 465, c. 620</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/7">The petition was raised by Kyle's grandmother, Mrs. Catherine McDermott, who lives on Maple road in Mexborough&mdash;the road on which Kyle was killed. He was knocked down by a white van driven by 44-year-old Mr. Christopher Collins, who is also from Mexborough, although he was not detained by the police until 10 months later&mdash;it took the police 10 months to track that individual down. Mr. Collins served just six weeks of the five-month sentence that he was given.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/8">Kyle's grandmother, Cath McDermott, was one of the first on the scene after the accident. She told me of her memories of that dreadful evening. It was about five minutes past 6 on a nice summer evening, and Kyle had just been to the shops on his bike. Mrs. McDermott was sat in the front room watching TV, when she heard screams from outside. She went outside and saw Kyle lying in the middle of the road. She told me that when she got to Kyle, he was vomiting blood and blood was coming from his ears. She told me how she cradled Kyle in her arms as she felt him slipping away. She also wanted me to tell the Chamber how grateful she was for all the efforts of the emergency services, which tried desperately hard to save Kyle. Indeed, Mrs. McDermott told me that they tried for nearly seven hours in the hospital to revive Kyle, but without any effect. I guess that none of us can imagine holding our grandchild in our arms while they slip away&mdash;it must be the worst feeling in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/9">I was never fortunate enough to meet Kyle during his short life. All I know is that he was a bonny and lively lad&mdash;he was described in the newspaper as &quot;a little angel&quot;. Kyle had many friends and loved sport; in fact, he had just had a trial with Rotherham United under-eights. He had just moved up to Mexborough Montagu junior school from Park Road infants. His death was a great blow to the whole community of Mexborough.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/10">As stated in the petition, Mr. Collins was sentenced to just five months in prison, of which he served only six weeks. Shortly after his release, the chief constable of South Yorkshire, Mr. Meredydd Hughes, spoke out about the case in a local newspaper. The article, in the <i>South Yorkshire Times</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-27">27 September</phrase>, was entitled &quot;Chief Constable calls for tougher sentences on hit and run drivers&quot;. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/11" class="indent">&quot;South Yorkshire's police chief has backed calls for tougher penalties for hit and run drivers&mdash;after the man responsible for mowing down a schoolboy was released from prison after six weeks...South Yorkshire chief constable Meredydd Hughes has now added his voice to calls for harsher penalties for killer drivers, while urging campaigners to continue pressurising the Government for change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/12">The article quotes Mr. Hughes as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/13" class="indent">&quot;Kyle's death was a tragedy not only for his family, but also for the community. It is disappointing that the strong feeling within the area was not reflected in the length of sentence given and I understand the concern people have that an offender can be released only a few short weeks after his court appearance.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/14" class="indent">I urge the community to express their feelings by supporting the campaign by the McDermott family to call for longer sentences for hit and run drivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/15" class="indent">Courts across the country have signally failed at times to adequately punish drivers who kill others.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/16" class="indent">Drivers have the responsibility to stop at the scene of collisions and ensure victims receive assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/17" class="indent">The law must ensure that those who fail to comply with those simple procedures are correctly punished.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/18">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-11">11 October 2006</phrase>, three weeks after the first article appeared, another article was published in the <i>South Yorkshire Times</i>, under the banner headline, &quot;Hit and run driver back behind bars&quot;. The article stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/19" class="indent">&quot;The hit and run driver who knocked down and killed seven-year-old Kyle McDermott is back behind bars after he was caught flouting his driving ban&mdash;just three weeks after his early release from prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/20" class="indent">Christopher Collins...knocked the youngster off his bike on a Mexborough road last year and drove off, leaving him to die. He served less than a third of a five-month jail term and was released from prison last month.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/21" class="indent">As part of his sentence Collins had been banned from driving for five years&mdash;but on Friday he was caught behind the wheel of a car in Doncaster.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/22">Collins was sentenced to a further four months in prison for driving three weeks after being released. I am sure that hon. Members can see why so many people in my constituency feel that there is no justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/23">That leads me to the first point of law that I want to raise with the Minister. Many drivers who are jailed for hit and runs are also banned from driving, but the ban operates while they are still in prison. My constituents and I think that a five-year ban should start only once an individual is released from prison, and I would like the Minister to comment on that when she sums up.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/24">Of course, hit-and-run accidents are not a new phenomenon. Indeed, I lost my cousin, Stephen Ennis, to a hit-and-run accident as long ago as 1978. Stephen's case is yet another example of why we need much stiffer penalties for hit-and-run accidents. The issue is best summed up by a newspaper cutting from the beginning of July 1978, with the headline &quot;Licensee who left injured rider lying in road jailed&quot;. The article continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/25" class="indent">&quot;A village pub licensee drove for 500 yards with a motor-cycle jammed beneath his car...and neither he nor his three passengers stopped to help the injured rider they left lying in the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/26" class="indent">Michael Bristowe then hid in a cupboard at a friend's house to avoid being found by police.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/27" class="indent">But when they did ferret him out he told them his car had been stolen from Barnsley earlier that night and someone else must have collided with the motor cyclist, Sheffield Crown Court heard.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/28" class="indent">Bristowe, 35-year-old licensee of the Lord Nelson, at Crigglestone, a village between Barnsley and Wakefield, was yesterday jailed for a month and banned from driving for two years after being found guilty by a jury of causing the death of Stephen Ennis by reckless driving....He was also told by Judge Cotton to pay the whole of his defence costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/29" class="indent">'In the interests of all other road users, the court is bound to take a serious view of this case,' said the judge&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/30">that was after he had sentenced Bristowe to prison for a month. The judge continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/31" class="indent">&quot;'And I'm satisfied you drove with your concentration impaired by a large amount of drink. Neither can I ignore your callousness in leaving behind that injured motor cyclist.'...Prosecuting counsel, Mr. Arthur Hutchinson said the accident happened in Wakefield Road outside Barnsley when Bristowe and three friends who were also drunk...were returning from a night out...They had been drinking first at Dodworth WMC and then at Chennell's Bar in Barnsley's town centre, where Bristowe's brother was the licensee.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/32" class="indent">The accident happened when Bristowe drove on the wrong side of traffic lights at the junction of Wakefield Road and Laithes Lane and collided with the motor cyclist.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/33" class="indent">After his arrest, Bristowe twice refused a breath test, but a blood test showed he'd got 227 mgs of alcohol in his blood&mdash;nearly three times above the permitted limit...Bristowe told the court he had drunk 12 bottles of Guinness that night, but was not drunk because he generally drank five pints of beer, sometimes more, when working behind the bar.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/34" class="indent">He was travelling no more than 30 mph and was misled by a 'road ahead closed' sign and by a line at the road workings.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/35" class="indent">'I saw no lights from the motor cycle, and although I felt a bump I thought this was from rubble on the road,' he said.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/36" class="indent">He also heard a scraping noise, but thought this was caused either by the exhaust trailing on the floor or by the car's wing dropping onto the wheel.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/37" class="indent">'I hid in the cupboard because I panicked. My behaviour that night was abominable and I stupidly lied to the police. I'm ashamed of myself&mdash;but I didn't drive recklessly,' he said.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/38">I know the devastating effect that Stephen's death had on the whole of my family, particularly my Auntie Harriet and Uncle Doug&mdash;who has since passed away&mdash;and Stephen's brother Dougie and his sister Coran. Steve was 25 when he died and a really good sportsman&mdash;particularly at rugby. He was three months younger than me and was in my class at Grimethorpe junior school. I certainly miss him a lot.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/39">It is no wonder that a Department for Transport survey conducted in 2005 showed that in cases where careless driving convictions were made, only 20 per cent. of victims and victims' families felt that justice had been served. Almost half the victims felt that the gap in penalties between dangerous and careless driving is too great. I know that the Minister will probably inform the Chamber that the Department is creating a new offence of causing death by careless driving, with a maximum sentence of five years, but, as I understand it, it will not specifically recognise in penalty terms a driver who is guilty of leaving the scene of a major accident. That is the main point that I would like to make in today's Adjournment debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/40">I shall turn briefly to the statistics. In 2002 in South Yorkshire there were two fatal road hit-and-run accidents. In 2006, that had trebled to six. Nationally, in 2002 there were 142 fatal hit-and-run accidents, and in 2006 the figure was exactly the same. In South Yorkshire in 2002, there were 530 hit-and-run accidents where someone was slightly or seriously injured, increasing to 566 such accidents in 2006. In England as a whole, there were 24,040 accidents where someone was injured by a hit-and-run driver, and that figure dropped to 19,046 by 2006. Those statistics from the Department for Transport show the state of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/41">The Minister will know that I tabled a question with her Department for answer on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-15">15 October</phrase>, which read:</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/42" class="indent">&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many drivers were prosecuted for being involved in fatal hit-and-run accidents in each of the last five years; and what the average length of sentence handed down was.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/43">I received the following reply from the Minister:</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/44" class="indent">&quot;While the Department for Transport monitors details of road traffic accidents including 'hit and run', this information is not linked with details of any subsequent prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/45" class="indent">Although the Court Proceedings Database held by my Department can provide sentencing data on the numbers of defendants convicted of motoring offences that cause the death of a person, the information held cannot distinguish hit and run incidents from those where the driver remained at the scene.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-10-15.750"><i>Official Report</i>, 15 October 2007; Vol. 464, c. 750W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/46">I suggest that she takes a look at that database with a view to being able to produce that information in future. It is important that we have an evidence base to show whether a person found guilty in a hit-and-run accident case receives a heavier sentence than otherwise. Will the Minister cover that point when she sums up?</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/47">I have often wondered why a person involved in a serious road accident would choose to drive off. As in my cousin Stephen's case, the driver often says in court, &quot;I panicked. I didn't know what to do&quot; and so on. Many of my constituents believe that many hit-and-run drivers have an ulterior motive&mdash;for example, those drivers' cars might not have been insured, taxed or tested. Equally, they feel in many cases, as in that of our Stephen, that the driver was drinking and that self-preservation kicked in.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/48">It would be interesting to know how many drivers guilty of a hit-and-run offence were also guilty of drink-driving, assuming that they were tracked down by the police in a matter of hours, as the person who killed Stephen was. It would also be interesting to know whether the number of hit-and-run accidents has increased since the breathalyser and the offence of drink-driving were introduced. I have the feeling that it probably has&mdash;I have no evidence base to prove it, but that is my feeling.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/49">Many previous debates on the subject in the House have become embroiled in the difference between careless driving and the more serious offence of dangerous driving. Needless to say, in hit-and-run accidents it is much more difficult to prove dangerous driving. I do not intend to become too embroiled in that point of law. The main legal point that I want to make is that because there is no direct correlation between leaving the scene of an accident and a more severe penalty, that may act as a perverse incentive to drivers with something to hide to leave the scene. Of course, I know that magistrates and juries can use their discretion to take that into account when sentencing, but that is not the same as having a compulsory minimum sentence for leaving the scene of an accident. My main point is that the Government should consider introducing such a compulsory minimum sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/50">I do not advocate a certain length of sentence. Some people say that there should be a minimum of three or five years, and some say that there should be a minimum of three years for careless driving and five years for dangerous driving. I know that Mrs. McDermott and many of my constituents in Mexborough advocate the application of the maximum penalty of 14 years for dangerous driving to all fatal hit-and-run drivers. That may be slightly excessive, but I shall be interested to hear what the Minister says.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.2/51">I simply wish to sow the seed in the Minister's mind to give this extremely important issue detailed consideration. We owe it to the likes of Kyle McDermott and his family to ensure that, in future, no other parents of fatal hit-and-run victims will feel that the person responsible for their son or daughter's death has got away with murder. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-05a.288.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" speakername="Christopher Fraser" colnum="288"  time="014:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071205/halltext/71205h0006.htm#07120550000507">
	<p pid="a.288.0/1">Before I pass comment, Mr. Williams, I wish to put on record that I have come from a Select Committee meeting at which I was the only Conservative member, and I must return to it. I hope that the Minister will forgive me for not being here for her winding-up speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> on securing this debate on a most important subject, which affects many constituencies, Members of Parliament and the people whom we represent across the country. It is a most devastating thing for a family to deal with, and the hon. Gentleman did extremely well to articulate the tragic example in his constituency, which is echoed in situations that I have faced in my own. In October, I contributed to a timely debate in this Chamber on road traffic accidents and young drivers. I focused specifically on the point that the hon. Gentleman has just made&mdash;sentencing for fatal hit-and-run drivers&mdash;and I am pleased to raise those points again today.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/3">Motorists who kill on the road while under the influence of alcohol or drugs currently face a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison whereas&mdash;this is the important part of the law&mdash;failing to stop at the scene carries a maximum sentence of just six months. I believe that that is an anomaly. I am not suggesting that every young person is a rogue and does things on the road that they should not, but an awful lot of young people drive around in the way described earlier, perhaps in untaxed and uninsured vehicles. Most importantly, a lot of young people know the law, and they know their rights. As it stands, the law effectively encourages those over the limit to drive off, leaving their victims injured or dying, in the hope that by the time the police catch up with them, they will have sobered up sufficiently to pass the relevant test and will therefore be sentenced for a lesser charge. That is a real problem, and it must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/4">During our debate in October, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase> was made patently aware of the issue by hon. Members from all parties. I do not think that the issue involves party politics. I have tabled questions about it during the past couple of years, because such accidents occur time and time again on the roads of my constituency in rural Norfolk. They are not quite accidents&mdash;some people say that they are murders, as someone is killed on the road when someone else is responsible. There is a technical point, as has been described, about someone who has caused an accident saying that they are innocent and how the court actually finds them. It is a great disgrace that the grief of bereaved families, which have so often lost a young family member who could have made an ample contribution to the community and society, is compounded by the fact that the person who perpetrated that crime, murder, accident or whatever it is called gets away relatively easily to lead their life again.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/5">During the past couple of years, I have read newspaper reports about some of the excuses that people give. There is no excuse for killing someone by driving recklessly&mdash;God forbid that it should happen to anybody in this House. Having said that, remorse is one thing, but the most important thing is that justice is served at the start of the process. A message must be sent out that we will not tolerate such behaviour. At the moment, the guidelines offer an incentive in the law for people to leave the scene of a crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/6">During the debate in October, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport told me that he would raise the matter with the Ministry of Justice. I hope that when the Minister responds, she will tell us what communication has taken place between the Department for Transport and the Ministry of Justice to deal with the issue, so that it can be dealt with effectively and put on the statute book in such a way that no one will be able to misunderstand the law or misuse it in their favour when such an incident happens. I look forward to reading, if not hearing, the Minister's response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-05a.289.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" speakername="Tom Clarke" colnum="289"  time="014:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071205/halltext/71205h0006.htm#07120550000508">
	<p pid="a.289.0/1">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase>&mdash;I agree with everything that he has said&mdash;I must apologise to you, Mr. Williams, and to the Chamber, as I must leave a little early, perhaps before this debate concludes. I join the hon. Gentleman in congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> on a moving speech. His speech was typical of his work as a greatly respected Member of the House&mdash;it was extremely well informed and came up with solutions. The solutions that my hon. Friend described are important, and all right hon. and hon. Members seem to agree that they are appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/2">My reason for speaking&mdash;I have had the opportunity to discuss the matter with my hon. Friend&mdash;relates to a case in my constituency that raises many comparisons with the tragic case that he has mentioned. Gillian Curran, a bright, vivacious young woman, was coming home from work just before Christmas a few short years ago. She had completed her Christmas shopping just the day before. When I last spoke to her parents, Sandra and Patrick, they told me that those presents and her room remain exactly as they were. Obviously, her sister, Nicola, was devastated. The community reflected on what took place and approached me in the way that my hon. Friend's constituents approached him. I presented a petition to the House that was signed by around 11,000 people, and I attended a debate in this Chamber. I am happy to acknowledge that many of the representations that I made were taken on board by the then Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, when he piloted the Road Safety Act 2006 through Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/3">The circumstances of the case are as follows. The young woman was returning from work in a Christmas rush and found herself in a tailback just outside the Hilton hotel in Bellshill. A driver, who was clearly driving too fast, hit her, and her car in turn hit the car in front. The situation ended tragically, with her fighting without success for her life&mdash;sadly, she passed away in the evening. On the evidence so far, life for that family will never be the same again. Although they are not looking for vengeance&mdash;they have told me that again and again&mdash;they find it unacceptable that, because of the ambiguity of legislation on careless driving and dangerous driving, the people who had to make a decision about a prosecution decided that the charge would be careless driving. The consequence was that the person responsible was fined &pound;500 and disqualified for six months. It was not possible to draw the attention of the court to the fact that a life was lost&mdash;the court was completely unaware of it. Clearly, that was not acceptable, and I therefore welcome the initiative of the then Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet, who sought to clarify that aspect of legislation which, rightly, if I may say, applies to the whole United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/4">Remembering that family and that lovely young woman, whose life was lost so early and who had so much to offer, her family, the community and Scotland's Campaign Against Irresponsible Driving take the view that notwithstanding the 2006 Act, which they welcomed, the matter has not yet been clarified to deal with that case and other cases, such as the one outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough. Something like nine people a day are killed on the roads. If that is still the case, the law throughout the United Kingdom ought to be absolutely clear. As my hon. Friend has said, it is not necessarily possible to set a minimum or maximum sentence&mdash;I am sure that the House would want to address that&mdash;but the court should at least have the right to know the circumstances of a case.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/5">The case in my constituency differs in a number of ways from the one outlined by my hon. Friend&mdash;there was no drink involved and the driver stayed at the scene of the accident&mdash;but, nevertheless, when there are cases such as the one that he has described, it is clearly wholly unacceptable that we, as a Parliament, have not yet addressed the reality that people face. Of all the constituency cases that I have dealt with over the years, none struck me with the same poignancy as that of Gillian Curran. As her parents have said on several occasions, we cannot bring Gillian back, but we have a responsibility to others&mdash;young people, certainly, with their lives ahead of them&mdash;as fellow citizens, who have the right to feel that they can use the streets and roads of our country in safety. If people act blatantly against the law, as we have heard about this afternoon&mdash;our constituents can describe many other such cases&mdash;they should clearly face the full penalty of the law. I therefore plead that legislation on road safety should reflect what happens on Britain's roads today and face up to the challenges of some of the less attractive aspects of modern Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/6">The House is being invited to look at the facts and to respond in order to remove any ambiguity and to ensure that if people misbehave, as many sadly do, and that leads to loss of life, the penalty should be paid. Parliament should do its utmost in the interests of road safety and of the people who use the streets and roads of our country.</p>

	<p pid="a.292.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> on securing the debate. I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> for their thoughtful contributions on this serious matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/2">For the record, Mr. Williams, I am a chairman of the all-party group on road safety. I am also chairman of an associate all-party group called Justice for Road Traffic Victims, which is sponsored by RoadPeace.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/3">I had an Adjournment debate on road safety seven years ago, and it is rather sad that today we are repeating the points that were argued then. However, I welcome the fact that the Government have introduced measures during the intervening years, which have taken us forward; however, there is still a long way to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/4">I deliberately do not use the phrase &quot;road accident&quot;, because crashes that result in injury or death are seldom accidents. They are normally the result of incompetent driving at one end of the spectrum and reckless driving at the other, with the latter often associated with excessive drinking.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/5">I believe that the single biggest step that we could take to reduce the number of road crashes would be to take tougher action against those who endanger lives through their driving, whether because of excessive speed, lack of care and attention, general bloody-mindedness&mdash;sometimes known as road rage&mdash;or, worst of all, driving under the influence of drink or drugs. Seven years ago, I welcomed a Government consultation paper on road traffic penalties, which proposed tougher action against motorists who drive dangerously, or at excessive speed, or while drunk. I invite the Minister to provide a progress report on what has happened since that report.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/6">I shall repeat a very telling example that I gave in the debate seven years ago, because it is an example of the way in which road deaths are treated as less important than any other form of involuntary death. That was set out in shocking and graphic detail on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-06">6 December 2000</phrase> in a four-page report in <i>The Sun</i><i>,</i><i></i>part of which read:</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/7" class="indent">&quot;Allan Jackson was 3 times over the limit when he ran down and killed 3 pals on the pavement. The sentence&mdash;Just 8 Years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/8">The report described how Jackson killed three young teachers as a result of his drunken-driving. Had he shot them or stabbed them to death, he would now be serving three life sentences for murder, but because he was a drunk-driver, and despite his having been banned twice for drink-driving convictions, the judge jailed him for just eight years&mdash;less than the maximum sentence, which is only 10 years. Given that he was jailed seven years ago for eight years, I can almost guarantee that, with remission, he is now out, despite having killed three people. What message does that send out? Quite simply, the message is this: if someone is killed in a road crash, the guilty person is treated more leniently than if he had killed using a weapon other than a car driven recklessly.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/9">In 2000, before my Adjournment debate, I took up a case on behalf of a young father whose wife had been killed, leaving him with three young sons to bring up, although I should stress that the driver who killed his wife was not a drink-driver. In meetings with the Solicitor-General and various departmental officials at that time, I asked for four things, one of which was the creation of a new offence of causing death by driving negligently; the court would determine the severity of the case and the sentence. To a large extent, that request has been met, although the measure has yet to be implemented. At least the Government took my request on board, which I appreciate. They have not used my terminology; nevertheless, the spirit is the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/10">My second request was for the referral to the Crown Court, for trial by jury, of all magistrates court cases involving a road crash death, and for sentencing by a judge even in cases where a guilty plea is entered. My third request was immediately to suspend the licence of any driver involved in a fatal crash, pending a medical inspection to determine whether they have a health condition that might affect driving. The final request was to provide for an extension beyond the current six-month legal limit during which alternative charges can be introduced if further evidence emerges, either from the defence or prosecution, that affects the original charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/11">A national crusade against the number of road crashes is needed. The only sure way to reduce road deaths and injuries is for civilised society to regard those who drive at speed, fail to stop after an accident&mdash;&quot;accident&quot; is the legal term&mdash;or drink and drive in exactly the same way as we regard those who carry out assaults. We need to shame those responsible as though they were thugs&mdash;thugs on wheels. The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk referred to murder on our roads. We regard assault as unacceptable and we need to change attitudes so that those who endanger others through their driving are likewise condemned for their irresponsible behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/12">Although there is a general condemnation of those who drive while under the influence of drink or drugs, not all drivers have got the message, and the police are having to take increasing numbers of breath tests. When responding to that debate seven years ago, the then Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1848" name="Keith Hill">the right hon. Member for Streatham (Keith Hill)</phrase>, made reference to the Government's consultation paper on penalties for road traffic offences, and specifically referred to the</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/13" class="indent">&quot;robust package of measures to reduce drink driving.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/14">He said that the review had</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/15" class="indent">&quot;specifically considered raising the minimum disqualification period for first-time, high-risk offenders from one year to two and making drink driving an offence for which a convicted driver has to retake the driving test.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/16">I would welcome an update this afternoon. Are the police now encouraged to</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/17" class="indent">&quot;breath-test in locations where they suspect drink-driving to be taking place, without having to have grounds for suspicion in each individual case.&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/18">He acknowledged,</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/19" class="indent">&quot;That is not random breath testing, but it will allow the police to take a more targeted, intelligence-led approach to that branch of enforcement.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2000-12-19.338"><i>Official Report</i>, 19 December 2000; Vol. 360, c. 338</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/20">I am most grateful to Brake, the road safety charity, for providing a briefing for this afternoon. It starts by telling me:</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/21" class="indent">&quot;incredibly, there is currently NO specific charge for killing or injuring someone in a 'hit and run', when the driver leaves the scene.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/22">We have heard graphic examples this afternoon of how such incidents are increasing. According to the Department for Transport's report &quot;Road Casualties Great Britain: 2006&quot;, the number of people who are leaving the scene of a hit-and-run involving fatal, serious and slight injuries has increased in the past decade from 18,357 to 21,006, so it is a growing problem. More than one in 10&mdash;11 per cent.&mdash;of deaths and injury crashes on our roads involve a hit-and-run driver.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/23">At the moment, the prosecutors have to prove that the standard of driving was far below the standard of a careful and competent driver, but if the person has left the scene, that is increasingly almost impossible to prove. The hon. Member for Wellingborough makes a good point, which Brake certainly endorses, that there should be a specific charge for killing or injuring someone in a hit-and-run. If someone leaves the scene and there is a serious injury or fatality, that should be considered a crime in its own right. The courts should be able to punish such offenders, because they clearly have no respect for the law or for the lives that they devastate. We must have tougher prison sentences.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/24">The principle of prosecuting a driver whose illegal behaviour is linked to a death, regardless of the standard of driving, can be seen in the welcome new charge of causing death while driving while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured, as set out in the Road Safety Act 2006. If I understood her intervention correctly, the Minister said that that provision was likely to be introduced or to commence some time early in the new year. I hope that it is&mdash;I and other hon. Members will table questions in the new year if that has not come to pass.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/25">We need a change in the law to ensure that killer drivers do not escape justice, and to act as a disincentive to others from leaving the scene of a crash. We need a charge for leaving the scene of a crash after causing death or serious injury by driving. Brake suggests that that could be a separate charge, or perhaps an amendment to the existing charge of causing death while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured. The charge would carry a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment, which is equivalent to the maximum penalty for causing death by dangerous driving. In addition, I certainly endorse the point made by the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough that when a driver is disqualified and sent to prison, the disqualification should start on the day that they are released from prison, not while they are serving prison sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.2/26">I have already mentioned that in the last year for which figures have been published, 2006, there were 21,006 crashes resulting in death and injury that involved a hit-and-run driver. That is a shocking statistic by any standard, and I hope that today's debate will lead to the Government taking further action.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-05a.297.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" speakername="David Burrowes" colnum="297"  time="015:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071205/halltext/71205h0007.htm#07120550000515">
	<p pid="a.297.1/1">Yes. Perhaps we can hear from the Minister whether that practice could be adopted elsewhere. I was encouraged by the Director of Public Prosecutions saying that the CPS is taking the issue very seriously and is not now looking at the easy option. We need to see whether that is being followed through out in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> rightly raised the tragic loss of Alexine Melnik. That loss, together with that of Kyle McDermott and others, will not be in vain. That is the point of this debate: such deaths should not be in vain but should lead to changes. They have led to changes through the Road Safety Act 2006, but the concern today is that there are still significant gaps. As described by my hon. Friend, hit and run is a horrible, horrendous offence. We should not be dealing with the lower end of sentencing. We should be able to give the courts the full range of options so that they can deal appropriately with the particular circumstances of a failure to stop.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/3">All hon. Members have tragic cases in our constituencies on which we campaign. Soon after I was elected, Abigail Moore, who was aged 25 and from Hadley Wood, tragically lost her life as a result of a hit and run accident in Hackney. There was also the case of Livia Galli-Atkinson. My predecessor as MP for Enfield, Southgate, Stephen Twigg, passionately championed the concerns of the Galli-Atkinson family. Livia's death was not the result of a hit and run accident but was caused by dangerous driving. A paltry fine of &pound;2,000 was imposed following that incident on <phrase class="date" code="1998-01-12">12 January 1998</phrase>. It is the efforts of the Galli-Atkinson family, the Melnik family, the McDermott family and others that bring us here to seek to ensure that road safety is taken extremely seriously and is not the poor relation when it comes to criminal justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/4">Let us consider the passage of the Road Safety Bill, which is now on the statute book. There was a missed opportunity in that respect. I sought to table an amendment to create a new offence that would properly recognise the importance of allowing failure to stop offences to be dealt with on an either-way basis&mdash;either in the magistrates court or in the Crown court. Sadly, sufficient time was not given to the measure in Committee and on Report to allow consideration of what hon. Members are saying today.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/5">However, this cause is being championed. I mentioned the Galli-Atkinson family, who have instigated the Livia award, which commends the service provided by police officers investigating these crimes on a daily basis. It is designed to commend exceptional service for road crash victims and for the cause of justice. We met last month to give awards to many officers in the Metropolitan police for their efforts. At that gathering, it was significant that, time and again, senior police officers, while accepting their awards for dedicated service, mentioned their concern that hit and run incidents and failing to stop offences were not being given due regard and attracting the penalties that they merited. Lord Simon, as well as myself and others, pointed out the need to tackle such offences and deal with them properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/6">The Livia award panel, on which were senior Crown prosecutors, former chiefs of the operational command unit of the Metropolitan police, senior solicitors, journalists and myself, made representations to the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>, on tackling the matter and the need for a proper penalty for failing to stop at the scene of an accident. His response was similar to that made in the Committee on the Road Safety Act 2006. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Deliberately fleeing the scene of an accident to avoid prosecution is a cowardly and deplorable act that must not be allowed to go unpunished. However, it would be equally wrong to assume that because a driver did not stop they must be deliberately seeking to evade prosecution. The driver may be in shock and it would not seem sensible for the law to deter him subsequently from reporting the incident and taking responsibility for it. Equally, the driver's fault may be minimal or non-existent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/8">The example that has been given&mdash;the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" name="Maria Eagle">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle)</phrase> might give a similar one today&mdash;is of a lorry driver who goes along a narrow road and does not realise that he has caused an accident, and goes on his way without knowledge. The Under-Secretary of State for Transport wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/9" class="indent">&quot;In such cases a bad driving offence would not apply and the current penalty of up to six months in prison for failing to stop would seem to be about right.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/10">There may well be circumstances in which it is right, but there are many others, as we have heard, in which it is plainly wrong and an injustice. We need to ensure that there are options on the statute book and that we are not limited to a summary-only offence, so that it can be dealt with as an either-way matter and therefore at the Crown court. I do not need to go into different sentencing levels, as the point has been well made by hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/11">Sadly, I did not have the opportunity during the passage of the Road Safety Act to go through current legislation to see whether the situation of people who do not know that they have caused an accident is covered. Section 170 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 properly requires a driver to stop their vehicle if a road traffic accident has occurred and there has been either personal injury or damage. That duty on the driver applies only if he knows that the accident has occurred. In the case of Harding <i>v. </i>Price in 1948, it was established that the prosecution must prove that the driver knew of the accident or ought reasonably to have known it. In 1970, the case of Hansen <i>v. </i>Powell<i></i>involved a lorry driver. Convictions were quashed because the driver's knowledge was a necessary ingredient of an offence. Case law and statute therefore already make that point and deal with the Minister's concerns, which have previously been voiced, about those who do not realise that they have been involved in an accident.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/12">We need to deal with the horrendous cases in which the driver plainly knew and sought to evade justice. We have all seen cases in our constituencies, and I have seen them in court, in which the offender deliberately did not stop and, regardless of their motives, may well have denied the victim urgent medical assistance, which might have led to their dying on the streets. In other cases, they may prevent the prosecution from properly identifying them. There are ways and means of doing that: number plates might be cloned through the internet or in other ways, which is not currently barred. They may have other ingenious ways of avoiding identification, but they may well do it simply by driving off and then evading justice, perhaps through the road traffic offences of having no insurance or licence. The offences that they are avoiding may be on a minor scale, or much more serious if they have alcohol in their system or there are other serious driving offences involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/13">We heard in the Livia award process from police officers who do sterling work in serving justice and victims that, time and time again, they are prevented from dealing speedily and properly with the concern of victims and their families by people hitting and running and then trying to flee justice. The time that it takes the police to identify the offender and bring them to justice is of great concern to them. They, and hon. Members, are concerned that there should be a proper deterrent so that people know that, if they fail to stop, they may well face a sanction that is not just six months but could be increased.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/14">I would ask the Minister particularly to address the issue of guidance. Yes, the guidance to magistrates makes it clear that failure to stop is now an imprisonable offence under the 1991 legislation, but sentences of imprisonment are rarely imposed for failure to stop. The court and the prosecution look to the bad driving offences rather than at the failure to stop and the merits of the offence. It should attract a severe penalty in certain circumstances. Guidance indicates that it will invariably be dealt with by way of a financial penalty and penalty points rather than any custodial sentence. It is important that that is addressed urgently.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/15">It is also important that victims' expectations are dealt with. They can be poorly managed. Brake made the point that there is often a disparity between sentencing and expectations. Victims see a sentence of five months and think that that is far too short for the loss of their loved one. It is impossible to compensate for that loss through a sentence, but nevertheless it is important to manage those expectations well and, not least, to have a clear and honest sentence. When a sentence of imprisonment is imposed, it is important that victims and their families know that it will be served. If a sentence of five months is given but the person comes out after a matter of weeks, the families see that and do not understand it. It is important that when a sentence is imposed by the court the public know that it will be properly served. It is important that sentences are explained.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/16">I invite the Minister to take up the question raised by the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough about the driving disqualification. Should it run at the time that the sentence is imposed, concurrently, so that people serve their ban in prison? That can mean that they come out and, soon after, are driving on the streets in the same community. That raises great concerns. Should the disqualification period begin after their release from prison?</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/17">The understandable point of a driving disqualification is to protect the public. Obviously, that does not make sense: how are the public protected by a driving qualification that has been served in prison? However, as I understand it, Court of Appeal guidance on disqualification periods, particularly lengthy ones, is on the side of offender rehabilitation. Once they have finished their term of imprisonment, the guidance considers disqualification for a lengthy period to be onerous. There is reference to considering a lesser disqualification period when it is allied to a sentence of imprisonment, in order to be on the side of rehabilitating an offender once they are in the community. It is important that the Minister give careful thought to the guidance that courts use when dealing with sentences for those who will receive a custodial sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.1/18">I want to give the Minister ample opportunity to reply to all the concerns raised by hon. Members. It is important to seek to plug the gap. I spoke to the Minister who took the Road Safety Bill through Parliament&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>&mdash;on the evening after the Livia award last year. He said that when the ink is hardly dry on the last Road Safety Act, everyone jumps up and down with extra measures for the next one. Nevertheless, the point was raised before and during the passage of the 2006 Act, and it will not go away. I know that hon. Members will not let it go away. It is important that we have answers to fill this important gap and deal with the ambiguity. For the sake of Kyle McDermott and all those others who have been mentioned today, I ask the Minister to respond in full.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.0/1">We all welcome the fact that trends are going down, but the debate is about sentencing for fatal hit and run accidents, and I understand that official Government statistics show an increase of between 2,000 and 3,000 in the number of hit and run incidents involving death and injury in the past decade. That is therefore an area of growth, which is what we should be addressing.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is correct in that the hit and run element is an important issue. My information is that 11 per cent. of all reported personal injury road accidents involve at least one hit and run driver or rider. That is a significant percentage of cases in which people flee and seek to evade responsibility, for whatever reason. I do not want to say that it is always for a bad reason, although obviously it frequently is. There may always be mitigating circumstances. I accept, as hon. Members have said, that there are blatant examples in which the reason for flight is probably to evade responsibility and minimise the impact on the driver.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.2/1">The trend is important. It is increasing in respect of hit and runs, and the number of cases of people being left to die is increasing&mdash;from 113 fatal crashes in 1977 to 152 in 2006, an increase of 35 per cent. It is important to focus on the right trend.</p>

	<p pid="a.302.0/1">I accept that. It is also important to place matters in the context of the fact that there is an increasing focus on such crimes as a result of which society in general is beginning to regard them as more important. There is now much more social disapproval of both drunk driving and people getting away with such behaviour. That increasing disapproval assists policy makers and the Government in our job of dealing with the higher end of the incidents to which my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough has brought to the attention of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/2">My hon. Friend asked why a driving ban is frequently served concurrently with a sentence of imprisonment, an issue to which the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate also referred. I understand my hon. Friend's point. It seems nonsensical in many ways for someone to serve a driving ban when they cannot drive because they are locked up. I intend to have a think about the problem and discuss it with my colleagues at the Department for Transport and the Home Office who have responsibilities and interests in such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/3">I want to stress that matters are not always as simple as they seem. The hon. Gentleman said that rehabilitation is a common issue in sentencing, and that lesser offences are overtaken by more serious offences, so imprisonment would be considered more seriously. There are circumstances in which those in prison can be released on temporary licence as part of their rehabilitation. People in open prison can be released and get jobs as part of their rehabilitation into the community. It might then be sensible for the ban to be served concurrently because we would not would want a chap like Mr. Collins out on temporary licence and be able to drive, and banned only from driving when he properly finished his sentence. There are always difficulties in taking a blanket approach, but I am certainly happy to talk further with colleagues in the Government and officials about what, if anything, could be done and whether such a proposal would be a sensible way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough also mentioned Ministry of Justice statistics. He made the reasonable statement that we need to be able to tie in the offences with the sentences, otherwise it is difficult to know the trends. I accept that point, but if only that were easy to do. It is a difficult issue, and again I cannot promise to make a difference to the position quickly, but I hear his point about the statistics and see the sense in his argument. However, our data on sentencing often come from the courts, and it is not possible collect everything that we want and tie it to individuals. Our systems of data collection are not always as sophisticated as we would wish. I am certainly willing to have another look at the matter, but I cannot promise to come back swiftly with an all singing, all dancing, joined-up statistics arrangement that will enable us to provide him with what he wants. I do, of course, understand his point.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/5">My hon. Friend also asked about leaving the scene of an accident. Brake and hon. Members have said that the sentences for failing to stop or leaving the scene of an accident are less than those for substantive driving offences, especially those that cause death by dangerous driving. The change in the law under the 2006 Act, which everybody has welcomed, is a substantial improvement. Everybody has accepted that. The new offence of causing death by careless driving, and the implementation of the 2006 Act's provisions shortly, will plug a significant gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/6">I shall say a little more than in my intervention about when that will happen and why it has not happened yet. It is important that the Sentencing Guidelines Council should be able to issue its guidelines before the offence is commenced. All that that will require is a commencement order, but the danger of doing so before receiving substantive, carefully thought through and properly consulted on guidance is that sentencers might be more lenient, or might take one view rather than another. We want to ensure that the guidance is issued before sentencers get their hands on the offence as an option. I hope that all hon. Members see the importance of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/7">The Sentencing Guidelines Council goes through a specific process, including proper consultation&mdash;education of sentencers is also a part&mdash;before it issues guidelines. I hope that that will happen earlier rather than later in the new year, but I cannot give a date, as it is not in my power to tell the Sentencing Guidelines Council precisely when it must finish its job. It is engaged, however, and as soon as it has finished it is our intention to commence the offences and give the courts and sentencers the option of a five-year sentence for causing death by careless driving. That will make a significant difference and improvement, as everyone who spoke acknowledged. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase> had some engagement on the matter with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase> at an awards ceremony, apparently&mdash;I am sure that that is true. It is certainly important for us to see what happens once the offence is commenced.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/8">I take on board the points made about the remaining perceived gap created by the lack of a specific sentence for fleeing the scene after somebody has been injured or killed in a hit and run. I can see the points made with examples by my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough and others. As the criminal law is kept under constant review&mdash;I can confirm that, being in the Ministry of Justice&mdash;it is certainly something that my policy making colleagues and I, as well as Ministers and officials from the Home Office and the Department for Transport, will want to look at. Hon. Members are right to raise the matter and to say, &quot;Look here, this is still an issue.&quot; It is also important to see what use sentencers can make of the new law and how much of an issue remains in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/9">Although some Members have suggested that the six-month sentence for failing to stop is an incentive to leave the scene of an accident, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> said, the alternative view is that if there is a five, eight, 10 or 14-year sentence for doing so, that itself could be more of an incentive to flee. I do not suppose that anyone flees thinking that they will be picked up later; they flee to escape the consequences of their actions, for whatever reason. There is a question whether a higher available sentence than six months would make it more or less likely that people would flee. One suspects that different people would react in different ways.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, and for her kind remarks and those of other Members on my having secured this debate. I accept her point. We do not want totally to reverse what I described as a perverse incentive to leave the scene of a crime in order to avoid a bigger sentence. However, we do not want to go too far the other way. I accept that that is a very good point. I said that for the one in five people involved in hit and run accidents, the disparity between careless and dangerous driving is too big. There is a feeling on the streets that people are literally getting away with murder. We as a Government must take cognisance of that fact.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.0/1">If I speak for longer than three minutes, will you notify me, Mr. Williams? I want the Minister to have plenty of time to reply to the debate. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> is very knowledgeable about this matter and covered the vast majority of points that I wanted to make. I thank him for giving me some of his time&mdash;it is unusual for hon. Members to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/2">I wish to speak specifically about Border Television. It does not do only what its name suggests, because while it covers the borders between England and Scotland, it takes in a third country: the Isle of Man. To that extent, the service is unique among those for the ITV regions. It is also important to me because its studios are in my constituency and it employs nearly 100 people in well paid jobs. However, I am not concerned about only the jobs. We have a good station that is appreciated by the people in the area. No other station in the country has a higher percentage of possible viewers watching the local news, but that might be destroyed. There is a perception that if the amalgamation goes ahead, programmes will be broadcast from Newcastle, probably from the Gateshead studio. The BBC does that&mdash;its programmes are broadcast from there to Carlisle and the rest of the north of Cumbria&mdash;but it does not get such good viewing figures. In fact, they are only just about acceptable. We cannot seriously consider sending news from Newcastle to Stranraer, Douglas on the Isle of Man and the southern part of Cumbria. That is not possible and it would not be acceptable. The people in Stranraer will tut and will not accept that whatsoever.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> intervened earlier about Scottish football. The worry that we have in our area is that all that we might get could be Granada and Manchester United. The people in Dumfries would much sooner be watching Queen of the South than either Rangers or Celtic. We have a unique station; it works well, and the reality is that it has always been profitable. It was profitable when it was taken over, which was not so long ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/4">When I asked Michael Grade how much would be saved by getting rid of Border Television, the answer was, &quot;I'm not going to tell you.&quot; In a further meeting, he said, &quot;I will tell Ofcom, but I am not making this matter public.&quot; I suspect that he is saying that because the amount is very small.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/5">There is a massive campaign in the borders to save Border Television. I attended the switching on of the Christmas lights in Carlisle, and thousands of people were signing postcards to send to Ofcom. I know that the same has happened in Dumfries and throughout the rest of the region. There will be a rolling campaign. I think that there will probably be more letters and more support from the Border television region than anywhere else in the country. We do not want to lose the uniqueness of the area. We do not want to be joined with the south, if that is the option&mdash;the people of southern Scotland certainly do not want to joined with the rest of the area&mdash;because we believe that we will never get mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/6">For example, Barrow-in-Furness, which is in the Granada region, has been mentioned 13 times on Granada Television in the past three months. The Isle of Man, which is covered by Border Television, has been mentioned 83 times. The reality is that we have a good station, and we are going to fight for it. Ofcom should listen. ITV signed a contract, and we should keep it to that contract.</p>

	<p pid="a.309.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> on securing the debate. I was not here when he secured the debate three years ago, but I am delighted to respond to him today.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/2">I want to deal with the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase>, as I have an answer for him. I have been told that the European championship finals in 2008 will be on both BBC and ITV. The issue has been confused by Scotland's World cup qualifiers, where the home games are on Sky and the away matches are on Setanta. That is because the qualifiers are not listed as a universal sports event, but I have been told that it is our intention to review the list of sporting events around 2008-09, and we will no doubt take on board his comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1484" name="Eric Martlew">the Member for Carlisle (Mr. Martlew)</phrase> made a strong case on behalf of his constituents and Border Television&mdash;I know that that issue is contentious. He emphasised both the popularity of the channel and the unique role that it plays for his constituents. I am sure that Ofcom will take seriously his representations, and those of his constituents, if they respond directly to Ofcom in the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Selby knows that the Government are committed to retaining a strong regional dimension to public service broadcasting, reflecting the UK's cultural traditions and meeting the needs of diverse communities. The commitment can be broken down into two separate policy goals, which I am sure that he shares. One is that programmes are made for the regions; the other is ensuring that programmes are made in the regions. Both are important, which is why we hard-wired a regional dimension into the Communications Act 2003. As a result, the 2003 Act facilitates the development of a critical mass of production embedded outside London and the M25 area, and it ensures that broadcasters continue to invest time and money in producing high quality programming for the regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/5">BBC and ITV offer programmes made in and for viewers' regions, and ITV, Channel 4 and Five are required to produce a proportion of programmes outside the M25&mdash;indeed, 51 per cent. of ITV's spend and 58 per cent. of its hours are in the regions. ITV claims that it carries 5,000 hours of regional programming each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/6">The key theme of today's debate is the regional programming dimension, which my hon. Friend emphasised. As I think we all appreciate, that dimension has provided ITV's unique appeal and has been one of the reasons for its success as far back as its launch in 1955. I think that the BBC responded by killing off Grace Archer&mdash;those of us who are old enough might remember it&mdash;but even that did not capture the same audiences as today's. One of the reasons why ITV's regional programming has been successful is its distinctive voice. Its services are seen as the region having its own conversation, rather than as London or the metropolis talking to the regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/7">I agree with my hon. Friend's independent research&mdash;people really value their regional programmes. The weekly reach of any regional programme, whatever research is considered, is always greater than that of any commercial radio or television station. He is quite right to draw attention to such programmes' popularity and importance in people's lives. He is also right that competition from ITV forced the BBC to respond and change.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/8">It would be wrong to think narrowly of regional programming as the regions talking to themselves. Regional programming should cater to regional interests and communities of interest, but that does not mean that it should not reflect the regions to the nation as a whole. Much programming does that&mdash;programmes such as &quot;Emmerdale&quot; or &quot;Coronation Street&quot; have been highly successful in that genre. However, regional news constitutes the vast majority of ITV's regional output in terms of both volume and cost. ITV spends more than &pound;100 million a year on its regional provision alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/9">The key question, which my hon. Friend addressed, is how sustainable such expenditure is in the light of increasing competition from digital and multi-channel television and new media. Mingled with the impact on ITV's falling advertising revenues, that is a challenge to the viability and sustainability of ITV's traditional funding model. ITV's total revenue in 2006 was &pound;1.6 billion, down from an all-time high of &pound;1.9 billion in 2000. My hon. Friend suggested that Ofcom should look again at the constraints on advertising built into ITV contracts' rights renewal mechanism. No doubt Ofcom and others watching the proceedings in this Chamber will consider it as a possible issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.313.1/1">I was pleased to secure the debate, which gives me the opportunity to raise some specific constituency issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/2">I am fortunate to have lived for more than 30 years in a beautiful part of the country, and even more fortunate to have the privilege of representing the area. My constituency is characterised by the fact that almost every part is within 5 km of specially protected heathland&mdash;indeed, much of it is within 400 m. For part of the debate, I shall concentrate on the Purbeck part of my constituency. The ratio of house prices to wages in Purbeck has been shown to be the sixth highest in the country and the highest outside the London boroughs. The proportion of second homes in Purbeck is 6.9 per cent. and the Purbeck Housing Trust has a stock of only about 1,600 dwellings. It is obvious that young people and others on low incomes experience great difficulty in finding suitable accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/3">The first issue I wish to raise is the impact of Natural England's policies on some of my constituents. Natural England is of course an unelected body, and many residents are concerned about the scale of its power and the democratic deficit. I should point out that I live within 5 km of protected heathland but further than 400 m away. I should also like to tell the Minister that during my political career, spanning more than 21 years, I have fought to protect and enhance local heathland.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/4">In 2006, Dorset local authorities informed applicants for residential dwellings within 5 km of protected heathland that their proposals could not be approved until a solution was found that would mitigate any impacts. An interim solution had to be put together fairly quickly because it was clearly impractical to have virtually no development allowable in Poole or Dorset. All the councils involved have worked together with Natural England and have agreed an interim policy, which permits residential development within the 400 m to 5 km band, provided that mitigating measures are agreed. As the Minister wrote to me in a parliamentary answer:</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/5" class="indent">&quot;The boroughs of Poole, Bournemouth, and Christchurch, together with East Dorset and Purbeck district councils have agreed to develop a long-term strategy for the protection of designated heathlands&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/6">He went on that that should allow</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/7" class="indent">&quot;for more detailed consideration of mechanisms and measures to ensure the appropriate and necessary mitigation of residential development proposed to 2026.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-11-21.887"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 November 2007; Vol. 467, c. 887W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/8">My concern is that there will probably be no movement on the restriction on small-scale applications within the 400 m band. If Natural England says, &quot;No,&quot; that will be it, however much consultation is carried out. I understand the logic behind the 400 m rule; it is simple, clear, and easy to apply&mdash;indeed, I suspect it makes life easier for local planning officers: just say no. I emphasise that I agree with the need to protect our wonderful heathland. However, I want to put the cases of just two of my constituents. I could recount many more.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/9">A young man with a baby and a wife, living with his parents, bought a plot with a small bungalow on it that could accommodate two dwellings. The idea was that he and his brother could build two properties and house themselves in the area in which they wish to remain. He started to deal with the local planning authority in March 2006, when an indication was given that support would be given to the replacement of one dwelling with two. I do not have any strict views on back garden development. I think that every case needs to be considered on its own merits. I do not go out campaigning against such developments, but we need to ensure that each development is right. Without any preconceptions about whether the planning application was good or not, there was an indication on the subject of the two dwellings.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/10">My constituent incurred the expense of a flood risk assessment and an arboricultural assessment. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October</phrase>, it was requested that he have a bat survey carried out. In a letter at that time, Natural England considered that the proposal would not have a significant effect on the interest features of the site of special scientific interest. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-20">20 October</phrase>&mdash;just 11 days later&mdash;Natural England wrote to say that it did object, and, in essence, the 400 m rule was applied. My constituent continues to live with his family, and neither he nor his brother have a house.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/11">In Corfe Mullen, east Dorset, a couple coming up to retirement, who were not particularly well off, had an informal viewing by East Dorset district council, and informal advice was given by letter that there was a reasonable prospect of obtaining permission for a second dwelling on their site. They saw it as their pension fund. They submitted plans on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-24">24 February 2006</phrase>, which were refused on the grounds of scale and bulk, so they submitted further plans in July 2006. At no time were they informed of potential objections from Natural England. They first learned on a visit to the planning office on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-27">27 August 2006</phrase> that the 400 m line went down the middle of the proposed plot.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/12">I am aware that larger builders and building concerns keep their planning permissions live and build when they wish, so the local authority cannot afford to stop their planning permissions. Instead conditions are put on the permission, such as no cats. That is a pretty useless condition, but that was how it is handled for sophisticated people who know how to handle the planning system. In one case of a potentially big development, it has been suggested to me that although part of the proposal lies within the 400 m limit, enough money will be offered that it will be considered exceptional circumstances. I put it to the House that the system is a blunt instrument for ordinary people, and there should be some flexibility, even if the starting point is a presumption against development.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/13">Natural England has pointed out to me that the 400 m zone has been supported by planning inspectors in appeal cases, but to me that is just indicative of the power that Natural England wields. I hope that the Government can set out some guidelines so that it is at least possible to have case-by-case judgment. My constituents are being told by their respective councils that they have no hope of getting planning permission. One of them went to visit the local office of Natural England, where the officer said that the final word was not for them but for the local council. They are playing games. It was not a pleasant experience and my constituent was given no hope that there would be any movement.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/14">I have questioned with all the planning authorities concerned whether the 400 m rule will put further pressure on our valuable green belt&mdash;we have some of that in addition to the heathland that is designated green belt. Each reply stated that only a modest number of houses would be built on infill sites in the 400 m zone, apart from one large site in Poole. Why cannot a more sophisticated approach be taken, examining individual settlements to work out how much development is being halted and whether the impact of that development would be greater than expanding the size of existing houses, which would be allowable? The two cases that I have mentioned were on the outer limits of the zone, right in the middle of heavily populated residential areas, and in one case, the distance from heathland was 400 m as the crow flies. How easy it would be to access heathland from there must surely be considered, rather than just a straight measurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/15">I wish to comment briefly on the south-west regional spatial strategy, the final report on which we are awaiting. Again, there is a democratic deficit. In May and June this year there was examination in public, at which, to my knowledge, no Members of Parliament were allowed to go and talk. I find that incredible when one has been elected by a large number of people. My constituents expected me to be there to speak, but I wrote three times and each time was refused. There are proposals that would affect the green belt in my constituency&mdash;700 homes are proposed in a beautiful valley, which local residents do not want to lose. If affordable housing for local young people was being built, the reaction might be slightly different, but by the time the infrastructure is put in&mdash;anybody who has been to Dorset will know what our roads are like&mdash;there will be very little money to provide the housing that is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/16">As one can imagine, being a young person looking for housing in Purbeck is very difficult. I have had a number of cases in which a single mother, or single parent, have been seeking housing. Because supply is so tight and because it takes such a long time, single parents cannot be offered housing near to their extended family. Surely it is important to take the extended family into account. Why is not proximity to the extended family within the criteria for allocating houses? Because of the constraints on building, it is not possible to build more houses in areas in which most people need to be in order to be near to their mother or grandmother.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/17">To help the situation, a councillor and I have suggested allowing our housing trust to buy existing houses that come on the market, particularly former council houses because they are a bit cheaper. It has been demonstrated to us that that will not stack up in money terms. It only makes sense to use the amount of money that is available to a housing trust to buy new build. New build in Purbeck is in way out places such as Bovington, where there is no public transport. It is not helping the cohesion of the family if we cannot have the flexibility to produce innovative solutions. I want consideration to be given to the monetary position, because it makes sense to buy existing houses in order to keep a family together and enable them to support each other.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/18">Another concern is the number of flats that are being developed in Poole and right across the south coast. Our local council says that it is the Government's fault that so many flats are being granted permission and that nothing can be done about it. People who drop into my surgeries often talk about the number of flats being built everywhere. I am not going to spend a lot of time talking about this&mdash;I should declare that the owner of the plot next door to me had an application to build flats, but it has been withdrawn, and there is not an application at the moment. However, this potential loss of family houses is of concern to my constituents. We are not getting a balance. Figures show that of all the new dwellings in Poole, 70 per cent. are flats, which is way over the allocation. Something is wrong either at Government level or in the processes set at local level, but we are not getting a balance in the development that is allowed.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/19">I have raised a range housing and planning issues, but they are issues that are coming up time and again in my surgeries, and I really wanted the opportunity to discuss them publicly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-05a.316.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="316"  time="016:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071205/halltext/71205h0010.htm#07120550000532">
	<p pid="a.316.0/1">It is pleasure to be serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Williams.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> on securing this debate on planning and housing in her constituency. She is right to say that it is a vital issue, not just in her constituency, but in every constituency in the country. We work together really well on the Public Accounts Committee. I have a lot of time and affection for the hon. Lady. However, I am afraid that I will have to disappoint her on a number of points today. She will understand that I will not be able to go into detail on a lot of her concerns, particularly with regard to the regional spatial strategy and individual planning applications. I do not want to prejudice in any way the impartiality of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State should the proposals for the regional spatial strategy come before her at a later date, and I know that the hon. Lady will accept that.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/3">The draft regional spatial strategy for the south-west, based on the detailed proposals made by the relevant Dorset authorities, identified potential for the urban areas of Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch to provide about 29,000 additional dwellings by 2026. We now await the recommendations of the independent panel that carried out the examination in public of the draft regional spatial strategy earlier this year. However, I reiterate to the hon. Lady that I cannot, of course, comment or speculate further on what might arise from that until the panel report is published.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/4">The hon. Lady said that, as an MP, she was not allowed to appear at the examination in public. I point out to her that anyone can attend such sessions, because they are held in public. However, given that EIPs are concerned with discussing selected matters, the decision on whom to invite as participants is made by the panel and is based on representations made to it. It is for the panel to explain why they ask certain people to appear and not others. I hope that that clarifies the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/5">On the national perspective, we need to rise to the challenge of making new housing affordable, which is why the Government announced that we will invest &pound;8 billion to increase the amount of affordable housing over the next three years&mdash;a &pound;3 billion increase on the last comprehensive spending review period. By 2010-11, we aim to be delivering more than 70,000 affordable new homes a year. The wider aims are for 2 million new homes by 2016 and 3 million by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/6">Important though they are, this debate is not just about the numbers, but about ensuring&mdash;I think that the hon. Lady alluded to this in her excellent speech&mdash;that new homes are part of well designed and mixed communities, which will mean more family homes and greener homes built to the highest environmental standards to meet the challenges posed by climate change. That is why we have set out the most ambitious target of its kind in the developed world&mdash;to have all new homes zero-carbon by 2016. Furthermore, we need to provide enough land to meet the challenge of building new homes. Councils are tasked with identifying 15-year supplies of land for housing, with the continuing priority for sustainable brown land. However, it is important to point out that we are not changing the rules on strong green belt protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/7">For a generation we have not been building enough homes. Since the early 1970s, the level of new build has been far less than the demand. I therefore welcome the fact that we are now building more homes than we have been for about 17 years. Figures show that 185,000 were built in the last year for which data are available. However, we need an additional 240,000 new homes a year to meet the target of 3 million new homes by 2020. Last week in the House, we had the Second Reading of the Housing and Regeneration Bill, which will help greatly to ensure that those 3 million homes will be built. A key part of the Bill is the establishment of the homes and communities agency, which will be tasked with working with local authorities and local and regional planning bodies to ensure that they can step up to the plate and build what is necessary in their area. That is a crucial part of our ambition for more homes</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/8">The hon. Lady focused on the constituency and regional perspective. I am aware that providing more housing in Dorset brings its own special challenges. She said eloquently that the county is characterised by its outstanding environmental quality, with its numerous international, national and local designations playing an influential role. That means that any housing development must respect the high quality of the surrounding environmental assets. The Dorset heathland is designated as a special protection area and a special area of conservation, which stems from European directives aimed at protecting important habitats and bird life. I know that Natural England's decision to object to all planning applications for housing developments within 400 m of those sites has caused some local concern, although the research has also shown&mdash;she mentioned this&mdash;that adverse effects can be experienced by heathlands up to 5 km away.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/9">We made it clear in the planning White Paper that a high level of protection should be given to our most valued townscapes and landscapes, wildlife habitats and natural resources, and that those with international and national designations should receive the highest level of protection. That is why we believe that it is essential that the local planning authorities in south-east Dorset progress plans to mitigate those effects by providing alternative open space or heathland management to divert potential users away from such sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/10">I am pleased to see that work is progressing well on a joint heathland mitigation plan by the south-east Dorset local planning authorities, with a consultation taking place in September to October and a public examination programmed for May or June 2009. I must point out that without that interim mitigation framework, I agree with the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole that there would effectively be a moratorium on all new housing developments within south-east Dorset. Most of Purbeck district council, Poole borough council, Bournemouth borough council, Christchurch borough council and East Dorset district council is within 5 km of that heathland site, which would prevent south-east Dorset local planning authorities from meeting their targets in relation to affordable and market housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/11">A moratorium would also adversely affect the local economy, especially the construction industry, and perversely the environment would be affected as current residents and visitors would have nowhere other than the existing heathlands sites to use for recreation. Therefore, it is absolutely imperative that the interim mitigation framework allows the provision of new recreation areas and the improvement of others, enabling the construction of new housing without compromising the environmental quality of the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/12">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole mentioned the green belt and I have touched upon that issue already. I repeat that the Government have made it clear in the planning White Paper that we remain committed to the key principles of the green belt, and we are not changing green belt policy. With all the concern that has been expressed about building on the green belt&mdash;I have written many letters to hon. Members about this&mdash;it is worth saying that this Government have increased the amount of green belt land. Since 1997, we have seen the amount of green belt land across the country grow by 64,000 acres. In 2006, the amount of land designated as green belt amounted to 1,631,800 hectares. That is about 13 per cent. of the land area of England, compared with 8.3 per cent. of the land area classified as urban land. There are also no Government plans to review green belt boundaries&mdash;they are a matter for local authorities and regional planning bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/13">The hon. Lady was eloquent in saying that this issue is not only about the numbers, although they are important; it is about the role of the local authorities providing a strategic vision for housing in their areas. Planning policy statement 3 asks local authorities to develop key and clear strategies for where housing will be developed in their areas, working with local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/14">The hon. Lady referred to infill and so-called garden grabbing. While some intensification of urban areas may provide a useful contribution to housing supply, that is a local matter. It is for local authorities to make the choice about where they want housing to be located, and to strike an appropriate balance between intensification and other options, including greenfield development. Local authorities have the powers that they need to prevent inappropriate development, which can include housing in back gardens. They can set local policies to provide the strategic overview specifically to protect gardens from development, and they can exclude gardens from their brownfield targets. It is important that they make those decisions by working with their local communities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-05a.319.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="319"  time="016:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071205/halltext/71205h0011.htm#07120550000534">
	<p pid="a.319.1/1">In terms of a case-by-case basis, a balance needs to be struck between local authorities providing policies and a strategic vision for an area, which includes infill, garden grabbing and other matters relating to housing and planning, and site-by-site consideration. Such a balance definitely needs to be struck. PPS3 provides the means that local planning authorities need and the weapons to decide what type of housing they want, and where, which is important. That is not a top-down approach dictated by the Government. It is very much a matter for local authorities, working in consultation with their local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/2">Regional planning guidance note 10, published in 2001, is the current statutory regional spatial strategy for the south-west. Its policies focus development on the region's main towns and cities. I am reluctant to talk in detail about it, but the emerging RSS, which the South West regional assembly is considering, seeks to continue and reinforce the view that development outside those areas should be of smaller scale in order to meet local needs. However, it should seek to increase the overall level of housing delivery across the region as a whole, in order to meet growth needs and to address the affordability problems mentioned by the hon. Lady. The important question is what rate of housing development is appropriate in Mid-Dorset and North Poole in order to meet local needs. As I have said, however, I am going to disappoint the hon. Lady: we must await the RSS panel report, although I understand that publication is imminent.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/3">I turn to the rural communities that are such a wonderful feature of the hon. Lady's constituency. I have mentioned the balance that needs to be struck between the strategic vision and case-by-case solutions, but it is important to consider bespoke solutions, rather than treating growth as a one-size-fits-all solution. It is about understanding a community's specific needs, and how they work.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/4">Gathering evidence and understanding local housing markets is a key step to ensuring an appropriate mix of housing to meet local needs, including affordable housing. As for rates of housing development, clearly there needs to be a proper balance between demand and supply and promoting a sustainable pattern of development for the region. The regional spatial strategy process sets that balance with a planning framework for a sustainable pattern of development for the south-west. Looking ahead to 2006, it sets rates of housing development in the hon. Lady's part of Dorset.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/5">The Government's commitment to tackling housing supply and ensuring more affordable housing with reforms to the planning system will equip local communities with the tools to focus on solutions tailored to local needs. The Government are keen to increase the supply of housing and to address problems of affordability so eloquently referred to by the hon. Lady.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/6">It is clear that there still needs to be substantial housing in the small towns and villages of the region, with a focus on delivering more affordable housing. However, I cannot stress enough how important it is that the south-west owns the agenda and seeks its own solutions. The regional spatial strategy will provide rates of housing development for each planning authority in the region. Most importantly, however, it will be a spatial strategy prepared in harness with strategies for housing investment, the environment and the region's economic growth. Together, they will provide local communities with a clear strategic context.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/7">PPS3 suggests how local planning authorities might use their local development frameworks to set the balance of different household types to be provided across the planning area. Those measures, along with others, are intended to strengthen every local community's ability better to meet its housing needs. I suggest that the hon. Lady asks whether her local authorities were using PPS3 to judge the mix between flats and family homes. PPS3 provides a clear opportunity for local planning authorities to designate what they need in terms of housing, and where they need it.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/8">The region's number one priority is the provision of more affordable housing to help improve the balance of its housing markets. My Department also has the key objective of sustainable communities in all regions. Today's debate has given us an excellent opportunity to reinforce the Government's commitment to a better future for the south-west. We want more homes in appropriate places&mdash;more homes, green homes and better homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/10" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Five o'clock.</p>
