<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18a.244.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="244"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060118/halltext/60118h01.htm#60118h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.244.1/1">I thank the hon. and learned Lady for that intervention. I know that she put that very matter as a written question to the Minister's predecessor a couple of years ago, and got an answer that was not in the affirmative. That question should not so much be put to me, as it is an option. My personal view&mdash;I should be interested to hear the Minister's&mdash;is that, so far as I know, not only is each case different, but the material relating to each case is different. Some files are very comprehensive, but others consist only of one sheet of paper. I am putting my conclusion before I have developed my arguments, but I have concluded&mdash;this may not be the final conclusion of the High Court&mdash;that we decide to pardon either everybody or nobody. There are, I suspect, major problems, and I refer the hon. and learned Lady's question&mdash;while in no way avoiding it&mdash;to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/2">Since 1998, we have seen a number of developments, which I should like briefly to take hon. Members through. In November 2000, an important psychological threshold was crossed when relatives of those executed were allowed to participate in the Remembrance day ceremonies at the cenotaph. As my hon. Friend pointed out, many but not all local communities&mdash;even in this regard they have been divided&mdash;have decided to add to war memorials the names of those who were executed in the first world war. I think that I am right in saying that there are one or two examples of the names of those who were executed already appearing on war memorials in the 1920s and 1930s. I have not had time to check this, but the name of the only Norfolk man to be executed&mdash;Private John Abigail of the 8th Norfolk Regiment, who was a volunteer who deserted more than once and who was executed in 1917&mdash;appears on the wooden panels of St. Augustine's church in Norwich. Having seen a photograph, I think that that predates the contemporary debate. However, that was an important watershed.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/3">In October 2004, the Irish Government formally submitted to the United Kingdom Government a report seeking a pardon for 26 Irish soldiers who were executed. They were from both the north and the south, Catholic and Protestant&mdash;those who served in the demonstrably Protestant 36th Ulster Division and the overwhelming Catholic 16th Irish Division. I shall come back to that, but I understand that the report is lying on the table and that the Ministry of Defence has not yet formulated a considered reply. Obviously, there are contemporary political sensitivities relating to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/4">In May 2005, a case was brought before the High Court by the family of Private Harry Farr, seeking a full posthumous pardon. It was brought in the name of his daughter, who is now aged 92, who must be one of the relatively few surviving immediate relatives. That case has been adjourned while the Ministry of Defence considers further submissions by the family. I recognise that I should not get into the weeds of that case because it is, at present, sub judice.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/5">In November 2005, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase>&mdash;alas, he is not in his usual place; like Charles II, he is on his travels abroad, with the Foreign Affairs Committee, but his heart is here in this room even as we speak&mdash;introduced a new version of his private Member's Bill, which in effect has been introduced and reintroduced since 1993, seeking a pardon for soldiers of the great war. In 2000, the New Zealand Government passed an Act to pardon soldiers of the great war, which related to five New Zealand soldiers who were executed. That was a no-holds-barred, absolute retrospective pardon. In July 2005, the New Zealand Prime Minister presented the relatives of those soldiers with any outstanding medals, decorations and certificates. The New Zealand Government have gone the whole hog. Interestingly, to compare and contrast, in December 2001, the Canadian Government debated the issue and offered a formal apology to 23 Canadians who had been executed, but stopped short of granting statutory pardons.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/6">In three countries&mdash;the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada&mdash;we have three variations: there has been no apology and no pardon directly from the United Kingdom Government, but there has been a motion of regret, which is as near as possible to an apology; in New Zealand, there has been a complete apology and a restitution of all civil rights, if I may put it that way; and the Canadian Government have made an apology, but have not granted a statutory pardon.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/7">Interestingly, there are dogs that have not barked in this case. As far as I understand, no request has yet been received from the South African Government for those who would now be constituted citizens of South Africa who were executed during the first world war. I will not touch on the subject of other Commonwealth citizens who were also executed under military law during the first world war. There are half a dozen in relation to Nigeria and the West Indies, and, of course, several hundred who were in the old Indian army. Several dozen were executed as a consequence of a mutiny in Singapore in 1915. It will muddy the waters if we get on to that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/8">A vast amount of popular and academic literature and many TV documentaries have been produced since 1998. In my considered opinion, the two best books, which do not quite present the arguments for and against, but which complement each other, are Catherine Corns' and John Hughes-Wilson's &quot;Blindfold and Alone: British Military Executions in the Great War&quot;, which was published in 2001, and Dr. Gerard Oram's &quot;Military Executions During World War I&quot;, which was published in 2003 and which has the advantage of comparing and contrasting what happened in the French and the German armies, as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/9">Having sketched out the background, let me come to the core of what I wish to address. I want to ask the Minister some specific questions to see what, if anything, has changed since 1998. First, has his Department discovered any new official documents relating to the court-martials and executions of these men? Secondly, have any of the files relating to the 3,000-plus men sentenced to death but reprieved been discovered? I understand that all those files were destroyed at some point in the inter-war period. This is an important issue; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> will be aware of it. There would be a control mechanism if we had available the 3,000 files relating to those people found guilty but reprieved. We do not know why they were reprieved. We have only one side of the argument. Thirdly, have any other official documents or has any other contemporary evidence been produced by other Departments or by individual citizens since 1998 that is directly relevant to the central question? Finally, has the Government's legal opinion changed since 1998?</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/10">Obviously, a serious challenge to the Government's opinion as stated in 1998 is the High Court case involving Private Harry Farr. I know that this may be difficult for the Minister to answer and he may very well say that it is a hypothetical question, but can he confirm that if a final ruling finds in favour of the family&mdash;that there will be some form of pardon, even if it is a conditional pardon&mdash;that would effectively set a precedent for all the other cases, or, as the hon. and learned Lady suggested, would the Ministry of Defence have to consider some form of tribunal that would assess each individual case as the case of Private Harry Farr has been assessed?</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/11">I understand the political sensitivities of this matter, but the MOD has now had just over a year to study the report of the Irish Government covering the cases of the 26 Irish soldiers. A copy of the report was leaked to the <i>Sunday Mirror</i> and there are various extracts from it on the internet. I have to say&mdash;this is a personal view and I admit that I have not read the full report&mdash;that it struck me less as a legal, historical document than as an emotional polemic aimed at the British Government. Does the Minister intend publicising the report as soon as possible? It has already been partly leaked to the press and it might be helpful if we saw the full report.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/12">Given that a year has now gone by, when is it likely that an answer will be given to the Irish Government about the report? Will the British Government's reply be placed in the public domain? If the British Government were to accede to the request of the Irish Government&mdash;if they recognise that the Irish Government have presented a case and the 26 Irish soldiers effectively get some form of pardon&mdash;would the British Government's opinion be that that would set a precedent across the board for other national groupings? After all, what about the Scots and the Welsh? Given the Minister's background, it may interest him to know that, of those found guilty and condemned to death during the first world war, 10 per cent. were from England, 10 per cent. were from Ireland, 12 per cent. were from Scotland and 14 per cent. were from Wales. An incredible 22 per cent. were from New Zealand. What do those statistics mean? I suspect, in isolation, not a lot, but one can see the potency behind different groups arguing for their specific cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/13">There is a final point connected with Ireland. I recognise that this does not fall directly into the category of those executed in the first world war. Does the Minister know whether any formal request has ever been made by the Irish Government for formal pardons to be given to those 15 Irishmen convicted by British Army tribunals in 1916 and executed following the Easter rising? They were convicted and executed for a rebellion that, as far as I understand from reading the best, most recent account&mdash;Professor Charles Townshend's &quot;Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion&quot;&mdash;was fully covered under military law at the time. I realise the sensitivity of the matter, but I think that we are now into this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/14">The purpose of my debate, apart from the opportunity to put a series of questions to the Minister, is to allow colleagues who may have different views to contradict what I have said, perhaps to press strongly for a pardon or a partial pardon and to ask similar questions. I am still unpersuaded by the case for a pardon, but I have an open mind. If I could be persuaded, perhaps I would be. There is now an opportunity for the Minister to explain his Department's current position and whether it has changed since 1998, and to ensure that my questions and those of other hon. Members receive due attention.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18a.247.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="247"  time="010:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060118/halltext/60118h01.htm#60118h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.247.0/1">I repeat the congratulations that I have already offered to the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk on having obtained the debate at what he rightly says is an important time, on the manner in which he has expressed his interest in it, and on the measured way in which he set out the position as he sees it. The broad sweep of the historian was very much in evidence, and I hope that the narrow focus of the law will not muck it all up.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/2">I disagree with the hon. Gentleman on only one or two small things. One is his reaction on having the privilege of interviewing first world war soldiers to some of them saying, in effect, &quot;I put up with it; I served well. They ran away, why shouldn't they have suffered punishment?&quot; even if they did not necessarily say that the others should have been executed. One does not necessarily want the state to have that reaction. It is a similar argument to that of those who say that they accept that 60 per cent. of criminals are from poor backgrounds, and that they have had problems with their parents, but that a lot of people have had that and they do not go to the wrong. That is a natural human reaction, but the state has to consider the justice of the case of each individual who was killed. This is an issue of justice. That is why I, as somebody who no doubt perpetrated many injustices in my former career as a lawyer, have an interest in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/3">I cannot go any further without speaking of my comrade-in-arms on this issue, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase>, who has a proud history of fighting on the subject. When I looked back&mdash;I had only a brief opportunity to do so&mdash;to prepare for the debate, I found that it is over a decade since he started to argue this case. He argues it with ferocity and diligence, and with a great deal of strength. He is very sorry not to be here for the debate. He is, as the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said, obliged to be on parliamentary duties elsewhere. My hon. Friend and I had a short conversation about the matter and if I had a message to pass on from him it would be that he has not changed his mind. That is pretty manifest in that as recently last December, on Second Reading of the Armed Forces Bill, he again put forward the case for an outright pardon.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/4">Those who were executed were, by and large, executed for offences such as cowardice, desertion and sleeping at their posts. These days, such allegations would always be looked at through the prism of a better understanding of psychiatry and psychology and the impact on people of trauma than could possibly have existed then.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/5">My attention was brought to the issue in 2001, shortly after I was elected to represent Redcar, by a Middlesbrough family who include an elderly lady who is, I think, the great-niece of a man who was shot at dawn for just such an offence. I had the privilege of meeting John Hipkin, who has for a very long time run a campaign called &quot;Shot at Dawn&quot;. He is now well into his 70s, but is nevertheless present on every occasion on which he thinks he can have an influence and, like my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock, he is very loyal to his cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/6">I met the woman and came down to London to walk with &quot;Shot at Dawn&quot; in the Armistice day parade on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-11">11 November 2002</phrase>. I talked to her about why she was still troubled by what seemed like an old injury to a family, most of whom were now dead. She said that, when young, her relative&mdash;hon. Members will have to excuse me for not remembering whether it was her aunt, her great-aunt or her mother&mdash;had been completely shunned by her contemporaries because her father, or uncle, had been executed as a traitor. The family were in disgrace; they were not to rear their heads and were not entitled to have an opinion or any share in the community on account of that event. It was clear that the relative had passed on to her descendent the recollection of that experience. I cannot possibly bring it to life, but most people with a grain of imagination will be able to work out what it must have been like for her.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/7">The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk spoke of &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot;. One of my earliest visits to London was as a teenager to see the film&mdash;I am not so old that I go back to the time of Joan Littlewood's production. It was a notable film and made the point that the first world war was, in a sense, a war of vaudeville patriotism. Patriotism was at a great emotional height then. People encouraged their young men to sign up as an act of gallantry. We have all seen the poster that says &quot;Your Country Needs You.&quot; It would have been a great source of pride to people to be able to say, &quot;My son is a soldier&quot; or &quot;My boyfriend is joining up.&quot; In that context, one can understand how it must have impacted on families to hear that those people had been shot at dawn, apparently for treacherous offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/8">I accept that it is pretty unlikely that all 306 soldiers were simply suffering from trauma. There might well have been wrongdoing and a mixed bag of circumstances, but the fear that there has been injustice persists. Many, many people who heard of the events&mdash;I looked at some cutting overnight&mdash;talked about those who had been shot and knew that they were not cowards and that they must have been traumatised.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/9">There is an account of a village&mdash;Fulstow, near Louth in Lincolnshire, which is not on my patch&mdash;that has finally decided to mark Armistice day. Because Private Charles Kirman was shot at dawn for cowardice and the whole village would not put his name on the war memorial, they would not allow any reference to be made to the first world war in the village hall&mdash;which was built in memory of second world war veterans&mdash;and would not hold any kind of Armistice day event until it was agreed that his name should go on to the war memorial. Indeed, descendents of his mates who had been killed in action would not support the honouring of the names of their fathers or uncles until Private Kirman's name was honoured too. There are clearly some powerful cases that require a strong examination&mdash;and a stronger examination than that which has already been carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/10">I do not speak for &quot;Shot at Dawn&quot;. I readily appreciate&mdash;the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk has also made the point&mdash;that there are likely to be good and bad cases among this group of men. However, granted the lack of understanding of psychiatric matters; granted the haste in which the cases were held; granted that there was no appeal against verdicts that were brought about in the field at courts martial; and granted that it is asserted repeatedly by the campaign that even the right to appeal to the King for clemency was not an effective right, it is almost inevitable that injustices occurred. It is a painful sense of injustice to relatives and it is not right that we should tolerate them. I do not want to use emotive language, but they are something of a stain on our justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/11">Let me turn to what I know a bit about: the way in which the law generally deals with old cases that it considers to have been unjustly tried. Some years ago, I was involved in the Ashley King case in the Court of Appeal and that set down the parameters. The rule is that even if the law was correctly applied as it stood on the day on which the trial occurred, if the way in which we have moved on, reinterpreted justice and improved on things throws the light of injustice on how the law worked in the old days, we should view those old facts through the better prism of justice that has subsequently evolved. If we were to do that, which is merely the ordinary civil law way of going on, some of the surviving people would be relieved of their pain by understanding what happened. If they were to find that their forebears had behaved in the way alleged, in a way they would not be any worse off, as they have already suffered pain. On the other hand, there will be people who have wrongly suffered that pain and who deserve to have matters put right before their lives end.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/12">I admire, respect and have a huge amount of time for the Secretary of State for Defence, who diligently carried out a review of these cases as well as he possibly could as recently as 1997, which ran into 1998. Of course, that has not stopped the campaign, put an end to the pain or stopped the air of secrecy that surrounds this whole area, and it never will as long as it is done by a member of the Government, however well disposed and well intentioned it is. It is a judicial rather than an Executive function to consider how cases were tried and whether they should be overturned. That is the huge flaw in the way in which the matter has been tackled so far. I wonder whether the right way forward is to see whether the Criminal Cases Review Commission is an appropriate body to deal with these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/13">The CCRC was set up in 1995 to take over from a Home Office department that had been, frankly, discredited because it was intended to look at miscarriages of justice that were alleged still to exist after final appeals had been exhausted, but it was perceived as being part of the Home Office and terribly close to the police and so not at all impartial. It did not refer many cases, and when it did it was many years later. The CCRC is a completely independent, non-departmental public body set up to review such cases. It reviews them on an application basis. When someone says that they are not guilty even though the Court of Appeal says that they are, and even if they have been to the House of Lords and had no satisfaction, the CCRC can take on and consider such cases or reject them; whichever it thinks fit. If it takes on a case and sends it back to the Court of Appeal, the case must be heard by a court to determine whether there was an injustice and whether the verdict should be overturned. It sounds cumbersome, but it produces reasonable justice in the end. I wonder if that is not the right tribunal to consider these cases at first instance.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/14">I value highly what the Secretary of State said about there being scant evidence about what happened in some cases. That point was reflected in what the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said. However, there will have been rules about the way in which the courts martial should have been run. There are certain questions to ask in an appellant system. Do the facts justify the outcome? Would there be a psychiatric defence now and can we sense whether that is right? Were the procedures followed properly? Even if they were, were they just enough when we look at them through the prism of justice as it is now? Even in a case in which there is only a little bit of documentation, experts might discern something from it. If the CCRC were to consider all such cases, there might come a tipping point at which it became fairly clear that procedures were not being followed in the way in which campaigners have always alleged that they never were. We might then be in a position to look for a holistic pardon for the entire group.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/15">My guess is that there is a reservation about whether the CCRC has the power to consider the decisions of old courts martial. If it does not, that is not necessarily an insurmountable problem. Perhaps it could consider these cases if someone from this House, or possibly a cross-party group, makes an application for it to do so. If there is a need for a minor change in the law so that it can review such cases, there is an omnibus, Christmas-tree Home Office Bill coming soon that could easily accommodate a short clause, which need not necessarily be controversial, to permit that change.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/16">The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk talked about the issue being raised in the other place recently. It was raised by my noble Friend Lord Dubs, who talked about New Zealand having passed an Act to permit such convictions to be overturned. Lord Drayson, speaking on behalf of my Government, I suppose, replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/17" class="indent">&quot;the House will recognise that we have looked thoroughly for a legal solution to this matter, and we have not found such a legal solution to provide a pardon.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2006-01-09.6"><i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>9 January 2006; Vol. 677, c. 6</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/18">It sounds as though the political will is present in the Government to take the issue on a bit more. If there is no legal solution of the type that I have outlined, it is not a matter of major difficulty to bring one about by a short and simple change in the law. I urge the Government to reconsider this matter and to acknowledge the hard work put in by the Secretary of State and that this is a judicial issue, which should be tackled roughly in the way in which I suggest.</p>

	<p pid="a.252.1/1">I would agree entirely with that if the end result was that the Government were willing to consider the cases that could not be given the sort of scrutiny that the CCRC would undoubtedly give them, and that the benefit of the doubt would then be given in those cases by the Government bringing forward a one-clause Bill to grant the pardons.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/2">Twenty-odd years ago, when I was first elected to the House, I met some of the families of the people concerned, whom I met again in 1998. I also recollect members of my family telling me about their experiences in the first world war. One of the family members whom I spoke to some 20 years ago told me about the case of his father. He came from a small market town from which they all went off to war together. He was a 22-year-old with two children and with him went three of his brothers, one of whom had lied about his age and joined the Army at the age of 15, and who was killed within two weeks of being in France. Those were tragic circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/3">It was a close-knit community and the overwhelming majority of the male population under 30 joined the Army. Those who came back did so with stories of what had happened and about the execution of the person with whom they had grown up, gone to school and gone to war. It was much like the situation in the village in Lincolnshire, but people talked. The family did not tell people what had happened, but all the other men who returned told their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/4">The chap who I talked to told me what it was like to go to school with the other boys. I can remember it from after the second world war: I went to school and a boy in my class whose father had won the Victoria cross came into school with the VC in his pocket. The man told me that boys would come to school with the medals that their fathers had received for serving in the first world war and that they all gave him a bad time, talking about his family and him. He explained in graphic detail what it was like for the family and how the stigma stayed with them. His mother had great difficulty facing the local community, but because the family had no means to move away they had to live with it. They lived with it for the rest of their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/5">We have an opportunity. I shall quote what the then Armed Forces Minister, the present Secretary of State, said about Armistice day in 1998. By ironic coincidence, he was speaking at 11 minutes past 11, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> pointed out to the House at the time. The right hon. Gentleman said:</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/6" class="indent">&quot;For some of our soldiers and their families, however, there has been neither glory nor remembrance. Just over 300 of them died at the hands not of the enemy, but of firing squads from their own side. They were shot at dawn, stigmatised and condemned&mdash;a few as cowards, most as deserters. The nature of those deaths and the circumstances surrounding them have long been a matter of contention. Therefore, last May, I said that we would look again at their cases. The review has been a long and complicated process&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1998-07-24.1372"><i>Official Report</i>, 24 July 1998; Vol. 316, c. 1372</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/7">He went on to say that because there was no compelling legal ability to deal with the problem, the situation would be much as it stands: the Government would regret that it happened, but there would be no chance of relieving the pain. That is why the hon. and learned Member for Redcar was so right to talk not about justice but about the pain that families and others have suffered through the injustice. We cannot put that right but we can by some measure adopt what the New Zealanders did. We should not try to judge each case on its merits, but say that in today's circumstances it would be inconceivable for such situations to have arisen and to have been dealt with in such a way.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/8">I remember my grandfather saying that only enlisted men were shot, never officers. He said that it was a class thing. Officers who did not go to fight were merely sent home. Few of them ever stood any sort of trial and excuses were always found. I do not want to suggest that it was a class thing, but it is something that our generation&mdash;mine and yours, Mr. Bayley&mdash;can do something about.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/9">None of us could possibly imagine what those young men went through&mdash;and many were very young. Some of those who were executed had been in and out of the front line for more than three years. Many had served with distinction; some had been put up for awards at some time during their career. Some, as the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said, had been involved in incidents that probably would have meant some punishment from the unit commander or under the regulations of the British Army. However, it is inconceivable that any of us could say hand on heart that we would not have reacted in a similar vein in such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/10">Some 20,000 people were convicted of some form of cowardice or desertion, but 300 paid the ultimate price. The circumstances that led to their being executed included the character of the commanding officer or brigade commander who ultimately made the decision, or the way in which the war was going at the time. As the hon. Gentleman said, examples had to be made. All circumstances were different at different times during the war, and those people were certainly in the wrong place at the wrong time. Circumstances compounded to make their situation even worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/11">If the House is worth anything to our society in trying to deliver relief for the pain that the families have gone through, we surely have to respond in what most reasonable people in this country believe to be the right way. In my opinion, that can only be through a full pardon as a result of a change in our legal system. We cannot reconsider the cases. The Ministry of Defence and the Secretary of State, to their credit, went everywhere they could to find a way out for us all, but could not do so within the current framework. The matter will be resolved only in the manner suggested by the hon. and learned Lady, with the Government reacting, or by the Minister being courageous enough to give the benefit of the doubt to all 306 and to table legislation that would grant them a pardon. I urge him to do that sooner rather than later.</p>

	<p pid="a.255.0/1">Twice as many British servicemen were killed in the first world war than in the second world war. What made what happened seem even worse was that the majority of those casualties were inflicted in a condensed geographical area. Whatever one's point of view about the issue in hand today, everyone would agree that no trauma affected the attitude of the British people towards war as much as the experience of world war one. Indeed, many would say that the lessons that were drawn from world war one had a pernicious effect in the 1920s and 1930s in making the country more disinclined than it should have been to take the measures that might have stopped the onset of world war two.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/2">There is no doubt that this morning's debate has touched on great issues of war and courage, and war and injustice. The victor of Burma, Viscount Slim, observed that the same fighting man who could win the Victoria cross under some circumstances could desert his post under others; it all depended on whether his commanding officers knew how to handle the resting of their subordinates. Indeed, the experience of the bravest resistance agents who fell into the hands of the Gestapo in the second world war showed that there are issues of physical endurance that all but the very strongest minds cannot overcome if tried to the limit. Therefore, if people were insufficiently rested and if their psychological traumas failed to be recognised, even the bravest of individuals could have undertaken acts that would at the time of the first world war have been regarded as gross cowardice.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/3">How do we deal with those events of the early 20th century in these years of the early 21st century and for whom are we proposing to undertake any steps that might be considered? Who is all this for? I was asking myself that when preparing for the debate and what I have heard this morning has helped me answer the question. Is it for the people themselves who were the victims? Is it for their families and others who knew them, or is it for the historical record? As the debate has continued, I have become more convinced that it is for the families and others who knew the people concerned. If we do not take that line, we shall get into the difficulties that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> so admirably outlined in his excellent contribution. I hesitate to follow his speech with my historical observations, because there are people at the highest reaches of the British armed forces who know what they know about British military history as a result of studying under my hon. Friend when he held his senior historical teaching position at Sandhurst.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/4">The matter of past historical experience brings several examples to mind. Let us consider three of them. I refer first to the case of George Archer-Shee. He was a young lieutenant who was killed early in the first world war, leading his men on a raid. He should not have been there, because half a dozen years before the first world war he had been a naval cadet at Osborne and was wrongly accused of stealing a five shilling postal order from another cadet. That incident became the basis of the famous Terence Rattigan play &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;. George Archer-Shee won justice at that time, partly because his brother was a Member of Parliament and could enlist the services of Sir Edward Carson, one of the greatest barristers of the day, to fight the case, and partly because his father was determined to risk the entire family fortune or whatever it would take to clear the honour of his son's reputation.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/5">However, even though justice was won for George, he lost. His naval career was ruined and, instead of being in the Royal Navy where he would almost certainly have survived the first world war, he immediately returned from abroad when the war was declared, volunteered, went to the western front and was killed early in his career fighting for the country that arguably had not treated him well as a cadet.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/6">The next case concerns the Arctic convoy veterans of world war two with whom some of us have been involved, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1767" name="Mike Hancock">the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock)</phrase>, in fighting for recognition for a service medal for them, which was not awarded to mark their specific service in world war two. The third case is that of the Chinook pilots who were killed in a crash on the Mull of Kintyre, over which the argument carries on. There is much agreement that an injustice may have been done to those dead pilots.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/7">How do we differentiate between those cases? That brings us back to the question of whether any family members or others close to the people concerned are still alive and feeling the pain of those perceived injustices. If we go further than that&mdash;this is where I part company with my Liberal Democrat colleagues, who are urging a collective solution&mdash;and say that we must give a collective pardon to everybody irrespective of the facts of the individual cases, I fear that we will open up a Pandora's box. That was hinted at by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk when he referred to the events of the Peninsula war and the Easter rising. It is a convenient political cop-out to be able to say that because we would not do something in this day and age, we as parliamentarians and politicians will pass judgment on what was done in a different day and age when different standards pertained.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/8">If individual cases are to be considered, that should be done&mdash;if it is to be done at all&mdash;on the basis of whether there is any legal mechanism to enable people who have a direct interest in such cases to bring an action. Even then, this is a matter for lawyers and the courts; it is not a matter for politicians and Parliament. In that respect I go some way towards the position of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase>, who made a thoughtful contribution. We also face a problem of boundaries. If we make the wrong decision, we will open up an endless process of historical review, which will not do good service to the cause of political debate in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/9">Let me return to the question of who this is for. If it is for the people who were killed, it can only be so in some spiritual sense that would depend on one's religious viewpoint. If one believes that those people still have some sort of entity or existence, they do so in a dimension where our consideration of their cases makes little difference. If it is for the families, then the only basis on which anything could justifiably be proceeded with would be where there are still a small number of survivors who are directly affected by what happened in the individual case. However, if it is for the historical record, we have to be very careful indeed; we as politicians would be entering into a rewriting of that record, when the historical record ought to be written by historians.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/10">Even in our day and age, there is still not entire agreement on the record of the first world war. A recently published book by a leading historian entitled &quot;Forgotten Victory: The First World War&mdash;Myths and Realities&quot; seeks to rehabilitate many of the leading figures of that war who have been so effectively satirised in the years in between. I think that it overstates its case, but those are matters that it is appropriate for historians to debate and settle.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/11">In respect of our debate today, the line can only be correctly drawn at the point at which the people who were directly affected cease to be living in this world and wishing to bring an action. The strongest case that has been made in this debate for any sort of consideration has been the pain, the stigma and the shame that was inflicted on the families of those concerned. I maintain that, once those family members are no longer living, the correct approach is for justice to be done by historians, and that politicians meddle in this sensitive area at their peril.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his timely and helpful intervention. I agree wholeheartedly that anecdotal and empirical evidence shows that despite the good intentions underlying the Children Act 1989, social services, which are quite often under financial or time pressure and do not wish to alienate foster parents because they have difficulty in recruiting foster parents and adoptive parents, choose the path of least resistance, which often excludes extended family members.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/2">What is to be done? I urge the Minister to examine the following modest but important proposals. First, the Government should remove the unnecessary and iniquitous requirement to obtain leave to apply before a contact order may be sought under section 8 of the 1989 Act. Such an action would not require primary legislation and could be enacted by secondary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/3">Secondly, the Government should re-examine section 17 of the 1989 Act and issue regulations so that all children who cannot live with their parents and are cared far by family and friends should have a right to assessment. That will examine the financial aspects of grandparents' care for their grandchildren. Similarly, section 23 of the 1989 Act needs to be adhered to in practice, not just in theory. Above all, we need consistency across local authorities and other agencies on the issues of payments made under section 17 of the 1989 Act to family carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/4">Thirdly, section 10 of the 1989 Act should be amended to provide parity between family and non-family carers&mdash;for example, by reducing the residence criterion for the former from three years out of five to one year out of three. That would still screen out unsuitable carers, but would maintain the strong bond between applicants and children.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/5">All of those proposals can be contained within a new set of principles governing placements, which would inform placement decision making by local authorities, and enforce the requirement on courts, local authorities and others to give careful consideration to and to act on the principle that any non-family placement should proceed only if it has been demonstrated that care in the family network would not both promote and safeguard the child's welfare. That would correct the present legal imbalance.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/6">In conclusion, the Government have an opportunity today to offer hope to those whose voices have not been heard&mdash;to those who are working for the state by proxy, sustained by selflessness and dedication, whose sole aim is to give their kin the very best start in life, sometimes at the cost of their own health and well-being. I trust that the Minister will grasp this opportunity and justify that hope.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.3/1">As we discuss these matters in general terms, it is not possible to say whether that is right. In some circumstances, the paramountcy of the child's interest could be compromised by access for grandparents, other relatives or non-resident parents. The role of the court is to take the law as Parliament sets it down and to apply it to individual cases. As an ex-lawyer, I am wary of putting myself in the place of the judge. We lay down the general principles and the courts will in good faith apply them to individual cases as they arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/2">The Government are not convinced that the safeguard of requiring leave to apply should be removed. We must do what we can to avoid involving children in unnecessary court proceedings, especially adversarial court proceedings, which can be distressing and bewildering for adults, let alone children. Such proceedings are costly, too. Removing the requirement would immediately bring in formal parties to start court proceedings. I am not saying that that would happen in every case, but it could, and the court must have a way to screen cases if, knowing all the circumstances, it feels that proceedings are unnecessary. Without the court having an initial opportunity to consider whether there would be any likely benefit to the child, it is difficult to understand how it could do that in each individual case.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/3">This is an important matter and we will have an opportunity in the not-too-distant future to explore it in more detail. I suspect that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and I will engage in debate in another forum. However, it would not be fair of me to suggest today that the Government are convinced of the need for change.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.3/4">The hon. Gentleman will remember that during the passage of the Adoption and Children Bill, a commitment was made to consider what changes to guidance and secondary legislation would be necessary to ensure that the application for leave process did not turn into a huge barrier. The process is meant to be not a costly, horrendous and huge barrier, but a safeguard to ensure paramountcy of the child's interests. The Department for Education and Skills is considering the issue, and I expect consideration to be completed sometime this year. I know that that is rather vague.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.1/1">Mr. Bayley, I should like to thank Mr. Speaker for choosing this subject for debate and for appointing me leader of the Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation to the Palestinian territories&mdash;the first ever such delegation&mdash;from which this debate arises. I thank my colleagues who were with me on that delegation, and I thank the IPU staff, Mr. Courtenay and his colleagues, for the remarkable care that they took in organising the visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/2">I have been for very many years, and from long before he became Prime Minister, a critic of the policies of Ariel Sharon. I think it appropriate for all of us to express our deep sympathy to his family for the ordeal through which Mr. Sharon is going. Nobody, whatever their opposition to his policies, would have wished on him such dreadful suffering as he is now undergoing. It must also be said, however, that whatever the trauma through which Mr. Sharon and his family are going at present, it does not detract from the baleful effect of the policies pursued by the Israeli Government during the period of the second intifada, which began in 2006, and which was triggered by Mr. Sharon's visit to the Haram-esh-Sharif, which my colleagues and I visited when we were in the Palestinian territories.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/3">Those territories are one of the smallest areas in the world, yet that tiny Palestinian territory must be one of the most militarised in the world. There are Israeli troops and checkpoints all over the Palestinian territories; there are more than 600 fixed checkpoints. Between mid-November and <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-03">3 January</phrase>, there were no fewer than 824 flying checkpoints in that territory. My colleagues and I encountered those checkpoints everywhere that we went.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/4">We were involved, through no provocation of our own, in several disagreeable incidents relating to the way in which Israeli troops either prevented us from moving, or harangued us, or from preventing us from trying to speak to Palestinians when we were paying our visit. As I pointed out to my honourable colleagues, although those incidents were disagreeable, the fact is that we were going home at the end of our visit, whereas the Palestinians had to live with much worse every day of their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/5">I have visited that area and those territories more times than I can count. Not so long ago, I was able to drive uninterrupted, from Natanya&mdash;where recently a terrorist bomb incident took place&mdash;right through to Cairo, without any obstruction. When I attended a conference in Ramallah, not many years ago, I was able, at the end of the conference, to hire a Palestinian taxi and drive right through to Aqaba in Jordan, again without being interrupted or prevented in any way whatever. To imagine that that might be possible for anybody, including an overseas visitor, today is absolutely chimerical. It is almost impossible to move about freely in those territories.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/6">The latest information we have is that during the past few weeks, between 13 and 29 main roads in the Palestinian territories have been closed by Israeli troops, and the average number of roads closed in those territories every single day is 20. At every point of the way where one goes, there are the fixed checkpoints and flying checkpoints. Although we were delayed on occasion for 45 minutes simply trying to get into one town or another, the Palestinians can be delayed for hours. Although we were delayed simply while paying a visit, they are delayed or prevented altogether from getting to their jobs and to hospitals, schools and universities. Normal life in those territories is absolutely impossible.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/7">I have visited Bethlehem many times. When we were there, Manger square was empty except for a small celebration of Palestine national day, and the church of the nativity, which used to be so crowded that one could scarcely move in it, had just two groups of visitors. At Christmas, when the number of visitors to Bethlehem used to be enormous, there was only a fraction of the number of visitors who used to go to worship in the church of the nativity. In any case, just as we were there, a new obstruction was erected by the Israeli authorities that makes access to Bethlehem difficult, if not impossible. That town's livelihood is being strangled, because it depends so much on pilgrims and visitors.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.0/1">I, too, congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> on having secured today's debate and on what has aptly been described as a moving and powerful speech. I do not want to repeat his words, other than to endorse what he said about Ariel Sharon. Whatever criticisms I and others might have of Mr. Sharon's record over the years, none of us would wish on any human being the kind of suffering that he and his family are going through at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/2">My right hon. Friend gave a powerful account of the impact of closures and movement restrictions, the wall and so on. I shall not repeat that, but would refer hon. Members on both sides of the House to the work of the Open Bethlehem project. That gives a graphic description of what is happening, not only highlighting the impact of the closures, but offering a message of hope about the fact that Bethlehem has to survive and that we all have a responsibility to do all that we can to ensure that it is open to the outside world.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/3">I should like to raise two issues. If I go on for too long on the first, I shall drop the second, because I know that many other hon. Members want to speak. The first is the Palestinian elections next week. I am fortunate in being a member of the team of observers from the UK Parliament going there, and I should like to thank the Foreign Office and the Inter-Parliamentary Union for enabling that delegation to go ahead. I was there last year when the Palestinian presidential elections took place. Some of the lessons of that experience should concern us all in the run-up to next week's elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/4">First, democracy is as important for Palestinians as it is for anybody else. They have the same right to exercise democratic choice as anybody else. Last year, I received two impressions of the way in which Palestinians reacted to their elections. One was that they had tremendous pride in the fact that they were breaking the caricatures that too many people paint of them and that they were holding elections. However, the other was a sense that they were not sure that anything was going to change. They seemed to wonder whether, given that they were able to exercise democracy only by the grace and favour of an occupying power, nothing particular would change afterwards. I found that second feeling most prevalent in East Jerusalem. That was partly because of the way in which the people were treated in those elections. It is good to hear that Israel is allowing Palestinians in East Jerusalem to vote next week. However, I have to say that we will all be looking for more co-operation with the democratic process than was seen in East Jerusalem last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/5">Last year, the occupying authorities allowed only about 6,000 of the 120,000 Arab East Jerusalemites to vote in the city, the area known as J1. The rest were forced to travel outside to the area known as J2, sometimes having to run the gauntlet of Israeli checkpoints in order to exercise their democratic rights. The voting procedure in the city was chaotic; people were forced to vote in post offices, alongside people trying to post letters. The choice of post offices was not accidental. The image was that the voters were guests in their own city, and that they were absentee voters casting postal votes for an election about somewhere else&mdash;the west bank. The voting was on the level, but in the post offices, the slot in the ballot boxes was not on the top of the box but on its side, so that it looked as though voters were posting a letter, not casting a ballot.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/6">We look for a better performance than that next week. I know that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> will say more about Jerusalem if she catches your eye, Mr. Bayley, and I ask hon. Members to pay attention to what she says. Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. In the meantime, it is occupied under international law. Israel has no right to pre-empt international law. The international community and, indeed, all of us have a responsibility to make sure that Palestinian democratic rights are respected next week.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/7">I certainly endorse what my right hon. Friend said about how Hamas came to be as prominent as it is. Partly, it is as a result of the Palestinian Authority's failings&mdash;corruption and so on&mdash;which are very much to do with the kind of policies that Israel has pursued in recent years. I ask hon. Members to look seriously at the article in <i>The Guardian </i>today by Chris McGreal. If Hamas does well in next week's election, as is likely, it will present everyone in the international community, but particularly in Israel, with some hard choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/8">If hon. Members read the article, they will find that there are changes and debates going on in Hamas. That does not alter the fact that it has been responsible for some utterly appalling attacks over the years, and may be responsible for attacks in future. However, if we are to achieve political change among Palestinians, and are to get into a situation in which the broad mass of Palestinians wish to recognise Israel and to live side by side with it&mdash;as I believe the majority of Palestinians do&mdash;it will involve understanding the changes in political Islam and encouraging the voices of change within it, rather than writing off those involved as an undifferentiated whole, made up of terrorists. The article in <i>The Guardian </i>makes that point well.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/9">My last point about Hamas is that we should not confuse terrorism with refusal to recognise the state of Israel. There are Palestinian groups that recognise the state of Israel that are involved in terrorism, and there are Palestinians who do not recognise the state of Israel who are entirely non-violent. Although I want every Palestinian to recognise the state of Israel, I also want every Israeli to recognise that Palestinians have no fewer rights than they do. If we do not say that it is a precondition for participation in the Israeli political process that every single Israeli political party should recognise that there should be a state of Palestine, it makes absolutely no sense and is unjust to say that every single political party in Palestine should have to recognise the state of Israel to participate in the elections. As I say, I want there to be mutual recognition, but the way to achieve that is to be even-handed, not to load on one side conditions that we would not, and should not, impose on the other.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18a.281.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" speakername="David Winnick" colnum="281"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060118/halltext/60118h03.htm#60118h03_spnew21">
	<p pid="a.281.2/1">No one participating in the debate disputes the right of Israel to exist and to defend itself. That is not the issue. This shows my age, but I took the view in 1948, when I was quite young, which seems a long time ago, that in all the circumstances it was right for the international community&mdash;it was international community&mdash;to bring Israel into existence. Nearly 2,000 years of Jews being demonised, persecuted, tortured and murdered laid the basis for what the Nazis did, which has already been referred to. This was the systematic extermination of 6 million because of their race; it was nothing to do with religion. All of that justified Israel coming into existence, but the price that the Palestinians paid for that should not be forgotten. If we understand why Israel came into existence, surely we have an equal responsibility to understand the Palestinian case. If we were Palestinians living at that time, I doubt whether we would have taken any other attitude than that taken by them.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/2">I mention the long history of anti-Semitism. All of us have a responsibility&mdash;especially, perhaps, without being misunderstood, those who take a particularly strong view on the middle east, opposite to Israel, so to speak&mdash;to dissociate ourselves in every way possible from some of the poisonous anti-Semitism that we have seen in Europe for centuries and which is now surfacing, surprisingly, in countries such as Egypt, for example through such documents as the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, a notorious tsarist forgery that states that the Jews will dominate the world. I do not know when that domination is going to start; maybe in 2020 or 2021. I have not been given the exact date. Moreover, we have seen the sheer obscenity&mdash;there is no other way to describe it&mdash;of the Iranian President organising a conference on what is described as &quot;holocaust denial&quot;. There is a responsibility in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/3">I want to bring us away from the idea that what happened last year in Gaza was the start of a process whereby Israel intends to withdraw from the occupied territories. I accept nothing of the kind. Whether the removals from Gaza were stage-managed or not, it was never the intention of Sharon or his Government that that withdrawal&mdash;which, however unilateral, we all welcome&mdash;would start the process of withdrawal from all the occupied territories, something we all want to see.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/4">I have a note from the Library about settler occupation in the west bank from 1972 to 2004. All the settlements are illegal and exist in defiance of the international community; the very community that brought Israel into existence in 1948. In 1972 there were 800 such settlements; by 1990 there were 78,600; by 2000 there were 192,976. At the end of 2004 the figure was 234,487. That demonstrates that over the years, Israel has been determined to build such settlements in defiance of international opinion. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/5">I endorse everything that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> said about the daily misery and humiliation that Palestinians face. If Jews were facing that sort of tragedy and being treated in that way, would we not be raising our voice? I hope so. I would be doing so, as would my right hon. Friend and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase>. Have we therefore not a responsibility to raise our voice loudly and clearly about the way in which the Palestinians are being treated? We should make no apology for doing so. I see the hon. Member for Lichfield smiling. He well knows the history of anti-Semitism and he should be concerned about the way in which Palestinians are being treated, as described by my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>. We must be evenly balanced; for heaven's sake, it is no good taking a one-sided attitude.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/6">We know that the quartet exists. I accept that the British Government wish to see a fair solution, though I do not know whether that is the view of every hon. Member. The fair solution is a Palestinian state no less independent and viable than Israel itself. The one country that can put sufficient pressure on Israel is the United States, which has the muscle and the influence. I am dismayed that in the last few years, under President Bush, there has been no wish to use that influence to bring about the right and just solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/7">I do not believe that if the issue were to be settled it would mean the end of international terrorism. That would be a very naive view. Bin Laden and his murderous fanatics would find many other reasons, as they do now. It would, however, take so much poison out of the middle east. It would not only be right in itself but would help to stabilise the position in the region. That is why I hope that the British Government will try to persuade the American Government to do what is right.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.1/1">I am going to sit down in just a moment, if my hon. Friend will forgive me.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/2">The next few days will be absolutely crucial. If an election in the Palestinian territories does not take place a week from today that can be seen to be credible and that returns a Government capable of doing something&mdash;bearing in mind that the entire Palestinian Authority's budget each year is about the same as what the Israelis are spending on building the wall&mdash;that election will be of very little value. If anything, it could polarise the issue even more if, as others have said, Hamas takes more than a foothold in the democratic process.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/3">We are in very difficult times. I do not believe that the international community has done enough to ensure that next Wednesday's election will be credible. In the Israeli elections that follow, I hope that the 70 per cent. of Israelis who support withdrawal will vote for it. I hope that we can get something out of the situation, but I came back from my visit to the Palestinian territories much more depressed about it than when I went.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18a.284.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" speakername="Nicholas Clegg" colnum="284"  time="015:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060118/halltext/60118h03.htm#60118h03_spnew26">
	<p pid="a.284.3/1">In keeping with other hon. Members, I will try to make my observations and comments brief. So much has been said about this fraught and difficult issue that is of great value and derived from far greater insight, experience and expertise than I possess. I shall just supplement what has been said with four observations.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/2">First, I visited the region in late November with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase>, and went to areas such as the west bank, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Ramallah and Hebron when the political drama in Israel was unfolding; the day after I left, Ariel Sharon announced the establishment of his new political party, Kadima. It was obvious to me, as a first-time visitor to the region, that something terrifically significant was happening in Israeli politics. Since then, I have been asking myself a question that has been made more acute by Mr. Sharon's tragic stroke; does Kadima represent a new shift in political trade in Israel, or is it, as is alleged by some, nothing more than a sleight of hand by Sharon's supporters who are trying to pursue an agenda that has not changed over the years, but in a more politically acceptable manner?</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/3">I shall state my provisional view as a question, as the answer is dependent on the events of the months to come. However, my hunch is that Kadima is a more significant development in Israeli politics than suggested by some. The notion that the party is merely a Machiavellian sleight of hand, with the same agenda of brutal unilateralism as was pursued before, stretches credulity, not least because the party has gathered around it the centre ground of Israeli political opinion. Kadima seems to have broken a taboo; it has explicitly accepted that a Palestinian state should be established on the basis of land for peace.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/4">I have an overarching question about where that development will take the peace process. Will it still rely on a unilateral decision by Israel about the terms of the negotiated land for peace settlement? We then come back to the age-old question of whether unilateralism works in a region where one side feels so aggrieved by the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/5">My second observation, which has been made before, is about Hamas. No doubt other hon. Members have read about the intriguing signs that Hamas has softened its stance on the status and existence of Israel; it has even indicated that it would be prepared to negotiate with Israel. If that is the case, it would appear to be a glimmer of hope in the context of continuing and profound concern about the military and terrorist activities sponsored by Hamas.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/6">However, the response of the international community to what looks like an almost inevitable increase in Hamas representation after the elections on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-25">25 January</phrase> needs to be delicate, sensitive and intelligent in order to extract the best from those elections; otherwise they may be used merely as an excuse to accelerate a continuing spiral of antagonism. I would be grateful to hear the Government's thinking on the issue; it must be quite advanced given that the election is only a week away. How will they act&mdash;both alone and in the context of the European Union&mdash;when confronted by a precipitate decline in the political power of an increasingly illegitimate Fatah movement&mdash;to be frank, it appears corrupt at times&mdash;and the rise of the increasingly popular Hamas movement.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/7">My third and penultimate observation is that when visiting the region with the hon. Member for Bristol, East, I was naturally struck, like many visitors, by the existence of the wall. Yet I had simply not appreciated, until making our visit, that the most insidious and destructive effects on the everyday livelihoods and fortunes of Palestinians in the west bank are, obviously, though the closure regime, but also through various invisible controls. The permits to retain one's home, if one has been studying abroad for two years, are often withdrawn unilaterally. The licences required merely to move from east Jerusalem form a Byzantine, complex system; the permits needed may be yellow, blue or orange. That is in order to visit families or to work in parts of the west bank or east Jerusalem.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/8">I still simply cannot understand why reducing the west bank to a socially and economically dysfunctional state is in Israel's own interest. That is neither a political nor a polemical statement; it is a logical one. You cannot make peace with chaos, nor with grinding poverty. You cannot make peace where people cannot meet their families, nor travel to work where moving even a few metres or kilometres is made impossible. I literally find incredible the suggestion that such a degree of dysfunctionality somehow serves the wider, legitimate security objectives of the Israeli state.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/9">My fourth and final point in this fairly arbitrary list of observations is said with a continued sense of regret; that the European Union did not choose to publish, shortly before Christmas, the report drafted by its own diplomats on the ground in east Jerusalem about conditions there. It reminded me just how inconsistent, weak and politically vague the European Union's role in the region appears to have been, and for far too long.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/10">There are glimmers of hope. It is encouraging that European Union observers, principally Italian and led by an Italian general, are overseeing the implementation of the Rafah border agreement. By financing projects in the west bank and elsewhere, the EU is doing much extremely good work, not least to develop the capacity of the Palestinian police forces to operate effectively. However, in the absence of clear leadership from Washington on the issue, it is incumbent on the British Government&mdash;and, certainly, on all other governments in the European Union&mdash;to try and come to a more coherent, collective political view, however difficult that is.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/11">The European Union is the economic giant in the neighbourhood. It has enormous leverage; would that it wished to use it more coherently. I am keen to know whether the Minister agrees with that analysis. What does he feel the British Government could do to develop a more coherent and organised European Union role in the region?</p>
