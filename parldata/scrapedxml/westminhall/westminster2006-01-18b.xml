	<p pid="b.241.3/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bayley, in the removed Westminster Hall. The subject that I have been lucky enough to have had selected for debate&mdash;that of pardons for British soldiers executed in the first world war&mdash;continues to generate great public interest and controversy. It was not only a controversial subject at the time, more than 90 years ago; there has been a continuing campaign that seeks pardons either for individuals or for all the men who were executed while serving in the British Army or the Commonwealth armies during the first world war. It is regarded as a question not only of natural justice, but of humanitarian concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.3/2">Having been interested in the subject for more than 30 years, I have concluded that the debate about pardons for British soldiers executed in the first world war is not a narrow debate about just those men, British military justice and the way in which the British Army performs. There is also a continuing debate about Britain's coming to terms with the first world war. Whatever the evidence at the time and the continuing work of historians, those of us who have been involved in the issue as historians realise that any attempt to influence wider public opinion on the first world war or pardons for British soldiers executed in that war comes up against powerful and popular cultural images, which have helped to define at least public perception. I am thinking of the impact some 30 years ago of the play and then the film &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; and some 15 years ago of the series &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;. Whatever historians have attempted to say about British generals in the first world war, and there is a case to be made, the image of Stephen Fry playing General Melchett&mdash;a bovine man of intense stupidity callously sending tens of thousands of young men to their deaths&mdash;is incredibly difficult to overcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.3/3">Let me declare an interest&mdash;first, as a military historian. Many years ago, when I had as my father-in-law would say a real job and before I became a Member of Parliament, I researched and wrote a number of books connected with the first world war. In the early 1970s, I was lucky enough to interview several hundred veterans of that war who of course even then were in their 70s and 80s. One question, among many others, that I invariably asked them concerned their attitude towards the men who were executed in the first world war for desertion, cowardice and so on. The survivors of that war had an ambivalent attitude towards those executions. That is borne out by the archives at the Imperial war museum, whether oral or written. It was possible to find large numbers of men who, at the time and in their old age, regarded the executions as wrong, vindictive and not achieving their objective of deterring people from running away, but equally I found large numbers of veterans who were bitter. They might not necessarily condone the fact that ultimately the men were executed, but they were bitter that some men decided to abscond and, as they saw it, did not do their duty and let their muckers down. That is an equally balanced view.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.3/4">Following that research, I was involved in getting a minor classic on the first world war republished in 1986. I am referring to a book that was originally published anonymously in 1938, &quot;The War the Infantry Knew&quot;, an account of the 2nd Battalion the Royal Welch Fusiliers during the first world war based entirely on letters and diaries of officers and those of other ranks. The core part of the book was the diaries of the battalion medical officer, the formidable Captain James Churchill Dunn, Distinguished Service Order, Military Cross and Bar, Distinguished Conduct Medal&mdash;that related to his time as a trooper in the yeomanry in the South African war.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.3/5">I had always imagined that Dr. Dunn was, frankly, a rather tough old bastard. A particular image was given by the contemporary accounts from those who served with him. I am thinking of Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves and Private Frank Richards, who was one of the few pre-war regular working-class soldiers to leave a real memoir&mdash;it was tarted up by Robert Graves, but &quot;Old Soldiers Never Die&quot; gives a real view from the ranks. I was to discover that Dr. Dunn was probably a more sensitive and perceptive man than I had ever imagined. Interestingly, through his diaries, he gives a number of accounts of his views on morale and discipline and of how his own courage leached away in the course of continuous soldiering and participating in major battles. He served as a regimental medical officer continuously for nearly two years. Robert Graves and Siegfried Sassoon, brave men as they were, flitted in and out of combat, unlike the bulk of the British Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.3/6">Dr. Dunn was one of only two regimental medical officers to give evidence in 1922 to what we now call the shell shock committee. There are virtually no first-hand evidence accounts of the questionnaire surviving. Dr. Dunn's, however, does survive, because it was in his papers. Despite being a sensitive man, he was absolutely convinced of the deterrent value of executing those who wilfully deserted and absconded; he believed in the deterrent effect. I am not suggesting that just because that was the view of one regimental medical officer&mdash;a man of considerable experience who was sensitive enough to recognise what battle stress was; he used to withdraw soldiers from the front line to rest them&mdash;a case should be based on it against the campaign that seeks pardons for British soldiers executed in the first world war. I am trying to illustrate my background interest in the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.3/7">When I became a junior Front-Bench defence spokesman in June 1998, my first Front-Bench speaking role, within a few days, was to respond to a statement by the then Minister for the Armed Forces, who is now the Secretary of State for Defence, on the review of pardons for soldiers executed in the first world war. It is interesting that, in the 1970s, a large number of Labour Members then in opposition felt very strongly that the then Conservative Government and previous Labour Governments had been far too secretive about the records relating to the men executed and that the likelihood was that there had been a cover-up.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.3/8">The Minister of State in 1998 carried out a very comprehensive review. As he said in his statement, he personally examined about one third of the files. He interviewed many people, including historians and relatives, and he concluded in 1998 that there was not a legal case to pardon those who had been found guilty and executed. However, the Government were moved to say that they regretted what had happened. It is interesting that someone whom I suspect before he looked into the matter was predisposed to consider that there was a strong case the other way concluded at the time, after an exhaustive survey, that there was not necessarily such a case.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.3/9">I am speaking here today because we are now eight years on. I am not saying that just because the Government had a review and said then that there was not a case that there will never be a case. I am not persuaded&mdash;it was my considered view then and still is today&mdash;that there is a case for retrospective pardon. My view is still based on a reluctance to rewrite history without real evidence. I am not in any way suggesting that those who are advocating pardons for those executed during the first world war are arguing this, but there is a case that such pardons could apply to other periods in history involving the British armed forces. There is strong feeling about the issue in the first world war because it is close and real, and there are still surviving members of families of those who were executed, but there is certainly a case to be argued that we could consider those British soldiers who were executed during active service in, for example, the Peninsular war, to see whether at the time similar criteria could be applied and that they did not know that they were suffering from post-traumatic stress&mdash;although they would not have understood at the time what that meant.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.3/10">I want to draw out the Minister on the point that the evidence at the time was more complicated than some popular historians have made out and that each individual case is different, which creates a major problem. That does not mean that all of us who are involved in this debate are not moved by what must be the trauma of the families who have discovered that a grandfather, a father or an uncle was found guilty of a capital offence and executed. It has moved many members of the public, and I can understand why; it is a natural feeling.</p>

	<p pid="b.243.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate. I have followed with huge interest what he has had to say so far. Are there not many different individual reasons why soldiers were executed? I understand that some war memorials have named those who were executed, but in other communities a decision has been taken not to do so. The sensitivity that he brings to the debate is hugely important.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18b.243.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="243"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060118/halltext/60118h01.htm#60118h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.243.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for those comments. On the whole, all hon. Members who have been involved in this debate have been sensitive, because that is the feeling among the public. His point about communities' reactions&mdash;I may come back to this&mdash;is understandable. My sense is that in the aftermath of the second world war certainly those families who had knowledge that their husband, father or grandfather had been executed frequently wanted to keep quiet about it. It was the military equivalent in that period of an unwanted pregnancy. It was something that people felt ashamed of and did not want to talk about.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.1/2">Over the past 15 years, there has been a sustained campaign in this country and in Commonwealth countries for formal pardons for those executed, and since the Government's review of 1998 that campaign has continued. Any belief that the Ministry of Defence had that the review would somehow stop the debate was, as I said at the time, highly unlikely. The purpose of my debate is to enable us to question the Minister about Government policy and whether it has changed, or is likely to change, as a consequence of either new evidence or information, legal proceedings, or sustained lobbying.</p>
	<p pid="b.243.1/3">The interest of parliamentarians in the issue and the emotions that it arouses could be seen last week when there was a question in the other place and, it would be fair to say, their lordships gave the Minister for Defence Procurement a hard time at the Dispatch Box. It applies not only to this House but to the other place. As much as anything else, that question prompted me to apply for this debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.244.0/1">I echo what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> said about the measured way in which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> is presenting the debate; the broad sweep of the historian is present, and I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate and on the way in which he is conducting it. Before he moves on to recent events, may I raise the question of the case for an overall pardon, for which there has been strong lobbying? Both hon. Gentlemen have made the point that there may be distinctions to be drawn between individuals. Would there be any real reason why the statutory body, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, as an expert body that regularly refers cases back to the Court of Appeal and, equally, refuses many, should not be asked to look at all the files and to come to a view? Would that be better than the Secretary of State doing so?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18b.244.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="244"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060118/halltext/60118h01.htm#60118h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.244.1/1">I thank the hon. and learned Lady for that intervention. I know that she put that very matter as a written question to the Minister's predecessor a couple of years ago, and got an answer that was not in the affirmative. That question should not so much be put to me, as it is an option. My personal view&mdash;I should be interested to hear the Minister's&mdash;is that, so far as I know, not only is each case different, but the material relating to each case is different. Some files are very comprehensive, but others consist only of one sheet of paper. I am putting my conclusion before I have developed my arguments, but I have concluded&mdash;this may not be the final conclusion of the High Court&mdash;that we decide to pardon either everybody or nobody. There are, I suspect, major problems, and I refer the hon. and learned Lady's question&mdash;while in no way avoiding it&mdash;to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/2">Since 1998, we have seen a number of developments, which I should like briefly to take hon. Members through. In November 2000, an important psychological threshold was crossed when relatives of those executed were allowed to participate in the Remembrance day ceremonies at the cenotaph. As my hon. Friend pointed out, many but not all local communities&mdash;even in this regard they have been divided&mdash;have decided to add to war memorials the names of those who were executed in the first world war. I think that I am right in saying that there are one or two examples of the names of those who were executed already appearing on war memorials in the 1920s and 1930s. I have not had time to check this, but the name of the only Norfolk man to be executed&mdash;Private John Abigail of the 8th Norfolk Regiment, who was a volunteer who deserted more than once and who was executed in 1917&mdash;appears on the wooden panels of St. Augustine's church in Norwich. Having seen a photograph, I think that that predates the contemporary debate. However, that was an important watershed.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/3">In October 2004, the Irish Government formally submitted to the United Kingdom Government a report seeking a pardon for 26 Irish soldiers who were executed. They were from both the north and the south, Catholic and Protestant&mdash;those who served in the demonstrably Protestant 36th Ulster Division and the overwhelming Catholic 16th Irish Division. I shall come back to that, but I understand that the report is lying on the table and that the Ministry of Defence has not yet formulated a considered reply. Obviously, there are contemporary political sensitivities relating to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/4">In May 2005, a case was brought before the High Court by the family of Private Harry Farr, seeking a full posthumous pardon. It was brought in the name of his daughter, who is now aged 92, who must be one of the relatively few surviving immediate relatives. That case has been adjourned while the Ministry of Defence considers further submissions by the family. I recognise that I should not get into the weeds of that case because it is, at present, sub judice.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/5">In November 2005, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase>&mdash;alas, he is not in his usual place; like Charles II, he is on his travels abroad, with the Foreign Affairs Committee, but his heart is here in this room even as we speak&mdash;introduced a new version of his private Member's Bill, which in effect has been introduced and reintroduced since 1993, seeking a pardon for soldiers of the great war. In 2000, the New Zealand Government passed an Act to pardon soldiers of the great war, which related to five New Zealand soldiers who were executed. That was a no-holds-barred, absolute retrospective pardon. In July 2005, the New Zealand Prime Minister presented the relatives of those soldiers with any outstanding medals, decorations and certificates. The New Zealand Government have gone the whole hog. Interestingly, to compare and contrast, in December 2001, the Canadian Government debated the issue and offered a formal apology to 23 Canadians who had been executed, but stopped short of granting statutory pardons.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/6">In three countries&mdash;the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada&mdash;we have three variations: there has been no apology and no pardon directly from the United Kingdom Government, but there has been a motion of regret, which is as near as possible to an apology; in New Zealand, there has been a complete apology and a restitution of all civil rights, if I may put it that way; and the Canadian Government have made an apology, but have not granted a statutory pardon.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/7">Interestingly, there are dogs that have not barked in this case. As far as I understand, no request has yet been received from the South African Government for those who would now be constituted citizens of South Africa who were executed during the first world war. I will not touch on the subject of other Commonwealth citizens who were also executed under military law during the first world war. There are half a dozen in relation to Nigeria and the West Indies, and, of course, several hundred who were in the old Indian army. Several dozen were executed as a consequence of a mutiny in Singapore in 1915. It will muddy the waters if we get on to that area.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/8">A vast amount of popular and academic literature and many TV documentaries have been produced since 1998. In my considered opinion, the two best books, which do not quite present the arguments for and against, but which complement each other, are Catherine Corns's and John Hughes-Wilson's &quot;Blindfold and Alone: British Military Executions in the Great War&quot;, which was published in 2001, and Dr. Gerard Oram's &quot;Military Executions During World War I&quot;, which was published in 2003 and which has the advantage of comparing and contrasting what happened in the French and the German armies, as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/9">Having sketched out the background, let me come to the core of what I wish to address. I want to ask the Minister some specific questions to see what, if anything, has changed since 1998. First, has his Department discovered any new official documents relating to the courts martial and executions of these men? Secondly, have any of the files relating to the 3,000-plus men sentenced to death but reprieved been discovered? I understand that all those files were destroyed at some point in the inter-war period. This is an important issue; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> will be aware of it. There would be a control mechanism if we had available the 3,000 files relating to those people found guilty but reprieved. We do not know why they were reprieved. We have only one side of the argument. Thirdly, have any other official documents or has any other contemporary evidence been produced by other Departments or by individual citizens since 1998 that is directly relevant to the central question? Finally, has the Government's legal opinion changed since 1998?</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/10">Obviously, a serious challenge to the Government's opinion as stated in 1998 is the High Court case involving Private Harry Farr. I know that this may be difficult for the Minister to answer and he may very well say that it is a hypothetical question, but can he confirm that if a final ruling finds in favour of the family&mdash;that there will be some form of pardon, even if it is a conditional pardon&mdash;that would effectively set a precedent for all the other cases, or, as the hon. and learned Lady suggested, would the Ministry of Defence have to consider some form of tribunal that would assess each individual case as the case of Private Harry Farr has been assessed?</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/11">I understand the political sensitivities of this matter, but the MOD has now had just over a year to study the report of the Irish Government covering the cases of the 26 Irish soldiers. A copy of the report was leaked to the <i>Sunday Mirror</i> and there are various extracts from it on the internet. I have to say&mdash;this is a personal view and I admit that I have not read the full report&mdash;that it struck me less as a legal, historical document than as an emotional polemic aimed at the British Government. Does the Minister intend publicising the report as soon as possible? It has already been partly leaked to the press and it might be helpful if we saw the full report.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/12">Given that a year has now gone by, when is it likely that an answer will be given to the Irish Government about the report? Will the British Government's reply be placed in the public domain? If the British Government were to accede to the request of the Irish Government&mdash;if they recognise that the Irish Government have presented a case and the 26 Irish soldiers effectively get some form of pardon&mdash;would the British Government's opinion be that that would set a precedent across the board for other national groupings? After all, what about the Scots and the Welsh? Given the Minister's background, it may interest him to know that, of those found guilty and condemned to death during the first world war, 10 per cent. were from England, 10 per cent. were from Ireland, 12 per cent. were from Scotland and 14 per cent. were from Wales. An incredible 22 per cent. were from New Zealand. What do those statistics mean? I suspect, in isolation, not a lot, but one can see the potency behind different groups arguing for their specific cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/13">There is a final point connected with Ireland. I recognise that this does not fall directly into the category of those executed in the first world war. Does the Minister know whether any formal request has ever been made by the Irish Government for formal pardons to be given to those 15 Irishmen convicted by British Army tribunals in 1916 and executed following the Easter rising? They were convicted and executed for a rebellion that, as far as I understand from reading the best, most recent account&mdash;Professor Charles Townshend's &quot;Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion&quot;&mdash;was fully covered under military law at the time. I realise the sensitivity of the matter, but I think that we are now into this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.1/14">The purpose of my debate, apart from the opportunity to put a series of questions to the Minister, is to allow colleagues who may have different views to contradict what I have said, perhaps to press strongly for a pardon or a partial pardon and to ask similar questions. I am still unpersuaded by the case for a pardon, but I have an open mind. If I could be persuaded, perhaps I would be. There is now an opportunity for the Minister to explain his Department's current position and whether it has changed since 1998, and to ensure that my questions and those of other hon. Members receive due attention.</p>

	<p pid="b.247.0/1">I repeat the congratulations that I have already offered to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> on having obtained the debate at what he rightly says is an important time, on the manner in which he has expressed his interest in it, and on the measured way in which he set out the position as he sees it. The broad sweep of the historian was very much in evidence, and I hope that the narrow focus of the law will not muck it all up.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/2">I disagree with the hon. Gentleman on only one or two small things. One is his reaction on having the privilege of interviewing first world war soldiers to some of them saying, in effect, &quot;I put up with it; I served well. They ran away, why shouldn't they have suffered punishment?&quot;, even if they did not necessarily say that the others should have been executed. One does not necessarily want the state to have that reaction. It is a similar argument to that of those who say that they accept that 60 per cent. of criminals are from poor backgrounds, and that they have had problems with their parents, but that a lot of people have had that and they do not go to the wrong. That is a natural human reaction, but the state has to consider the justice of the case of each individual who was killed. This is an issue of justice. That is why I, as somebody who no doubt perpetrated many injustices in my former career as a lawyer, have an interest in it.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/3">I cannot go any further without speaking of my comrade-in-arms on this issue, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase>, who has a proud history of fighting on the subject. When I looked back&mdash;I had only a brief opportunity to do so&mdash;to prepare for the debate, I found that it is over a decade since he started to argue this case. He argues it with ferocity and diligence, and with a great deal of strength. He is very sorry not to be here for the debate. He is, as the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said, obliged to be on parliamentary duties elsewhere. My hon. Friend and I had a short conversation about the matter and if I had a message to pass on from him it would be that he has not changed his mind. That is pretty manifest in that as recently last December, on Second Reading of the Armed Forces Bill, he again put forward the case for an outright pardon.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/4">Those who were executed were, by and large, executed for offences such as cowardice, desertion and sleeping at their posts. These days, such allegations would always be looked at through the prism of a better understanding of psychiatry and psychology and the impact on people of trauma than could possibly have existed then.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/5">My attention was brought to the issue in 2001, shortly after I was elected to represent Redcar, by a Middlesbrough family who include an elderly lady who is, I think, the great-niece of a man who was shot at dawn for just such an offence. I had the privilege of meeting John Hipkin, who has for a very long time run a campaign called &quot;Shot at Dawn&quot;. He is now well into his 70s, but is nevertheless present on every occasion on which he thinks he can have an influence and, like my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock, he is very loyal to his cause.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/6">I met the woman and came down to London to walk with &quot;Shot at Dawn&quot; in the Armistice day parade on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-11">11 November 2002</phrase>. I talked to her about why she was still troubled by what seemed like an old injury to a family, most of whom were now dead. She said that, when young, her relative&mdash;hon. Members will have to excuse me for not remembering whether it was her aunt, her great-aunt or her mother&mdash;had been completely shunned by her contemporaries because her father, or uncle, had been executed as a traitor. The family were in disgrace; they were not to rear their heads and were not entitled to have an opinion or any share in the community on account of that event. It was clear that the relative had passed on to her descendent the recollection of that experience. I cannot possibly bring it to life, but most people with a grain of imagination will be able to work out what it must have been like for her.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/7">The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk spoke of &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot;. One of my earliest visits to London was as a teenager to see the film&mdash;I am not so old that I go back to the time of Joan Littlewood's production. It was a notable film and made the point that the first world war was, in a sense, a war of vaudeville patriotism. Patriotism was at a great emotional height then. People encouraged their young men to sign up as an act of gallantry. We have all seen the poster that says &quot;Your Country Needs You.&quot; It would have been a great source of pride to people to be able to say, &quot;My son is a soldier&quot; or &quot;My boyfriend is joining up.&quot; In that context, one can understand how it must have impacted on families to hear that those people had been shot at dawn, apparently for treacherous offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/8">I accept that it is pretty unlikely that all 306 soldiers were simply suffering from trauma. There might well have been wrongdoing and a mixed bag of circumstances, but the fear that there has been injustice persists. Many, many people who heard of the events&mdash;I looked at some cuttings overnight&mdash;talked about those who had been shot and knew that they were not cowards and that they must have been traumatised.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/9">There is an account of a village&mdash;Fulstow, near Louth in Lincolnshire, which is not on my patch&mdash;that has finally decided to mark Armistice day. Because Private Charles Kirman was shot at dawn for cowardice and the whole village would not put his name on the war memorial, they would not allow any reference to be made to the first world war in the village hall&mdash;which was built in memory of second world war veterans&mdash;and would not hold any kind of Armistice day event until it was agreed that his name should go on to the war memorial. Indeed, descendents of his mates who had been killed in action would not support the honouring of the names of their fathers or uncles until Private Kirman's name was honoured too. There are clearly some powerful cases that require a strong examination&mdash;and a stronger examination than that which has already been carried out.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/10">I do not speak for &quot;Shot at Dawn&quot;. I readily appreciate&mdash;the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk has also made the point&mdash;that there are likely to be good and bad cases among this group of men. However, granted the lack of understanding of psychiatric matters; granted the haste in which the cases were held; granted that there was no appeal against verdicts that were brought about in the field at courts martial; and granted that it is asserted repeatedly by the campaign that even the right to appeal to the King for clemency was not an effective right, it is almost inevitable that injustices occurred. It is a painful sense of injustice to relatives and it is not right that we should tolerate them. I do not want to use emotive language, but they are something of a stain on our justice system.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/11">Let me turn to what I know a bit about: the way in which the law generally deals with old cases that it considers to have been unjustly tried. Some years ago, I was involved in the Ashley King case in the Court of Appeal and that set down the parameters. The rule is that even if the law was correctly applied as it stood on the day on which the trial occurred, if the way in which we have moved on, reinterpreted justice and improved on things throws the light of injustice on how the law worked in the old days, we should view those old facts through the better prism of justice that has subsequently evolved. If we were to do that, which is merely the ordinary civil law way of going on, some of the surviving people would be relieved of their pain by understanding what happened. If they were to find that their forebears had behaved in the way alleged, in a way they would not be any worse off, as they have already suffered pain. On the other hand, there will be people who have wrongly suffered that pain and who deserve to have matters put right before their lives end.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/12">I admire, respect and have a huge amount of time for the Secretary of State for Defence, who diligently carried out a review of these cases as well as he possibly could as recently as 1997, which ran into 1998. Of course, that has not stopped the campaign, put an end to the pain or stopped the air of secrecy that surrounds this whole area, and it never will as long as it is done by a member of the Government, however well disposed and well intentioned it is. It is a judicial rather than an Executive function to consider how cases were tried and whether they should be overturned. That is the huge flaw in the way in which the matter has been tackled so far. I wonder whether the right way forward is to see whether the Criminal Cases Review Commission is an appropriate body to deal with these matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/13">The CCRC was set up in 1995 to take over from a Home Office department that had been, frankly, discredited because it was intended to look at miscarriages of justice that were alleged still to exist after final appeals had been exhausted, but it was perceived as being part of the Home Office and terribly close to the police and so not at all impartial. It did not refer many cases, and when it did it was many years later. The CCRC is a completely independent, non-departmental public body set up to review such cases. It reviews them on an application basis. When someone says that they are not guilty even though the Court of Appeal says that they are, and even if they have been to the House of Lords and had no satisfaction, the CCRC can take on and consider such cases or reject them; whichever it thinks fit. If it takes on a case and sends it back to the Court of Appeal, the case must be heard by a court to determine whether there was an injustice and whether the verdict should be overturned. It sounds cumbersome, but it produces reasonable justice in the end. I wonder if that is not the right tribunal to consider these cases at first instance.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/14">I value highly what the Secretary of State said about there being scant evidence about what happened in some cases. That point was reflected in what the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said. However, there will have been rules about the way in which the courts martial should have been run. There are certain questions to ask in an appellant system. Do the facts justify the outcome? Would there be a psychiatric defence now and can we sense whether that is right? Were the procedures followed properly? Even if they were, were they just enough when we look at them through the prism of justice as it is now? Even in a case in which there is only a little bit of documentation, experts might discern something from it. If the CCRC were to consider all such cases, there might come a tipping point at which it became fairly clear that procedures were not being followed in the way in which campaigners have always alleged that they never were. We might then be in a position to look for a holistic pardon for the entire group.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/15">My guess is that there is a reservation about whether the CCRC has the power to consider the decisions of old courts martial. If it does not, that is not necessarily an insurmountable problem. Perhaps it could consider these cases if someone from this House, or possibly a cross-party group, makes an application for it to do so. If there is a need for a minor change in the law so that it can review such cases, there is an omnibus, Christmas-tree Home Office Bill coming soon that could easily accommodate a short clause, which need not necessarily be controversial, to permit that change.</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/16">The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk talked about the issue being raised in the other place recently. It was raised by my noble Friend Lord Dubs, who talked about New Zealand having passed an Act to permit such convictions to be overturned. Lord Drayson, speaking on behalf of my Government, I suppose, replied,</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/17" class="indent">&quot;the House will recognise that we have looked thoroughly for a legal solution to this matter, and we have not found such a legal solution to provide a pardon.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2006-01-09.6"><i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>9 January 2006; Vol. 677, c. 6</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.247.0/18">It sounds as though the political will is present in the Government to take the issue on a bit more. If there is no legal solution of the type that I have outlined, it is not a matter of major difficulty to bring one about by a short and simple change in the law. I urge the Government to reconsider this matter and to acknowledge the hard work put in by the Secretary of State and that this is a judicial issue, which should be tackled roughly in the way in which I suggest.</p>

	<p pid="b.251.1/1">I appreciate that warning, Mr. Bayley.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> on his consistency on this issue&mdash;being present when it is debated and discussed&mdash;and on the excellent way in which he presented his point of view, although it is not one that I share. There is an issue that goes beyond what he explained about the traditions of natural justice in this country and what the overwhelming majority of people feel is a realistic approach in today's society. By any means, most of us agree that what happened was an appalling outcome in the circumstances. No stone should be left unturned; if a change in the law is required to give those men pardons, then that is what should happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.251.1/3">I agree with virtually everything that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> said, except her comments about putting this matter to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The problem is that there would not be consistency of evidence, so some cases would get a thorough going over, some of which might end up with a pardon being granted, but, sadly, that opportunity would not be present in many cases. We know the likely problems from previous examinations and from what the Secretary of State told us in 1998, when he had fastidiously gone through the documentation and considered the cases. I remember conversations we had in his office in which he said what an emotional rollercoaster he was on when he read the cases; he had a picture of his relatives who had served in the first world war on the bookcase in his office. He said, &quot;I read these papers and looked at these pictures and could not fail to be emotionally involved in the situation.&quot; He also said that there was such scant information available in some instances that it was impossible to go one way or the other, which would be unfair to the cause and to the majority of the people involved.</p>

	<p pid="b.252.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way; it is good to discuss points as they are raised. I am sure that what he says is the situation, but would any damage follow from the CCRC using its expertise to consider as exhaustively as possible all the cases that it could, and the Government having to make their mind up about whether to grant pardons in the remaining cases? That would be a quick way of getting through the issue and of offering some succour to people before they die.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18b.252.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1767" speakername="Mike Hancock" colnum="252"  time="010:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060118/halltext/60118h01.htm#60118h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="b.252.1/1">I would agree entirely with that if the end result was that the Government were willing to consider the cases that could not be given the sort of scrutiny that the CCRC would undoubtedly give them, and that the benefit of the doubt would then be given in those cases by the Government bringing forward a one-clause Bill to grant the pardons.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/2">Twenty-odd years ago, when I was first elected to the House, I met some of the families of the people concerned, whom I met again in 1998. I also recollect members of my family telling me about their experiences in the first world war. One of the family members whom I spoke to some 20 years ago told me about the case of his father. He came from a small market town from which they all went off to war together. He was a 22-year-old with two children and with him went three of his brothers, one of whom had lied about his age and joined the Army at the age of 15, and who was killed within two weeks of being in France. Those were tragic circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/3">It was a close-knit community and the overwhelming majority of the male population under 30 joined the Army. Those who came back did so with stories of what had happened and about the execution of the person with whom they had grown up, gone to school and gone to war. It was much like the situation in the village in Lincolnshire, but people talked. The family did not tell people what had happened, but all the other men who returned told their families.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/4">The chap who I talked to told me what it was like to go to school with the other boys. I can remember it from after the second world war: I went to school and a boy in my class whose father had won the Victoria cross came into school with the VC in his pocket. The man told me that boys would come to school with the medals that their fathers had received for serving in the first world war and that they all gave him a bad time, talking about his family and him. He explained in graphic detail what it was like for the family and how the stigma stayed with them. His mother had great difficulty facing the local community, but because the family had no means to move away they had to live with it. They lived with it for the rest of their lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/5">We have an opportunity. I shall quote what the then Minister for the Armed Forces, the present Secretary of State, said about Armistice day in 1998. By ironic coincidence, he was speaking at 11 minutes past 11, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> pointed out to the House at the time. The right hon. Gentleman said:</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/6" class="indent">&quot;For some of our soldiers and their families, however, there has been neither glory nor remembrance. Just over 300 of them died at the hands not of the enemy, but of firing squads from their own side. They were shot at dawn, stigmatised and condemned&mdash;a few as cowards, most as deserters. The nature of those deaths and the circumstances surrounding them have long been a matter of contention. Therefore, last May, I said that we would look again at their cases. The review has been a long and complicated process&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1998-07-24.1372"><i>Official Report</i>, 24 July 1998; Vol. 316, c. 1372</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/7">He went on to say that because there was no compelling legal ability to deal with the problem, the situation would be much as it stands: the Government would regret that it happened, but there would be no chance of relieving the pain. That is why the hon. and learned Member for Redcar was so right to talk not about justice but about the pain that families and others have suffered through the injustice. We cannot put that right but we can by some measure adopt what the New Zealanders did. We should not try to judge each case on its merits, but say that in today's circumstances it would be inconceivable for such situations to have arisen and to have been dealt with in such a way.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/8">I remember my grandfather saying that only enlisted men were shot, never officers. He said that it was a class thing. Officers who did not go to fight were merely sent home. Few of them ever stood any sort of trial and excuses were always found. I do not want to suggest that it was a class thing, but it is something that our generation&mdash;mine and yours, Mr. Bayley&mdash;can do something about.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/9">None of us could possibly imagine what those young men went through&mdash;and many were very young. Some of those who were executed had been in and out of the front line for more than three years. Many had served with distinction; some had been put up for awards at some time during their career. Some, as the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said, had been involved in incidents that probably would have meant some punishment from the unit commander or under the regulations of the British Army. However, it is inconceivable that any of us could say hand on heart that we would not have reacted in a similar vein in such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/10">Some 20,000 people were convicted of some form of cowardice or desertion, but 300 paid the ultimate price. The circumstances that led to their being executed included the character of the commanding officer or brigade commander who ultimately made the decision, or the way in which the war was going at the time. As the hon. Gentleman said, examples had to be made. All circumstances were different at different times during the war, and those people were certainly in the wrong place at the wrong time. Circumstances compounded to make their situation even worse.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/11">If the House is worth anything to our society in trying to deliver relief for the pain that the families have gone through, we surely have to respond in what most reasonable people in this country believe to be the right way. In my opinion, that can only be through a full pardon as a result of a change in our legal system. We cannot reconsider the cases. The Ministry of Defence and the Secretary of State, to their credit, went everywhere they could to find a way out for us all, but could not do so within the current framework. The matter will be resolved only in the manner suggested by the hon. and learned Lady, with the Government reacting, or by the Minister being courageous enough to give the benefit of the doubt to all 306 and to table legislation that would grant them a pardon. I urge him to do that sooner rather than later.</p>

	<p pid="b.254.0/1">I shall be relatively brief, because we need to give the Minister as much time as possible to respond. First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> not only on securing the debate but on the measured and thoughtful way in which he spoke. I do not think that there is another Member in the House who has his breadth and depth of knowledge of historical matters. I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1767" name="Mike Hancock">the Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock)</phrase> on their speeches.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/2">We need to recognise that we are on the edge of history; we are on the last page of the last chapter of the first world war. There are 10 or a dozen amazing survivors from that great conflict; I believe that there are no survivors from Germany. In a relatively short time the final combatant will pass on, and it would be fitting if we could close that chapter and the book of those who fought by granting a pardon, at least as far as can be conceived, and following the good examples of the approaches taken by the Irish Republic, Canada and New Zealand.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/3">The debate is of course deficient without the presence and contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase>, who, as we have heard, has campaigned for 10 years or more to bring about justice. The early-day motion that he tabled in the first year or two that I was a Member of Parliament&mdash;in 1997 or 1998&mdash;attracted more signatures than any other early-day motion before or since. I was in the House on <phrase class="date" code="1998-07-24">24 July 1998</phrase> when the then Minister for the Armed Forces gave his statement and we debated it. It was the most moving debate that I have experienced in my eight or nine years in the House. It was clearly thought through by the then Minister but the conclusion was not the one for which we are still searching. I should point out that the debate will go on until people feel that justice has been done.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/4">Clearly, the 306 people who were shot at dawn included many who it was quickly realised should not have been executed. Lessons were learned, because by the second world war there were no executions&mdash;certainly not on the scale and for the purposes for which an example had to be set, as if such an exercise were a sort of decimation, when one in 10 along the line was stabbed to death as in ancient history.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/5">I am grateful to the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk for drawing attention to &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; and &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot;. That satire really made an impact on people of my generation, because we could see not only the futility of war, but the stupidity of those who were responsible for such actions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, South said, not all officers led from the front. Of course, there were many brave officers, but there were those who did not get stuck in as the men at the front did.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/6">I first became aware of the scale of the first world war when, as a scout in 1961, I did my hiker's badge. As a project, I recorded information on village war memorials. I realised quickly that the list of names in respect of the first world war was considerably longer than that for the second world war. Clearly, various lessons had been learned, not least the stupidity of sending men into a barrage of machine gun bullets. Cowardice, courts martial and so on were more measured and understood in the second world war. Medical knowledge was improving all the time and it is now even better than it was in the second world war.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/7">There have been calls for a state funeral for the last person from the great war to pass on. I urge caution because through my Royal British Legion connections I am told that it does not necessarily know all the names of those who took part in the war. In the past six to nine months, one or two names have emerged of which it was not aware. Would the family want a state funeral? If they did agree to it, it is possible that someone else may emerge who had not wished it to be known that he was a survivor and a brave soldier from the first world war.</p>
	<p pid="b.254.0/8">Will the Minister take serious note of what has been said and realise that, although we have moved on from 1998, the campaign for the pardon has not weakened? As we come to the final page of the final chapter, I urge the Government to find a way in which to give posthumous pardon to those 306 people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18b.255.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" speakername="Julian Lewis" colnum="255"  time="010:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060118/halltext/60118h01.htm#60118h01_spnew11">
	<p pid="b.255.0/1">Twice as many British servicemen were killed in the first world war than in the second world war. What made what happened seem even worse was that the majority of those casualties were inflicted in a condensed geographical area. Whatever one's point of view about the issue in hand today, everyone would agree that no trauma affected the attitude of the British people towards war as much as the experience of world war one. Indeed, many would say that the lessons that were drawn from world war one had a pernicious effect in the 1920s and 1930s in making the country more disinclined than it should have been to take the measures that might have stopped the onset of world war two.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/2">There is no doubt that this morning's debate has touched on great issues of war and courage, and war and injustice. The victor of Burma, Viscount Slim, observed that the same fighting man who could win the Victoria cross under some circumstances could desert his post under others; it all depended on whether his commanding officers knew how to handle the resting of their subordinates. Indeed, the experience of the bravest resistance agents who fell into the hands of the Gestapo in the second world war showed that there are issues of physical endurance that all but the very strongest minds cannot overcome if tried to the limit. Therefore, if people were insufficiently rested and if their psychological traumas failed to be recognised, even the bravest of individuals could have undertaken acts that would at the time of the first world war have been regarded as gross cowardice.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/3">How do we deal with those events of the early 20th century in these years of the early 21st century and for whom are we proposing to undertake any steps that might be considered? Who is all this for? I was asking myself that when preparing for the debate and what I have heard this morning has helped me answer the question. Is it for the people themselves who were the victims? Is it for their families and others who knew them, or is it for the historical record? As the debate has continued, I have become more convinced that it is for the families and others who knew the people concerned. If we do not take that line, we shall get into the difficulties that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> so admirably outlined in his excellent contribution. I hesitate to follow his speech with my historical observations, because there are people at the highest reaches of the British armed forces who know what they know about British military history as a result of studying under my hon. Friend when he held his senior historical teaching position at Sandhurst.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/4">The matter of past historical experience brings several examples to mind. Let us consider three of them. I refer first to the case of George Archer-Shee. He was a young lieutenant who was killed early in the first world war, leading his men on a raid. He should not have been there, because half a dozen years before the first world war he had been a naval cadet at Osborne and was wrongly accused of stealing a five shilling postal order from another cadet. That incident became the basis of the famous Terence Rattigan play &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;. George Archer-Shee won justice at that time, partly because his brother was a Member of Parliament and could enlist the services of Sir Edward Carson, one of the greatest barristers of the day, to fight the case, and partly because his father was determined to risk the entire family fortune or whatever it would take to clear the honour of his son's reputation.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/5">However, even though justice was won for George, he lost. His naval career was ruined and, instead of being in the Royal Navy where he would almost certainly have survived the first world war, he immediately returned from abroad when the war was declared, volunteered, went to the western front and was killed early in his career fighting for the country that arguably had not treated him well as a cadet.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/6">The next case concerns the Arctic convoy veterans of world war two with whom some of us have been involved, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1767" name="Mike Hancock">the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock)</phrase>, in fighting for recognition for a service medal for them, which was not awarded to mark their specific service in world war two. The third case is that of the Chinook pilots who were killed in a crash on the Mull of Kintyre, over which the argument carries on. There is much agreement that an injustice may have been done to those dead pilots.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/7">How do we differentiate between those cases? That brings us back to the question of whether any family members or others close to the people concerned are still alive and feeling the pain of those perceived injustices. If we go further than that&mdash;this is where I part company with my Liberal Democrat colleagues, who are urging a collective solution&mdash;and say that we must give a collective pardon to everybody irrespective of the facts of the individual cases, I fear that we will open up a Pandora's box. That was hinted at by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk when he referred to the events of the Peninsula war and the Easter rising. It is a convenient political cop-out to be able to say that because we would not do something in this day and age, we as parliamentarians and politicians will pass judgment on what was done in a different day and age when different standards pertained.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/8">If individual cases are to be considered, that should be done&mdash;if it is to be done at all&mdash;on the basis of whether there is any legal mechanism to enable people who have a direct interest in such cases to bring an action. Even then, this is a matter for lawyers and the courts; it is not a matter for politicians and Parliament. In that respect I go some way towards the position of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase>, who made a thoughtful contribution. We also face a problem of boundaries. If we make the wrong decision, we will open up an endless process of historical review, which will not do good service to the cause of political debate in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/9">Let me return to the question of who this is for. If it is for the people who were killed, it can only be so in some spiritual sense that would depend on one's religious viewpoint. If one believes that those people still have some sort of entity or existence, they do so in a dimension where our consideration of their cases makes little difference. If it is for the families, then the only basis on which anything could justifiably be proceeded with would be where there are still a small number of survivors who are directly affected by what happened in the individual case. However, if it is for the historical record, we have to be very careful indeed; we as politicians would be entering into a rewriting of that record, when the historical record ought to be written by historians.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/10">Even in our day and age, there is still not entire agreement on the record of the first world war. A recently published book by a leading historian entitled &quot;Forgotten Victory: The First World War&mdash;Myths and Realities&quot; seeks to rehabilitate many of the leading figures of that war who have been so effectively satirised in the years in between. I think that it overstates its case, but those are matters that it is appropriate for historians to debate and settle.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/11">In respect of our debate today, the line can be correctly drawn only at the point at which the people who were directly affected cease to be living in this world and wishing to bring an action. The strongest case that has been made in this debate for any sort of consideration has been the pain, the stigma and the shame that was inflicted on the families of those concerned. I maintain that, once those family members are no longer living, the correct approach is for justice to be done by historians, and that politicians meddle in this sensitive area at their peril.</p>

	<p pid="b.258.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> on securing this debate on the soldiers who were executed in the first world war. I wish to state at the outset that the Government did not believe that the review that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence carried out in 1998 would end this issue, and this debate has demonstrated that.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/2">The issue has been raised many times in this House and outside. It provokes powerful emotions, and there are strong and principled views on both sides of the debate. It is not solely a moral question, or a point of law, or an exercise in historical investigation. Rather, it is a complex debate with strong moral, legal and historical factors, every one of which is relevant, and every one of which is powerfully argued. I am glad to have had the opportunity to listen to the points raised, and to have this chance to explain the Government's position.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/3">The previous Government considered these cases and decided that they were not able to take any action. The Labour party when in opposition promised a full and open investigation. We honoured that pledge when we came to office in 1997. The then Minister for the Armed Forces, my right hon. Friend the present Secretary of State, immediately set up a review into the whole subject of the executions and the possibility of recommending pardons. The summary of that review is in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/4">The best view is of course that looking back&mdash;the view of &quot;what if?&quot; and &quot;if only&quot;&mdash;but we must not forget the circumstances in which the cases were brought. We must be very careful not to blame the members of the courts martial. The officers who conducted the trials were honourably and conscientiously doing their very best to discharge their responsibilities and their duties and to see that justice was done.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/5">The review made a detailed consideration of shell shock&mdash;of both the way in which it was understood and treated at the time, and the way in which courts martial dealt with it as a possible defence or mitigation. All the issues were set in their historical context and all the case files held in the country were reviewed. As the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State reviewed more than 100 cases himself. The review sought advice from historians, lawyers and medical experts, and of course veterans and the people seeking the pardons played a vital part in the discussions that my right hon. Friend held.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/6">It is important to make it clear how and why pardons are granted. A free pardon excuses a person from all penalties imposed at trial in recognition that that person was technically and morally innocent of the charges against them. A conditional pardon reduces the penalty to a lesser one. In order to make a recommendation to the sovereign for a pardon under the royal prerogative, the Secretary of State would need to be satisfied for a free pardon that each individual was technically and morally innocent of the offence, and for a conditional pardon there would have to be compelling grounds that a lesser sentence than the one imposed was more appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/7">The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk is a distinguished historian, and I am sure that he would agree that anyone who has studied the records and eye-witness accounts, heard or read the poetry, looked at the photographs or talked to those who survived the trenches, will realise that some places came as close to hell on earth as anyone could possibly imagine, and that it was an awful experience for those involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/8">That conclusion is borne out by the tremendous weight of evidence&mdash;there really is no doubt about it. Unfortunately, we cannot say the same about the evidence that survives from the courts martial that condemned the soldiers to death. There is no doubt that the records are very thin. I have the documents for the Harry Farr case; there are six and a half pages, and they are handwritten. Therefore, there is very little information about what was actually said at his court martial. Those records that have survived are&mdash;and were intended to be at the time&mdash;a summary rather than a full account of the proceedings and leave many questions unanswered.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/9">At the time of the review, my right hon. Friend wished, as do many others, to treat together all those who were executed. However, in order to consider pardoning a group of people, there needs to be sufficient evidence to meet the test in each individual case. As that level of evidence is lacking in most&mdash;perhaps all&mdash;of the cases, consideration of a blanket pardon was believed during my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's review not to be possible. The approach that I described, in which each case is treated individually, was considered to be proper in the context of possible statutory pardons as well as pardons under the royal prerogative.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/10">Since my right hon. Friend's review, the New Zealand Government have passed an Act of Parliament establishing a form of statutory pardon for each of the five members of the New Zealand expeditionary force executed during the first world war. The stated aim of the Act was to remove, as far as practicable, the dishonour that the execution of the five soldiers brought on them and their families. The Act is relevant to our considerations. A number of Members in this House and the other place are pressing the Government to consider a similar Act of Parliament to pardon all those executed to whom we have referred in this debate. That would represent a major step, but it could not be undertaken without careful consideration of its far-reaching implications.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/11">I am aware of the private Member's Bill promoted by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase>, which will be considered on Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-03">3 March</phrase>. The Bill requires pardons to be granted to all those executed, possibly after consideration of each case by an international body of judges that would have to be appointed. However, when my hon. Friend presents his Bill, an important point to consider will be the fact that it does not state exactly what test would be applied in order to make a decision, and that is key to reaching any conclusions on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.0/12">At the end of the detailed review of all the issues in 1998, my right hon. Friend concluded that it would not be just or compassionate to put the cases of those who were executed to the pardon test just to see most&mdash;quite possibly all&mdash;of them fail. He particularly did not wish to take a course of action that, although it might lead to pardons for a few of the men, would leave most without a pardon and thus still condemned.</p>

	<p pid="b.260.0/1">I am sorry that I could not be here at the beginning of the debate. I have listened to the Minister and the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase>, and I must say that the tenor of the remarks disturbs me.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.0/2">My granddad, Tom King, was born in 1899. He was a captain's runner in the first world war, hopping between trenches, and it is amazing that he survived to return; indeed, he joined the Labour party when he did. I know, from the stories that he told me of the horrors that he faced in the trenches, that for him the most disorientating time of all was going on leave, because the Germans knew when he and his fellow soldiers were going and used to shell the trains, so they never knew where they stood. I heard from him how badly affected most, if not all, those young people were. It has been a surprise to me that, since 1997, my Labour Government, and my granddad's Labour party, have not been persuaded to take steps to make pardons possible for some of those soldiers suffering from shell shock.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18b.260.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" speakername="Don Touhig" colnum="260"  time="010:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060118/halltext/60118h01.htm#60118h01_spnew13">
	<p pid="b.260.1/1">My very first experience as a councillor, before I came to this House, was of laying a wreath at the cenotaph. I stood next to the secretary of my local Labour party branch. He was one of four brothers who went to the first world war, and the names of three brothers are on the cenotaph. I fully understand the horrors and the consequences, but no one could say that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, when Minister for the Armed Forces, did not carry out the most exhaustive, determined examination of the issues with a desire to do something about the matter. As colleagues have explained, and as I seek to explain, there are difficulties about simply agreeing to a pardon in the way that my hon. Friend strongly advocates.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/2">At the time of the review, my right hon. Friend felt strongly&mdash;particularly with respect to the families of the executed and those who still remembered them&mdash;that it was simply not right to take no further action, and so he made a statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="1998-07-24">24 July 1998</phrase>. He said that the House acknowledged and expressed deep regret for the loss of life and remembered all those who endured such terrible conditions, those who died at the hands of the enemy, those who were executed and those who did their awful duty of being part of the firing squads. He said that all those executed should be recognised as victims of a terrible war. The Government then asked that the names of the executed men be added to war memorials and books of remembrance throughout the country. That is public recognition and a sign of the lifting of the stigma of execution from the men and their families, and I am pleased that many communities around the country did precisely what was asked.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/3">The men who were executed are commemorated in the national memorial arboretum, where a very fitting memorial was dedicated in June 2001. They are remembered among their fallen comrades, and the sacrifice of all their lives is honoured and acknowledged.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/4">Although the Government felt that it was not right to put all cases to the pardon test only for most of them to fail, it was always open to individuals, particularly the families of the executed, to petition the sovereign and seek a pardon for a particular serviceman. If such a petition is received it is, of course, considered on its merits. The Secretary of State has to determine whether he can recommend that the sovereign grant a pardon, whether free or conditional, on the basis of the evidence available. That is what happened in the case of Private Harry Farr, who was executed in 1916. The rejection of the petition submitted by his daughter is now the subject of a judicial review. The courts have accepted that there are no arguable grounds to challenge the rejection of a free pardon, but the hearing was adjourned in October following the submission of new legal arguments about the possibility of a conditional pardon. Those points are still being considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/5">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has asked me to take an overview of our considerations and to report to him directly when considerations are complete. I am sure that hon. Members will accept that it is difficult for me to say much more about the Farr case because of that. However, I emphasise that, as we said in court, there has been no pleasure for the Secretary of State in reaching any of his decisions in relation to the rejection of the petition on Private Farr. As I said, we have not yet reached a further conclusion on the new grounds submitted to us, but the Secretary of State and the Government&mdash;all of us&mdash;have the greatest sympathy for Private Farr's daughter and her family, who conducted the campaign on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/6">Another matter in which hon. Members will have an interest is the response to the report submitted to the Government by the Irish Foreign Minister in October 2004. It seeks pardon for 26 Irish soldiers executed during the first world war. We are considering our response to the Irish Government on that; we will, of course, make it public. Throughout this debate, and over many years, the Government have approached the cases that we are discussing with a sympathetic heart and an open mind&mdash;a point made by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk when he responded to the statement made in July 1998.</p>

	<p pid="b.261.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I am tight for time and there are a couple of points that I would like to make.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/2">We regard the soldiers who were executed as victims, along with millions of others, of a cataclysmic and ghastly war.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/3">The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk asked me a number of questions, and I shall briefly respond to them. He asked whether any documents had come to light. No new documents have come to light in support of the case from any source whatever. No files have been found of those sentenced to death but reprieved; they would have been routinely destroyed, and we know that some were destroyed during the bombing in the last world war. The Government's legal view on the matter has not changed, but of course we must await the judgment in the Farr case before we can determine a reaction to it. As I said, we are considering the request from the Irish Government, and we will respond to it in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/4">My hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> made a moving comment about the stigma attached to families. We fully understand that, and it motivates us to try to be reasonable and do something. I do not agree with her that the Criminal Cases Review Commission is the way to deal with the matter; I do not think that that approach would solve the problem for us.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1767" name="Mike Hancock">The hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock)</phrase> made it quite clear that he believes, as do a number of colleagues, that a pardon is appropriate; I think that he made those remarks in 1998, too. He was supported in what he said by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase>. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">The hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase>, who spoke for the Opposition, posed a number of important questions that are still to be answered if we are to resolve the matter satisfactorily.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/6">I said at the beginning of my reply that we want to resolve the matter. Many hon. Members have raised points that I want to consider. Like all hon. Members, I can only imagine the horrors that people went through in the trenches in the first world war; like all hon. Members, I recognise the painful consequences for the families concerned; and like all hon. Members, I have a desire to ease the pain and suffering that the families are experiencing. However, that has to be done legally if we are to do it properly, and if it is to mean anything at all.</p>

	<p pid="b.263.1/1">This debate is about families in Britain today, in all their variety and complexity. It is also about human rights and the value that we place on people whose love for their family is unconditional and who have hitherto felt excluded from decisions about their own lives. Family life in this country is not just about the nuclear family; it is about the wider or extended family, as well. Unfortunately family policy and the workings of family law often ignore the role of the extended family, in which grandparents play a vital part, nurturing and protecting children and acting as carers, role models, links to the past of the family and bridges to the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/2">There are 13 million grandparents in the United Kingdom, each with an average of 4.4 grandchildren. One in five children is looked after by a grandparent, 60 per cent. of child care is provided by grandparents and three quarters of the UK population has a family of three generations or more. The care undertaken by grandparents would have an equivalent day-care cost of &pound;1 billion, yet grandparents are becoming the proxy victims of family break-up, feuds, separation and divorce. Each year divorce affects 150,000 children, two thirds of whom are under the age of 10. Some 200,000 non-custodial fathers have lost contact with their children. Given that custody is vastly disproportionately awarded to mothers, paternal grandparents are particularly affected, and are estranged from their own grandchildren through no fault of their own. Up to 1 million children are in that position.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/3">The human cost of family breakdown falls on the extended family, too. I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>, who has kept the issue at the top of the political agenda in the context of a study entitled &quot;Britain's Pensioner Parents: the quandary of parenting your grandchildren&quot;, which was published in June 2005. I thank him for his continuing support for organisations such as Grandparents Plus, the Grandparents Association and the Family Rights Group. He has also kept the issue alive with early-day motion 601&mdash;&quot;Grandparents who act as parents&quot;&mdash;which I was privileged to sign with 54 other hon. Members last July.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/4">The case for reform, both financial and legal, is compelling. It is a matter not only of arcane legal issues, but of human rights, natural justice, fairness and equity, as well as economic and practical good sense. It is also about respecting people whose love for their children's children can make estrangement so painful that some of them are suicidal as a result.</p>

	<p pid="b.263.2/1">My hon. Friend talked about human rights and legal issues. I should like to make a point on behalf of my constituents, Mr. and Mrs. Jennings. At a time in their life when their income is diminished&mdash;they are coming up to retirement&mdash;they have, through no fault of their own, found themselves sole carers for two very young grandchildren, both under the age of five. To their horror, what Mr. and Mrs. Jennings and other grandparents have found&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> has highlighted the issue&mdash;is that in taking on the official role of foster parents, they are not entitled to the same rights as foster parents who are not related to their foster children. They do not have rights to the same income, allowances or benefits as unrelated foster parents. As a result, they find themselves bringing up their grandchildren in greatly diminished circumstances&mdash;worse circumstances than if their grandchildren had gone to foster parents who were not members of the family. Does my hon. Friend agree that that issue needs to be addressed and answered by the Minister?</p>

	<p pid="b.264.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention. Later in my speech, I shall make further reference to the points made by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead in his report about the financial burden of being de facto foster parents, often as a result of alcohol or narcotics abuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/2">Whatever the intention behind the Children Act 1989, its practical ramifications have led to a de facto presumption against grandparents' access to their own grandchildren. Grandparents have very few legal rights. Section 8 of the Act forces them to go through two legal hurdles to secure legal access to their own flesh and blood. They have no automatic right to apply for a contact order, but must first obtain the permission of the court so to do. That is more difficult if the child is already fostered or adopted, and legally next to impossible if the parents are not married. Can one imagine the heartache of being separated from a grandchild who has been adopted, and, as a result of a prescriptive contact order, being allowed to send that grandchild a Christmas card only if the words &quot;Nanny&quot; or &quot;Grandad&quot; are not written on it? That is the action of a callous state machinery inflicted on people who are as much the victims of family disintegration and breakdown as their grandchildren.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/3">When a child is taken into care, the local authority has a duty to promote contact with the family as long as that is not incompatible with the welfare of the child or children. Section 23(6) of the 1989 Act imposes a responsibility on the local authority in respect of children who are looked after so that the presumption of care lies with family and friends in the first instance, and only then with foster carers and adopters. However, that is clearly not happening in practice. Often social services departments do not regard grandparents as a priority; rightly, they do not wish to be seen to be offending foster parents or adopters. In fact, we are seeing less, not more, parity between non-family and family carers. As of <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-30">30 December 2005</phrase>, foster carers can apply for a residence order or special guardianship order without seeking leave if a child has been living with them for 12 months, but family and friends cannot do that unless they are already registered as foster parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/4">According to experienced family law solicitors and data from the Grandparents Association and other helplines, the legal costs of leave to apply for a contact order&mdash;not including the contact order itself&mdash;can run to between &pound;250 and &pound;1,000. Many grandparents lack the means to meet those obligations and the confidence to cope with the legal system. Some live in relative poverty and therefore forgo the proper legal representation that would assist them in a traumatic and emotional process. Even after going through such a process, there is no guarantee that the contact order will not be breached. The experience in Scotland, whose Parliament has recently debated the Family Law (Scotland) Bill, suggests that parenting agreements and a grandparents charter are fine in principle if one thinks that the only way to overcome the problems is through mediation. However, only legislation&mdash;or the amendment of it&mdash;is appropriate to safeguard grandparents' rights and bring fairness and equality into this aspect of family law.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/5">Let us consider the financial impact on grandparents who are struggling to fulfil their child care role as foster carers, especially in cases where the parents are absent. Under section 105 of the 1989 Act, a private arrangement for relatives to care for a child can be agreed with the consent of the parents, but invariably attracts no financial support from the local authority. The same applies when a local authority facilitates an informal placement of a child with family members: under regulation 38 of the Fostering Services Regulations 2002, grandparents can be financially unsupported for weeks or months. Even a residence order allowance is discretionary. Only when grandparents or other relatives are assessed as foster carers under section 23(2) of the 1989 Act will they attract a fostering allowance, and even then there is sometimes pressure from the local authority for them to apply for a special guardianship order, after which the financial help will cease.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/6">In his report, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead presents eloquent testimony to the heroic efforts of the decent people in his constituency on the Wirral who have given up the prospect of a relatively comfortable, if not rich, retirement&mdash;or indeed a quiet retirement&mdash;to care for their grandchildren. The bulk of them receive barely &pound;30 from the state for each grandchild that they look after. That is not taking into account any legal costs such as care orders. Generally, research shows that family carers are poorer&mdash;some live in poverty&mdash;and older and are more likely to be single parents than &quot;stranger foster carers&quot;, which is an emotive term that I do not like, but it is used officially.</p>

	<p pid="b.265.0/1">I am listening with great interest to what my hon. Friend has to say. Does he agree that despite the best endeavours of all those of us who were involved in the Adoption and Children Act 2002, which brought great changes to adoption and fostering services, still not enough priority is given to extended family members, particularly grandparents, in taking on the role of foster carers or the new role that they have under that Act? Does he not agree that it is preferable that we should look to extended family members to take over the children of a family that has broken down before having to look to foster carers or adoptive parents, who do not have the family connections? The reality now is that such an approach is not taken nearly enough.</p>

	<p pid="b.265.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his timely and helpful intervention. I agree wholeheartedly that anecdotal and empirical evidence shows that despite the good intentions underlying the Children Act 1989, social services, which are quite often under financial or time pressure and do not wish to alienate foster parents because they have difficulty in recruiting foster parents and adoptive parents, choose the path of least resistance, which often excludes extended family members.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/2">What is to be done? I urge the Minister to examine the following modest but important proposals. First, the Government should remove the unnecessary and iniquitous requirement to obtain leave to apply before a contact order may be sought under section 8 of the 1989 Act. Such an action would not require primary legislation and could be enacted by secondary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/3">Secondly, the Government should re-examine section 17 of the 1989 Act and issue regulations so that all children who cannot live with their parents and are cared for by family and friends should have a right to assessment. That will examine the financial aspects of grandparents' care for their grandchildren. Similarly, section 23 of the 1989 Act needs to be adhered to in practice, not just in theory. Above all, we need consistency across local authorities and other agencies on the issues of payments made under section 17 of the 1989 Act to family carers.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/4">Thirdly, section 10 of the 1989 Act should be amended to provide parity between family and non-family carers&mdash;for example, by reducing the residence criterion for the former from three years out of five to one year out of three. That would still screen out unsuitable carers, but would maintain the strong bond between applicants and children.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/5">All of those proposals can be contained within a new set of principles governing placements, which would inform placement decision making by local authorities, and enforce the requirement on courts, local authorities and others to give careful consideration to and to act on the principle that any non-family placement should proceed only if it has been demonstrated that care in the family network would not both promote and safeguard the child's welfare. That would correct the present legal imbalance.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.1/6">In conclusion, the Government have an opportunity today to offer hope to those whose voices have not been heard&mdash;to those who are working for the state by proxy, sustained by selflessness and dedication, whose sole aim is to give their kin the very best start in life, sometimes at the cost of their own health and well-being. I trust that the Minister will grasp this opportunity and justify that hope.</p>

	<p pid="b.266.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1759" name="Stewart Jackson">the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson)</phrase> on obtaining this well timed debate&mdash;not that much time passes without a Bill or Act with &quot;children&quot; in the title coming before the House. In that sense such debates are always well timed.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/2">I see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> in his place. Legislation to deal with contact issues and some aspects of the way in which the courts deal with these matters will be introduced in the House soon. The debate is well timed in that sense, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/3">I congratulate the hon. Member for Peterborough on the thoughtful way in which he presented his case. I shall say a little about the present position and try in the time available to me to respond to the points that he made.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/4">The Government recognise and value the important role that grandparents play in their grandchildren's lives. Whether families are together, divorced or otherwise, grandparents play an essential part in the upbringing of any child lucky enough to have them. No one disputes that. We know that grandparents can make a vital emotional, and sometimes financial, contribution to the lives of their grandchildren.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/5">Many grandparents are already involved in the care of their grandchildren&mdash;the hon. Gentleman quoted some statistics&mdash;and most children see their grandparents as important figures in their lives and enjoy the time that they spend with them, perhaps because with their grandparents they can get away with a little more than they would with their parents. That in itself can contribute to happy childhoods. Such elements are essential to the children's development and future lives. I want to make it clear that there is no dispute about the grandparents' importance in the lives of their grandchildren.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/6">The hon. Gentleman suggested that the voices of grandparents are not heard. I understand the points that he made about how courts can appear. Many people, not just grandparents, feel that their voices are not heard when they have to deal with the courts. However, the Government do listen to the voices of grandparents and their organised groups&mdash;he referred to the Family Rights Group and the Grandparents Association. I have had the benefit of meeting many such groups and I always examine their contributions to the reports that are prepared by various forums in the House, whether as part of pre-legislative scrutiny or by Select Committees.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/7">The Government listen to the organised grandparents' groups, which have made some of the points that the hon. Gentleman made. We have been known to fund grandparents' organisations to produce advice sheets and resource packs for local authorities that are engaged in work force training. The hon. Gentleman mentioned work force issues and the culture and approaches taken by some of the professions that traditionally deal with family breakdown and looked-after children.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/8">I do not accept that the voices of grandparents are not heard by Government. I understand why many grandparents, because of their personal experience and that of others, might feel that their voices are not heard sufficiently or that their being heard has not resulted in all the aims of their various campaigns being achieved, but I do not accept that we do not listen. We do listen, and it is important that we do.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/9">The hon. Gentleman asked about the requirement that grandparents must have the leave of the court to apply for a contact order. He suggested that the balance struck in the Children Act was wrong. I remind the House that at the centre of the 1989 Act&mdash;a landmark piece of legislation which remains at the heart of the way in which we deal with issues of safeguarding children and the lives of children&mdash;is the paramountcy principle. The interests of the child are paramount when making decisions on often difficult and emotive cases of family breakdown and on what should happen to children who, for various reasons, can no longer live with their parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/10">We must always bear that important principle in mind&mdash;the interests of the child are paramount. I believe that absolutely. That principle is an important factor in our approach to all such matters and it has implications for the approach taken by the courts. The main implication of the principle is that, as it says on the tin, the needs and interests of the individual child is paramount in each set of circumstances and must remain so. Inevitably, that may conflict with other groups' interests. Fathers' groups have been campaigning&mdash;more vocally recently&mdash;and suggesting that family courts do not treat them fairly. They say that there should be changes to the way in which the Children Act should work, particularly in respect of the paramountcy principle.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/11">The paramountcy principle must be paramount if it is to live up to its name. The interests of the child must be paramount. Although the principle does not negate the interests of grandparents, the courts must put the interests of the child first and foremost.</p>

	<p pid="b.268.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister, who in her reasonable and fair-minded way is answering my speech point by point. However, removing the requirement to seek leave would not necessarily breach the principle of the paramountcy of children's rights and their long-term welfare. It would simply represent a tidying-up exercise and an attempt to return some parity and fairness to a difficult situation that can be traumatic for grandparents.</p>

	<p pid="b.268.1/1">I do not deny that grandparents can be adversely affected by the break-up of their children's families, or that that they can feel distressed and left out if, as a consequence of the break-up, they start to lose access to their grandchildren. The 1989 Act recognises that, even if there is parental opposition, it could be in the interests of a child to maintain contact with their grandparents. No one has a veto. The parent does not have a veto. Subject to the paramountcy principle, the court will take into account the importance of grandparents and other relatives to the lives of children.</p>

	<p pid="b.268.2/1">This issue is a hoary old chestnut, and if the Minister and I come up against each other during consideration of a new children and adoption Bill, we shall deal with the subject in detail. However, will she acknowledge that the paramountcy of the welfare of the child&mdash;a principle to which we all adhere&mdash;is not compromised by access to non-resident parents and grandparents? In the right circumstances, access to a loving family member, be it grandparent or father, should contribute to a child's welfare. Those ideas are not mutually exclusive. This has been a bone of contention between us before. Does the Minister now acknowledge that that is right?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18b.268.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" speakername="Maria Eagle" colnum="268"  time="011:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060118/halltext/60118h02.htm#60118h02_spnew8">
	<p pid="b.268.3/1">As we discuss these matters in general terms, it is not possible to say whether that is right. In some circumstances, the paramountcy of the child's interest could be compromised by access for grandparents, other relatives or non-resident parents. The role of the court is to take the law as Parliament sets it down and to apply it to individual cases. As an ex-lawyer, I am wary of putting myself in the place of the judge. We lay down the general principles and the courts will in good faith apply them to individual cases as they arise.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.3/2">The Government are not convinced that the safeguard of requiring leave to apply should be removed. We must do what we can to avoid involving children in unnecessary court proceedings, especially adversarial court proceedings, which can be distressing and bewildering for adults, let alone children. Such proceedings are costly, too. Removing the requirement would immediately bring in four more parties to start court proceedings. I am not saying that that would happen in every case, but it could, and the court must have a way to screen cases if, knowing all the circumstances, it feels that proceedings are unnecessary. Without the court having an initial opportunity to consider whether there would be any likely benefit to the child, it is difficult to understand how it could do that in each individual case.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.3/3">This is an important matter and we will have an opportunity in the not-too-distant future to explore it in more detail. I suspect that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and I will engage in debate in another forum. However, it would not be fair of me to suggest today that the Government are convinced of the need for change.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.3/4">The hon. Gentleman will remember that during the passage of the Adoption and Children Bill, a commitment was made to consider what changes to guidance and secondary legislation would be necessary to ensure that the application for leave process did not turn into a huge barrier. The process is meant to be not a costly, horrendous and huge barrier, but a safeguard to ensure paramountcy of the child's interests. The Department for Education and Skills is considering the issue, and I expect consideration to be completed sometime this year. I know that that is rather vague.</p>

	<p pid="b.269.0/1">I am grateful for the Minister's patience&mdash;I know that time is short. May I press her on the two specific issues, which I mentioned at the end of my remarks, relating to the review that she has announced today? Will that review consider section 17 of the Children Act 1989, which deals with the right to assessment and section 23, which provides the presumption in favour of family members?</p>

	<p pid="b.270.0/1">I fear that the hon. Gentleman has misheard me, or perhaps I did not speak clearly enough. The review to which I referred was provided for during the passage of the Adoption and Children Bill in 2002, as the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham will recall. It was to consider whether the perceived barrier that the obligation to apply for leave represents could be minimised as much as possible. Let me make it clear that I am not announcing a review today. There are quite enough ongoing reviews of that area of law without the hon. Member for Peterborough thinking that I am announcing another one. However, we will have further opportunities to consider that issue and others relating to how to make contact work and making it easier.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.0/2">The new Bill, which will be introduced fairly soon, will cover contact for grandparents. Sometimes the reason why grandparents cannot see their grandchildren is that parents do not comply with the contact order. The new legislation will assist grandparents by giving the courts new and wider powers, rather than just the sledgehammer of imprisonment, to ensure that when the court has ordered contact and it is in the interests of the child&mdash;that is what the order means&mdash;it goes ahead. The new legislation will be of great benefit to many grandparents who have contact orders to see their grandchildren but cannot do so, particularly when the court is reluctant to resort to imprisonment. It is difficult to argue that imprisonment of the resident parent is in the best interests of the child.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.0/3">We know that there are difficulties and I hope that the new Bill will address them satisfactorily. I am sure that we shall have a chance to discuss the issues in more detail during the passage of that legislation. We are short of time, so I conclude by congratulating the hon. Member for Peterborough again.</p>

</major-heading>

	<p pid="b.271.1/1">Mr. Bayley, I should like to thank Mr. Speaker for choosing this subject for debate and for appointing me leader of the Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation to the Palestinian territories&mdash;the first ever such delegation&mdash;from which this debate arises. I thank my colleagues who were with me on that delegation, and I thank the IPU staff, Mr. Courtenay and his colleagues, for the remarkable care that they took in organising the visit.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/2">I have been for very many years, and from long before he became Prime Minister, a critic of the policies of Ariel Sharon. I think it appropriate for all of us to express our deep sympathy to his family for the ordeal through which Mr. Sharon is going. Nobody, whatever their opposition to his policies, would have wished on him such dreadful suffering as he is now undergoing. It must also be said, however, that whatever the trauma through which Mr. Sharon and his family are going at present, it does not detract from the baleful effect of the policies pursued by the Israeli Government during the period of the second intifada, which began in 2000, and which was triggered by Mr. Sharon's visit to the Haram-esh-Sharif, which my colleagues and I visited when we were in the Palestinian territories.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/3">Those territories are one of the smallest areas in the world, yet that tiny Palestinian territory must be one of the most militarised in the world. There are Israeli troops and checkpoints all over the Palestinian territories; there are more than 600 fixed checkpoints. Between mid-November and <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-03">3 January</phrase>, there were no fewer than 824 flying checkpoints in that territory. My colleagues and I encountered those checkpoints everywhere that we went.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/4">We were involved, through no provocation of our own, in several disagreeable incidents relating to the way in which Israeli troops either prevented us from moving, or harangued us, or from preventing us from trying to speak to Palestinians when we were paying our visit. As I pointed out to my honourable colleagues, although those incidents were disagreeable, the fact is that we were going home at the end of our visit, whereas the Palestinians had to live with much worse every day of their lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/5">I have visited that area and those territories more times than I can count. Not so long ago, I was able to drive uninterrupted, from Natanya&mdash;where recently a terrorist bomb incident took place&mdash;right through to Cairo, without any obstruction. When I attended a conference in Ramallah, not many years ago, I was able, at the end of the conference, to hire a Palestinian taxi and drive right through to Aqaba in Jordan, again without being interrupted or prevented in any way whatever. To imagine that that might be possible for anybody, including an overseas visitor, today is absolutely chimerical. It is almost impossible to move about freely in those territories.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/6">The latest information we have is that during the past few weeks, between 13 and 29 main roads in the Palestinian territories have been closed by Israeli troops, and the average number of roads closed in those territories every single day is 20. At every point of the way where one goes, there are the fixed checkpoints and flying checkpoints. Although we were delayed on occasion for 45 minutes simply trying to get into one town or another, the Palestinians can be delayed for hours. Although we were delayed simply while paying a visit, they are delayed or prevented altogether from getting to their jobs and to hospitals, schools and universities. Normal life in those territories is absolutely impossible.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/7">I have visited Bethlehem many times. When we were there, Manger square was empty except for a small celebration of Palestine national day, and the church of the nativity, which used to be so crowded that one could scarcely move in it, had just two groups of visitors. At Christmas, when the number of visitors to Bethlehem used to be enormous, there was only a fraction of the number of visitors who used to go to worship in the church of the nativity. In any case, just as we were there, a new obstruction was erected by the Israeli authorities that makes access to Bethlehem difficult, if not impossible. That town's livelihood is being strangled, because it depends so much on pilgrims and visitors.</p>

	<p pid="b.272.0/1">I met the mayor of Bethlehem just before Christmas in this place, and he told me that the Israelis had built the separation wall through the middle of one of Bethlehem's cemeteries. Will my right hon. Friend join me in condemning that action?</p>

	<p pid="b.272.1/1">Certainly. The obstructions, which are obstructions to worship among other things, in Bethlehem and other towns and cities are extraordinary and outrageous. When we were in Hebron, for example, a barrier was such that people within seconds of a mosque had to do a circuitous walk of 25 minutes to go and pray at that mosque; that is, of course, if they were allowed to move at all. The Israelis are making a huge fuss at the moment about ejecting a handful of foreign agitators who are assisting people who have settled illegally in the old city of Hebron. The centre of Hebron, which I used to visit and where I used to buy food and shop for the famous Hebron glass, is now totally deserted. It is a ghost city because of the walls, huts, turnstiles and gates through which people have to go if they are to get into Hebron, and the fact is that they do not get in.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/2">When a group of Palestinians was showing us the situation, we arrived at a junction through which two busloads of illegal Jewish settlers had just passed with no obstruction whatever. We were met by Israeli troops, who pointed their guns at us. When I explained to them who we were and what we were seeking to do, they sought authority from an officer over the telephone and then told us, &quot;You can pass; the Arabs cannot.&quot; Of course, we did not proceed.</p>

	<p pid="b.272.2/1">I applaud my right hon. Friend for initiating this important debate. What he says about the suffering in the Palestinian territories is undoubtedly true. I visited Hebron with the Labour middle east council about 18 months ago&mdash;I thank the council for that opportunity&mdash;and the grotesque realities of what is happening there show the very worst aspects of what he is talking about.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.2/2">Does my right hon. Friend also appreciate what I believe to be true; that what is happening in Hebron is not indicative of the moderate opinion of the Israeli majority and that, frankly, we should be putting pressure on people to support changes in Israeli politics to ensure that such things do not happen?</p>

	<p pid="b.273.0/1">I would like to think that my hon. Friend is right; certainly hundreds of thousands of Israelis, if not many more, would be filled with revulsion at what is going on in the Palestinian territories if they were to see it for themselves. When I first visited the Palestinian territories and for many years afterwards, Israeli tourists would visit the towns and cities; but no Israeli in his or her right mind would go into Palestinian territories now because their lives would be in danger. The only Israelis who see what is going on now are the troops, including reserve troops. I am sure that there are vast numbers of decent Israelis who, if they saw what was going on, would be physically sickened by it.</p>

	<p pid="b.273.1/1">The very change in climate to which my right hon. Friend refers&mdash;that Israelis could visit those areas at one time but can no longer do so in safety&mdash;is surely indicative of the fact that a solution to the problem is running further and further away as a direct result of the measures that have been taken over the years.</p>

	<p pid="b.273.2/1">I hope to refer to the point to which my hon. Friend draws our attention before I conclude. It is a fact that access to the towns through checkpoints makes things very difficult for Israelis. I had my doubts about doing so, but we were advised that it would be easier for us to move around the territories in a minibus that had Israeli licence plates. When we approached Tulkarm, however, the troops stopped us at the gates and told us that we could not go any further because we were in a vehicle with Israeli licence plates. They told us that we would have to get out and take taxis, but although one was extremely abusive, they subsequently backed down and allowed us to proceed.</p>

	<p pid="b.273.5/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his generosity in giving way. I have a particular interest, having returned last Friday from a visit to Israel hosted by the Conservative Friends of Israel. The point that the right hon. Gentleman makes about security barriers and mobility for Israelis and Palestinians is well made. However, those barriers are in place not for the convenience of one side or the other. Indeed, they are inconvenient and, as one nears Jerusalem, they seem grotesque and ugly. Nevertheless, although they have reduced mobility they have also reduced terrorism, perhaps to the tune of 90 per cent. The reality is that 761 Israeli citizens have died as a result of terrorist activities, so the barriers are indeed a safety measure; they give no one any pleasure, but they are necessary because of the situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.274.0/1">They have not stopped a number of terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens in their own cities. They did not stop the recent attack on Israeli that killed five people in Natanya. In crude realpolitik terms, I suppose that the Israeli measures could be justified if they worked, but there is no indication that they do. What is more, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" name="Frank Cook">the Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook)</phrase> said, the prospect for the future is dread and dire, as I shall try to explain.</p>

	<p pid="b.274.2/1">I am grateful for hon. Members' interest but, as I say, there is good attendance today, a considerable number of hon. Members wish to speak and I do not want to take up a disproportionate amount of the time. I hope that hon. Members will forgive me if I do not give way, at this point at any rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/2">As I was saying, we went to Tulkarm to see the wall. The wall is not a barrier within the old green line. It would be ugly if it were, but it could be justified. However, it goes deep into Palestinian territory. It has divided Jerusalem and locked 55,000 Palestinian Jerusalemites out of Jerusalem. It has cut the west bank in two. Whereas what I personally regard as the melodramatic charade of the removal of the settlers from Gaza has taken place, removing 8,000 settlers, last year there were more than 9,000 illegal settlers in the west bank. Some 450,000 Israeli settlers are illegally settled there and the Israeli Government have no intention of removing them.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/3">In Tulkarm we saw one of the most futile and obscene sights that I have seen even in that territory, which was called the back-to-back procedure. Palestinians wishing to drive goods along were made to unload their goods from the vans. The goods were transferred over a fence to other vans. That was absolutely futile given that the Israeli soldiers who tried to prevent us from talking to the van drivers did not even inspect the goods that were transferred. If there were any bombs or explosives in the goods, they could have continued to be there as they were moved.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/4">Land has been confiscated. We happened by chance to meet a Palestinian who, from a hilltop, showed us one set of olive groves that had been confiscated from him without compensation by the Israelis and another set that was theoretically still owned by him but to which he would not be allowed access to for so long that he would not be able to tend the groves. Eighty per cent. of the wall&mdash;or the barrier, fence or whatever one calls it, as it is all those things&mdash;is inside Palestinian territory; 10 per cent. of west bank territory is being confiscated by the building of the wall. The checkpoints and the other obstructions mean that the rest of the tiny territory is being split up into tiny, ungovernable cantons.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/5">What is the result? The result is poverty on a scale that is comparable to some of the worst third world poverty in Africa, and made more obscene by the fact that it is minutes away from people living at first world standards in illegal settlements on the basis of subsidies from the Israeli Government. There is poverty, malnutrition and deep discontent. Nobody in this room, in this House or, I hope, in this country would in any way condone terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens. As Israelis themselves have said, the festering hatred that is being built up among Palestinians as a result of the way that they are being treated inevitably breeds terrorists.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/6">The situation is worse than that. The wall locks the Palestinians out, but it also locks the Israelis in. My parents came to this country from eastern European ghettos; the Israelis have now created their own ghetto in the Holy Land, because they dare not move beyond the wall, just as the Palestinians are not allowed to move beyond it.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/7">The Palestinian elections take place next week, and they are extremely important. If Hamas does well, as it may well do, the responsibility for that will lie with the Israeli Government for nourishing the roots of Hamas. The sad thing is that Hamas and Likud and Kadima need each other. Each can point to the other. Israelis can say, &quot;We've got to do what we're doing because Hamas and Islamic Jihad are so dangerous&quot;; Hamas and Islamic Jihad can say, &quot;We've got no alternative because the Israelis are oppressing us.&quot; Because of that, we must exert far more pressure on the Israeli Government. The idea of reciprocal measures&mdash;the idea that one of the most powerful military organisations in the world is comparable with the rag, tag and bobtail Palestine security forces and that one movement depends on the other&mdash;is absurd.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/8">I do not condone any extremism among the Palestinians, nor do I condone the corruption that we all know has existed. Years ago, I pleaded with Mr. Arafat to accept the Camp David proposals. I am not saying that the Palestinians have behaved entirely sensibly and moderately, but the fact is that persecution and oppression breed recalcitrant behaviour, and that is what we are witnessing today.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.2/9">Some of my hon. Friends and I went to see the Prime Minister about this matter last week. Let us be clear about it; let us set aside the human rights issues that are involved and just look at the fact that until the Palestinian issue is solved, the middle east will be a powderkeg. All extremist movements, as well as good and moderate Arab opinion throughout the region, will not allow settlements to take place until the Palestinians have the right to their own land, which the Israeli Government have, on paper at least, accepted. Our Government have a great deal of influence in the region, and I look to them to take even more action than they have already taken to try to bring a solution to what is one of the most tragic situations in the world.</p>

	<p pid="b.275.1/1">I shall be extremely brief. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> on making a remarkable and moving speech. Unlike him, I have never had the privilege of visiting either Israel or the occupied territories, but I have often visited other parts of the Arab world.</p>
	<p pid="b.275.1/2">I wish to say two things. First, I will provide a further piece of evidence in support of the compelling speech I have just heard. Recently, the ambassador of one of the most moderate, decent, reasonable and pro-western Arab countries&mdash;I shall not name it&mdash;said something to me during a private conversation. It is a country I know extremely well and have visited many times, and where there is total religious freedom. He said to me, &quot;Julian, you cannot imagine the sheer hatred that is overtaking our young people because of what is going on in the occupied territory. This is a sickness that is spreading right across the whole of our region.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.275.1/3">My second point is that my father was in almost the last unit to leave Palestine in 1948, before the effective ethnic cleansing took place that pushed the Palestinians into the 26 per cent. of the country that is now nominally theirs. We all know the indescribable background to 1948&mdash;the deaths of 6 million Jewish people in the concentration camps and the generations of persecution before that, not least the murder of 300,000 Jews in the Ukraine only a generation or so earlier. However, it cannot be in the interests of anybody, whichever side of the ethnic divide in that part of the world, for this to go on. Men such as Moshe Dayan spoke of how they would act when they had won their victory, and our recent former colleague Winston Churchill said that peace must be our opportunity. When one has won the war, that is the opportunity to show a bit of leniency, to realise that one has to live with the others as neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="b.275.1/4">Many of us have a long-term interest in that part of the world. I have a large number of friends in the Lebanon and have been there on many occasions&mdash;some of them rather uncomfortable. It is in the interests of people on both sides of the divide that we make the peace process work. However, in this case, as the right hon. Gentleman said, the stronger party has to move first.</p>

	<p pid="b.276.0/1">I, too, congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> on having secured today's debate and on what has aptly been described as a moving and powerful speech. I do not want to repeat his words, other than to endorse what he said about Ariel Sharon. Whatever criticisms I and others might have of Mr. Sharon's record over the years, none of us would wish on any human being the kind of suffering that he and his family are going through at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/2">My right hon. Friend gave a powerful account of the impact of closures and movement restrictions, the wall and so on. I shall not repeat that, but would refer hon. Members on both sides of the House to the work of the Open Bethlehem project. That gives a graphic description of what is happening, not only highlighting the impact of the closures, but offering a message of hope about the fact that Bethlehem has to survive and that we all have a responsibility to do all that we can to ensure that it is open to the outside world.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/3">I should like to raise two issues. If I go on for too long on the first, I shall drop the second, because I know that many other hon. Members want to speak. The first is the Palestinian elections next week. I am fortunate in being a member of the team of observers from the UK Parliament going there, and I should like to thank the Foreign Office and the Inter-Parliamentary Union for enabling that delegation to go ahead. I was there last year when the Palestinian presidential elections took place. Some of the lessons of that experience should concern us all in the run-up to next week's elections.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/4">First, democracy is as important for Palestinians as it is for anybody else. They have the same right to exercise democratic choice as anybody else. Last year, I received two impressions of the way in which Palestinians reacted to their elections. One was that they had tremendous pride in the fact that they were breaking the caricatures that too many people paint of them and that they were holding elections. However, the other was a sense that they were not sure that anything was going to change. They seemed to wonder whether, given that they were able to exercise democracy only by the grace and favour of an occupying power, nothing particular would change afterwards. I found that second feeling most prevalent in east Jerusalem. That was partly because of the way in which the people were treated in those elections. It is good to hear that Israel is allowing Palestinians in east Jerusalem to vote next week. However, I have to say that we will all be looking for more co-operation with the democratic process than was seen in East Jerusalem last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/5">Last year, the occupying authorities allowed only about 6,000 of the 120,000 Arab East Jerusalemites to vote in the city, the area known as J1. The rest were forced to travel outside to the area known as J2, sometimes having to run the gauntlet of Israeli checkpoints in order to exercise their democratic rights. The voting procedure in the city was chaotic; people were forced to vote in post offices, alongside people trying to post letters. The choice of post offices was not accidental. The image was that the voters were guests in their own city, and that they were absentee voters casting postal votes for an election about somewhere else&mdash;the west bank. The voting was on the level, but in the post offices, the slot in the ballot boxes was not on the top of the box but on its side, so that it looked as though voters were posting a letter, not casting a ballot.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/6">We look for a better performance than that next week. I know that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> will say more about Jerusalem if she catches your eye, Mr. Bayley, and I ask hon. Members to pay attention to what she says. Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. In the meantime, it is occupied under international law. Israel has no right to pre-empt international law. The international community and, indeed, all of us have a responsibility to make sure that Palestinian democratic rights are respected next week.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/7">I certainly endorse what my right hon. Friend said about how Hamas came to be as prominent as it is. Partly, it is as a result of the Palestinian Authority's failings&mdash;corruption and so on&mdash;which are very much to do with the kind of policies that Israel has pursued in recent years. I ask hon. Members to look seriously at the article in <i>The Guardian </i>today by Chris McGreal. If Hamas does well in next week's election, as is likely, it will present everyone in the international community, but particularly in Israel, with some hard choices.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/8">If hon. Members read the article, they will find that there are changes and debates going on in Hamas. That does not alter the fact that it has been responsible for some utterly appalling attacks over the years, and may be responsible for attacks in future. However, if we are to achieve political change among Palestinians, and are to get into a situation in which the broad mass of Palestinians wish to recognise Israel and to live side by side with it&mdash;as I believe the majority of Palestinians do&mdash;it will involve understanding the changes in political Islam and encouraging the voices of change within it, rather than writing off those involved as an undifferentiated whole, made up of terrorists. The article in <i>The Guardian </i>makes that point well.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/9">My last point about Hamas is that we should not confuse terrorism with refusal to recognise the state of Israel. There are Palestinian groups that recognise the state of Israel that are involved in terrorism, and there are Palestinians who do not recognise the state of Israel who are entirely non-violent. Although I want every Palestinian to recognise the state of Israel, I also want every Israeli to recognise that Palestinians have no fewer rights than they do. If we do not say that it is a precondition for participation in the Israeli political process that every single Israeli political party should recognise that there should be a state of Palestine, it makes absolutely no sense and is unjust to say that every single political party in Palestine should have to recognise the state of Israel to participate in the elections. As I say, I want there to be mutual recognition, but the way to achieve that is to be even-handed, not to load on one side conditions that we would not, and should not, impose on the other.</p>

	<p pid="b.278.0/1">First, I should say that I visited Israel and Jerusalem last week, along with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase>, courtesy of Conservative Friends of Israel.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/2">I wish merely to make two, brief comments. First, let us not doubt the enormous difficulties faced by the Palestinians; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> made a passionate and moving speech, highlighting that point. However, we must not forget that since the second intifada began, more than 1,000 Israelis have been killed as a consequence of terrorism. Given that Israel's population is a tenth of the size of ours, it is not surprising that that has had an enormous impact on Israeli society. Let us consider the impact that the <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July</phrase> bombings had on our country. It was an enormous tragedy and about 50 people died, but it was one instance and relatively small compared with what Israel has had to suffer.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/3">In my visit last week, we travelled up to the Lebanese border. In doing so, we stopped off for a coffee. As we went into a supermarket area of shops, the level of security that was in place was striking. Israelis live with that all the time, because they live constantly with the threat of terrorism. That is not to condone everything that the Israeli Government have done and every action taken by Israelis, but we must bear in mind the extraordinary circumstances in which Israel finds itself and the extraordinary threat of terrorism that it faces.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/4">My second point is about the security barrier. There is no doubt that it is horrendous, ugly and disruptive and places enormous burdens on the Palestinian people. However, it has been effective in reducing the number of deaths. I will give some statistics. In the 34 months from the beginning of the intifada until August 2003, when the first part of the barrier was put in place, there were 73 terrorist attacks in Israel and 293 people were murdered. In the following 11 months&mdash;from August 2003 until the end of June 2004&mdash;there were three terrorist attacks and 26 people were murdered.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/5">I will give the number of casualties in each year. In 2003, 214 Israelis were killed. In 2004, the figure was 117. In 2005, 45 Israelis were killed. In saying that, I am not supporting every aspect of the security fence and the particular locations in which it is placed&mdash;we should acknowledge that the Israeli Supreme Court has forced 30 changes to the position of the fence&mdash;but it has saved lives. We met politicians of many persuasions in Israel, but there is widespread support in broad principle for the fence, because it saves Israeli lives. This House should not be too critical of a country that tries its hardest to do precisely that, because it is the responsibility of every Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.279.0/1">I will not repeat points that other hon. Members have made. I commend the opening speech by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> and that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/2">I will simply respond to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> by saying that nobody suggests that Israel does not have a responsibility to protect the security of its citizens. Every sovereign state has such a responsibility. In protecting its citizens, it should remain within international law and should be mindful of the rights of others, particularly the Palestinians.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/3">The impression that I have gained from my travels in the region&mdash;both in Israel and in Palestine&mdash;is that this Israeli Government's policies take no account of the Palestinians' rights or of their well-being. The Israeli Government respond only to Israeli citizens' security concerns and Israeli interests, whether or not those Israeli citizens are within the international borders of Israel or are illegally expropriating other people's land on the west bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/4">I want to discuss the concerted attack on Palestinian institutions and civil society, and the naked attempt in Jerusalem to push out any Palestinian institution, to obstruct any such institution and to alter the demography of east Jerusalem by reducing the number of Arabs and increasing the number of Jews. The concerted attack on institutions in east Jerusalem is longstanding; at its most extreme, Orient house was closed down immediately following the death of Faisal Husseini and all the records that lay within were confiscated. They were the only records of Palestinian property rights in east Jerusalem.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/5">The process continued. At every opportunity, the Israeli Government confiscated the computer hard discs of Palestinian non-governmental organisations and humanitarian organisations. That was done in order to compile a massive register, as far as I can tell, of every Palestinian, how they are related to each other, who they know and with whom they are connected.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/6">In Gaza, the Israelis control who is registered as a Palestinian; so much for Gaza's apparent sovereignty. The economic life of Arab east Jerusalem is being deliberately strangled by the Israelis; they are demolishing houses and making businesses unviable by cutting them off from the hinterland that would otherwise support them. Employment and income levels in east Jerusalem have gone down, but the taxes that the Israelis impose have gone up. That is a deliberate economic attempt to squeeze east Jerusalem Arabs out of their city and alter the demography to the advantage of the Israelis.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/7">My final point is about the family reunification law, introduced through the Knesset. It violates international law and is wholly discriminatory. It bars family reunification for Israelis if they marry a Palestinian woman under 25 or a Palestinian man under 35. An Israeli can marry a person of any other nationality and bring their husband or wife into Israel, but if they marry a Palestinian in those age ranges they may not; they have to go to live with them in the Palestinian territories.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/8">That is a nakedly discriminatory law whose only purpose is to discriminate, primarily against Israeli citizens of Palestinian origin&mdash;largely citizens of the Galilee and those towns with Palestinian-Israeli citizens; 20 per cent. of Israeli citizens are Arab citizens&mdash;and against Jerusalem Arabs. That law says to such people that if they choose to marry a Palestinian from the west bank, or one who may live in Jerusalem but does not have a Jerusalem ID, they must go to live outside Jerusalem.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/9">As I say, that violates international law. It is being challenged by Israeli human rights groups in the Israeli courts, but our Government should be making it absolutely clear to the Israelis that they must abide by international law, and that that sort of law should never have gone through the Knesset. It should have been blocked. It is a disgrace to Israel and its credentials as a liberal democracy that it ever conceived of such a law, let alone passed it.</p>

	<p pid="b.280.0/1">For 13 years or so, I have been friends with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase>, whom I congratulate on securing this debate. We disagree on only two things; the future of the BBC and the subject of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/2">One of the sadnesses of this type of debate is that it always ends up rather polarised. People always try to apportion blame and assign a monopoly of guilt or virtue to one side or the other. True life, of course, is far more complicated than that.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/3">I am certainly not here to condone the fence per se or its route, but we have to set on record why the fence has been built. Hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber have already spoken about the need and right of a sovereign state to defend its own people. Whether we accept the fence as a good idea or not, it was interesting to hear the right hon. Gentleman say that in Hebron there are walls, huts, gates and turnstiles; he was right. He also talked about the difficulty in moving freely; he was right.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/4">However, in the 1980s, when I worked for the BBC in Belfast, one had to go through precisely the same sort of procedure if one wanted to shop in Royal avenue. The fences, gates, huts and turnstiles were put there not because of some ill-intentioned regime in London, but to protect the citizenry. In fairness, we have to accept that the motivation for erecting the fence was not to try to destroy the Palestinian economy, as has been claimed, but to try to protect Israel's citizenry.</p>

	<p pid="b.281.1/1">I shall not, because others have not given way and others want to speak as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.1/2">It is fair to examine and explore the gravity of the offences being committed against the Israeli people at the moment. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> has said that more than 1,000 Israelis have been killed; in fact, 1,084 have been killed since the beginning of the Palestinian intifada. In 2005, when there was supposed to be a period of peace, 45 Israelis were killed&mdash;of whom only eight were members of the Israeli defence force and 37 were civilians&mdash;and 406 were wounded. Twenty-three of the 45 killings were caused in seven suicide attacks. In 2005 alone, there were 199 bomb attacks, 848 mortar attacks, 377 Kassam missile attacks and 1,133 shooting attacks.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.1/3">Of course, I appreciate that there is anger among young Palestinians and accept that there have been injustices, but apportioning blame against the state of Israel for erecting the fence and not acknowledging that it is there because someone has to move first and say that the attacks will end simply is not being realistic about the middle east, let alone Israel and the occupied territories. Several hon. Members have spoken about the possible illegality of what Israel has done and that claims are being made against the Israeli Supreme Court. That is so, but let us at least recognise that Israel has a Supreme Court, which can and does override the Government and the army, and that Israel has been a democracy since 1948. If only some Arab countries were the same. Thank God that, due to our intervention, Iraq is heading in that direction. I hope that Iraq will be successful in that, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.1/4">I do not defend the route of the fence, and I am sure that there will be cases of injustice. When answering an intervention, the right hon. Gentleman rightly said that the fence has not prevented a number of terrorist attacks. He has spoken about attacks in Natanya, a town that I know well on the Israeli coast. How many more Natanyas would there have been were it not for the fence? I remind hon. Members that resolution 242 said that all land disputes should be settled by a negotiated peace. Bombs, rockets and suicide attacks are not negotiation. Israel has every right&mdash;indeed it has a duty&mdash;to protect its citizens.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18b.281.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" speakername="David Winnick" colnum="281"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060118/halltext/60118h03.htm#60118h03_spnew21">
	<p pid="b.281.2/1">No one participating in the debate disputes the right of Israel to exist and to defend itself. That is not the issue. This shows my age, but I took the view in 1948, when I was quite young, which seems a long time ago, that in all the circumstances it was right for the international community&mdash;it was the international community&mdash;to bring Israel into existence. Nearly 2,000 years of Jews being demonised, persecuted, tortured and murdered laid the basis for what the Nazis did, which has already been referred to. This was the systematic extermination of 6 million because of their race; it was nothing to do with religion. All of that justified Israel coming into existence, but the price that the Palestinians paid for that should not be forgotten. If we understand why Israel came into existence, surely we have an equal responsibility to understand the Palestinian case. If we were Palestinians living at that time, I doubt whether we would have taken any other attitude than that taken by them.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.2/2">I mention the long history of anti-Semitism. All of us have a responsibility&mdash;especially, perhaps, without being misunderstood, those who take a particularly strong view on the middle east, opposite to Israel, so to speak&mdash;to dissociate ourselves in every way possible from some of the poisonous anti-Semitism that we have seen in Europe for centuries and which is now surfacing, surprisingly, in countries such as Egypt, for example, through such documents as the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, a notorious tsarist forgery that states that the Jews will dominate the world. I do not know when that domination is going to start; maybe in 2020 or 2021. I have not been given the exact date. Moreover, we have seen the sheer obscenity&mdash;there is no other way to describe it&mdash;of the Iranian President organising a conference on what is described as &quot;holocaust denial&quot;. There is a responsibility in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.2/3">I want to bring us away from the idea that what happened last year in Gaza was the start of a process whereby Israel intends to withdraw from the occupied territories. I accept nothing of the kind. Whether the removals from Gaza were stage-managed or not, it was never the intention of Sharon or his Government that that withdrawal&mdash;which, however unilateral, we all welcome&mdash;would start the process of withdrawal from all the occupied territories, something we all want to see.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.2/4">I have a note from the Library about settler occupation in the west bank from 1972 to 2004. All the settlements are illegal and exist in defiance of the international community; the very community that brought Israel into existence in 1948. In 1972 there were 800 such settlements; by 1990 there were 78,600; by 2000 there were 192,976. At the end of 2004 the figure was 234,487. That demonstrates that over the years, Israel has been determined to build such settlements in defiance of international opinion. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.2/5">I endorse everything that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> said about the daily misery and humiliation that Palestinians face. If Jews were facing that sort of tragedy and being treated in that way, would we not be raising our voice? I hope so. I would be doing so, as would my right hon. Friend and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase>. Have we therefore not a responsibility to raise our voice loudly and clearly about the way in which the Palestinians are being treated? We should make no apology for doing so. I see the hon. Member for Lichfield smiling. He well knows the history of anti-Semitism and he should be concerned about the way in which Palestinians are being treated, as described by my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>. We must be evenly balanced; for heaven's sake, it is no good taking a one-sided attitude.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.2/6">We know that the quartet exists. I accept that the British Government wish to see a fair solution, though I do not know whether that is the view of every hon. Member. The fair solution is a Palestinian state no less independent and viable than Israel itself. The one country that can put sufficient pressure on Israel is the United States, which has the muscle and the influence. I am dismayed that in the last few years, under President Bush, there has been no wish to use that influence to bring about the right and just solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.2/7">I do not believe that if the issue were to be settled it would mean the end of international terrorism. That would be a very naive view. Bin Laden and his murderous fanatics would find many other reasons, as they do now. It would, however, take so much poison out of the middle east. It would not only be right in itself but would help to stabilise the position in the region. That is why I hope that the British Government will try to persuade the American Government to do what is right.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18b.283.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" speakername="Tom Levitt" colnum="283"  time="015:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060118/halltext/60118h03.htm#60118h03_spnew22">
	<p pid="b.283.0/1">For the record, the other members of the delegation to which my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> referred were my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" name="Roger Berry">the Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry)</phrase> and me, as well as two colleagues from another place. It was my first time in the middle east; I particularly wanted to go there because I have some general sympathy with the Palestinian cause&mdash;although I do not have a lot of knowledge on the subject&mdash;and an interest in what the Department for International Development is doing there. I went there and speak today in a personal capacity, not as a representative of DFID.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.0/2">I thought that occupation was a static process, but what we saw was much more active; the occupation not only moves on but gets worse. Particularly in Hebron, we saw how illegal settlements were being linked together by new security measures. We saw how the economy of that town was being destroyed by the policy of allowing traffic in and out of the city for only six hours a day; we had to leave the town illegally by driving a minibus across fields. The issue was summed up for me when I was shown a Palestinian medical centre in Hebron that had been taken over two weeks earlier by Israeli forces and was now an Israeli army post. Local Palestinians no longer had an available medical centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.0/3">Judging from everything that we saw, I felt that Israeli policy in the Palestinian territories was absolutely clear. First, it was to hold on to economic control of the Jericho valley; secondly, to resettle Gaza settlers in the west bank; thirdly, to protect other settlers and encourage them to come in illegally, settlers not just from Israel but from fundamentalist Christian groups around the world. Fences would immediately be put around those illegal settlements, military posts would be put in to guard them and new roads would be built for them and barred to Palestinians. Settlers will also get to vote in the Israeli elections in March, although many of them never lived in Israel previously. One can imagine which way they are likely to vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.0/4">The next tactic is clearly to take all of Jerusalem, the key city for three of the world's major religions, into Israel and then extend it eastward through the Ma'ale Adumim development, dividing the west bank into two. With 10 per cent. of the west bank already behind the wall, some of the most fertile and economically productive land and most productive water sources have effectively been taken into Israel. That is clearly what is happening. The tactic is being used for economic destruction in the west bank. In Tulkarm, where there is a no-go area of about 100 m alongside the wall, thousands of square yards of greenhouses had been destroyed; not to build the wall, but to maintain that no-go area.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.0/5">The remaining part of the west bank, which consists of less than 50 per cent. of what should be the west bank under the 1948 agreements, is criss-crossed by roads that act as barriers. When those roads are policed so that Palestinian vehicles may not use them, they are barriers to communication and not agents of it. If one adds to that the 600 permanent roadblocks, one sees not only that those circumstances make the Palestinian economy virtually unworkable, but that they will thwart the Palestinian people's democratic aspirations as well.</p>

	<p pid="b.284.1/2">The next few days will be crucial. If an election in the Palestinian territories does not take place a week from today that can be seen to be credible and that returns a Government capable of doing something&mdash;bearing in mind that the entire Palestinian Authority's budget each year is about the same as what the Israelis are spending on building the wall&mdash;that election will be of very little value. If anything, it could polarise the issue even more if, as others have said, Hamas takes more than a foothold in the democratic process.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.1/3">We are in very difficult times. I do not believe that the international community has done enough to ensure that next Wednesday's election will be credible. In the Israeli elections that follow, I hope that the 70 per cent. of Israelis who support withdrawal will vote for it. I hope that we can get something out of the situation, but I came back from my visit to the Palestinian territories much more depressed about it than when I went.</p>

	<p pid="b.284.3/1">In keeping with other hon. Members, I will try to make my observations and comments brief. So much has been said about this fraught and difficult issue that is of great value and derived from far greater insight, experience and expertise than I possess. I shall just supplement what has been said with four observations.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.3/2">First, I visited the region in late November with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase>, and went to areas such as the west bank, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Ramallah and Hebron when the political drama in Israel was unfolding; the day after I left, Ariel Sharon announced the establishment of his new political party, Kadima. It was obvious to me, as a first-time visitor to the region, that something terrifically significant was happening in Israeli politics. Since then, I have been asking myself a question that has been made more acute by Mr. Sharon's tragic stroke; does Kadima represent a new shift in political trade in Israel, or is it, as is alleged by some, nothing more than a sleight of hand by Sharon's supporters who are trying to pursue an agenda that has not changed over the years, but in a more politically acceptable manner?</p>
	<p pid="b.284.3/3">I shall state my provisional view as a question, as the answer is dependent on the events of the months to come. However, my hunch is that Kadima is a more significant development in Israeli politics than suggested by some. The notion that the party is merely a Machiavellian sleight of hand, with the same agenda of brutal unilateralism as was pursued before, stretches credulity, not least because the party has gathered around it the centre ground of Israeli political opinion. Kadima seems to have broken a taboo; it has explicitly accepted that a Palestinian state should be established on the basis of land for peace.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.3/4">I have an overarching question about where that development will take the peace process. Will it still rely on a unilateral decision by Israel about the terms of the negotiated land for peace settlement? We then come back to the age-old question of whether unilateralism works in a region where one side feels so aggrieved by the other.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.3/5">My second observation, which has been made before, is about Hamas. No doubt other hon. Members have read about the intriguing signs that Hamas has softened its stance on the status and existence of Israel; it has even indicated that it would be prepared to negotiate with Israel. If that is the case, it would appear to be a glimmer of hope in the context of continuing and profound concern about the military and terrorist activities sponsored by Hamas.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.3/6">However, the response of the international community to what looks like an almost inevitable increase in Hamas representation after the elections on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-25">25 January</phrase> needs to be delicate, sensitive and intelligent in order to extract the best from those elections; otherwise they may be used merely as an excuse to accelerate a continuing spiral of antagonism. I would be grateful to hear the Government's thinking on the issue; it must be quite advanced given that the election is only a week away. How will they act&mdash;both alone and in the context of the European Union&mdash;when confronted by a precipitate decline in the political power of an increasingly illegitimate Fatah movement&mdash;to be frank, it appears corrupt at times&mdash;and the rise of the increasingly popular Hamas movement.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.3/7">My third and penultimate observation is that when visiting the region with the hon. Member for Bristol, East, I was naturally struck, like many visitors, by the existence of the wall. Yet I had simply not appreciated, until making our visit, that the most insidious and destructive effects on the everyday livelihoods and fortunes of Palestinians in the west bank are, obviously, though the closure regime, but also through various invisible controls. The permits to retain one's home, if one has been studying abroad for two years, are often withdrawn unilaterally. The licences required merely to move from east Jerusalem form a Byzantine, complex system; the permits needed may be yellow, blue or orange. That is in order to visit families or to work in parts of the west bank or east Jerusalem.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.3/8">I still simply cannot understand why reducing the west bank to a socially and economically dysfunctional state is in Israel's own interest. That is neither a political nor a polemical statement; it is a logical one. You cannot make peace with chaos, nor with grinding poverty. You cannot make peace where people cannot meet their families, nor travel to work where moving even a few metres or kilometres is made impossible. I literally find incredible the suggestion that such a degree of dysfunctionality somehow serves the wider, legitimate security objectives of the Israeli state.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.3/9">My fourth and final point in this fairly arbitrary list of observations is said with a continued sense of regret; that the EU did not choose to publish, shortly before Christmas, the report drafted by its own diplomats on the ground in east Jerusalem about conditions there. It reminded me just how inconsistent, weak and politically vague the EU's role in the region appears to have been, and for far too long.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.3/10">There are glimmers of hope. It is encouraging that European Union observers, principally Italian and led by an Italian general, are overseeing the implementation of the Rafah border agreement. By financing projects in the west bank and elsewhere, the EU is doing much extremely good work, not least to develop the capacity of the Palestinian police forces to operate effectively. However, in the absence of clear leadership from Washington on the issue, it is incumbent on the British Government&mdash;and, certainly, on all other Governments in the EU&mdash;to try to come to a more coherent, collective political view, however difficult that is.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.3/11">The European Union is the economic giant in the neighbourhood. It has enormous leverage; would that it wished to use it more coherently. I am keen to know whether the Minister agrees with that analysis. What does he feel the British Government could do to develop a more coherent and organised EU role in the region?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18b.286.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="286"  time="015:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060118/halltext/60118h03.htm#60118h03_spnew27">
	<p pid="b.286.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> on his ability to acquire this debate. As he has proved during it and many others held in the House, his knowledge of the area is deep. He speaks with great passion but also with great feeling, and I congratulate him on becoming leader of the IPU delegation to Palestine.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.0/2">Our debate has produced a number of speeches articulated with enormous passion. All too often, we come to debates in the Chamber or Westminster Hall to find so many people reading out briefs of one kind or another and taking up party positions. Nearly everyone who has spoken did so with great passion. Interestingly, on the whole they had fixed or relatively fixed positions. Let us be quite clear; this is a divisive subject. It is probably only the Minister and, in theory, the Front Bench spokesmen who have to try to straddle it who take an objective view. The people who live in the area, whether they are Israelis or Palestinians, have passionate and deeply held views.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.0/3">The subject is so divisive that when I was first appointed Conservative Front-Bench spokesman on the middle east, people's first words were not to congratulate me&mdash;someone commiserated and said that I could have got Europe&mdash;but to ask, &quot;Are you pro-Arab or pro-Israeli?&quot; That is how divisive the subject is. I hope that I am pro-British and that I can take an objective and constructive view.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.0/4">I will not list the contributions to the debate like a laundry list, but what came through from them was that Britain still has a role to play. We have a responsibility because we were a great power there 80 or 90 years ago and because of some of the things that happened as a direct consequence of successive British Governments, Liberal&mdash;when we had Liberal Governments&mdash;Conservative, and Labour. We look to the Minister to tell us what the British Government will try to do to resolve the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.0/5">The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton rightly sent Mr. Sharon his commiserations. Part of me is filled with gloom, first, because whatever his many faults&mdash;Mr. Sharon is not known as &quot;the bulldozer&quot; for nothing&mdash;he is a strange combination of a very brutal, hard-nosed soldier and politician with quite a subtle man who, in his fourth decade, could recognise the changes that had to take place. With his incapacity, I wonder what will now happen to Israeli policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.0/6">Secondly, I am filled with gloom by what appears to be the chaos and confusion in the Palestinian territories, the political divisions and the fact that today the EU has suspended &pound;25 million of aid because of financial irregularities in the Palestinian territories. Somebody might say that is indeed an irony coming from the EU. Israelis and Palestinians may frequently be overcome by gloom but if they want to come to a constructive conclusion they have to keep working at it.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.0/7">My party and the other two political parties represented in the debate believe that Israel has a right to exist, just as there is a right to a Palestinian state. All hon. Members agree on that, but the problem is how to achieve it, because there are vastly different definitions between Israel and Palestine on what each state should consist of, and the overlap is absolutely enormous.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.0/8">I listened to what the right hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members said. There is no doubt in my mind, given my background, and the mention made of Northern Ireland, that with the best will in the world the most sophisticated counter-insurgency and counter-terror measures never, ever work on their own and frequently can be counter-productive, whether they are put in place by democratic countries such as ours or by the most fiercely totalitarian regimes. There is a danger that while trying to protect your own citizens you will provide recruits for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.0/9">However, I do not resile from the fact that large numbers of those actively involved in politics in Palestine wish to destroy the state of Israel and kill Israeli citizens, but there has to be a political rather than a military solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.0/10">Finally, I want to ask the Minister two or three brief questions and I hope that he will have time to give an opinion. Can the Minister assure us that the Government are doing everything possible to address some of the issues identified by hon. Members today that are frustrating the peace process? Have the British Government tacitly accepted the de-Palestinisation of east Jerusalem, cited by the UN and, as is likely, by their own consulate in Jerusalem? What discussions have been taking place about Jerusalem's future status? Has thought been given to the implications that that will have for the future of peace negotiations? What are the Government doing to encourage economic regeneration in the west bank? Finally, what is the Minister's assessment of progress made in dismantling settlements built since March 2001?</p>

	<p pid="b.288.0/1">I join other hon. Members in thanking my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1706" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> for bringing this issue to the House for discussion. He has been my guide in many areas. I shall be frivolous for a moment and say that he has especially been my guide in cinema and in the American musical over the years, but he has also been my guide on this subject, and the House listens to his words with very great and special respect. I am not quite as old as him, but we were both brought up to believe that there was every possibility that the dream of people living alongside one another in the Holy Land would be realised. Over the years, it has irked my right hon. Friend as much as it has irked all of us in this Chamber to see that that has not happened and that the bitterness has continued.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/2">Let me say before I come on to Palestine that this is a difficult time in Israeli politics. I echo the words of my right hon. Friend and others by saying how saddened I was to hear of Prime Minister Sharon's illness. We wish him a speedy recovery. He certainly turned Israeli politics upside down in his determined efforts to withdraw Israeli settlers and defence forces from Gaza and parts of the west bank. Few people could have predicted just two years ago that Ariel Sharon would have instigated and led so unilateralist a movement, because that is what I think it is. It is a move against the religious right and the expansionists in Israeli politics.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/3">It is possible that Sharon's other, in my view, unilateralist policy&mdash;the building of the barrier, the wall, the fence; call it what you will&mdash;allowed him, by being seen as strengthening Israel's physical defences, enough political slack in Israel to disengage from Gaza. Disengagement has been the right policy for Israel. Although not part of the road map, it has made an effective contribution and it is important that the parties and the international community continue to build on that opportunity. We must try to understand how we might do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/4">On a recent visit to Israel and Palestine, I was encouraged by signs that there are influential elements in Israeli society who understand clearly that what Israel does not need, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" name="Nicholas Clegg">the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg)</phrase> pointed out, is an economic basket-case on its borders. What possible benefit could that bring to anyone? That is why the agreement on movement and access, reached between Israel and the Palestinians on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-15">15 November</phrase>, was a significant step and should go some way towards ensuring that Israel's disengagement from Gaza at least gives the Palestinian people a chance to mount an economic revival.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/5">The EU, under the UK presidency, launched, with a very short lead time, the EU border assistance mission at the Gaza-Egypt border, enabling the Rafah crossing to open on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-25">25 November</phrase>. Thousands of Palestinians have since used that crossing. It is vital that the Palestinians and the Egyptians make a success of Rafah and try to replicate its lessons elsewhere; for example, for the Gaza seaport and airport and perhaps for crossing points in the west bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/6">However, as we have heard, although some developments since Israeli disengagement have been encouraging and have given us cause for optimism, many other Israelis policies in the occupied territories have not. As my right hon. Friend has told us, restrictions on freedom of movement, and the occasional disproportionate use of force&mdash;sometimes very disproportionate&mdash;by the Israelis remain real matters for concern. As has been said, the world is particularly concerned about the hardship that the route of the barrier is causing in the west bank and, especially, Jerusalem. That route threatens the possibility of the creation of a two-state solution and has led to the tragic saga of which we have heard so much this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/7">According to the United Nations office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs, from which I was lucky enough to receive a briefing in Jerusalem, Israel's closure regime is the primary cause of poverty and economic depression in the west bank. Closures restrict Palestinian access to medical personnel; make it difficult for children to travel to school; hinder ordinary Palestinians on their way to work&mdash;I saw that on a number of occasions&mdash;and impede trade and economic development. We remain extremely concerned about the humanitarian and economic consequences of closures, both internally and on the borders. The imposition of curfews and tight access controls is also, as we have heard, having a very detrimental effect on the quality of life in those Palestinian areas. We continue to call on the Government of Israel to do all that it can to ease movement restrictions.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/8">We have also seconded a senior army officer to lead a team to help UNOCHA, and the mission seeks to work with the IDF to try to reduce the number of obstacles to Palestinian freedom of movement.</p>

	<p pid="b.289.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the fact that, in the past five years, the income per head in the Palestinian territories has fallen by 50 per cent. and the number of people living in poverty has risen from 20 per cent. to 61 per cent.&mdash;according to DFID figures&mdash;suggests that we should act with great urgency to remove the barriers to economic activity and human life?</p>

	<p pid="b.289.1/1">I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. The eastern shore of the Mediterranean should not be a poor part of the world. I have said before that I am not one of those who feel that the situation cannot be remedied, or that there cannot be a viable economy in Gaza and the west bank. Why should there not be? Israel has proved that it can be done, and many projects have taken place in Gaza, some of which I have seen, that demonstrate that it is possible to have a vibrant economy there. I agree that the issue is urgent. Call me old fashioned, but it seems to me that if there is a vibrant economy there, we will see less resentment and fewer problems. That is something that we have to work hard to achieve.</p>

	<p pid="b.290.0/1">The Minister is very generous in giving way. Does he not also accept, given all the points that he has made, that one cannot just remove the barrier, even though it is causing huge difficulties for Palestinians and subjecting them to a lower economic growth rate? That would result in even more killings in Israel.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18b.290.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" speakername="Kim Howells" colnum="290"  time="015:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060118/halltext/60118h03.htm#60118h03_spnew31">
	<p pid="b.290.1/1">I would certainly agree that there has been a palpable reduction in the number of deaths and murders by suicide bombers in Israel. There is also a sense inside Israel that people feel safer than they did previously. However, that does not make the route of the barrier right. That is the whole point, and that is why we continue to protest to the Israeli Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.1/2">I am very glad to see that the Israeli courts often agree with us about the route of the barrier, and that non-governmental organisations and Palestinians have been pursuing that route through the Israeli courts to try to stop the incorporation of Palestinian land and the absurd instances that I saw in east Jerusalem of people being prevented from going to their places of work when they lived minutes away from them, so that they suddenly faced a journey of an hour, if they could get there at all. That is absolutely crazy.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.1/3">My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton made an interesting point. I wrote down his comments; he said that &quot;persecution and oppression breed recalcitrant behaviour&quot; and that terrorists are feeding off the festering resentment generated by the detrimental effects on Palestinian lives of repressive Israeli measures in the occupied territories. That is not the Israel that we dreamt of, nor is it the Israel of the people I met when I was last in that country a few months ago. I went to a kibbutz and people communicated to me their regret that this situation had come about.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.1/4">The point has also been made that Israel has an absolute duty to protect its own citizens. Although that is not an excuse for routing the barrier as it has been, it should be said that the Palestinian Authority must get a grip on security. I heard last week that it had released one of the people who had kidnapped a British aid worker. That will not do. The road map has a number of duties attached to it; one of them is that the Palestinian Authority gets a grip on security in the west bank and Gaza, and it is clearly not doing that.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.1/5">The Palestinian Authority is not short of money. The Government are giving a lot of money to the Palestinians; they gave it in the past and they will give it in the future. Members know my views about the corruption that was the curse of the Arafat regime. A lot of money was filched off into bank accounts in Zurich and God knows where else, instead of going into rebuilding Palestinian communities. To say that is not in any way to excuse the measures that the Israelis have taken and that my right hon. Friend gave examples of, but we must bear it in mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.1/6">There are duties on both sides. It must be ensured that the immediate answer to people's desperate situations is not thought to be to praise suicide bombers. I believe that mullahs and imams should stand up and say that suicide bombers go straight to hell, but all too often they keep their heads down and do not say such things, and in some places they talk about them as being great heroes; as exceptions. They are not exceptions. They are blowing young Palestinian men and women to pieces with their poison, and they are blowing young Israelis to pieces with their poison as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.1/7">I was glad to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> say that we have to straddle both sides. My party colleagues believe that, too. Everybody in this House believes it. We would not be here otherwise. We believe in democracy, and we believe that there is a way out of this situation. The way out is for us to press very hard for the road map. I cannot think of another way out. People tell me, &quot;Well, we must revise it.&quot; How many times have these plans been revised? How many times have we heard Israelis and Palestinians say, &quot;You do that; we'll do this&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="b.290.1/8">I can understand why Sharon and the movement in Israel involving Giladi and others have decided to become unilateralists, but will it result in a two-state solution? Will it result in a viable Palestinian state? It will do so only if both sides understand that murder and oppression feed resentment and terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.1/9">That is the conclusion that we must draw. The Government understand that, and we will do our utmost to press all sides&mdash;the quartet, the Israelis and the Palestinians&mdash;to get together and to find a solution to this most pressing and historic of problems.</p>

	<p pid="b.292.1/1">It is a delight to see you in the Chair, Mr. Bayley. I am also very pleased that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools, whom I hold in high regard, is to reply to the debate.</p>

Friends the Members for Burton (Mrs. Dean), for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) and for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins). Education funding is an extremely important subject for our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.1/3">I bring good news about educational achievement from Staffordshire and from my Stafford constituency. The results achieved by seven-year-old pupils at key stage 1, 11-year-old pupils at key stage 2 and 14-year-old pupils at key stage 3 are above the national average in an area where average household incomes are only about 80 per cent. of the national average. The results of 16-year-old students at key stage 4 are below average, but last year they achieved their best improvement for seven years and their best GCSE results ever.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.1/4">Inspectors have praised our targeted approach. With better funding, we would be able to target more resources to raise the achievements of looked-after children and children from economically deprived backgrounds&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.292.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Bayley. I would just like to mention that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> has also joined us for this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.3/2">In our area the staying-on rate for 16-year-old students is also above average and our A-level results are at or above the average. If I sound as though I take a propriety interest in our schools, it is because I really care about them. I regularly visit schools in my constituency: last Friday, for example, I was at St. Patrick's Roman Catholic primary school, whose pupils and staff work hard for their enthusiastic new head teacher, Mrs. Goodison, and where there is a warm and positive learning environment. I am also proud of the Stafford collegiate, which brings together all the town's secondary schools, a purposely developed sixth-form centre and the college of further education. The result is a wonderfully broad range of courses for 16-year-old students to choose from, which no doubt helps to explain the good staying-on rate. We are currently working on developing the Government's 14-to-19 agenda, including our ability to offer apprenticeships to 14-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="b.292.3/3">My own latest project is an attempt to partner individual secondary schools with individual local employers. That is in addition to the excellent work that the schools and employers have already done with Staffordshire Partnership, but I foresee additional benefits for schools and local businesses from that additional partnership working&mdash;for example, more mentors for students in their schools and improved recruitment and retention for employers in their businesses.</p>

My constituency also has some excellent schools, but St. Mildred's in Whiston, St. John's in Alton and Draycott Manor school have all closed.

	<p pid="b.293.4/1">I am sure that my hon. Friend will make this point later. He is obviously aware of a somewhat controversial White Paper that is all about standards&mdash;at least, we hope that the legislation will be. Staffordshire schools already do well, as he says, but does he not agree that they would do much better if there was fair funding? I have in mind the &pound;5,211 per pupil that will go to Kensington and Chelsea in the coming year, 2006&ndash;07, as opposed to the &pound;3,381 per pupil that will go to Staffordshire. The difference is nearly &pound;2,000 a head.</p>

	<p pid="b.293.5/1">I will deal with that directly. We in Staffordshire want to join with the Government and contribute significantly to an overall increase in standards of achievement. If only our education service had something approaching the average level of funding from the Government to pay for that effort. Instead, we consistently receive a level of funding that falls further behind the best-funded local authorities. If Staffordshire received resources that were more like those received by the better-funded authorities, it could have more teachers, support staff, computing back-up, textbooks, tools and equipment, and we could then swiftly raise standards still further.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.5/2">We in Staffordshire have not simply felt sorry for ourselves; we have tried to overcome the obstacles that the low funding presents. Staffordshire local education authority has consistently added to the funding of the education service from its own resources. Few LEAs are doing that this year. That is surely a sign of Staffordshire's tenacity in doing everything in its own power to raise standards in its schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.5/3">The other positive action that Staffordshire LEA has taken is to support the campaigning organisation F40. Staffordshire is not alone: a number of LEAs languish at the bottom of the league table for central Government funding year after year, and that is why F40 was started.</p>

	<p pid="b.294.0/1">Does my hon. Friend&mdash;I say that advisedly&mdash;at least admit that with the new funding formula Staffordshire is doing a little better than before? It was previously fifth from bottom and is now 18th from bottom out of 149 LEAs, excluding the Isles of Scilly, in England.</p>

	<p pid="b.294.1/1">I praise the hon. Gentleman for helping in the campaign with the information that he unearths in parliamentary questions and answers. F40 presses for fairer education funding, and I declare a pertinent interest in it, because last year I was elected to chair it. The Minister knows all about F40. The organisation has responded energetically to the Department's various consultations on funding and lobbied for changes that will benefit the poorer LEAs. Some aspects of the changes to funding that the Department made three years ago reflected and addressed concerns that we had raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.1/2">A delegation from F40 met the Minister last year, and I thank her for her willingness to engage with us and to discuss the problems that we believe exist and how they can be resolved. We were pleased by some of the Government's recent decisions on the dedicated schools grant, which is to start from this April. The two-year settlement, with advance notice for schools of the 2007&ndash;08 figures, is helpful for planning budgets and spending decisions. Future settlements will be even more helpful, as they will give notice of the next three years' funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.1/3">I warmly welcome the Government's decision to establish the baseline for the dedicated schools grant based on what local authorities were spending in 2005&ndash;06. Schools in areas such as Staffordshire, which has a strong recent record of commitment to education, are not now facing an immediate reduction in resources. In fact, Staffordshire schools will have an extra &pound;10 million&mdash;an increase of almost 3 per cent.&mdash;to spend as a result of that decision. The guaranteed minimum increase in per pupil funding is also welcome, although obviously it builds on the historical levels of funding for local authorities, which I hope I have demonstrated are an unfair base from which to start.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.1/4">As we look forward beyond the next two years, there are aspects of the current funding system that continue to disadvantage areas such as Staffordshire. The Government rightly adjust funding to reflect the additional challenge that schools face in overcoming deprivation, which affects the ability of pupils to learn. The adjustment is calculated according to where pupils live, whether or not that is also where they go to school. In places where there is considerable cross-border travel to school, the schools that are faced with the challenge of deprivation are not receiving the additional funding given for deprivation. With the advent of local area statistics, it is now possible for schools to know precisely how many pupils they have on roll from the areas that attract the additional funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.294.1/5">The Government also adjust the funding for additional cost pressures. Staffordshire gets no additional money through that factor and resents the level of funding that goes to those areas that benefit from it. After all, the main expense of any school is teachers' salaries, which are paid according to a national scale. Will the Minister confirm that the Department will continue to reflect on the justification for those adjustments, their levels and their practical application?</p>

	<p pid="b.295.0/1">I agree that it is right that funding should follow deprivation. One of the problems in Staffordshire is that it has been hard for schools in deprived areas to get the funding they need because of the way in which the county as a whole is funded. Does my hon. Friend agree that as well as increasing across-the-board funding we should ensure that schools in the tougher areas of Staffordshire get more direct funding?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18b.295.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" speakername="David Kidney" colnum="295"  time="016:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060118/halltext/60118h04.htm#60118h04_spnew12">
	<p pid="b.295.1/1">Indeed I do. My hon. Friend does not have to look too far from his constituency to Walsall and Wolverhampton, where the local authorities are getting larger sums for deprivation than his area does, even though teachers in his local schools face similar challenges as a result of deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.1/2">The Government also add an amount to the formula for rural factors&mdash;for example, an education service in a rural area has extra costs, not least in transport. However, that factor seems to attract much smaller sums than the other two factors that I have mentioned. As long as we have those other factors we should certainly have as significant an amount of funding for rurality.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.1/3">The Minister knows that the F40 group has devised a system to account for education spending that allows for accurate and instant evaluation of different policy options and spending priorities. There is no longer any excuse for guesstimates and assumptions in the Department's funding system. I thank my right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools for offering to arrange for her officials to meet members of the F40 group to discuss the new system.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.1/4">My right hon. Friend should also be thanked for drawing together the various additional funds into one standards fund and for ending the requirement for matched funding from LEAs. The recent announcement on personalised learning is an early measure from the White Paper. I hope that the additional resources for the personalisation of learning are soon incorporated in the mainstream formula. The proposal to use prior attainment data can be only a short-term measure; otherwise there will be almost a perverse incentive not to improve standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.1/5">Whichever way one looks at the figures, Staffordshire does badly. The Minister's written answer to the hon. Member for Lichfield on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-15">15 December</phrase> last year, at column 2200W of <i>Hansard,</i> showed that Staffordshire's funding per pupil under the new dedicated schools grant for 2006&ndash;07 will be &pound;3,381. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, that puts Staffordshire 18th from bottom of the league table of funding for the 150 English LEAs. Staffordshire's funding per pupil is &pound;197 less than the mean of &pound;3,578 and &pound;382 less than the average of &pound;3,763. If we restrict the comparison to the shire counties, of which there are 34, Staffordshire receives &pound;63 per pupil less than the average, which on its own makes a &pound;7.5 million difference to the local authority's funding for its schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.1/6">At LEA level, the Government say that the national settlement for local authorities will provide a 6.8 per cent. increase in 2006&ndash;07, but in Staffordshire the increase will be 6.5 per cent. Staffordshire is losing out in every way. If that were the result occasionally, no doubt Staffordshire could ride out the lean years, but the fact is that Staffordshire loses out every year. I looked back to the figure for funding per pupil in Staffordshire in 1997&ndash;98 and it was &pound;2,640. That was the total spending per pupil, including all revenue grants. That year, the average was &pound;2,940 for an English authority so Staffordshire was getting &pound;300 less than that.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.1/7">When presenting a legitimate complaint about the system for distributing the Government's money it is easy to lapse into a completely negative whinge. I note, however, that the Government I support have raised the average funding per pupil from that &pound;2,940 in 1997 to &pound;4,110 this year&mdash;an increase of more than &pound;1,100 per pupil. The Minister knows the arguments well. In fairness, she and her Department have engaged constructively in attempts to mitigate the harshness that the Department's formula visits on areas such as Staffordshire. Sadly, although changes have been made with the sincere intent of making the funding system fairer, they have not halted the slide towards greater disparity. In fairness to the Department, the new White Paper makes a welcome commitment to</p>
	<p pid="b.295.1/8" class="indent">&quot;a system of fair admissions, fair funding and clear accountability.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.295.1/9">That quote is from the Prime Minister's foreword to the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.1/10">A system of fair funding for Staffordshire would provide adequate resources compared with other authorities, taking into account the total resources available, to enable us to do better than we are already doing. I regularly meet people engaged in education in my constituency, including local authority staff, teachers, other school staff, governors, parents and, most importantly, students. I detect an appetite to go further to achieve more.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.1/11">Staffordshire will continue to support the F40 campaign. We will be represented at its conference in Nottingham on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-11">11 March</phrase> and we will continue to contribute to the debate on school funding, including through the new direct schools grant which has been established from this year. I look forward to an open debate on the future of the dedicated schools grant formula from 2008 onwards. We shall take part in the comprehensive review of education spending that the Department and the Treasury are to conduct shortly. The new formula should ensure that priority is given to a basic entitlement for every child, built on sound evidence on costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.295.1/12">Will the Minister give a clear signal to Staffordshire's broad and enthusiastic education community that there is official recognition that Staffordshire has performed extraordinarily well with limited resources&mdash;I would say unfairly limited resources&mdash;and deserves credit for its achievements to date? I ask also that the Government commend Staffordshire's schools and its authority for their performance. We want our schools to do even better in future. While recognising that such improvements cannot be delivered on a shoestring, will the Minister hold out the prospect that Staffordshire will receive fairer funding in the coming years? We support the Government's agenda of higher standards and better schools for all; we just cannot go on delivering more with less.</p>

	<p pid="b.297.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase>, not only on securing this debate, but on the persistent and committed way in which he campaigns for increased funding for his authority. I also welcome the commitment shown by the other hon. Members representing Staffordshire constituencies who are here today.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.0/2">I should like to put on record, as my hon. Friend has asked, my gratitude and respect for the work of teachers and pupils within the authority in Staffordshire, who have been responsible for significant improvements in the quality of education in the county. Those achievements reflect the hard work of teachers and other staff across the county. Staffordshire now has 10 per cent. more teachers than in January 1998 and 80 per cent. more support staff. They are certainly working effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.0/3">Turning to education funding, it is worth reflecting on the increases in funding for Staffordshire since the Labour Government came to power. Since 1997&ndash;98, total revenue funding in Staffordshire has increased in real terms by &pound;1,040 per pupil&mdash;almost 40 per cent. In the other important area, school capital, which tends not to be the subject of fair funding representations but which is important for ensuring that the environment within which children are learning is as we would expect it to be, spending on school buildings in Staffordshire has also increased dramatically, from &pound;3.7 million in 1996&ndash;97 to more than &pound;29 million this year&mdash;a sevenfold increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.0/4">Despite that, there are concerns about the level of funding in Staffordshire, particularly when compared with other areas of the country. My hon. Friend has made representations to me on a number of occasions. I wish to discuss the county's position in what I suppose we might call the funding league tables, and the reasons why Staffordshire does not always have access to some specific grant funding&mdash;although I note that my hon. Friend acknowledges the way in which the new funding arrangements will bring together those sources in the school development grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.297.0/5">Some have argued that levels of funding per pupil should be more or less the same for authorities across the country. That would be the only way to ensure that no authority was below the average. However, I do not believe that there should be a uniform rate of support, and I do not think that my hon. Friend was arguing in favour of that. Let me explain why.</p>

	<p pid="b.298.5/1">I was about to say that it is because of differences in children and structures that there is differential funding for authorities. Our aim is to give all pupils an equal opportunity in life, and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford acknowledges, pupils from more deprived backgrounds are likely to have additional educational needs and to require additional help if they are to have an equal chance to succeed. That is why the current&mdash;or old&mdash;formula funding system gives funding additional to the basic entitlement to authorities with a higher number of pupils from deprived backgrounds. Staffordshire has fewer pupils from deprived backgrounds than many other authorities, and that is a key reason for the difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.5/2">However, as my hon. Friend said, although additional educational need is the main reason why Staffordshire receives less funding per pupil, the current formula funding arrangements also give extra funding to sparsely populated authorities such as Staffordshire, which benefits to a certain extent from sparsity funding&mdash;I heard his request that it should be a larger portion. There is also extra funding for authorities in high-cost areas. I do not accept the contention that there are similar employment costs in all parts of the country because of the national pay system. The evidence of the differential and higher costs in some parts of the country are the justification for the area cost adjustment, which, as my hon. Friend said, is one of the additions that Staffordshire does not receive under the existing formula.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.5/3">I understand the concerns of individual schools such as those highlighted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase>. I hope that he will be reassured by Staffordshire council's latest provisional out-turn figures, which show that net school balances in the county stood at more than &pound;27 million at the end of the financial year 2004&ndash;05. There was &pound;7 million more in school balances in Staffordshire at the end of 2004&ndash;05 than at the end of 2003&ndash;04, which represents an increase of 35 per cent.. The national average increase was 16 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.5/4">That deals with the current situation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford said, the Government are making some important changes to school funding arrangements from the beginning of April this year. They are designed to ensure that the money intended for schools in every area of the country reaches them, and to give head teachers and governors stability and certainty about their funding so that they can make better plans. We shall ensure more stability for schools through multi-year budgets. As my hon. Friend knows, the dedicated schools grant is a new ring-fenced grant from the Department for Education and Skills to each local authority. It will cover funding for schools and other provision for pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.5/5">As my hon. Friend recognised, we consulted widely on the new school funding arrangements, including our proposals for distributing the DSG among authorities, in the spring last year. Schools and authorities in areas such as Staffordshire that spend more than their formula funding allocation told us of their concerns about the proposals. They were worried that, over time, their relative funding levels would be reduced. Staffordshire was one of the authorities that made that case. We listened carefully to those concerns, and in summer last year we consulted on a modified method for distributing the DSG that will put stability at the heart of local authority funding allocations. A majority of the people who responded to the new consultation supported the modified method, and that is what we shall use to distribute the DSG in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.5/6">Given the cry for greater transparency, let me describe how the DSG distribution will work. We shall take each authority's existing level of spending on the schools budget as the starting point, give every authority an increase of at least 5 per cent. per pupil over its current spending in each year, and then distribute the remaining grant according to the Government's priorities for education. Our priorities include personalised learning at key stage 3 and in primary schools and the provision of more practical learning options for pupils at key stage 4. That will enable precisely the sort of exciting work in the 14-to-19 age group to which my hon. Friend referred. The priorities also include covering the full-year cost of implementing time for planning, preparation and assessment in primary schools&mdash;that is the final stage of our work force reforms under the national agreement&mdash;and meeting the cost of increasing entitlement to free early years provision from 33 to 38 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.5/7">Although we have earmarked sums for those priorities in every authority's allocation of dedicated schools grant for each year, decisions on the distribution of funding between schools continues to be a matter for local authorities in consultation with their schools forums. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> made clear, it is at that level that authorities should take into consideration the challenges of deprivation when distributing resources within a given authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.5/8">What does the school funding settlement mean for Staffordshire schools? The county can expect an increase in dedicated schools grant of 6.5 per cent. on top of current spending per pupil in 2006&ndash;07, with a further increase for 2007&ndash;08 of 6.4 per cent. per pupil. That is an increase of more than 13 per cent. per pupil over those two years. We have heard what that amounts to in terms of guaranteed funding per pupil. The settlement gives the authority and its schools unprecedented predictability by providing guaranteed per-pupil funding for two years. That should give Staffordshire schools the confidence to plan ahead more effectively than ever before, making sure that their financial planning really supports the school improvements that my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford said they were so keen to ensure.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.5/9">I believe that we have ensured a good settlement for Staffordshire schools and schools across the country, but as my hon. Friend says, and as I am willing to make clear today, from 2008&ndash;09 we are introducing three-year allocations of dedicated schools grant and three-year budgets for schools. Before that, we intend to review the operation of a number of aspects of the new school funding arrangements, including dedicated schools grant distribution. As my hon. Friend conceded, the new distribution arrangements for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 already create some benefits for Staffordshire, but we want to review the arrangements in two years' time to make sure that the operation is going as we believe it should. We will want to consider what lessons can be learned from those first two years and will want to work up proposals for the distribution of DSG in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.5/10">Later this term, we will announce the terms of reference for the review and say how we propose to involve all local authorities and other stakeholders, including the F40 group of authorities. My hon. Friend is national chair of that group and works very hard for it.</p>

	<p pid="b.300.1/1">No, it will not, for the reasons that I outlined earlier. I do not believe that the amount should be the same from county to county, regardless of levels of deprivation, costs or sparsity, and I do not believe that my hon. Friend honestly believes that either. However, it is of course important that the challenges of deprivation are recognised, not only in national distribution, but in local distribution, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.1/2">I was grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford for bringing a delegation from the F40 group to see me last June. At our meeting, my hon.

	<p pid="b.300.1/3">I thank my hon. Friend and other hon. Members for raising the subject of school funding in Staffordshire. I know that my hon. Friends, at least, recognise that there has been a considerable increase in funding for schools in Staffordshire over the past eight years, although they rightly challenge us to make sure that Staffordshire receives a fair share funding and resources that will enable it to carry on the good work that my hon. Friend outlined. I look forward to my Department's detailed report on the forthcoming meeting with the group, and I have no doubt that Staffordshire and the F40, ably led by my hon. Friend, will continue to make representations on fair funding. I shall continue to listen to them.</p>

	<p pid="b.302.1/1">In the time available to me, I should like briefly to summarise the chronological sequence of events in this case, to comment on the trial and appeals process, to describe the mitigating factors and to pose a series of relevant questions to the Minister of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="1997-06-12">12 June 1997</phrase>, Teresa Daniels&mdash;hereafter referred to as Terry&mdash;was arrested at Las Palmas airport in Tenerife in the company of her companion Antonio Benavides, who was in possession of 3.8 kg of cocaine. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-17">17 June</phrase>, five days later, Terry was released on bail. Shortly afterward, she suffered a near-fatal brain haemorrhage, but fortunately, as a result of early and effective medical intervention, she was saved and restored to health.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="1997-09-02">2 September 1997</phrase>, Terry attended a court hearing that lasted one and a half hours, at which she was asked five questions and then told that she was free to go. More than six months later, on <phrase class="date" code="1998-03-27">27 March 1998</phrase>, Terry Daniels was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for drug trafficking&mdash;precisely the same sentence as was imposed on her co-defendant Mr. Benavides. He had previous criminal convictions; she did not. As I have mentioned, he had cocaine in his possession at the time of the arrest; she had none.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/4">Terry's lawyer requested that she be given conditional liberty, which was granted to her. After a series of legal skirmishes, the first appeal by Terry's lawyers was heard on <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-12">12 November 1999</phrase>. It was heard on the basis of written pleadings and dismissed in her absence. A copy of the judgment was never sent to her and her sentence of 10 years' imprisonment was confirmed. In January 2000, Terry lodged a second appeal and in February 2000, she travelled to the United Kingdom to have a medical check-up and it transpired that she needed to have a series of operations. In March 2000, in response to correspondence from me, the Spanish ambassador sent me a letter with a report from the Spanish directorate general of penitentiary institutions that stated that Terry had been released on <phrase class="date" code="1997-06-17">17 June 1997</phrase> &quot;without further admissions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/5">In May 2002, more than two years later, an international search and arrest warrant was issued, and in June 2003, a formal request for extradition was made. In August 2005, the Home Office&mdash;in the person of the Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" name="Charles Clarke">the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>&mdash;agreed to her extradition and Terry was extradited in October 2005. Now she is in Topas prison in Salamanca near Madrid.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/6">I said that I wanted to comment on the trial and the appeals process, and I shall do so in two very specific respects. One might be characterised as a comment on form and the other manifestly relates to substance. As far as the form is concerned, no translator was available during the trial. I must emphasise that, because I believe passionately that Terry has been ill treated. Terry did not understand and therefore could not effectively participate in the proceedings. She did not receive a copy of the judgment and, yes, such was the level of misunderstanding and lack of information that she thought that she was a witness at the hearing and not a defendant.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/7">On the matter of substance I make the point to the Minister of State that the evidence upon which Terry was convicted and then sentenced was scanty indeed. I do not think that I exaggerate when I say that it consisted overwhelmingly of the interpretation of an entry in her diary which referred to an expected payment. The interpretation put upon it was that she was recording an expectation of payment as a result of engagement in drug trafficking. In fact, as she explained, she was referring to a payment that was to come to her as a result of a personal injury claim. The official translation of the content of the diary was judged to be inadmissible, apparently on the grounds that it was out of time. It seems certain to me that Terry's human rights under the European convention were breached in two respects: by the failure to admit the official translation of the diary, which would have lent weight to her pleading, and by the theft of her diary.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/8">I shall now discuss the mitigating factors in Terry's case, which I genuinely believe should be seriously and thoughtfully taken into account by the Minister. I referred a few moments ago to the reference in the letter that I received from the Spanish ambassador and the accompanying report to the phrase &quot;without further admissions&quot;. It was surely not unreasonable of Terry Daniels to believe, when she had sight of that document, that the phrase &quot;without further admissions&quot; suggested that the case had been closed. That certainly was her view: she thought that the case had been dropped.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/9">There are several other mitigating factors. Seven and a half years elapsed between Terry's original conviction and the start of her imprisonment. The Spanish authorities made little effort to detain her until Thames Valley police notified Interpol of her whereabouts. She has suffered from desperately bad health&mdash;I referred to her near-fatal brain haemorrhage, and she now suffers regular bouts of depression. In addition, in the course of this appalling, harrowing and seemingly interminable saga, she has lost her father; he died of cancer slightly less than five years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/10">It is inevitable that if Terry stays in prison for any length of time after such protracted delays and despite the real anxieties about the fairness of the trial, she will have a greatly reduced possibility of having a family. She is already in her early 30s and I believe that that is a relevant consideration in this case. In addition, the prison conditions that she is now experiencing are poor. It is difficult for her to communicate as she does not speak Spanish, and many of the people around her do not speak English or do not choose to communicate with her in her mother tongue.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/11">On top of all that Terry endures separation from her remaining family. I ask the Minister to try to put himself in her position and to see the merit of my case That separation is a huge burden. Pat Daniels, her mother, is a magnificent woman, a supportive mother and a hard-working individual, but she could not by any stretch of the imagination be described as a person of means and it costs approximately &pound;1,000 every time she goes to visit her daughter. All in all, the cumulative impact of the nature of the trial, the unsatisfactory character of the appeals process, the ongoing delay, the continued uncertainty and the absence of any obvious light at the end of the tunnel is putting an intolerable strain on Terry.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/12">That leads me to my series of questions and challenges to the Minister. He knows that I hold him in the highest esteem&mdash;he is an immensely capable and intelligent Minister&mdash;so I hope that he will not take amiss what I am about to say as the prelude to my three questions. I, like many other hon. Members, have conducted a number of Adjournment debates over the years. It is not uncommon&mdash;in fact, it might be said to be a regular characteristic&mdash;to find substantial parts of ministerial speeches devoted to congratulating the hon. Member who has secured the debate and to repeating a considerable number of the difficult circumstances that the hon. Member has just spent some minutes describing. I say to the right hon. Gentleman that my ego is quite big enough, I do not require it to be inflated any further, and I am certain that he is familiar with the case, upon which there has been a great deal of correspondence. I would therefore be very grateful if he were to focus specifically on the questions that I am now about to ask.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/13">I am immensely grateful to the Foreign Office for the visits by consular staff, and for the advice that they have proffered, but I wish to put the following question to the Minister. First, given that Terry seeks a pardon, will Her Majesty's Government support her request for it? Secondly, without prejudice to the first question and the Government's attitude to it, will the Minister expedite the application for Terry's transfer to the United Kingdom? Thirdly, if the transfer is successful, will the Government allow Terry to serve her sentence, or that part of it that she is still obliged to serve, in a low-security prison on the grounds that, manifestly, she poses no threat to public order or security?</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/14">I immensely appreciate my good fortune in being able to bring these matters to the attention of the Minister this afternoon. It is not my responsibility, so I shall not take it upon myself to say whether Terry Daniels is innocent or guilty. For my part, I believe that she is an honourable and decent person. It is, however, my responsibility to judge whether she has a reasonable case with which it is proper to trouble the Minister. I believe that she has.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/15">Terry has been supported throughout her case by Fair Trials Abroad, an admirable organisation to whose distinguished director, Stephen Jakobi, and his indefatigable work on this case I pay the warmest possible tribute. She has been badly treated. I do not want her case to be forgotten. It should not go by the board. Pat Daniels has done her best to champion Terry's cause while trying to work for a living and to hold the family together in some way. Terry is in no position to act for herself, but she knows that this debate has been secured. If she is to have a chance to rebuild her family life, to consider the possibility of being able to start a family herself, and to build a constructive and happy future, I believe that she requires the assistance of the British Government. I am sure that the Minister is not only intelligent and competent, but decent and humane, and I look forward to his reply with interest and anticipation.</p>

	<p pid="b.305.2/1">I am grateful for that clarification, Mr. Bayley. Given that assurance, hope to be able to answer the specific questions that have been put to me.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/2">I assure <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> that it is due neither to a desire for obfuscation nor to a desire to adhere to protocol that I congratulate him on his eloquent description of the case that he has raised today. I hope to be able to reply directly to his points. However, it is important&mdash;not least on the ground of completeness&mdash;that I should take the opportunity to place in context the case that we are discussing in relation to the wider UK-Spain relations, which are relevant to this case, and to place on record our understanding of how we arrived at this point.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/3">Before I discuss relations between the UK and Spain and address the specific points that have been put to me, it is important to note the close ties that the United Kingdom enjoys with Spain. Relations between the two countries are strong and deep. An estimated 677,000 Britons have chosen to make Spain their home: theirs is one of the largest British expatriate communities anywhere in the world. As one would expect, there is close co-operation on issues of justice and home affairs. The UK and Spain work together to improve Europe's response to common challenges such as immigration, and we have agreed fast-track extradition procedures between our two states. There is also extensive and valuable co-operation on health matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/4">Let me now give a summary of the case before us today. As I said, the hon. Gentleman spoke eloquently about the background to Ms Daniels' case and the events surrounding her trial, extradition and imprisonment in Spain. As he knows, our consular staff in London and Spain have been following Ms Daniels' case closely and have been providing her and her family with all appropriate consular assistance. I assure the House and the hon. Gentleman that that assistance will continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/5">The UK has important international obligations in matters of extradition, which it takes seriously. In Ms Daniels' case, the position at all material times was that she had already been convicted in Spain of serious drugs offences. She has sought unsuccessfully to appeal in Spain against a 10-year sentence. By the time the conviction was made final in January 2000, however, she had left the country. Not surprisingly, Spain's request for extradition followed. Pursuant to it, she was arrested in this country in June 2003. Bow Street magistrates committed her in June 2004, and an ensuing appeal to the High Court was dismissed in January 2005. It then fell to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to reach a final decision on Ms Daniels' surrender. In representations made against such an outcome, her UK solicitors relied in part upon the alleged lack of evidence against her. The solicitors contended, for example, that the Spanish evidence was not strong and relied almost entirely on entries in Ms Daniels' personal diaries, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/6">Spain's request for Ms Daniels' extradition as a convicted person withstood judicial challenge here before Bow Street magistrates and the High Court. It is not and cannot be the proper function of the Home Secretary to delve into the safety of a conviction arrived at in the independent courts of another European Union country any more than it would be right, I submit, for Spanish authorities to appear to impugn the integrity of a conviction arrived at in our courts. The Home Secretary considered the whole case fairly and properly in the round, including the representations that were made to him on evidential, health and other grounds, some of which we have heard today. For reasons fully set out in a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-23">23 August 2005</phrase> to Ms Daniels' legal representatives, my right hon. Friend concluded that those considerations did not outweigh the case for surrender. It was open to Ms Daniels to apply for judicial review of that decision, but she elected not to do so. Her surrender to Spain was effected on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-22">22 October 2005</phrase>, in conformity with our international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/7">The hon. Gentleman asks that the Government consider obtaining clemency for Ms Daniels. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will consider supporting a prisoner's plea for clemency in certain circumstances. Our policy is outlined in an answer given to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-02">2 May 2001</phrase>. With your permission, Mr. Bayley, I will take this opportunity to outline our policy for the benefit of all hon. Members. The answer given states:</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/8" class="indent">&quot;Our objective is to support pleas for clemency in deserving cases, while respecting the sovereign right of foreign Governments to sentence prisoners according to their own laws.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/9">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/10" class="indent">&quot;We will . . . consider supporting clemency pleas from British nationals imprisoned overseas in the following cases: in compelling compassionate circumstances, such as where a prisoner is chronically ill or dying (particularly when prison conditions overseas are poor) or when a close family member is chronically ill or dying; where continued incarceration is likely to endanger life or is likely to reduce life expectancy significantly; in cases of minors imprisoned overseas; as a last resort, in cases where we have prima facie evidence of a denial or miscarriage of justice, where we have made representations, but where those representations have failed to secure a remedy. In these cases, our reasons for supporting a plea would not normally be mentioned explicitly in the plea itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/11" class="indent">We will also take the prisoner's family circumstances into account when considering whether to support a plea for clemency. We will examine all pleas on a case-by-case basis.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2001-05-02.629"><i>Official Report, House of Commons,</i> 2 May 2001; Vol. 367, c. 629W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/12">To answer the hon. Gentleman's first question, we would certainly consider any request from Ms Daniels to support a plea for clemency if those criteria were met. Ms Daniels should make her clemency plea to the Spanish authorities through a lawyer.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/13">Implicit in that question was the possibility of remission. The hon. Gentleman asked whether Ms Daniels could be considered for possible remission of her sentence. There is provision under Spanish law for the early release of prisoners who are terminally ill or dying. I would advise Ms Daniels to investigate the Spanish procedures for granting remission and to obtain local legal advice on whether she could be eligible.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/14">On the second specific question, I understand that Ms Daniels applied on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-14">14 December 2005</phrase> to be transferred home to the United Kingdom to serve the rest of her sentence under the 1983 convention on the transfer of sentenced persons. Letters have been sent to the prison governor and Her Majesty's Prison Service transfer section by our consular staff with the information that she wishes to apply for transfer of sentence. As for how long it might take for such a transfer of sentence to the United Kingdom to be effected, prisoner transfers between the United Kingdom and Spain take place under the European convention on the transfer of sentenced persons. Any transfers from Spain to the United Kingdom must be agreed by the Spanish and British authorities as well as the individual involved. The time taken to consider and arrange a transfer varies from case to case, so it is difficult to give a precise answer. Our experience in previous cases suggests it can take two years or longer from application to transfer.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/15">I listened to the specific point made by the hon. Gentleman about the nature of the establishment to which Ms Daniels would be returned in the United Kingdom. I am not clear at this juncture about the exact procedure by which that would be determined, but I or one of my colleagues in the Home Office will write to him about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/16">For the record, I should outline the consular assistance that we have provided to Ms Daniels and her family. Consular staff were informed of Ms Daniels's arrival in Spain on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October 2005</phrase> following her extradition from the UK to Spain to complete her sentence. Our proconsul visited her in Madrid prison on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-25">25 October</phrase>. Ms Daniels said that she was anxious to be transferred to Las Palmas prison in the Canary islands where she had originally been imprisoned. Our proconsul maintained contact with the prison authorities, checking whether Ms Daniels would be transferred to another prison. We informed her on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November</phrase> that she was to be transferred to Topas prison, Salamanca, near Madrid, and unfortunately not to Las Palmas prison as she had hoped. The honourable Gentleman will understand that it is for the Spanish authorities to place prisoners as they see fit, just as it is for Her Majesty's Prison Service in the United Kingdom to decide where to put detainees.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.2/17">Ms Daniels saw the prison doctor and the social worker on her arrival at Madrid prison. With Ms Daniels's agreement, our consular staff arranged for copies of her United Kingdom medical records to be made available to the prison authorities in Spain. We also provided a short summary of the records in Spanish. A member of our consular staff again visited Ms Daniels when she was moved to Topas prison on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-23">23 November 2005</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.308.0/1">It is my view that there has been a miscarriage of justice, not least because of the character of the trial and appeal process that I described. I am sorry if the Government do not agree or are not prepared to contest the issue with the Spanish authorities. However, does the Minister consider it a relevant factor in the case that such a huge amount of time elapsed between Terry's original sentencing and the start of the sentence?</p>

	<p pid="b.308.1/1">Let me say with the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman that I hoped that I had addressed his point earlier. I explained that on the basis of the extradition request&mdash;a direct consequence of Ms Daniels being back in the United Kingdom&mdash;a number of legal steps were taken between the original sentencing and her incarceration in Spain. If that offers no comfort to the hon. Gentleman, I hope that it at least explains the length of the intervening period when, as I described, proceedings were brought before Bow Street magistrates and then the High Court. Ultimately, there was a decision by the Home Secretary based on the specific points that I have outlined.</p>

	<p pid="b.308.2/1">May I put on the record the fact that Terry Daniels has never made any secret of her address in Abbotts Way, Wingrave, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire? There was no problem of finding her, so that, at least, can be cast aside as a consideration in this matter.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-18b.308.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" colnum="308"  time="016:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060118/halltext/60118h05.htm#60118h05_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.308.3/1">I made no such suggestion. I was making it clear that Ms Daniels was involved in a series of legal proceedings here in the United Kingdom. An additional factor that should to be borne in mind is that cases in Spain can take a long time to come to court.</p>
	<p pid="b.308.3/2">In conclusion, let me say briefly that all of us involved in consular work appreciate that imprisoning any person in a foreign prison places enormous strain on the families involved, as it does on the individual detained. For the welfare of the prisoner and to ease the concerns of family members, consular staff take their duty of care to our prisoners in foreign prisons most seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.308.3/3">At this juncture, I too pay tribute to the work of Stephen Jakobi and Fair Trials Abroad. I know of the vital work that he and his organisation have taken on in a number of cases. However, I emphasise that we will maintain a close interest in Ms Daniels' welfare, while continuing to provide her and her family with all appropriate consular assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.308.3/4" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
