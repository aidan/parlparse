	<p pid="c.165.2/1">When I was married to my late first husband, Bob Cryer, in 1963, we managed, fortunately, to rent a house from a Mrs. Singleton. I do not want to sound like a Monty Python sketch, but we had an outside toilet and no bathroom, and our only heating was a coal fire. Eventually, we redecorated the house, made it snug, and put a water heater in the kitchen. Mrs. Singleton was so impressed by our efforts that she put our rent up from &pound;1 a week to &pound;1.50. So much for our efforts.</p>

	<p pid="c.165.4/1">She probably was.</p>
	<p pid="c.165.4/2">This morning, I want to focus on the problems in the Bradford district as a whole. Social housing is quite a hot topic today, because my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing has been talking about how to manage social housing. Although I do not agree with some of her comments, she apparently said on the &quot;Today&quot; programme that she looked forward to having more and better social housing. That is what I am asking for in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.165.4/3">In the Bradford <i>Telegraph and Argus</i> last night, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1440" name="Terry Rooney">the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney)</phrase> apparently berated the Bradford Community Housing Trust about the lack of consideration for tenants in his constituency. Over past months, I have had numerous complaints from constituents on various estates in my constituency about the lack of repairs and care by the trust. This morning, I shall focus on one estate&mdash;the Woodhouse estate.</p>
	<p pid="c.165.4/4">At a public meeting in Keighley in September last year, a representative of BCHT, the quasi-private organisation that took control of council housing following the stock transfer in 2003, admitted to tenants that they were living in homes that needed &pound;45,000 of repairs each. I acknowledge the chronic condition of housing, but BCHT continued to receive rent either from its tenants directly or from the public purse via housing benefit. My attempts to seek an explanation as to how BCHT intended to remedy its self-confessed problem were met with comments, published in <i>Inside Housing</i><i>,</i> that dismissed my calls for accountability on the ground that I was electioneering.</p>
	<p pid="c.165.4/5">MPs may be accused of that whatever we do. Perhaps the trust would have me do nothing about anything. However, the fact that it has repeatedly failed to answer legitimate questions from an elected representative and the diligent councillors for the ward is reprehensible. We should have been aware of the possibility of this type of problem at the time of stock transfer. Taking publicly owned property and transferring it to a quasi-private body without democratic accountability was always likely to be a recipe for disaster. Stock transfer not only brought to an end the influence of elected councillors, but excluded registered social landlords from both the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. I was not aware of that until recently.</p>

	<p pid="c.166.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Lady on raising an important subject. Does she accept that a decent registered social landlord that is non-profit-making and is run by a board that includes the right number of tenant representatives can deliver decent housing standards and proper maintenance, whereas tenants whose properties remain in council ownership are not necessarily guaranteed that level of decent housing and maintenance?</p>

	<p pid="c.166.2/1">The hon. Lady is being generous in giving way. I had the same problem as she did, but the other way round. My council refused to give me, as the elected representative of 1,536 tenants, their names and addresses so that I could contact them to represent their interests during the transfer. That was deplorable and the Audit Commission and the local government ombudsman had to become involved in the matter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05c.166.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1659" speakername="Ann Cryer" colnum="166"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0001.htm#08020535000470">
	<p pid="c.166.3/1">I seemed to have greater influence before stock transfer than now. In a perfect world there may be trusts that manage things better than the one in Bradford.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/2">The same landlord&mdash;BCHT&mdash;refused to allow one of my constituents to bid for a property. She had served time in prison for a crime for which she had paid the price to society, and wanted to rebuild her life with her two children without again resorting to crime. BCHT believed that the punishment handed down by the courts was insufficient. It was hardly for the trust to comment in that way.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/3">The same landlord attempted to explain the unacceptable condition of housing in my constituency on the basis of a 30-year business plan. My constituents, who are forced to live in such poor conditions, have been denied access to that plan even after an application under the Freedom of Information Act. As their elected representative, I must apparently wait until I am 98 to learn of the solutions. I shall probably be pushing up the daisies by then, or I may have lost interest.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/4">What is worse, as many hon. Members may recall from their constituencies, stock transfer was secured on spurious grounds. First, tenants were promised investment in their homes. Any visit to the Woodhouse estate would demonstrate that that has not materialised. Secondly, any tenant who did not vote in the election to ratify the stock transfer was assumed to have voted for it, which was a deplorable insult to the concept of free and fair elections. Any hon. Member representing an inner-city or urban constituency will be only too aware of how difficult it can be for even the most hard-working and imaginative colleagues to encourage some of our constituents to engage in the electoral process. Such a vote devalues and undermines our process of government and administration and, moreover, makes a mockery of the ethos of being a social landlord.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/5">From the outset, the signs were there. I argued against stock transfer, and I suppose I lost. That is clearly in the past, but just because stock transfer was built on shaky foundations does not mean that we must now passively allow this flawed, inappropriate and disengaged system to continue. I have asked legitimate questions, but have not been given the courtesy of an intelligent reply. I asked why, when operating and running costs have increased by 11 per cent. since stock transfer and income has increased by only 8 per cent., BCHT was using the funds raised through property sales to cover the annually increasing deficit, which is akin to corporate cannibalism. I was again told that it formed part of a 30-year plan, and my request to see the plan was denied. I also asked when the corporate cannibalism might cease and the proceeds from sales might be reinvested in areas such as Woodhouse, but was again referred to the 30-year plan, and my requests to see it were again denied.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/6">How can I possibly be expected to explain the extremely poor conditions that many of my constituents have to contend with, day in, day out, by a 30-year plan? This economic model is, as yet, wholly untested in the social landlord stock transfer market, which is being used as a smokescreen to avoid accountability to democratically elected representatives such as me and local councillors, and does not deal with the practical issue of substandard housing. One director of the trust has suggested that the answer is simply to refinance the debts. At a time when the Governor of the Bank of England is asking us to tighten our belts and refrain from using our credit cards too much, I am being told&mdash;albeit privately&mdash;that BCHT should exercise its credit card. Perhaps the question at stake is one not only of accountability, but of the ability to count.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/7">In response to my public and private questioning of BCHT, a consultation with tenants has commenced. Apparently, a meeting, or a so-called options appraisal, will take place tonight on the Woodhouse estate. I look forward to the outcome of that. However, the Housing Corporation has told me that the redevelopment of the Woodhouse estate was never in the infamous 30-year plan, that no application for funding in respect of that redevelopment has ever been made to the Housing Corporation and that, if it were made, it would be rejected on the ground that it did not provide value for money. That is what I was told several weeks ago in a meeting with a representative from the Housing Corporation.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/8">Are we saying, therefore, that the economics of the marketplace should determine whether tenants have the right to decent housing? Treating tenants in such a way is undemocratic and immoral. To make matters worse, my attempts to address the issue were met by opposition from Bradford city hall and by calls for me to keep quiet. I was accused of getting it wrong, and of not understanding the situation or the economic model. I was told that my comments could damage Bradford. My constituency is one fifth of Bradford, and my Woodhouse constituents are a part of that. I think that it would be far more damaging to Bradford if I were to keep quiet.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/9">I have seen for myself the houses on the Woodhouse estate, and I know what condition they are in. They are frequently well decorated and cared for by tenants, but the damp is showing through, which is soul destroying for the house-proud people who pay the rents. I challenge any of my critics to meet me at any time on the Woodhouse estate and tell me and my constituents that I and they are wrong and that the 30-year plan is working for them. I find it inexplicable that, after an audit on BCHT, the Housing Corporation found the estate to be satisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/10">In Walsall, the post-stock transfer organisation faces similar problems. In that case, the Housing Corporation acted. I see no difference between the two scenarios apart from an unwillingness on the part of a regulatory body to carry out its function. If the auditors acting on behalf of the Housing Corporation had really seen the Woodhouse estate, serious questions must be asked regarding their competence. I doubt that they ever saw Woodhouse. Had they done so, they would not have come to their conclusion. I could question what the auditors saw or did not see, but, again, I would be faced with no reply and the stonewall of exemption from the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/11">It is not in my interests to criticise BCHT without good reason. It is the largest provider of social housing in the Bradford district, and I and my constituents have every interest in having a strong, successful social landlord. However, the reality is that, at a time when demand for housing is increasing, and will continue to do so, stock is significantly decreasing, while costs increase. The fact that BCHT and the Housing Corporation are reluctant to come clean merely adds to the suspicion that something is wrong. If it is the case that the Woodhouse houses are not worth &pound;45,000 of investment but should be replaced, how will BCHT pay for any redevelopment? Had I been told last September that funding is simply not available, I would have immediately referred the matter to the Minister. In the 21st century and after 11 years of our Government, I do not accept that we can idly stand by and allow people to live in the conditions that are found on that estate.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/12">I have been invited to meet the Housing Corporation and BCHT. I am told that they want to address the problems of Woodhouse, but are not yet in a position to share the details of those plans. Even the last-minute attempts to address the matter are shrouded in secrecy. What am I asking? First, I want an open and robust commitment to deal with the problems of the Woodhouse estate in Keighley. I want to see detailed plans and schedules. I want my constituents to be involved in the drawing up of those plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/13">Secondly, I want a reappraisal of the meaning of &quot;social landlord&quot;. In the case of BCHT, stock transfer appears to have diminished its ethos. When the interests of the company come before the interests of its tenants, something has gone dramatically wrong. Thirdly, I want to see a reinforcement of the principle of public accountability. Fourthly, there is no point in having a regulatory body if it passively accepts unsatisfactory performance and fails to challenge and find solutions to substandard housing. A regulatory body must have the ability and courage to enforce.</p>
	<p pid="c.166.3/14">Finally, I want my constituents to be treated with the respect that they deserve rather than being seen as an inconvenience. I want them to be given the right to live in a home that is not harmful to them. Addressing social injustices is what we, and what social landlords, should be about. I do not wish to damage BCHT, but I do not believe that adopting the ostrich position in dealing with such difficult issues is beneficial to anyone.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05c.169.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" speakername="Austin Mitchell" colnum="169"  time="009:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0001.htm#08020535000471">
	<p pid="c.169.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1659" name="Ann Cryer">the Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer)</phrase> on securing this debate and on putting over her case. It is a crying scandal for a housing association to be so unhelpful to its tenants and to its Member of Parliament. The record of Bradford Community Housing Trust does not seem good to an outsider such as me. It is not right for a social landlord to behave in such a way towards its tenants. The Housing Corporation is currently merging with English Partnerships, which I hope will not be the prelude to a further period of confusion. I hope that such a merger will effectively bring pressure on housing associations to behave more sensibly and in a more accommodating way towards their tenants.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/2">I, too, lost a ballot on a large-scale voluntary transfer against the registered social landlord in Grimsby. In such cases, the deluge of videos and misleading information that descends on tenants has the effect of rigging the ballot. However, that is a loser's plaint, and I lost. Council housing was taken over by Shoreline housing association, which has been a good landlord and concerned to improve conditions. It has steadily improved the estates by rebuilding and pulling down the worst properties. I am entirely happy with Shoreline. The only problem is that it has not been able to bring into housing all the money that it promised. As a result, houses on some of the estates are boarded up and stick out like sore thumbs. They are clearly a distress to neighbours. Such conditions cannot be improved until the housing association raises the money on the markets, which is proving difficult. It will be a difficult year for housing associations, and for anybody else, to raise money.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/3">The record of housing associations is very patchy. Some are excellent, some are good and some are disastrous. The Government conventionally criticised the councils. There were the same variations in the performance of councils in respect of housing. Some were effective landlords and some were not. The record was better on the whole that that of the housing associations because the tenants had a form of accountability. If they did not like how the council was behaving towards them, they could throw out the councillors. They had that means of redress. There is not the same effective pressure on housing associations. It is misleading to suggest, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> did, that housing associations are better at consulting.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/4">The experience is that tenant consultation by housing associations is less effective than it was by the councils. The machinery of consultation is usually set up, but it tends to wither in at least some housing associations. Tenants on the board are bound by the Companies Act 2006 to support the financial interests of the company rather than the interests of the tenants whom they were appointed to represent, so it is not an effective form of representation.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/5">The record is one of sluggishness, particularly in respect of new housing. This country needs a massive housing drive and the Government have undertaken to promote such a drive. That will be very difficult this year, given the state of the housing market. I have tabled an early-day motion&mdash;it does not yet have a number&mdash;suggesting that money should be made available to councils to take over repossessed properties and put them into council housing stock, instead of the building societies and creditors selling off the houses for peanuts, as is usually the case. That would be a useful means of expanding the social housing that this country needs. I hope that the Government will listen to that.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/6">The point is that we need a housing drive and the RSLs&mdash;the housing associations&mdash;are generally sluggish in their approach to new development. They prefer to build up reserves and balances&mdash;to have the money in the bank&mdash;and turn themselves into benign housing operators rather than launching a big housing drive in their area. If the councils cannot do that and the housing associations do not do it, it will not be done, so means have to be developed for the Housing Corporation, under its new name, to push housing associations into redevelopment.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/7">The same is true of arm's length management organisations. Some ALMOs&mdash;certainly in Camden, where it is difficult to find land for new building&mdash;are being forced to sell off council housing to raise the money to carry out the necessary repairs. I think that that is happening in Sheffield. It is also happening in Birmingham, although it is not an ALMO there. We are in effect reducing the amount of social housing to raise money to repair the remaining social housing, rather than expanding the whole social housing sector. That is a scandal. It is distressing that the so-called Housing and Regeneration Bill&mdash;it will not do much for either, as far as I can see&mdash;does not tackle that problem right at the start.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/8">This debate is about standards in housing, and the financial pressure on councils is preventing them from improving standards in housing. That pressure and the aspirations of housing associations to build up balances and reserves and to merge with one another to form ever bigger housing associations, covering the whole country and therefore having roots and commitments in no particular area, will prevent the improvements in housing standards that my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley talks about and that we need throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/9">The pressures are considerable. Councils are being bullied, bamboozled and pushed into privatising their stock. The Government take from the housing revenue account &pound;1.5 billion every year for redistribution and to pay off the historical debt. That money should go to housing. They take the revenues from right-to-buy sales&mdash;which should go to housing&mdash;away from the local authorities. Councils have been deprived of money. They are not being provided with any extra money in the generous way in which housing associations are provided with it, through gap funding and the write-off of debt. Councils are not allowed to compete on equal terms in order to push them into privatisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/10">That pressure is increased by the Housing and Regeneration Bill, according to which tenants&mdash;I do not know how many; 10, 15, 20, 25 or perhaps only two or three&mdash;will be allowed to precipitate a large-scale voluntary transfer. One half of the Bill is devoted to pushing councils out of housing and the other half purports to bring them back into housing. That is a crazy combination; we cannot do both. If we are to improve housing standards, that dichotomy must be resolved; it is schizophrenic thinking to assume that we can do that. Even where councils are supposed to come back into housing, they are asked to do so on terms that make it impossible for most of them. In fact, the only terms on which they will be able to obtain regional grants is if they go for a large-scale voluntary transfer. It is a vicious circle.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/11">All that means that after 18 Tory years of disinvestment in council housing and 10 Labour years of pressure to privatise, council housing is in a mess in many areas. The Hills report aspires to creating mixed communities, which is what we need and what there used to be. Professor Hills' research shows that up to 1979, council housing was in genuinely mixed communities, with better-off as well as worse-off people. Since then, the estates have become dumping grounds, because so much of the stock has been sold off. Some of the stock sold off has been repossessed and bought by landlords who just put in anybody, so the whole area goes steadily downhill and there is no longer any sense of community. In that situation, housing standards are declining. We want social housing and council housing to be in a genuine community in which people can grow up together, live together and aspire to move into ownership or to other areas. It has to be a base from which people can build, but it has not become that.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/12">It is distressing to see the views of the new Minister for Housing in today's edition of <i>The Guardian</i>&mdash;exhibit A, which I cannot produce in court, but which I hold up in case anybody has long sight and can read it from a distance. I do not know what happens to new Ministers. It has not happened on the same scale to the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase>, but there is a kind of miasma in the basement of the Department for Communities and Local Government that seeps up and fills the minds of new Ministers, who begin to take up the kind of attitudes that one associates with the Smith institute. The attitude is basically that social housing and council housing are a kind of transit camp into which people will be moved on the basis of a means test and out of which they will be moved if they become better off. It is not that&mdash;it is housing for people; it is housing for communities. Until we get back to that basic aspiration, we shall have an unsatisfactory situation in which there are low standards in housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/13">According to the article, the new Minister for Housing refers to</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/14" class="indent">&quot;the culture of 'no one works around here'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/15">That is often the case because unemployment is higher on council estates. It is higher still on housing association estates. It is distressing that the article states that, referring to the &quot;no one works here&quot; syndrome,</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/16" class="indent">&quot;she said there was some evidence that living in social housing acted as a deterrent to people seeking work due to the sheer and growing concentrations of unemployment and poverty on such estates. 'If you are in a family, an estate or a neighbourhood where nobody works that impacts on your own aspiration.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/17">In other words, the estates, it is now argued, are the breeding grounds of a shiftless unemployed population that does not want work. That is the implication. Council tenants and social housing tenants are being abused in that fashion because they are in that situation as a consequence of the Government policy of selling off council housing and social housing under the right to buy, using the estates as dumping grounds for the needy and allowing landlords to buy the properties that have been sold off and allowed to deteriorate.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/18">Questions arise from the Minister's statement. Does the view that if people want a council house they should find a job apply to council estates? That is not clear from the article. Does it apply only to council estates, or does it apply to registered social landlords and housing associations? Does it affect secure tenancies, which people on council estates have, and assured tenancies, which people in housing association estates have? The new commitment&mdash;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I apologise for that, Mr. Amess, I have an enormous fan club who clamour for me at the most inopportune times. I shall switch my phone off&mdash;perhaps the Minister for Housing is trying to call me to give me the proper interpretation of her remarks.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/19">My point is that the threats are vague and unspecific. They will be received very badly on council and social housing estates all over the country. What are we about? We are the Labour party! We have been built up by support from people on council estates, and we treat them in such a fashion when they are at the end of a long period of financial deprivation, which has reduced them to their state. They are now being abused and told that they must go out and find a job. That is no way for a Labour Government to behave, or even to think.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/20">Do the Minister's remarks apply to housing estates only or to RSLs as well? Does the policy apply to new tenancies, or, as the Minister seemed to indicate, will it be extended to existing tenants? She certainly left the latter possibility open in her speech. Will the policy apply to new contracts for people in social housing, which would force them to look for work in addition to the other pressures that they face? People need to be encouraged and helped to look for work, but to be forced to do so as a condition of tenancy is another matter entirely.</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/21">What happens when people buy properties on estates, particularly from RSLs? The Government encourage people to buy a share in their own house, which is an unpredictable burden for tenants, because they cannot be sure what repairs will cost, and how much of that will fall on them and how much on housing associations. It will be a difficult burden to shoulder, particularly for people on those estates where 67 per cent. of the population are on benefits of some kind. It is difficult to see that such people will rush to buy shares in their own property, but if they do so, are they going to be treated in the fashion that I described along with everybody else?</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/22">All those questions need to be answered but, most of all, the Government need to raise their aspirations for new house building by councils, as well as by housing associations. Councils have the best overview of the housing needs in their area and they want to serve those needs. It is therefore unreasonable to push them out of housing when we are trying to encourage the building of more social housing. Will the necessary funding be provided to generate the improvement in the conditions of the estates and the tenants?</p>
	<p pid="c.169.0/23">We are committed to reaching the decent homes standard by 2010. Frankly, I doubt that we will reach it, but if we are going to do so, funding such as the gap funding that is made available to housing associations must surely be made available to councils, to help them to undertake the repairs and regeneration that are necessary in their areas. Our commitment must be to improve conditions for existing tenants as well as to build the new housing that is necessary because people cannot get on the ladder. Why can we not undertake both commitments?</p>

	<p pid="c.173.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1659" name="Ann Cryer">the Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer)</phrase> on securing this debate. I thank her for the harrowing story that she told today about the behaviour of one registered social landlord in Bradford. When I finish my remarks, I hope that the Under-Secretary will give us some hope about the future regulation, administration and democracy of registered social landlords. I shall return to that matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/2">If they wished to do so, hon. Members could pick up from the Library an interesting document titled &quot;Social Indicators&quot;, which comes out every month or so. The section on housing is very interesting, because it shows that people buying their own homes are paying an ever higher proportion of their salaries on housing costs, so the need for socially provided housing through either an RSL or a local authority is increasing, especially if my own community is anything to go by. Roughly 80 per cent. of my population have no possibility whatever of buying their own place in the community, and therefore rely either on council housing or housing associations to provide one.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/3">When we look at the completion of permanent dwellings by sector in the UK, we will see that in 1997 there were 160,000 private sector completions, 28,000 registered social landlord completions and 1,500 local authority completions. By 2005-06, there were 188,000 private sector completions, registered social landlord completions had gone down to 24,000 and local authority completions, at 326, had almost disappeared. That means that out of the 213,000 new properties that were completed in that year, fewer than 12 per cent. were for people who apply for social housing of some sort. In my constituency, which is pretty normal for inner-urban Britain and certainly for inner London, about 45 to 50 per cent. of the population live in properties owned by either the local authority or a registered social landlord. If we applied that figure to the rest of the country, we would begin to see that, by our failure to build, we are creating a bigger problem for ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/4">On the following page of &quot;Social Indicators&quot;, the story begins to unfold. In 1997, 44,000 households were living in temporary accommodation arranged through local authorities. That figure increased to 101,000 in 2004. I am pleased that it has now come down slightly, yet there are still 87,000 households living in temporary accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/5">Members of Parliament earn a good salary and usually have somewhere very nice to live, if not two or three nice places to live, according to the &quot;Today&quot; programme. They do not have a sense of insecurity. Imagine what it is like for people who are trying to bring up a couple of children when they are homeless. They will be placed by a local authority either in a bed and breakfast hotel, a hostel or temporary rented accommodation from a private landlord. They do not know how long they will be there. Their landlord is totally unresponsive to the need for repairs and so on. There is nowhere for their children to play. They have nowhere to get their own furniture, and there is no way for them to make their accommodation their home. After six months, they could be moved on, and their children might have to move school. That could happen again and again. Those people are desperately waiting for the dream of being offered a permanent tenancy in a decent flat where they know that they can put down roots and become part of the local community to come true.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/6">Imagine the effect of that situation on children who grow up with such a sense of insecurity. When they go to school, they are too embarrassed to say to their mates, &quot;Come home and have tea with me tonight.&quot; They are embarrassed because they live in a hostel or in a temporary place, or because they would have to travel a long way. I constantly meet young parents whose children go to primary schools in my constituency but who are homeless, so the local authority has placed them in rented accommodation, sometimes as far away as Enfield. That might not sound so far to us, but we should imagine making a 90-minute journey each way to school by bus to maintain a link with a community&mdash;we should think about children spending three hours a day on a bus.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/7">None of that is necessary. It has become the norm, because as a society and as a country we are not addressing the seriousness of the housing needs of an awful lot of people who are desperate to have somewhere permanent, safe and secure to live. I hope that we will begin to develop some sense of national endeavour, as this country managed to do after the second world war. The endeavour to solve the housing problem went on for nearly 20 years. None of the problems are necessary, and the damage that they are doing to people's lives is very serious.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/8">I welcome what the Government did in 1997 on decent home standards and in investing large amounts of money in improving estates. When I go around my constituency, I see new windows, new roofs and better common parts. All those things are very welcome. It is good news, and it has certainly improved the lives of many people. I hope that the Minister will take the decent homes standards a little further. First, much better energy efficiency standards are important for all new properties&mdash;not only local authority or RSL properties, but those in the private sector. Energy prices are likely to rise, so a lack of energy efficiency will mean higher costs for tenants.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/9">Secondly, within the planning guidelines, will the Minister ensure that much better standards of open space, particularly play space, are made available in urban areas? We are building to high levels of density. I can understand the pressure for high-density living, but it is important to make provision for some open space, including children's play areas. We also need something to be done about minimum room sizes and ceiling heights; again, that affects people's quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/10">Lastly&mdash;I say this with feeling&mdash;a large proportion of properties in my constituency are Victorian, and of themselves they are nice buildings and certainly attractive, but most of them have been converted into smaller apartments, and relatively few remain as family houses. The standards of conversion vary, but the standards of soundproofing are appalling. Many people come to my advice bureau, and to those of councillors and others, who are driven to distraction by noise from neighbours' flats. It is not necessarily that the neighbours are particularly noisy, but with such a low level of soundproofing on conversion, life can be intolerable. For instance, if a middle flat has three or four children running around all day, older people living in the ground floor flat would find their sympathy for the younger generation disappearing. All kinds of social tension result. Standards, open space and quality of housing are important matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/11">Many of my constituents are in desperate housing need. As I have explained, some are in less desperate need, in the sense that they are not eligible for local authority assistance, but they cannot buy because they do not earn enough, so they rent on the private market. Rents in London and in most big cities are very high. People living in my constituency, usually young people, are paying &pound;250 to &pound;400 a week for a flat. That makes a big hole in their salary, and they have no permanent security of tenure. Normally, they are on six-month to one-year lease agreements, and the rents can go up again at the end of that time.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/12">That has a number of effects. First, as a society we end up with a poorer sense of community, because people do not feel a sense of belonging or of security. Secondly, many people are making vast sums out of the buy-to-let market. Indeed, it is one of the biggest growth areas. Is it sensible to encourage that sort of investment without any rent regulation and with such vast profits being made? I ask the Minister to think seriously about what degree of regulation should be introduced into the private rented market.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/13">In 1974, the Labour Government, led by Harold Wilson, was prepared to control rents. It was a popular measure, and it was effective. It also brought about much greater security of tenure in the private market. The Conservative Government, under Margaret Thatcher, did away with most of those protections and controls, and we are still paying the price.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/14">I ask the Minister to look at the totality of expenditure. He is doubtless considering investment in housing&mdash;that is his job and what his budget is for&mdash;but I ask him to encourage the Government to look at the problem more holistically. I go back to the point that I started with: people are placed in privately rented, leased flats by local authorities because they are homeless. Some of those places are in appalling condition, and the rents are usually higher than on the open market. Many cost more than &pound;400 a week&mdash;I do not joke, it is that high&mdash;but it is all paid through housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/15">I do not object to people receiving housing benefit&mdash;quite the reverse; I support it&mdash;but it means that the community is paying out sums that would cover a pretty large mortgage, and that money is being spent on flats of an appalling standard, with insecurity of tenure, which are bad places to bring up children, and all the rest of it. And who is making money out of this but fly-by-night slum landlords, who are being subsidised by the public sector? It is immoral and wrong. The solution is to be tough on standards. The long-term solution is building far more places for rent for those in desperate housing need.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/16">The last point that I want to make is about democracy in housing. In my area, as in others, an ever larger number of people are living in properties owned by registered social landlords, and most development is undertaken by them&mdash;very little is done by the local authority. Islington local authority is at last developing a hundred-and-something new council houses. It is the first time for many years that we have seen new development.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/17">I welcome such developments, but unfortunately they are often paid for by the sale of a large number existing council properties&mdash;either businesses premises, or places that the council could not afford to do up, with street properties sold at auction on the open market. Those properties were not sold to people in desperate housing need; most were sold to property companies. I ask myself, who is helping whom? If we sell some properties in order to improve the remaining properties for development, we will end up with fewer places to rent, not more&mdash;the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/18">When the Minister next considers the details of the legislation before the House, I hope that he will look seriously at the question of the democracy and administration of housing associations. I have a large number of housing associations in my constituency. I meet them all from time to time. I have a great deal of correspondence with them. Some of them are extremely responsive and helpful, and I have no particular complaints about them&mdash;they respond to my requests and those of my constituents, and that is fair enough&mdash;but some are much less responsive, some do not respond at all, and some are so large that they hardly know where their properties are to be found.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/19">We come down to the question of accountability and democracy. Is it really such a good idea continually to encourage housing associations to merge and grow endlessly? Circle Anglia has become an enormous housing association, with properties from London to Lincolnshire. It has executive offices and super-executive offices and super-duper-executive offices, with lots of executives running all over the place&mdash;and somewhere, somebody sometimes ends up doing some of the repairs. The management structure covers a diffuse selection of properties&mdash;probably expensive ones.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/20">We need much greater rationalisation. We need the zoning of housing associations, so that they are restricted to one city, county or area. I hope that when the Mayor of London takes over the London Housing Board in April, and it becomes the main motor for investment in London properties, he will be given the power to encourage, if not force, housing associations to restrict themselves to one part of the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/21">We should also introduce a sense of democracy in housing associations. There was a time when they were small and local, and often democratic. Many operated on semi-co-operative principles. Indeed, in my constituency we still have a number of housing co-operatives. I do not see why we cannot return to that state. RSL tenants hardly know who their landlord is; their landlords are remote, and non-responsive. We need a return of a sense of democracy.</p>
	<p pid="c.173.0/22">This debate is about housing standards. For some people, the standard is high, but for far too many, standards are poor, and it makes life very difficult. We need a sense of priority. Too many families break up; too many young people fail; too many youngsters end up in the criminal justice system; too many people have utterly miserable lives. Simply put, that is because we as a community are not prepared to invest sufficiently or sensibly enough to conquer the housing problems that so many in our society now face.</p>

	<p pid="c.177.4/1">On a number of occasions. As I was saying, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1659" name="Ann Cryer">the hon. Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer)</phrase> would be the character of Cleopatra, who has come here to romance Mark Antony, the Minister, for housing favours, and I hope she gets what she is looking for. May I also congratulate her on having secured this debate? It is an important debate, and she has highlighted, with her local example, an issue that affects many people across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/2">I think we would all agree that politicians have a moral obligation to ensure that, in this first-world country, we have first-world housing for its citizens. I think that we would also probably all agree about the outcomes that we would like to see in terms of the quality of housing, so I will not dwell on that issue. However, I would suggest that, to achieve those outcomes, there are three criteria that we need to fulfil, and the Minister and the Government will hear me develop these three themes in the months ahead. The three criteria to achieve a high standard of housing are a sustainable environmental approach towards housing, a sustainable economic approach to the housing market and a sustainable social approach to communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/3">All three of those criteria are intimately connected with the standard of housing that we create. In an environmental context, it seems obvious to me that all new housing should be zero carbon. However, given that in 2050 most people will be living in housing that has already been built now, we must find a way to raise the standard of environmental performance of existing housing stock. Having said that, as we are primarily talking about the social elements of housing today, it would be inappropriate for me to pursue that idea in great detail.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/4">The second criterion, a sustainable economic approach to the housing market, is very relevant; we have already heard from other speakers about how important it is to ensure that the housing market is affordable, both in terms of the cost of buying housing and the cost of renting, which is perhaps even more salient today. We have heard a horror story from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>, describing a situation where there is a very low standard of housing at a very high price, which is the worst of both worlds. All of us need to think about how we can effectively ensure that housing is affordable for those at the lower end of the income scale.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/5">Thirdly, it is also obvious to me that the quality of a community is closely connected to the quality of housing and how that housing is structured. We have already heard from the hon. Member for Keighley and particularly from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> about how vital it is that we do not ghettoise people on low incomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/6">The Minister for Housing is claimed to have said, &quot;If you want a council house, find a job&quot;&mdash;that is the headline in <i>The Guardian</i> today. I do not think that that is what she ought to be saying, in terms of the messages that she is sending out to those who are depending on and looking for social housing. Having said that, I would like to issue a health warning: I know from my own experience that it is very easy for the media to misrepresent what politicians and Ministers say. She is also probably the only person in Parliament who has held her housing portfolio for a shorter time than I have, so it is possible that she was not necessarily thinking about the nuances that could be represented, or even misrepresented, by the media. So I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt here, and I would like to hear from her directly, at first hand, what she really thinks, rather than depend on what is often now, sadly, an unbelievably unreliable written press to be judge and jury of what she has said.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/7">Nevertheless, I think that we would all agree that, if people are excluded from the social housing sector, the only option for them is to go into the private rented sector, where rents are almost always higher. Housing benefit does not always cover that additional amount, which puts a further pressure on households that already have a relatively low income. That pressure can lead to default and eviction, and those households will therefore contribute to the homelessness figures, so it is very important to recognise the vicious spiral that can occur if we depend on the private rented sector to make up the difference between what households require and what is available in the regulated social housing sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/8">As the Minister here today knows, I am disappointed that the Housing and Regeneration Bill, which we will return to on Report, will not regulate the private rented sector in the same way that it will regulate the registered social housing sector. The Minister might want to say something about that today. What is obvious is that, if the private rented sector is going to end up as the collecting point for all those vulnerable households that do not have jobs and so forth, the landlords in that sector will be disinclined to play ball. They will say, &quot;Well, we don't want to have these vulnerable tenants, because they could default,&quot; so the vicious spiral gets ever worse.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/9">If the Minister wants to comment on what his colleague, the Minister for Housing, said about council houses, I will understand. Otherwise, I hope that the Minister for Housing will clarify to the House where she stands on this issue. I am perfectly willing to accept that the fault was presentational rather than intentional.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/10">I would like to turn now to what the other speakers in the debate have said. The hon. Member for Keighley highlighted something that I have seen myself, namely that the quality of a community housing trust is very often dependent on the individuals running that trust. I do not know the particular circumstances that she mentioned, but I have seen good trusts perform effectively simply because the individuals within the management structure do a good job. As a result, the standard of housing remains high, repairs are done quickly, and the tenants have a very high regard for those bodies. At the same time, once in a while I have seen managers who are not so effective. As a result, the corporate culture of the association declines and that directly impacts on the standard of housing for the tenants.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/11">I wonder whether the Minister has any views about how we can ensure that the variability of the quality of management is in some ways dampened, in terms of its consequences for the tenants. It could be that the Minister feels that the Housing and Regeneration Bill will be the right mechanism to achieve that. I suspect that we cannot completely eliminate that variability, but if he has a view on that issue I would be very pleased to hear it.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/12">The hon. Member for Great Grimsby made some very important observations. I have given my view on what the Minister for Housing said. I would simply add, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, that we have a responsibility as legislators and politicians to ensure that individuals and households who need the support of the Government to obtain adequate accommodation, both for the adults and for the children who are being raised, receive that support.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/13">Those words are easy to say, but it is much harder to take action. Does the Minister really think that we will achieve the goals set by the Government by 2010? That is only 22 months away, or if we give him the whole of 2010, 34 months away, which is still not very long. The Government's ambitious target will be expensive to achieve. If he reassures us that he believes that that target is still attainable, I would ask him to outline briefly the Government's strategy to make that colossal investment in less than three years. I want to see the target met, but I think that perhaps not enough has happened so far, since it was set, to ensure that it is achieved.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/14">The hon. Member for Islington, North highlighted one of the most serious and worrying statistics in this debate: the 87,000 households in temporary accommodation. That is not really a quality of life that we should tolerate in a country with the wealth that the United Kingdom has. What can we do to ensure that that figure is halved? It was half that figure previously, when I would have said that there was less wealth in the UK than there is now.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/15">Looking ahead, what are the next steps? As I said, we should return to the issue of economically sustainable housing. We should retrospectively consider implementing certain standards to the housing stock if we are to make the United Kingdom a zero-carbon economy in the not-too-distant future. We must also recognise that the only real way to have sustainable housing and a sustainable housing market is to increase the availability of housing stock.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/16">There are some creative solutions around, not all of which we need to discuss today. However, the Minister may not be aware that there are about 1 million potential properties over shops and other retail outlets, which, for administrative reasons, it is hard to convert into housing. Would he like to hear more about that from me and from institutions that have been looking at the issue? Those 1 million properties would make a big difference to easing the back pressure on purchased and rented accommodation, as long as their standard could be secured.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/17">On sustainable communities, we can also do a great deal to ensure that we design good community life into good housing. We all have noble intentions on this issue, and although the cost of doing something is high, the cost of doing nothing is even higher. Somebody made the insightful point to me that there is only one letter's difference between homelessness and hopelessness, and that is very true. People who drop out of society often feel that it has not offered them much, and those who end up living rough or living on the good will of their friends will eventually begin to display a degree of social disconnection.</p>
	<p pid="c.177.4/18">If the Minister says that we can solve all these problems by the end of 2010, I shall be delighted to hear it. If he does intend to pursue these issues, how will he do so and what can we do collectively&mdash;on a cross-party basis&mdash;to ensure that housing is treated not as a political football but as a social responsibility that we must all take on in a sombre and serious way?</p>

	<p pid="c.180.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1659" name="Ann Cryer">the hon. Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer)</phrase> on securing a debate on this important subject, which will concern hon. Members of all parties. As Members of Parliament representing our constituents, we should have good access to those who run the social and affordable housing in our areas. If we are to act on behalf of constituents, we need lobbying and information, and such things should not be withheld from us.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.0/2">The hon. Lady eloquently highlighted the situation in her area, where the local ALMO&mdash;I assume it was the ALMO&mdash;failed to provide adequate information and responses. It is deeply regrettable and sad that that body feels that it is outside the right and proper democratic process and that it is beyond the requirement to respond. It is difficult to envisage that in the case of a local council, which will feel more politically responsible.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.0/3">I hope that the Minister can provide some reassurance and that he might even be able to act on the issue by sending a letter to all the organisations involved in providing housing, including ALMOs and RSLs. I hope that he will remind them that they are still part of the process of providing social housing, which means that they are responsible to Parliament and to their Members of Parliament in a way that cannot be ignored. That is quite proper, and it is only right for the hon. Lady to expect an adequate response when she has had cause to write to the ALMO in question.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.0/4">My assertion is not that ALMOs are bad; indeed, there are excellent ALMOs out there, just as there are excellent RSLs and good councils managing stock. Whoever is in charge of social and affordable housing in the public sector, however, has a responsibility to answer hon. Members. As I say, I hope that the Minister can say something about that and provide some reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.0/5">In my borough, we have about 11,000 council houses, and the residents have thus far resisted the opportunity to move to an ALMO, because they feel that the local council does a good job of managing the estate properties. That goes to show that good social housing can take many different forms, and that someone who attempts to be prescriptive by saying that all housing should be supplied in one particular way will almost certainly have arrived at the wrong interpretation of the problem and the wrong solution.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.0/6">The hon. Lady has done a great service in raising this issue, because it raises fundamental questions about the quality of our housing stock. The Minister and I have spent the past month in Committee together, and I have mentioned several times in passing that the decent homes standard&mdash;laudable though its objectives are&mdash;has not achieved the desired results and will, by the Government's own admission, miss their targets. I would be interested to hear what he has to say about that.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.0/7">The Minister may or may not know that I recently asked him a parliamentary question about the issue. I was told that there were 8.7 million non-decent homes in 1997, although the hon. Lady will be interested to hear that that figure had declined to 6 million by 2005. Over those five years, therefore, there was a 14.5 per cent. reduction in the number of non-decent homes. Clearly, therefore, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit Öpik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> said, the Government's programme is very unlikely to be concluded by the 2010 deadline, given that we would need a dramatic 27 per cent. drop in the number of homes outside the decent homes standard in just a couple of years. Indeed, the Government have already admitted that they will miss their targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.0/8">I suspect that the reasons for that are manifold. The targets in many of our constituencies may have been found to be too specific and too centrally driven, with the Government seeking to create houses that may or may not provide a good standard of living for the people in them. In my area, the council has been encouraged to improve aspects of housing that, on any objective measure, do not require improvement. If the local housing provider had had a bit more flexibility to decide what was included in other areas, that might have resulted in a more sensible approach to this agenda.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.0/9">Although I recognise that the number of houses of non-decent standard has fallen, the real tragedy of the past 10 years, which was alluded to by the hon. Members for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), who is just leaving, and for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), is that the number of houses available in the social area&mdash;I was going to call it the market&mdash;has been lower in every one of the past 10 years than it was in 18 years under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Those on the socially conscious left of the Labour party must be wondering how on earth that could have happened.</p>

	<p pid="c.181.0/1">Those of us who were in the House during the years of the Thatcher premiership and who represented areas such as mine were in despair about housing. The right to buy was destroying our estates, and we are now paying the price for that, because many houses have left the public sector. The refusal to allow local authorities to invest sufficiently in repairs also meant that there was a massive &pound;1 billion backlog of repairs by 1997, which the current Government had to pick up. I do regret the lack of social housing being built, but I have no good memories whatever of the Tory years.</p>

	<p pid="c.182.2/1">Yes, it may be crook. However, the Government have produced not only less social housing every year, but less housing overall. The average during our time in office was 176,000 houses a year, but the average over the past 10 years has been 145,000. Both the social housing stock and the overall housing provision have declined.</p>
	<p pid="c.182.2/2">The hon. Member for Islington, North and I could argue about the rights and wrongs of right to buy, but it was before my time in the House, and for his information I am prepared to accept that there are better ways of doing it&mdash;for example, by allowing the money to be invested in new council housing. I would like councils to build new houses. On this matter, the left and right might have formed an&mdash;I was going to say unholy alliance, but perhaps it is a holy alliance. I do not see why councils could not start building houses again&mdash;either through right to buy, or by keeping receipts or allowing councils and RSLs to build houses that benefit the population.</p>

	<p pid="c.182.3/1">I shall resist entering into a theological debate about the benefits of buying and the moral obligation to buy that some people feel. However, the hon. Gentleman will recognise that other countries, such as Germany, resolve the problem by making it perfectly normal for wealthy households to rent accommodation. That is one way in which we could overcome the ghettoisation of those in rented accommodation and diminish the price pressures that we are seeing in this country.</p>

	<p pid="c.182.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is correct and his desires might be coming true, because home ownership is falling for the first time since the 1980s, although inadvertently, I suspect, as far as the Government are concerned.</p>
	<p pid="c.182.4/2">I shall turn to the announcement by the Minister for Housing this morning. I agree with the hon. Members for Great Grimsby, for Islington, North and for Montgomeryshire that it was misplaced, that it misfired and that it does nothing to help to understand the fundamentals at the heart of social housing. In fact, I think that it is a mistaken policy announcement along the same lines as dragging youths to cash points or saying that we should have British jobs for British workers. It was a meaningless announcement. Let us think it through: not only are there the implications described by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire&mdash;if we kick a family out of social housing they will have to enter rented accommodation, which in many cases might be impossible&mdash;but, worse still, where children are involved, the council has a statutory duty to house those kicked out and, therefore, will end up picking up the tab for kicking them out. It is pure headline-grabbing nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="c.182.4/3">A growing number of people in social housing are unemployed. The response to that should be a much more systematic appraisal of the problem, and solutions more in line with the welfare to work proposals that we described the other week. The solution is certainly not for the Government to claim that they have a silver bullet involving kicking people out of their homes, because obviously the Government will simply have to rehouse those with families. Could the Minister not have advised his new boss quietly and on the side before she made such an ill-thought-out announcement? Could he not have suggested that she think about reality and how the announcement might work in practice before making a proposal that will not stand the test of time&mdash;by which I mean about 15 minutes after being written up in the newspapers? It is quite clear from a couple of hours' thought that it cannot resolve the many deep and serious housing problems in this country. I am rather saddened that her first major speech as Minister for Housing has fired off in the most ludicrous headline-grabbing manner. I would have expected more from her.</p>
	<p pid="c.182.4/4">In conclusion, I congratulate the hon. Member for Keighley on securing this debate. Her concerns are real and genuine, and I would be surprised if there were any hon. Members who do not share them. I call on the Minister to act, perhaps by writing to all RSLs and other providers of social housing, be they ALMOs or councils, to remind them of their responsibility to respond to those democratically elected to represent constituents and their housing needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.183.0/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Amess, and to serve under your chairmanship. This has been a good debate on a matter of enormous importance, not only to Bradford, Grimsby and Islington, but across the country. The idea of housing standards and of ensuring that everybody has a choice of housing of an excellent standard is fundamental. Every Government should deal with that.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1659" name="Ann Cryer">the Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer)</phrase>, who in her usual manner highlighted her concerns about housing standards in her constituency with the utmost eloquence, wit and style&mdash;if only every hon. Member were as committed as she is. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friends the Members for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), who also do a fantastic job. Sometimes I disagree with them on housing, but their commitment to it and to raising housing standards is important.</p>
	<p pid="c.183.0/3">I also welcome back to the reunion&mdash;not as good as Led Zeppelin's I would suggest, but it is not far off&mdash;the hon. Members for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps) and for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik). As has been said, we have spent the last month on the Housing and Regeneration Bill Committee, which I thought was very good. It was challenging and scrutinised the Bill to ensure that housing policy is fit for the 21st century.</p>

The first is about decent homes&mdash;where we have come from, what we have achieved in the past decade and where we are going in order to hit the 2010 target. The second theme that I shall address at some length deals with serious points about engagement with tenants and the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley about standards as well as broader governance issues in Bradford. She made an important point about a particular estate, to which I shall respond later. The third theme is about the future. We spent the past month on the Housing and Regeneration Bill and, in particular, the last couple of sittings, talking about Oftenant and the establishment of a new social housing regulator, the fundamental objective of which is to raise standards for all social housing tenants and to ensure that they have decent homes. I shall talk more about those objectives, as I did in Committee on clause 86.</p>

	<p pid="c.184.5/1">I am not dancing on a pin. Our intention is clear. We want tenants of local authority homes brought under Oftenant, but there are practical difficulties, rather than ideological concerns. Those are being looked at now and we anticipate that it will take about two years before they are resolved. We need to consider how to align the regulator's work with the comprehensive area assessments. We also need to consider funding. All those difficulties need to be encountered before we move to a single domain regulator. However, we definitely aim to achieve that policy objective within two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.184.5/2">On the subject of decent homes, we have a massive social asset in social housing. There are about 4 million social homes, they are valued together at about &pound;400 billion, and they are an important national, collective asset. Everybody recognises that in the years before 1997, there was disgraceful neglect and chronic under-investment. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North was in the House when it happened, and he has been most eloquent on the subject. I should happily take an intervention from the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield, who speaks for the Conservatives, if he would like to apologise for the chronic under-investment that took place under the Thatcher and Major Administrations.</p>

	<p pid="c.184.6/1">I am most grateful to the Minister, because my intervention may give him an opportunity to explain, as he did to the Public Bill Committee, how right to buy gave him and his family the opportunity to move through the different types of housing that were available. I think that the Committee <i>Hansard</i> shows that he thanked Margaret Thatcher for the opportunity that right to buy gave his family.</p>

	<p pid="c.185.0/1">The hon. Gentleman taunts me. I do not want to rehash the arguments from the Housing and Regeneration Bill, but he knows that I said that one reason why I am in the Labour party is because Mrs. Thatcher absolutely decimated Hartlepool and the north-east. It was a disgraceful chapter in my town's history, which I do not want to go anywhere near again, so I certainly did not thank Mrs. Thatcher.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.0/2">There was chronic under-investment before 1997, and that has been a task for this Government. Indeed, I do not think that the Government receive the recognition that they should for their investment to achieve decent homes. Prior to 1997, we estimated that &pound;19 billion of repairs and maintenance was needed to bring homes up to a decent standard, so we set a target that by 2010, all social homes would meet minimum standards of decency, and that 70 per cent. of vulnerable households in the private sector would have decent homes. It must be said&mdash;I have seen it in my own patch and elsewhere&mdash;that the target, with its specific deadline, has galvanised massive improvement in the social housing stock, and it has been done in innovative and transformational ways.</p>
	<p pid="c.185.0/3">Let me recount to the Chamber a little tale. I used to work in Newcastle, a city with which the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire has a long association. I worked in the centre but travelled out to Walkergate, which is a good, traditional north-east community. When I was there in the mid-1990s, it had&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;not been invested in for quite some time. We have discussed registered social landlords, large-scale voluntary transfers and arm's length management organisations such as Your Homes Newcastle, and I travelled up there last summer to have a look around and see what has been done on investment. I must say that, on the improvements to tenants' homes, Your Homes Newcastle has been absolutely fantastic, revolutionising the way in which tenants live, with decent homes, new kitchens, energy efficiency and central heating systems. We should shout from the rooftops&mdash;the decent rooftops that we have put in place&mdash;what we have done.</p>

	<p pid="c.185.1/1">Obviously, the Liberal Democrat administration up there is partly responsible for that.

	<p pid="c.185.2/1">Funding is important, too, and the Government have unlocked a load of funding to ensure that we have decent homes. Since 1997, we have also increased the funding available to councils to help to deal with the issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby sometimes says that, on council investment, we have turned off the taps, but I say to him gently that that is simply not true. This year, council spending per home is about &pound;1,100, compared with about &pound;800 in 1997, so there has been a 30 per cent. increase in real terms. On top of that, we have also made &pound;3.7 billion available for ALMOs, such as Your Homes Newcastle, to deliver improvements to council housing stock, and we will have made available &pound;2.7 billion in private finance initiative credits for PFI schemes by March this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.186.0/1">I would like a definite response to my questions. The trust has told us that &pound;45,000 needs to be spent on each house on that estate, but it says that it will not do so because it is not worth spending, so it needs to build new houses to replace them. At the same time, however, the Housing Corporation says that it is not worth spending money on the estate to build new houses. What will happen to the tenants in the meantime and for the foreseeable future? Will they continue to live in that substandard housing? What will be done for them?</p>

	<p pid="c.186.1/1">My hon. Friend passionately argues her case for her constituents, but if she will forgive me, I shall mention just a couple more statistics and then come on to that precise point.</p>
	<p pid="c.186.1/2">More than &pound;20 billion of public money has been put into improving social housing standards since 1997, and as a result of levering in private sector money, a total of &pound;40 billion will have been invested by the end of 2010. On our achievements, since 2001, we have put in 518,000 new kitchens, 440,000 new bathrooms and 910,000 new central heating systems, which, with reference to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North, helps precisely with energy efficiency. That issue is important. I woke up to hear my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy on the &quot;Today&quot; programme this morning talking about energy prices. At a time of increasing energy prices, it is vital that we address the issue by ensuring that people stay warm and that there is environmental friendliness.</p>

	<p pid="c.186.2/1">I understand that point, and I welcome the Government's suggestion for better energy efficiency. Will the Minister go further, however, and specifically encourage&mdash;indeed, require&mdash;new developments to include self-generation through photovoltaic cells or heating cells, so that there is lower use of grid electricity in such homes?</p>

	<p pid="c.186.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. He knows about the target&mdash;the most ambitious target anywhere in the developed world&mdash;for all homes built from 2016 onwards to be zero-carbon homes, and we have a clear road map on how we reach it. There are provisions in the Housing and Regeneration Bill to ensure that the code for sustainable homes is made mandatory through an assessment, which, like the decent homes standard, will help to galvanise improvements in efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="c.186.3/2">I shall now pick up on the important points that my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley raised. She mentioned her concerns about the ballot, which I understand, but I shall make two points about it. Tenants voted 62.2 per cent. in favour of stock transfer, from a turnout of 65.5 per cent., which was higher than some local council elections, and higher than the turnout in the 2005 general election. I looked into her concern that if tenants did not vote, that was classed as a yes vote, and I have minutes from Bradford city council, which suggest that that is not true. The point was made clear on the ballot paper, and the minutes say:</p>
	<p pid="c.186.3/3" class="indent">&quot;It needs to be made clear that it is a majority of those that vote that will win the day&mdash;and that people who don't vote will not be taken into account.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.186.3/4">I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="c.186.3/5">My hon. Friend also mentioned the importance of governance and democratic accountability. In keeping with best practice from the Housing Corporation, when the council's stock was transferred through the LSVT system to Bradford Community Housing Trust, there was the traditional one-third representation: one-third tenants, one-third councillors, and one-third independent members. I understand that the RSL is restructuring its board and governance procedures, but that activity will put greater emphasis on tenants, who will hold a majority on the board. That will be important in raising housing standards in the organisation, so again, I hope that my hon. Friend takes some reassurance from that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.186.3/6">My hon. Friend mentioned important points about the Woodhouse estate, and I would very much like to come up to see it, if she will invite me. I have similar issues in my area, and I understand her concerns. The Woodhouse estate has been examined closely, and it is not considered cost-effective to repair some houses. She rightly said that Bradford Community Housing Trust carried out an options appraisal, and its preferred approach is to decant, demolish and rebuild. I understand, and I shall ensure, that the trust has met local residents to discuss that preferred option, but meetings have been poorly attended.</p>

	<p pid="c.188.1/1">I have been lucky in recent weeks with Mr. Speaker's roulette wheel&mdash;this is the second major debate that I have secured since the new year. It is topical, and the matter has been discussed in the House. Debate on the Energy Bill has been concerned primarily with the mix of suppliers and particularly the role of nuclear energy, but it has touched on fuel poverty. There was a debate here in Westminster Hall on fuel poverty on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-08">8 January</phrase>, secured by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase>. Many of the right points were made, and since then the fuel poverty advisory group has delivered its report and there have been important discussions about the matter. I hope to add value by advancing some of the arguments made.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.1/2">I wish to raise three matters. The first, and biggest, is whether energy prices are overwhelmingly driven by increased costs or whether there is an element of a breakdown in competition, unfair competition or monopoly profit. That is an important point that we have not properly pursued, although the Chancellor intervened with Ofgem. The debate presents an opportunity to pursue it in detail. I notice that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> is here. He will probably speak for himself, but he has tabled a motion in the past few days recommending a move towards the Competition Commission. I shall argue that he is right that that needs to happen, and I shall make the argument for that step by step.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.1/3">The second matter that I wish to touch on is whether the Government could do something about costs and prices directly or indirectly through the European Union. I shall briefly mention gas storage, liquefied natural gas terminals and access to the European Union market. Thirdly, and finally, I shall return to something that has been discussed here often&mdash;fuel poverty and the role of the social tariff.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.1/4">The context of the debate is substantial increases in domestic energy prices&mdash;I shall be talking about domestic energy, not transport. Four of the big six producers have increased their prices in January, and E.ON is thought to be following fairly soon. There has been a 17 per cent. increase in the price of gas and a 12 per cent. increase in the price of electricity. In a five-year period, there has been an 85 per cent. increase in the price of gas and a 63 per cent. increase in the price of electricity. Combined bills have gone up by 76 per cent. over that five-year period, and in the past few days we have crossed the psychological threshold of an average household energy bill being more than &pound;1,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.1/5">Associated with that are various symptoms of hardship. There were an estimated 420,000 additional cases of fuel poverty in January alone, based on the conventional definition of spending more than 10 per cent. of income on fuel. Worryingly, there has also been a rise in disconnections. Many of us thought that that problem had been solved by Government intervention some years ago, but disconnections have almost doubled in the past two years as a result of stress on prices.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.1/6">The conventional explanation for the rise in prices is that it is linked to cost. That is clearly a major factor&mdash;it would be unreasonable to suggest otherwise. There have been big increases in international prices of oil, gas and coal. Gas is particularly important in the UK electricity sector, and prices are determined in a peculiar way at the end of the interconnector, linked with oil prices in Europe after a time lag of three to six months. External factors such as rising world prices are clearly a major influence. As the Minister has recently reminded us, there are additional factors such as the fact that we are opting for strong environmental policies, which impose on producers costs that are inevitably passed on. We must understand that. As he has pointed out, the annual cost of the renewable energy obligation is about &pound;1 billion a year, and in addition there are the costs of energy efficiency undertakings. That all adds to costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.1/7">The big question I want to pose is whether that is a satisfactory explanation. Is that all there is, or is there more to it? Some 80 per cent. of the public believe that they are being ripped off by the energy companies, according to a YouGov survey in the past few weeks. Is that right, and a fair assessment? Clearly the Chancellor of the Exchequer is worried that there is something else involved, otherwise he would not have approached Ofgem. I want to go through the argument about whether there has been a failure of competition policy that needs action.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.1/8">The first point in the argument is that there is good research. A body called Cornwall Energy Associates carried out a meticulous, detailed study commissioned by Unison, the trade union, on the period 2003 to 2006. It tried to explain the increase in electricity and gas prices in that period and concluded that gas prices were pretty well determined by cost increases and were not a particular problem. On household budgets as a whole, it found that only 72 per cent. of the increase could be explained by cost increases and that there was a big unexplained differential.</p>
	<p pid="c.188.1/9">The study meticulously went through all the contributory factors and concluded that the only plausible explanation was an increase in margins by the integrated energy companies that supply electricity. The study did not take a dogmatic, ideological view about that and stated that it was partly understandable, because profit margins had been very low in 2003 and it was understandable to try to rebuild them. However, the key conclusion was that as a result of their dominance in the market, the energy producers were able to push up their prices faster than their costs. There did not seem to be any other obvious explanation.</p>

	<p pid="c.189.0/1">The hon. Gentleman will know that so far, Ofgem has rebutted and brushed away the concerns that people have raised. He is a distinguished economist of some standing. Does he agree that a market that is served by just six main suppliers is rather more likely to be oligopolistic than one served by the 20 suppliers that we had immediately just after so-called energy liberalisation?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05c.189.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="189"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0004.htm#08020535000505">
	<p pid="c.189.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right, and anticipates what I am going on to say. There has been a fundamental change in the market in the 20 years since privatisation. Initially there were two electricity generators, one integrated gas producer and a lot of regional monopolies. We then had a proliferation of competitors, but the industry has since consolidated and in the past 10 years has moved from 20 competitors to six vertically integrated companies.</p>
	<p pid="c.189.1/2">The question is whether that matters and why. It matters because it has a major impact on new companies trying to enter the industry. I have had correspondence from a company called BizzEnergy, which is a specialist producer trying to sell wholesale energy supplies to small-scale business. In its letter to me and the attached note&mdash;the Minister probably has it, because the company has campaigned actively&mdash;it states:</p>
	<p pid="c.189.1/3" class="indent">&quot;One of the biggest concerns facing companies like BizzEnergy is that with the 'Big 6' having their own power stations, with direct access to energy sources...this leads to market inconsistencies and aids the anti-competitive structure of the market...The liquidity of the wholesale market is currently very poor and sporadic due, in part, to this level of vertical integration.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.189.1/4">It concludes:</p>
	<p pid="c.189.1/5" class="indent">&quot;This has a direct impact on independent energy suppliers such as BizzEnergy and its potential new customers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.189.1/6">BizzEnergy is not the only company that is making that point. British Energy, which is the big nuclear energy company, has made a similar point about the dominating influence of the six integrated companies and their distorting effect. I do not wish to open the argument about nuclear power, but that is clearly testimony to the working of the market.</p>

	<p pid="c.190.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate. Does he agree that it is a remarkable coincidence that the six major companies have managed to increase their costs relatively similarly? The increases have all been about eight, nine or 10 times the rate of inflation. At a time when we are capping public sector worker pay, should we not consider capping those increases?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05c.190.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="190"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0004.htm#08020535000507">
	<p pid="c.190.1/1">I agree with the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's intervention, although it is not strictly true: it is interesting that one of the six, Scottish and Southern, has not yet increased its prices. It argues that profits have accrued in the industry through the issue of emissions trading licences, and it is using them to hold down its prices. However, the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's question is right.</p>
	<p pid="c.190.1/2">The next element in the argument is that the industry, supported by Ofgem, argues that we do not need to worry about any of that or those six producers, because consumers switch suppliers, which eats away at any profit margins that arise. They argue that 50 per cent. of households have switched suppliers and that households can make mark-ups of up to &pound;100. They say, &quot;It is a good market, so why should we worry about it?&quot; However, when we probe a little further, it is clear that the supposedly competitive retail market does not work as it is supposed to. Half of households have never switched&mdash;mine is one of them&mdash;perhaps because of conservatism or age. For the 6 million households with pre-payment meters, it is often, indeed invariably, impossible to switch because they are locked into a debt repayment arrangement with their supplier, so they cannot exercise that choice.</p>
	<p pid="c.190.1/3">The most damaging evidence on this issue came out of recent research by the university of East Anglia, which found that a third of people who had switched ended up worse off than they were before. They had made the wrong choice. It is easy to understand why. Many people change as a result of a calculated, thoughtful exercise, but many change under pressure. I have had endless correspondence with Scottish and Southern about old ladies in my constituency being browbeaten into changing their contracts and making bad choices. For all those reasons, one has to be sceptical of the Ofgem argument that there is a functioning market. It functions in part, but it does not function brilliantly.</p>
	<p pid="c.190.1/4">The final part of the argument is the industry's claims that, because of the competition, British producers supply cheap power and gas. That is certainly true of British gas, which has historically been relatively cheap. The tables coming from the Minister's Department suggest that British electricity prices are roughly in the middle of the European range, but that is misleading, because those prices are after tax, and the British VAT rate is one of the lowest in Europe; it is 20 per cent. in many countries. Using the pre-tax cost, Britain has the fifth-highest electricity prices in the Union, so something is not working.</p>

	<p pid="c.191.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. Does he agree that one problem with the current energy market is that Britain has so little influence over it? We depend increasingly on foreign-owned companies that clearly have interests other than serving the British people to whom they supply energy.</p>

	<p pid="c.191.1/1">I am not sure that I agree. There is a problem with energy suppliers&mdash;I shall come to my conclusion on that point in a moment, which is similar to that of the hon. Member for Selby. However, I do not think there is an economic, nationalist argument. I am not sure that having Union flags flying in the board rooms of energy companies would necessarily alter their prices. It is not a question of the nationality of owners, but there is a problem. That has been recognised by many in the competition business.</p>
	<p pid="c.191.1/2">Stephen Davies, a leading adviser to the Office of Fair Trading, has described the Ofgem approach as misguided and misinformed, and argues that there is a serious problem. Surprisingly, the issue has been taken up by the Competition Commission. The problems are complex. We are not talking about price fixing and crude cartels, but there is a competition issue. The head of the commission has argued that the purpose of its market investigations is</p>
	<p pid="c.191.1/3" class="indent">&quot;to enable the competition authorities to take an in-depth look at markets where competition is thought to be not working well, but where the problem does not at first sight appear to emanate from the dominant position of a single firm or the existence of hard core cartels.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.191.1/4">That describes the energy sector pretty well. He then makes a slightly odd remark:</p>
	<p pid="c.191.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Despite the CC's powerful armoury of regulatory and competition enforcement powers, its involvement in regulated sectors...has been minimal. Whatever the justification...the fact is that regulators are not making references to the CC for market investigations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.191.1/6">I want to know why the commission is not being involved. It clearly has the competence and powers, and is willing to look into the issue. It feels that Ofgem is not making a reference that it should make, and many questions need to be answered, so why not have an investigation?</p>
	<p pid="c.191.1/7">One aspect of Ofgem's conclusions is right: it accepts that there is monopoly profit in the market. That arises from the gains that producers make from being gifted trading certificates under the European emissions trading system. In response to the Chancellor's intervention a few days ago, Ofgem estimated that the energy industry will benefit from a windfall worth &pound;9 billion of trade permits under the scheme over a five-year period. Effectively, there is a gift to the industry of &pound;9 billion over five years because companies are being given the permits free of charge. That is a pure windfall and has nothing to do with efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="c.191.1/8">A series of questions emerge from that situation. First, what are the Government doing about it? Does the Minister intend to implement Ofgem's recommendation that the windfall should be channelled&mdash;it did not suggest a mechanism&mdash;to those who are hardest hit by the energy price rises? Should companies try to ensure that it is passed on to all consumers? I know that he is trying to introduce an auction system; I think that 7 per cent. will be auctioned in the next few years, but why only 7 per cent.? Why not 17, 70 or 100 per cent.? It is a free gift to producers, after all. Why is it not being auctioned as one would expect in a market? I expect that he will say that if it were auctioned, companies might try to pass the cost on to consumers, thus pushing up costs even more, but that is why the problem has to be dealt with in conjunction with a reference to the Competition Commission. Different aspects need to be considered together.</p>

	<p pid="c.192.0/1">The Chancellor will be familiar with the concept of windfall gains because the Treasury will have received about &pound;500 million extra in VAT receipts in the past five years because of the increases in electricity and gas prices. Why cannot some of that be recycled into Warm Front, which is losing about 25 per cent. of current expenditure levels and Government support?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05c.192.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="192"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0005.htm#08020535000511">
	<p pid="c.192.1/1">That is a good point that I intend to discuss later. There are windfall taxes, although we do not call them that any more, such as the petroleum revenue tax. Other countries are doing that. Spain is trying to retrieve some of the windfall from the European trading certificates, although I do not know what mechanism it is using. It may be similar to that which the hon. Gentleman describes.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.1/2">My next set of questions is about what the Government could or should be doing regarding other aspects of energy costs, starting with gas storage. An odd feature of Britain is that we have low levels of gas storage in comparison with other EU countries. I think that the figure is still five days, as opposed to more than 50, but it might have changed. We have one major storage at the Rough field, going back to the 1980s. In a world in which prices are volatile and a lot of imports are increasingly required, storage becomes important to even out booms and busts in prices, so why is ours so low? Could anything be done about it? As someone who came out of the oil industry, it puzzles me that we have a mandated strategic reserve for oil&mdash;under an international agreement, companies have to provide a strategic reserve&mdash;but none for gas. Gas affects households and industry as opposed to just transport, so it is just as strategic as oil&mdash;why do we take a different approach to it? Is there anything stopping the Government having such a policy? Does it have to be done internationally? Could it be done domestically? What are the practicalities of it? Surely, if we are interested in having greater stability of gas prices, that is one way of achieving it.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.1/3">My second question relates specifically to diversity of supplies. A recent and, indeed, welcome development is that instead of being dependent on the end of the pipe from the interconnector, Britain now has alternative liquefied natural gas supplies coming in by boat. There have been delays&mdash;the Milford Haven problems are well known&mdash;but there is a question that I find difficult to answer. Perhaps the Minister knows the answer. Why is the existing Isle of Grain port so underutilised? Apparently, it is only about 50 per cent. utilised, yet if there were a big burst in domestic prices, one would expect, in a market, that liquid gas would come into the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.192.1/4">A possible explanation is that the Isle of Grain is a BP project and is therefore run in the wider interests of BP. There is nothing wrong with that, but the Government chose not to require third-party access, which would have brought in more competition, enabled more suppliers to make use of the port, and helped to stabilise the market. Why has that not happened, and is it possible to rectify the situation?</p>
	<p pid="c.192.1/5">Another question under this heading relates to the European Union. We know the well-rehearsed arguments about the malfunctioning of the European gas market in particular, and the link to oil prices, which is a linkage that should not occur, but the practical question is whether anything can be done about it. We all know about EU lack of liberalisation, but where are we on rectifying it? I understand that legislation has been promised by the end of next year that will, in effect, change the market for the better. Can the Minister update us on his assessment of the realism of that time horizon, and whether the legislation will make a difference?</p>

	<p pid="c.193.0/1">In essence, I agree with the vast majority of the hon. Gentleman's points, but I suggest that we need to look closely at the EU treaty that is before us at present, as it fails to usher in a truly competitive EU market. The term &quot;free competition&quot; was apparently removed from the draft treaty at the behest of the French, and we are seeing now, for example, the amalgamation of two giant energy companies, Gaz de France and Suez, to create one enormous one. Economic nationalism seems to be on the march on the continent. What does the hon. Gentleman have to say about a treaty that does not seem to be tackling this issue?</p>

	<p pid="c.193.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is anticipating not what I am about to say but what I shall say tomorrow in the debate in the main Chamber on competition policy and the protocol attached to the treaty. In passing, the simple answer is that the protocol will, in effect, make the Sarkozy amendments symbolic and not real. However, the hon. Gentleman has touched on a real problem, and I do not want to minimise it.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.1/2">My third question is about fuel poverty and the Government's response to it. The broad problem has often been debated here. We have the problem that a large number of people&mdash;currently 4 million, as opposed to 2 million in 2003&mdash;are classified as fuel poor on the standard definition of greater than 10 per cent. of income spent on domestic fuel. The problem has been caused by a combination of income, energy prices and housing conditions, and the estimate is that some 420,000 fell into fuel poverty in the past month. Last year, 24,000 excess deaths were attributed to fuel poverty, so it is a major social problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.1/3">It is fair to say that when this Government came to power, they initially made considerable strides to deal with the problem&mdash;the figure for fuel poor was 4.5 million in 1999&mdash;but we have had a recent reversal of fortune. I simply quote what the chairman of the Minister's own quango, the Fuel Poverty Advisory Group, said about the policy on fuel poverty. He gives a rather harsh judgment that it is &quot;incomprehensible, unjustifiable and shocking&quot;. That is what he told the press over the weekend in discussing the report that his organisation has just published.</p>
	<p pid="c.193.1/4">I want to focus on the practical ways in which the problem might be alleviated, in particular the debate around the social tariff.</p>

	<p pid="c.194.0/1">Before the hon. Gentleman comes on to solutions, does he accept that part of the problem that we face in respect of fuel price rises is that they are unevenly distributed? Indeed, they are often concentrated in the most disadvantaged communities. Only today, figures came out that show that in Wales electricity prices are, on average, 20 per cent. higher than in England, and of course Wales has some of the most disadvantaged communities in the United Kingdom.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05c.194.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="194"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0005.htm#08020535000515">
	<p pid="c.194.1/1">Indeed, the pattern of energy prices is regressive, both regionally and between social classes. What happens under the pricing system is that we have a negative social tariff, or, as somebody put it, reverse cross-subsidisation. In effect, the poor subsidise the rich through the pricing system. According to Energywatch, low-income households on prepaid meters pay 20 per cent. more, which amounts to some &pound;140 a year on average, and something closer to &pound;200 a year in the worst cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.194.1/2">Clearly, the energy companies have addressed the problem, at least in theory, with their own social tariffs. Of course, some companies do not do anything; I believe that npower is one. Some companies&mdash;for example, British Gas&mdash;do rather more, but then British Gas has the biggest price differential between prepaid meters and online ordering, so the tariff is only partial compensation.</p>
	<p pid="c.194.1/3">Can the Minister bring us up to date on the arguments on the social tariff? As he knows, a formidable coalition of charities&mdash;Help the Aged, Energywatch, the National Consumer Council, Unison, Save the Children, Barnardo's, the National Housing Federation and Age Concern&mdash;is arguing that a Government power to require the companies to introduce a minimum standard of social tariff needs to be written into the Energy Bill. It is not a very ambitious demand, but it appears that the Government are balking even at that, and that they do not want reserve powers to be written into the legislation. I hope that the Minister will explain his position on the issue and say whether he is willing to listen to the powerful representations that have been made. A minimum standard is not too much to ask for in this context.</p>
	<p pid="c.194.1/4">To conclude, this issue is relevant not just to the past few weeks. I fear that the sudden surge in energy prices may well intensify. In fact, the Minister himself has said that we have moved away from the world of cheap energy. I do not know whether that is true, but certainly in the short term oil prices will be very high, and they normally feed through into gas prices after three to six months. There may be further pressures for utility price increases. Many industrial users are seriously worried about the forward markets, and what will happen this summer.</p>
	<p pid="c.194.1/5">Many of the issues that I raised will continue to be relevant. I hope that through debate and discussion we can make some progress, particularly on a Competition Commission reference and on a more progressive policy on fuel poverty and the social tariff.</p>

	<p pid="c.195.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on introducing the debate and on his careful analysis of the problems that we are facing. I welcome what he had to say, not least because he anticipated some of the things that I wanted to say myself, and because he repeated some of the points that I made not just in the debate in this Chamber in January this year, but on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-23">23 January</phrase> last year, when I warned about some of the things that happened in the course of the year and the winter.</p>
	<p pid="c.195.0/2">The policies of the energy companies and the role of Ofgem, which we will want to consider and which were touched on by the hon. Gentleman, have not avoided what seems to be a crass undermining of the Government's policy on inflation. The fact is that millions of people in Britain, many thousands of them in my constituency, are finding that their quality of life has diminished. My hon. Friends who are present this morning have raised those matters again and again.</p>
	<p pid="c.195.0/3">We welcome the fact that today's <i>Daily Record</i> dealt in some detail with the issues that we are debating; we welcome that transparency. I am also pleased that the paper's leader, although its coverage was largely encouraged by Alistair Buchanan, who does a very good public relations job for Ofgem, made clear the position that we are in:</p>
	<p pid="c.195.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Fuel prices are too high, simple as that. Companies making multi-million profits have raised prices again and again over the last couple of years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.195.0/5">The leader went on to mention that Alistair Buchanan</p>
	<p pid="c.195.0/6" class="indent">&quot;says there is a 'bonanza' out there.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.195.0/7">To be fair to Mr. Buchanan, he was promoting the idea, which I want to deal with shortly, and which the hon. Member for Twickenham addressed, that switching is the answer for many people. If there is a bonanza out there, it seems to me that it is not for the most vulnerable people, who have to pay the additional prices, or for those who have been the subject of so many studies, including the one by Save the Children, to which I shall return if I have time. More and more of the poorest people must deal with problems caused by price increases. If there is a bonanza, I can see evidence only of the one that the energy companies are enjoying to the hilt.</p>

	<p pid="c.196.0/1">My right hon. Friend has raised an important point. Does he agree that the Government are adopting a contrary position when they cap the pay of public sector workers in the fight against inflation&mdash;saving merely &pound;30 million in the case of the police&mdash;while at the same time they allow companies to rip off the people of Britain?</p>

	<p pid="c.196.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point, which has been raised again and again by my constituents&mdash;and, no doubt, his.</p>
	<p pid="c.196.1/2">The <i>Daily Record</i> leader concluded by referring to people power. In fairness, it was encouraging people to switch where that would be appropriate. However, it said:</p>
	<p pid="c.196.1/3" class="indent">&quot;What's more, people power is the only way to keep prices down.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.196.1/4">I welcome what the <i>Record</i> is doing, but, as to people power, Members of this House have tried again and again to exercise exactly that. One of my reasons for calling for a debate last January was that my Lanarkshire colleagues got together and, trying to speak for 500,000 potential consumers, we wrote to all the energy companies and said, &quot;If you can reach agreement with companies on a discount, we offer you the prospect, as Members of Parliament, with nothing to gain, of a forum to enable the big companies to speak to the people. There would be competition in action and our constituents would have the opportunity to choose the company best suiting their needs.&quot; What we got from many of the companies was absolute abuse. There was no suggestion that our constituents could enjoy the same access as companies. I spoke to a gentleman from a big company yesterday who told me that it had an agreement under which it paid for bulk purchase five years in advance. I do not know of any of my constituents who are being urged to switch who would get that benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.196.1/5">I want now to discuss switching, and what it means in reality. I use the word &quot;reality&quot; because I am a realist. The hon. Member for Twickenham accepted, and I agree, that of course wholesale prices have risen and that oil and energy reforms cost more. Inevitably that has an impact on the prices that must be considered. My question is why the consumer should bear most of the burden. I think that that is the question asked by most of us. In a truly competitive market, if only two, not one&mdash;we heard from the hon. Member for Twickenham that one of the energy companies has acted pretty well in this context&mdash;offered their consumers reasonable prices, they would undercut the rest, and bring about an exercise in real competition and choice.</p>
	<p pid="c.196.1/6">Yesterday we received information about the publication of a poll by Save the Children. Its findings were very disturbing. It showed that nearly one in five families with kids cannot afford to heat their homes. It also showed that 19 per cent. of families could not keep their homes warm because of the cost. It indicated that 15 per cent. of households cut back on food, and the same number on clothes. If we are to be led to believe that the answer to all that is switching&mdash;I do not want to discourage anyone who is free to do it from doing just that&mdash;my response is that there are very few facts to support that view. For example, npower announced an increase this January. Even if people wanted to switch that would take six to eight weeks, by which time it will be almost spring, and those people will have had no help with the severe winter conditions that many parts of the United Kingdom have had.</p>

	<p pid="c.197.0/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that switching is more likely to be attractive to the young than the old, and to those with internet access, because that is where most switching information is? Indeed, Ofgem's figures show that two thirds of pensioners have never switched. For the people who most need help, switching is not the solution. Given the negative experiences that pensioners often have when they switch, as pointed out by the hon. Member for Twickenham, it is hardly surprising that so many of them are reluctant to go down that route.</p>

	<p pid="c.197.1/1">I repeat that I do not want to discourage those who are free to switch from doing so. None of us would. But the hon. Gentleman has a point. The suggestion, in the midst of all the problems that people are dealing with, that switching is the whole answer, and Ofgem's devotion of so many resources to that answer alone, is not something I find convincing. Many people have switched more than once, only to find that prices have gone up again. All the evidence is that no sooner do people move, but the energy company they have joined raises its prices, too. The hon. Member for Twickenham mentioned evidence from the university of East Anglia showing that about a third&mdash;1.3 million people&mdash;switched to a tariff that was worse than their previous one.</p>

	<p pid="c.197.4/1">The right hon. Gentleman is making valuable points about switching. I thought at one time that I was the only person who had not switched, until I heard that my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham had not either. It is difficult to compare different companies on the internet, because they use different tariffs, and people do not know whether the tariff that they are on is equivalent to the one being offered by another company.</p>

	<p pid="c.197.5/1">The hon. Gentleman makes another solid point. It is very difficult to switch. The plain simple fact is that many people are prevented from switching by debt, prepayment meters that make switching harder, or outdated radio meters that simply will not allow it. Ofgem should have a second look at the view that switching alone should be the highest priority.</p>
	<p pid="c.197.5/2">I promise to wind up my contribution because I know that many hon. Members want to speak. The Minister knows that I have the highest regard for him and I know that, given the challenges he faces, he will do the best job he can. However, it is extremely worrying that yesterday Peter Lehman, the Government's own adviser on fuel poverty, said in a press release that the big six energy companies</p>
	<p pid="c.197.5/3" class="indent">&quot;have raised their prices, especially electricity prices, by more than their cost increases (with variations between companies) and Ofgem has done far too little even to investigate this&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.197.5/4">I think that that is the case. We know that there is a problem and we expect more from the regulators. If the powers do not exist, there is huge anxiety among all hon. Members that we should consider creating those powers. That is one reason why I shall conclude by saying to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> that he was right to table his early-day motion, which I have signed. If the companies and Ofgem think that their case is so good, why are they worried about going to the competition commissioner? Let them do so and undergo an examination, and let us go back to the people and explain what we have sought to do on their behalf to remove such a serious problem.</p>

	<p pid="c.198.0/1">It is a pleasure to make a brief contribution to this debate. I think that there is a television show called &quot;Before They Were Famous&quot; and those of us who are regulars in Westminster Hall debates listened to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> before he was famous. We are used to his analysis and sharpness and were not at all surprised that in many people's opinion he was judged to be the parliamentarian of recent months and the past year. I am pleased that he has initiated this debate. It is also a great pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.198.0/2">As I said, I shall make a brief contribution in support of the hon. Member for Twickenham and the three essential points that he made. The Government should at least consider three regulatory interventions in the energy market: first, a reference to the Competition Commission of the big six; secondly, consideration of whether the Energy Bill should contain a provision on a minimum social tariff for the energy companies; and thirdly, examination of whether the Government have done enough in relation to the boast of the former Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, that on the issue of gas storage and pipelines the companies will have to use it or lose it. I think that the former Chancellor used that phrase in a Budget a couple of years ago. I want to examine those issues briefly and I will try not to go over the ground that has already been covered.</p>
	<p pid="c.198.0/3">In referring to the European energy market a few years ago, one commentator talked about the seven brothers&mdash;the seven big energy companies&mdash;that dominate the energy market. We have six, not seven, brothers who dominate our energy market. It is worth listing them for the record: RWE npower, EDF Energy, British Gas, Scottish and Southern Energy, E.ON UK, and Scottish Power&mdash;which is being taken over by Iberdrola, a Spanish company. In recent weeks there has been confusion about the precise allegations that are being made about those six companies. For example, <i>The Sunday Times </i>ran a story about the Energy Retail Association and suggested that there had been meetings between energy companies, and that collusion and price fixing might be happening. I have seen no evidence of that. If there is evidence, it is a serious matter for the Office of Fair Trading. However, the fact that there is no proof has been used by some to say that there is no problem. The hon. Member for Twickenham referred to the Chancellor summoning the Ofgem regulator, who assured him that the market was competitive, in response to which the Chancellor said, &quot;That's all right then.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.198.0/4">Those developments have occurred over recent weeks, but the essential point is the structure of the market and vertical integration, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. No one has mentioned Energywatch so far in this debate. It has done an in-depth analysis to support some of the studies that have already been mentioned. Those studies discuss vertical integration&mdash;a market where a large number of the players are not just producing electricity and gas but retailing it, and are involved in every part of the process. In a short paper, which I recommend to the Minister, Energywatch mentions various anti-competitive practices that a vertical structure introduces.</p>

	<p pid="c.199.3/1">It has also played a key role in terms of the social responsibility of the companies. I will not mention all the different criticisms that Energywatch makes of the energy markets. There are well over 20 criticisms, and they break down into different themes. One feature of any market that is competitive is the flow of information and ensuring that people know what is happening. Energywatch criticises upstream long-term gas sales agreements, which account for more than 85 per cent. of source gas supplies to the UK. It states:</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/2" class="indent">&quot;These have the effect of withdrawing from the open market, information on prices and volumes which is necessary to make open markets work&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/3">There are many criticisms of price transparency and Energywatch goes into great detail about what it calls market foreclosure, which I understand relates to the great difficulty that any company has in breaking into the big six. From 20 down to six has already been referred to as the number of effective entrants in the market. That situation is quite remarkable. The hon. Member for Twickenham referred to British Energy, which is by no means a small player. It has complained to Ofgem that</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/4" class="indent">&quot;the access of the 'big six' to their own power stations and gas supplies undermines competition by restricting energy sales on the open market.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/5">And that energy trading</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/6" class="indent">&quot;increasingly forecloses the market to new entrants&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/7">Average UK consumer gas prices between 2004 and 2006 rose by 64 per cent. as opposed to 19.5 per cent. across six peer nations in Europe, in which there are apparently much less competitive and deregulated markets.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/8">So, what are we asking for? We are asking for a reference, which is quite a simple request. Why is Ofgem not making a reference and why do regulators generally not make references about the markets that they are in charge of to the Competition Commission? I suggest that it is because of pride. Ofgem got rid of price controls some years ago and it is reluctant to admit that it is not capable of giving both the business and the residential consumer the best possible deal because of the structure of the market. That is why Ministers were given the power to make a reference in the legislation. I understand that doing so is difficult because many of the businesses concerned are the same ones that are building new power stations, upon which the nation relies. However, overall in business terms, I think that the Government would be incredibly popular if they made such a reference to the Competition Commission. For example, manufacturing industry is very critical of energy prices and the influence of the big six. I realise that it would take political courage to make such a reference, but I would like to think that the Chancellor was serious when he summoned Ofgem the other week and that when he studies the documents from Energywatch and others, he will realise that an examination of the issues is essential so that the energy companies and the critics can both make their case as we move forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.199.3/9">The issue of social tariffs has been well covered. We last spoke about the subject in a debate on fuel poverty in the House a couple of weeks ago, and I was particularly critical of npower and the chief executive of npower retail, David Threlfall. It is interesting that in recent weeks even Ofgem has picked out npower as having the most to do to improve its social responsibility and tariffs.</p>

The Minister said then that some companies are doing well, and others are now moving in the right direction. Will my hon.

	<p pid="c.200.1/1">I shall let the Minister speak for himself on how he would rank the various companies. It is interesting that when npower was criticised by the regulator a few weeks ago, rather than putting its hand up and saying that it needed to do better, it rebutted the regulator's claims and said that it had a range of practical solutions. Incidentally, it was found that it had disconnected seven in 1,000 gas users last year, which was twice as many as its nearest rival, EDF Energy, which disconnected three and a half in 1,000.</p>

	<p pid="c.200.2/1">It is futile to try to rank the companies, because they are all woefully inadequate by any measure, so legislation to force action on a minimum floor is the right way forward. Does my hon. Friend agree that the existing arrangements are largely a sham, and a pretext for corporate responsibility that is not real?</p>

	<p pid="c.200.3/1">I agree that the time has come to have a minimum floor for social tariffs. I have great hopes of the Minister, and he gave a thoughtful interview on the &quot;Today&quot; programme this morning. If he looks back at the White Paper, he will see the comment:</p>
	<p pid="c.200.3/2" class="indent">&quot;If no further action is undertaken by the companies&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.200.3/3">the Government</p>
	<p pid="c.200.3/4" class="indent">&quot;will consider whether to take the opportunity for legislation to enable the Secretary of State to require companies to have an adequate programme of support for their most vulnerable customers. In this context, we may consider the role of mandated minimum standards for social tariffs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.200.3/5">The Energy Bill provides the opportunity to do more than just consider; it provides the opportunity to put that into effect.</p>
	<p pid="c.200.3/6">I was almost moved during the Minister's interview this morning when he replied to the claim that we have 22,000 more deaths among the elderly population in winter than in summer. The reason for that can only be energy prices. In Scandinavia, there is no significant difference between the number of winter and summer deaths. We have a chance to make a difference on our own watch as MPs and as a Government. We have a target of eliminating fuel poverty by 2016, so I hope that the Minister will take further steps in the Energy Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.200.3/7">I said that I would say a few words about gas storage and pipelines. The matter was dominant in the news 12 or 18 months ago when wholesale gas prices were high, but went off the political agenda during a short period when there was rather less pressure on wholesale gas prices. I understand that about a year ago, Ofgem consulted on the operation of the gas storage market, gas pipelines and so on. I would be interested if the Minister briefed us on the conclusions of the Ofgem inquiry, his response to it, and whether there is a case for instituting in law third-party access to gas storage and gas pipelines, which the hon. Member for Twickenham mentioned.</p>

	<p pid="c.201.0/1">It is always a great pleasure to speak in debates under your chairmanship, Mr. Amess.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing this debate. He has great expertise as an economist, particularly of energy and oil companies, and has been able to relate complicated Competition Commission issues to the fate and experience of vulnerable people who are finding it more and more difficult to keep their houses warm, and to survive the winter. However, he represents Twickenham, so he was remiss in not mentioning the great energy surge there during the second half of the Wales and England game last Saturday. That was one of the last great class battles and for once we had the result that we often deserve, but rarely achieve.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.0/3">Fuel, food, water and air are essential commodities for life, and we must pay for three of them at the moment. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">The hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> mentioned that there are 22,000 more deaths during the winter, which could be avoided if we had properly insulated houses and fuel that people could afford. That is a testament to our inability to address the fuel poverty issue, and brings into question whether we are such a civilised country as we claim and hope to be.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.0/4">My hon. Friend focused on competition issues, and it is important to reflect on them again. Fossil fuels, which are the mainstay of heating and lighting our homes, are a finite resource. Many of us are aware of the concept of peak oil and peak gas, and there is competition in that also, because that finite resource is coming to an end, and exploration and exploitation to produce that resource are becoming more difficult and expensive. It is sometimes said that the best cure for high prices is high prices, because higher prices encourage investment in exploration, exploitation and so on. However, we are approaching the stage at which wherever we look for such resources, they will cost more, and some of those issues will be reflected in the price.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.0/5">Another competition issue to which a number of hon. Members referred is consolidation. The number of energy companies has fallen from 20 to six, and that has been mentioned often during the debate. There has been a similar experience with supermarkets. Morrisons recently bought Safeway, which reduced competition. When there is consolidation, even if the remaining companies try to remain within the spirit of competition law, it is sometimes difficult. Indeed, an inquiry by the Competition Commission into supermarkets has established that there was uncompetitive practice in the grocery trade, particularly the dairy trade. A number of supermarkets have admitted to that breach of competition law and been fined, while others refuse to accept that and are contesting the issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.0/6">When a small number of companies are vertically integrated, it is more difficult for them not to be uncompetitive than in the supermarket trade where at least vertical competition has not reached the same scale as in the energy sector. Ofgem must look at that, and consider whether there should be a referral. The market is huge and domestic energy accounts for 27 per cent. of total UK consumption, of which gas makes up 69 per cent., electricity 22 per cent., petrol products 7 per cent., and coal 1 per cent. The problem is not restricted to domestic supplies; small businesses also find it difficult.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.0/7">When I was having a pre-match drink on Saturday in the Old Cognac, which is an excellent pub and provides excellent food, the landlady told me that her fuel bill is now &pound;3,000 a quarter for that very small but high-quality establishment. The problem affects domestic consumers, but also small businesses. I remind the Minister that it would not be new for the Competition Commission to investigate the fuel industry. At the instigation of my predecessor, the noble Lord Livsey, and following continued pressure from me, there has been an inquiry into liquid petroleum gas, on which a number of people who are not on mains gas have to rely. That fuel is much more expensive per unit of energy than mains gas or electricity.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.0/8">In the inquiry, the Competition Commission uncovered some uncompetitive practices, and we are still waiting for it to make its recommendations on how to deal with the problem. I understand that the park home owners have put in an objection to the recommendations. I ask the Minister to accelerate the outcome of that inquiry because vulnerable people such as park home owners and pensioners, who are not on mains gas, suffer from the very high prices of liquid petroleum gas.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.0/9">Clearly, problems exist for consumers. Energy prices are quick to rise when gas and oil prices go up, but they do not seem to drop when prices come down. May I refer to the point that was made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1485" name="Adam Price">the hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price)</phrase>? The <i>Western Mail </i>today reported that energy prices in Wales were between 15 and 20 per cent. higher than from the same supplier in England. By referring the matter to the Competition Commission, I want to ensure that the issue of regional pricing disparities is addressed. In my constituency, some of the ex-mining villages do not have mains gas and have to rely on oil and electricity, which is an expensive form of heating. Therefore, this disparity in pricing really must be tackled.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.0/10">Ofgem claims that the level of competition can be calculated by the number of people who switch energy suppliers during a given year. We have heard that about 4 million domestic users out of a total of 36 million have switched. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> said, many of those switched because they were encouraged to do so, and did not necessarily secure a good deal.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.0/11">In conclusion, a number of issues relating to competition need to be addressed. Fuel poverty is a scourge from which this country suffers. I thought that the Minister was very measured in his response to the interview on Radio 4 this morning. He clearly understood the problems. The Government's energy policy is that prices should be reduced through competition. We can see that that is not happening for a number of reasons, including limited supplies and the consolidation of the industry itself. The Minister will know that although some of the Warm Front schemes have been very successful, the Government are now reducing their investment in them.</p>
	<p pid="c.201.0/12">To sum up, are the major companies being really competitive? I am not alleging that an overt cartel exists. So, are there any ways in which companies are co-ordinating prices by means other than overt cartel making? We must look at the social tariff, which was raised by the hon. Member for Selby, whose early-day motion will probably be signed by many of us. We need to look at meter payment, the associated high tariffs, and the difficulty of those on meters to switch supplier. We also want to look at regional differences in supplies. The liquid natural gas pipeline has come through my constituency, but not a single constituent will be able to tap into it. Despite all that disruption, prices are still higher in Wales. Will the Minister address the liquid petroleum gas issue and tell us when people in isolated villages and homes can benefit from true competition?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05c.203.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" speakername="John Baron" colnum="203"  time="012:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0007.htm#08020535000535">
	<p pid="c.203.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing this debate, and other hon. Members on their excellent contributions. A great deal of consensus exists on this issue. Rising energy prices and fuel poverty are a concern for all our constituents. It is essential that we have the right regulatory framework in place to deliver a competitive market and to try to secure the best possible prices for all our citizens. In fairness, we should recognise that Ofgem has provided the UK with one of Europe's most competitive markets. Arguably, we have the fifth cheapest market for electricity and the cheapest for gas. Energy prices for consumers remain lower than before market deregulation. However, we must recognise that international and economic forces and global trends are driving up prices. The question is whether the Government are doing all that they can to help people with those price increases. Serious questions have been asked by hon. Members, and I want to focus on two or three other issues as well. I hope that the Minister will have plenty of time to answer my specific questions.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/2">Since 2003, the price of gas has risen by 82 per cent., and the price of electricity by more than 60 per cent. Cost increases are taking their toll on all households, especially those of the elderly and the vulnerable. I make no apology for repeating that point. We have all had letters from constituents raising those issues. I recently received correspondence from a local gentleman in his 60s explaining how, with council tax increases and rising food bills, increases in energy prices are causing a real difficulty. I hope you will forgive me, Miss Begg, if I read out a couple of sentences from his e-mail. He states:</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/3" class="indent">&quot;I myself cannot pay the gas and electric increases, petrol or council tax increases. I have informed the utility companies that I cannot pay the 27 per cent. increase.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/4">He goes on:</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/5" class="indent">&quot;So, my food has to suffer and I eat less. I only have one good meal a week. I live on toast and biscuits and chips and the odd cup of tea daily to keep my weekly costs down...The Government are aware, but don't care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/6">I fear that there are many others in the same situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/7">According to some estimates, the number of fuel-poor households has doubled since 2005 alone despite a Government target to eradicate fuel poverty from vulnerable households by 2010. Picking up on an earlier point, will the Minister explain why there has been a cut in the budget for the Warm Front scheme, which is the main mechanism for assisting households in fuel poverty?</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/8">We have also heard figures relating to fuel poverty deaths. Apparently, in the winter of 2006-07, about 25,000 people over the age of 65 died as a result of cold-related illnesses. Those figures are far in excess of countries on the continent with even more severe weather conditions. The disparity in the figures between those who die in the winter and those who die in the summer is far greater in this country than on the continent. Will the Minister address that issue because it suggests that the Government's strategy and policies are not having the desired effect?</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/9">Fuel poverty, as we have heard, impedes competition. As many as 2 million customers cannot switch suppliers because they are already in debt to their existing suppliers. In light of that worrying trend, I hope that the Minister will use his winding-up speech to explain how he proposes to meet his target to eradicate fuel poverty and say whether he believes that the time has come for Ofgem to have a specific mandate to ensure that fuel poverty is driven down, which has been touched on by a number of hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/10">We have also touched on social tariffs. I do not wish to re-explore the debate about social tariffs, but they could be part of the solution. Some suppliers are keen to develop them. Indeed, there have already been calls for the Secretary of State to take powers to direct suppliers to provide social tariffs. I would welcome the Minister's response and opinion on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/11">We have heard about Ofgem's future role. It could have an important role to play in promoting sustainable development and reducing our national carbon footprint. As the Minister will be aware, the Sustainable Development Commission has made five key recommendations about Ofgem's responsibilities, including changing the market arrangements to make it easier for small and low-carbon generators and suppliers to compete&mdash;a point touched on by the hon. Member for Twickenham. It would be useful to know whether the Minister has considered the options proposed by the commission and what views he has been able to form.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/12">One of the commission's recommendations was for consumers to have better information through smart metering and billing to help them to make decisions about energy consumption. The Government have been slow off the mark in that area. I suggest that they have committed themselves to the technologically inferior electricity display device over the smart meter, despite industry consensus that EDDs may be a waste of time and money and will not help to deliver favourable reductions in fuel poverty. The beauty of smart meters, as I understand them, is that they offer the opportunity for varied and innovative tariffs that will encourage those on tight budgets to use electrical appliances such as washing machines in off-peak hours. EDDs, however, simply tell people how much electricity they are using and perhaps dissuade them from using their appliances at all. In addition, EDDs work only for electricity, not gas, despite gas being the main heat source for most UK households&mdash;the figure that we heard was 69 or 70 per cent. of all households.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/13">The use of smart meters in all homes would lead to the removal from use of often expensive pre-payment meters, which statistics suggest are a much more expensive way of using energy. Many of the customers who use pre-payment meters are fuel poor and in debt to energy companies. Smart meters would also allow many people who are prevented from moving supplier to take advantage of market liberalisation. Will the Minister explain why he decided to opt for EDDs over smart meters? What beneficial effects are they likely to have on fuel poverty?</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/14">Finally, I want to touch on how to ensure true competitiveness in the UK market&mdash;the point that I raised with the hon. Member for Twickenham. In assessing competitiveness, we must consider not only the UK market, but the wider European context. I have already posed the question in this debate about the EU treaty, which fails to usher in a truly competitive EU market. Liberal Democrat Members and Government Back-Benchers must ask why the treaty is not ushering in a more competitive market. For example, the phrase &quot;free competition&quot; was apparently removed from the draft treaty at the behest of the French. Some of our continental allies appear to take a far less liberal approach to these matters than we do, and the consequence not only for British business but for British consumers is very serious. Whereas 20 million British consumers use French or German gas suppliers, none in France or Germany uses UK ones, so we have to consider the issue in a European context.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/15">For evidence of the different attitude taken by our neighbours, we need look no further than France's &euro;70 billion merger of energy giants Gaz de France&mdash;already Europe's largest natural gas operator&mdash;and Suez to create what will become the world's fourth-largest energy company, with the French Government keeping a one-third share of the new company. That is, as I have suggested, economic nationalism on the march. The French Prime Minister has gone on the radio and said, &quot;We have control. We control strategy.&quot; That is creating national champions and that cannot be good for competition. The merger was approved by the European Commission in 2006, subject to conditions, but how different that approach is from our national experience of breaking up monopolies and not consolidating national champions.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/16">Meanwhile, European watchdogs have been busy probing continental energy firms over claims of anti-competitive practices, but many of the results have proved inconclusive. There does not seem to be the political will to sort that problem out. I suggest to all hon. Members that if we are truly serious about trying to help our citizens in achieving or gaining the best possible prices, we have to grasp that nettle and try to ensure greater competition across Europe as a whole. I ask every hon. Member to examine the EU treaty carefully, because it falls well short of trying to introduce a more competitive market across Europe as a whole. One is not looking for favours or anything like that, but one does want far greater competition and this EU treaty is not delivering it. The treaty shies away from bringing in a more truly competitive market. Will the Minister say what the Government will do to try to put that right? What pressure will the Government bring to bear with their European counterparts in bringing into effect a much more liberalised energy market on the continent? We are failing to do that at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="c.203.0/17">I do not intend to say much more because I want to leave the Minister plenty of time to respond to the points that we have all made, but I ask him in all earnestness and honesty to address the concerns that we have raised, particularly with regard to smart meters, Ofgem's future remit and how we can best create a truly competitive European market.</p>

	<p pid="c.206.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on the measured and thoughtful way in which he introduced the debate. I hope that I shall have time to respond to some of his key points. We heard a very fine speech from my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, who has been a long-term advocate of doing more for the fuel-poor. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> made an important speech.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/2">We also heard some important Front-Bench contributions. I was impressed that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> is so diligent that he even continues his research when in an establishment that he called &quot;The Old Cognac&quot;. The price of an old cognac would be more than a new cognac, so I hope that that helps with some of the energy costs involved. I congratulate his nation on a remarkable comeback in the rugby over the weekend.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/3">I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" name="John Baron">the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase> will forgive me if I do not go too far down the European treaty road, because I vaguely recall that in the main Chamber we have spent a few hours debating that issue; indeed, we debated the energy aspects only the other day. However, I will say something about market liberalisation. I do not think that he is a supporter of the European treaty, but at one stage he almost seemed to be calling for more European powers to override national policies when it comes to energy nationalism. I am not sure whether that is a new Conservative party policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/4">We are all concerned about rising energy costs, particularly as they affect vulnerable people such as the frail elderly and poorer families with children. It is important that we are as clear as we can be about the evidence base, and the hon. Member for Twickenham was very measured in his introduction. Wholesale price rises in the past year have hit hard. Wholesale gas forward prices&mdash;the prices that our supply companies have themselves to pay&mdash;have increased by 50 per cent. for gas and 85 per cent. for coal since January 2007, so in just a year there has been a dramatic increase in wholesale prices. I am advised that wholesale prices tend to make up about 50 and 45 per cent. of retail prices for domestic gas and electricity customers respectively. Wholesale prices make up roughly 70 and 90 per cent. of prices for average-sized industrial gas and electricity consumers. UK gas prices are of course linked to continental prices because of interconnectors&mdash;increasingly so, because of the importance of liquefied natural gas, the price of which is strongly influenced by the price of oil. Fossil fuel prices have been on an upward trend in the past 12 months, pushed by global supply and demand pressures, which we all understand.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/5">The European Commission's third package of legislation on the internal market and action by the EU competition authorities aim to develop transparent, better- functioning EU gas markets. In response in particular to the hon. Member for Billericay, but also to the hon. Member for Twickenham, we can proudly say that the UK has been in the lead of the charge for greater market liberalisation in Europe. That is central to the concept of the single market. We are working hard on the matter and I am pleased that Commissioners are now taking it very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="c.206.0/6">I shall not say too much about the emissions trading scheme but, in response to the hon. Member for Billericay, we will see far higher rates in phase 3 of the scheme&mdash;very high rates&mdash;of auctioning of the allowances. We back that as a policy.</p>

	<p pid="c.207.0/1">I accept that the Government have tried to make the case in Europe for a more liberal market. The problem is that they are not having much effect. When we look at the merger in which the French Government will keep a 35 to 40 per cent. stake, we will see that economic nationalism seems to be on the march on the continent. What more will the Minister do to try to get the French Government to change their mind?</p>

	<p pid="c.207.1/1">We continue to push for that in the Energy Council of Ministers, of which I am a member, and we work closely with the Commission. The Commission's action on competition was significant&mdash;it launched dawn raids some while ago on the offices of major European energy companies. We are very much engaged in that process.</p>
	<p pid="c.207.1/2">We are not alone in having to pay more for our energy, but our domestic gas prices are still significantly lower than domestic prices in France or Germany. For more than a decade, our market has consistently delivered lower prices to UK domestic customers than the vast majority of other EU countries. I am conscious that that will bring no comfort to some of the vulnerable people in this country who are having to pay higher bills, but European comparisons are important. Even following the latest price increases, there will be opportunities for customers to save by switching suppliers. I shall say more about that because I am not far from the analysis of the hon. Member for Twickenham on switching.</p>
	<p pid="c.207.1/3">Alongside the great increase in wholesale prices, which is down to global factors such as the great demand for energy in China and India and so on, our environmental policies&mdash;we all support tackling climate change and global warming&mdash;are pushing up prices quite considerably. We need to understand that we will not save the planet on the cheap&mdash;such things are expensive. Our policies to protect the environment, be that through the EU's emissions trading scheme, the new carbon emissions reduction target, which is the successor to the energy efficiency commitment, and our renewables obligation which, as the hon. Member for Twickenham reminded us, will be worth &pound;1 billion in investment by 2010, inevitably have an impact on price. The cost of CERT, which funds installation of energy efficiency measures in households to save energy and to reduce carbon emissions, particularly lower-income households, has doubled on both gas and electricity. We estimate that the combined impact of the renewables obligation, CERT and the EU ETS counts for about 16 per cent. of annual electricity bills, which is a significant amount. In an estimated average bill, those costs will be a total of &pound;60 for electricity and &pound;19 for gas, and they will rise as we pursue our climate change policies.</p>
	<p pid="c.207.1/4">Contrary to what the hon. Member for Billericay said, we are committed to smart meters. There is a debate about whether the clip-on devices are helpful for energy inefficiency&mdash;they probably are&mdash;but we are committed to driving forward the development of smart meters. That is not inexpensive, but we think that it is important for a variety of reasons, about which we will say more in the weeks to come.</p>
	<p pid="c.207.1/5">Ofgem's primary role is to promote competition in the interests of gas and electricity customers. I have no doubt that if Ofgem was to see evidence of anti-competitive behaviour, it would not hesitate to investigate formally&mdash;it has a record of doing so. Ofgem states that ongoing market surveillance shows that the market remains competitive, and its June 2007 domestic retail market report showed vigorous price competition between the six major suppliers. I always urge Energywatch and other critics to put the evidence to Ofgem so that it can remain ever vigilant. The hon. Member for Twickenham cited an interesting study that I shall look at further.</p>
	<p pid="c.207.1/6">Is the market competitive? According to independent research&mdash;the latest figures from Oxera&mdash;the UK's energy market remains the most competitive in the EU and G7. We need our commitment to open and transparent markets to be replicated throughout the rest of Europe. Suppliers face similar costs when procuring energy wholesale. When those costs change, they face similar pressures on their margins. Despite the popular rhetoric, there is much evidence to show that we have a competitive market.</p>
	<p pid="c.207.1/7">I listened carefully to the opening of the debate by the hon. Member for Twickenham and found myself agreeing with him on two issues, so much so that I realised that I had said similar things to the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Committee when I appeared before it last week. First, it is important not simply to say that we have competition, but to look critically at that. In particular, we need to ensure that the conditions in our market do not prevent new entrants or new approaches that may emerge as we progress to a lower-carbon future. I am thinking particularly about the growing interest in local energy systems, combined heat and power, and the often small-scale development of renewables. We must ensure that smaller companies do not find unnecessary barriers to market entry. I do not know whether that happens, but it has been suggested, and I shall discuss it further with Ofgem. If we believe in markets and competition, we must ensure that they look like markets, rather than like oligopolies, as my hon. Friend the Member for Selby said. I am sensitive to that.</p>
	<p pid="c.207.1/8">The second matter on which I agree with the hon. Member for Twickenham is switching. We must ensure that switching works for all customers, but particularly for the vulnerable. If switching becomes the preserve of an IT generation and is not relevant to many of our vulnerable constituents, it will be worthless. I have raised that matter with Ofgem and the companies and I shall pursue it further.</p>
	<p pid="c.207.1/9">The Government have made progress through the years and decades on fuel poverty. The figures for excess winter mortality rates are shocking, and they continue to be so, but, when we look at the long-term trend, thankfully, as a result of rising affluence, more jobs, improved housing, energy efficiency schemes, pension credits and winter fuel payments, we see that the Government have been moving in the right direction on the fuel poverty indicator&mdash;spending 10 per cent. of income on energy is our definition of fuel poverty. We have made progress for all those reasons. I am proud of that progress. The Government have spent some &pound;20 billion on energy-related measures, including the winter fuel payment, but I recognise that we are being knocked off course by rising energy costs.</p>

	<p pid="c.209.1/1">The hon. Gentleman needs to look at the funding of Warm Front, which is the public spending programme administered by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, alongside the successor to the energy efficiency commitment&mdash;CERT. When he does so, he will see that more money will be spent in the next three years on vulnerable people and energy efficiency than has been spent in the past. Social tariffs can play a role, and I have met the energy companies to urge them to do more on those. They have increased the amount that they spend on social tariffs, but I met the bosses of the energy supply companies only last week to urge them to do more.</p>
	<p pid="c.209.1/2">I am not complacent. I am proud of what we have done as a society. I am worried about the current situation, and we need to redouble our efforts. The debate obtained by the hon. Member for Twickenham has helped us to focus on some of the critical questions.</p>

	Post Office Closures (York)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05c.210.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" speakername="Hugh Bayley" colnum="210"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0008.htm#08020535000541">
	<p pid="c.210.1/1">I shall be making some pretty blunt criticisms of how the Post Office has consulted the public and stakeholders over its proposals to close four more branches in York. The Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs cannot be here because he has been called to give evidence to a Select Committee, but I believe that he should rein in the Post Office, requiring it to rerun the consultation in York in a meaningful way and adopt a better approach when consulting in other areas. If he does so, it will show that the Government are in charge of the Post Office, but at the moment the Post Office appears to be a law unto itself.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/2">The Post Office has won approval from the European Commission for a further &pound;1.7 billion of public subsidy to keep branches open. I welcome that. I am glad that the Government supported that. That is a lot of money, and Post Office managers should be accountable to Parliament for how it is spent. The Post Office should be accountable through the Minister, and the Minister needs to set reasonable reporting requirements for the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/3">At the heart of the Government's case that further post offices closures are sadly inevitable, despite the public subsidy, is the claim that they currently serve 4 million fewer customers each week than they did two years ago. I presume that the Post Office has figures for customer usage now and then on which that statement was based. I therefore tabled a parliamentary question in November, shortly before the York closure consultation started, asking the Minister how many customers the Post Office had in York in each of the past five years. My hon. Friend said that he had asked Alan Cook, the managing director of Post Office Ltd, to reply. Despite many reminders to Post Office officials, he still has not done so.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/4">I do not object to a Minister delegating the answering of parliamentary questions about operational matters to the Post Office provided that he ensures that it does what it is told to do and answers a question asked by a Member of Parliament. When the Post Office fails to reply, it appears to me and to the public to be out of control and contemptuous of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/5">The Minister with responsibility for the Post Office may think that he is on a hiding to nothing with post office closures and that closures will always be opposed whatever he does. My advice to him is to require the Post Office, as a matter of routine, to ensure that every consultation document on closure indicates how many fewer transactions in each town, city and rural area covered by the consultation there are compared with the number at the time of the last round of closures.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/6">The public are not stupid. For example, if Post Office in York had lost 10 per cent. of its customers over the last three years, it would not be unreasonable for it to reduce its counter space in York by 10 per cent. However, despite being asked parliamentary questions, and being asked subsequently on many occasions to provide information about the decline of usage&mdash;if, indeed, there has been a decline&mdash;the Post Office has failed to do so. It simply has no basis for closing post office branches in York.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/7">I am sure that the Under-Secretary will have seen my submission to the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Select Committee about the Post Office's closure process, but I would like to go through the recommendations that I made in my submission. I believe that the approach to consultation currently being used by the Post Office, is deeply flawed, and that it is designed simply to enable it to jump the hurdles and to achieve closures without the appropriate public scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/8">I made nine recommendations to the Select Committee. First, local area consultation documents should state what change of usage in post office branches there has been in a particular area, and what change in post office capacity is being proposed. I also recommended that the Minister with responsibility for the Post Office should closely monitor the answers to parliamentary questions that are passed to the Post Office for reply, and that if the Post Office does not provide a reasonable and full answer to the Member, it should be told to provide more detail. It is not good enough simply to say that it is an operational matter and not something that should come before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/9">There were many factual inaccuracies and a lack of local knowledge in the consultation document that covered the York closures and closures elsewhere in north and east Yorkshire. For instance, it stated that there were 71 post office branches in York. I went through that with the Post Office, and it eventually agreed that there are currently 34.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/10">One of the branches scheduled for closure in York, Micklegate, was designated as a receiving branch for two other post office branches&mdash;the Bishopthorpe road and Albemarle road branches&mdash;that had been closed three years ago. That was not mentioned in the document. Post Office officials&mdash;I pay tribute to them for this&mdash;came to a public meeting in York to tell people about the proposals, but they were entirely unaware that a branch that was proposed for closure was designated as a branch that should receive customers from other branches that were closed three years earlier.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/11">It was felt that the customers of one branch that was to be closed, which was almost next door to a small branch of HSBC, could use the bank for services, but officials were unaware that HSBC was about to close that branch. They were unaware of a series of major housing developments in York near other branches that were proposed for closure. No account had been taken of winter flooding. Only last week, we had massive flooding in York, and some of the pedestrian routes that the Post Offices suggested could be used by members of the public to reach other post offices if certain branches were to be closed went through areas that flood in winter. Even when they are not knee-deep in water, they are too boggy and muddy, and too dark and dangerous for people, especially older people, to use.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/12">I propose that Post Office Ltd submit its draft local area consultation documents and closure proposals to local authorities in each of the areas affected before they are published to avoid omissions and factual inaccuracies.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/13">I was concerned to find that the branches scheduled for closure in York ran out of the letters provided by the Post Office to inform customers of how to complain. To ensure a reasonable supply of those letters, I had to phone the Post Office. If the Post Office wants a genuine consultation, it needs to tell its customers how to express their views. The fact that it produced a wholly inadequate number of letters informing the public of how do to that is an indication that it was not serious about consulting the public.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/14">One of my constituents went through the list of local community bodies in York, including residents associations, tenants associations, disability groups and transport groups, that the council routinely consults when it proposes a change in facilities or policies. He checked with as many of those bodies as he could and found that only two of them had been consulted by the Post Office as key stakeholders. Again, if the Post Office wants to know what is going on and what the impact of any change will be in a community, it has to consult in a proper and serious way.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/15">After reading the consultation document that the Post Office issued, it is not at all clear to me whether the closure plans that the Post Office is proposing will comply with the Government's minimum access requirements for post offices. That should be set out very clearly. The Government require a certain percentage of the population, 95 per cent., to be within, I think, one mile of a post office branch in an urban area or within three miles in a rural area. The Post Office needs to work out what proportion of the public are that close to a post office branch, currently and in the future. If it cannot produce those figures, it cannot be sure that it is complying with the Government's minimum access requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/16">I am sceptical about the excuse that is used by the Post Office, namely that it is unable to release information about post office branch usage because that information is commercial and confidential. The Post Office is not a private, commercial business; it is a public sector body that receives massive taxpayer subsidy and it needs to be accountable to Parliament. Even if there are commercial reasons why the Post Office does not wish to release information about the usage of a single branch, there is absolutely no reason why it cannot issue information about the usage across branches grouped together&mdash;10, 20 or 30 branches&mdash;in a particular town or city.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/17">The only argument that has been made to me about why the Post Office would not release information about the number of customers at a particular branch is that that information might affect the proprietor, the sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress, if they wanted to sell their business. Well, if a man or woman wants to sell his or her business, they would have to release to each and every potential buyer precisely that information, so it would cause no difficulty to the business if that information were in the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/18">I recommend that these Post Office consultation documents reveal, at the very least, the average number of transactions per branch in each urban area and in each rural area, and indicate any branch proposed for closure that carries out more than the average number of transactions. The Post Office should also have to meet a higher burden of proof to make the case for closing a branch that is busier than most of the branches in a particular town or city.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/19">One of the branches that is proposed for closure in York has almost 2,000 customers a week and is the fourth busiest post office in York, while another branch proposed for closure is the 13th busiest. However, of two other branches that are being maintained in York&mdash;with, I imagine, a huge public subsidy&mdash;one has just 13 transactions a week, or two customers a day, and the other just 26 transactions a week, or four customers a day. Would it not make more sense to use taxpayers' money to protect a branch with 400 customers a day than one with just two?</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/20">Of course, the reason that some branches with very low numbers of customers are protected is the Government's rural access criteria. The branches in York that I have just mentioned&mdash;the two that will not be closed&mdash;are not, of course, rural branches in the Yorkshire wolds or dales, far away from any market town, but branches within about three miles of York city centre. Nevertheless, they are protected under the access criteria. The Government need to consider a de minimis rule that would allow the minimum access criteria for rural areas to be set aside for branches that serve a very low number of customers, say fewer than five customers a day. The point of the access criteria is to protect a service for members of the public in rural areas, but if it is a service that nobody uses, or one that only two people a day use, maintaining it cannot be a good use of public money and the access criteria need to be amended.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/21">I put a final question to the Minister. When the last round of post office closures happened in York, Postwatch made an extremely strong argument against closing one of the six branches that had been proposed for closure, the Bishopthorpe Road branch in a secondary shopping centre in York. Postwatch asked the Post Office to think again about that closure. Nevertheless, the Post Office went ahead with it. Had the Post Office kept that busy branch open, there might have been a case for closing the busy branch near to it, Micklegate branch, which was a receiving branch and which is scheduled for closure now. However, the Post Office did not listen to Postwatch at that time and consequently it has got itself into a real mess.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/22">Of course, Postwatch is disappearing. Nevertheless, I believe that the closure criteria for post offices need to provide for a higher burden of proof for the closure of busy post offices. If the Post Office says that the fourth busiest post office in York is not commercially viable while another post office in York with only a two hundredth of the number of customers a day is considered commercially viable, there is something seriously wrong with the way that the Post Office determines commercial viability and it needs to change the criteria that it uses.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/23">I say to my hon. Friend the Minister, who is replying on behalf of the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs, that our hon. Friend's conduct as a Minister will be judged by whether he makes the Post Office deal with the public in an effective and respectful way regarding these closures. I do not believe that the Post Office has done that in York; it is entirely wrong and it should change.</p>
	<p pid="c.210.1/24">I entirely understand that the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs was unable to attend this debate because he had to go to the Select Committee, but I hope that I may be able to take up with him some of my concerns in a face-to-face meeting at a later date.</p>

	<p pid="c.213.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" name="Hugh Bayley">the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase>, in the usual way, on securing this debate on post office closures in his constituency. I also recognise the commitment that he has shown in pursuing his constituents' concerns, both in his presentation to the Select Committee that is examining post office closures and in the way that he has presented those concerns today.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/2">My hon. Friend is right that the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs is appearing before the Select Committee that is discussing post office closures. He made a series of points and directly asked for a face-to-face meeting with our hon. Friend. Of course, I will bring those detailed comments and that request to his attention.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/3">In the time available, let me try to establish some of the context for the decisions that have been taken thus far on the closure proposals in the city of York. My hon. Friend will be aware, as other hon. Members will be, that the decline in customer numbers, the increasing losses in the Post Office network and the changes in people's lifestyle, including changes in the way that they access services and information, have led the Government and indeed Post Office Ltd, after consultation, to take some difficult decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/4">In brief, it was decided that there would be 2,500 post office closures, that sub-postmasters leaving the network as part of the programme would receive compensation, that there would be 500 new outreach services to mitigate the effect of closures and that there would be new access criteria to ensure reasonable access to post office services.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/5">As my hon. Friend made clear, the Government will invest &pound;1.7 billion in the network on behalf of the taxpayer up until 2011. That includes an annual subsidy of &pound;150 million to keep open post office branches that could not otherwise be sustained.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/6">We estimate that about 4,000 post offices are currently commercially viable with no subsidy, with perhaps a number more on the margins. The Government do not take the view that the Post Office is purely a commercial service, which is why we have committed such a large public subsidy and why we are working with Post Office Ltd to maintain a national network that offers genuinely national coverage and is underpinned by access criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.213.0/7">As hon. Members will be aware, Post Office Ltd has been losing money for some years and lost approximately &pound;3.5 million a week last year. Four million fewer people now visit post offices every week than they did just two years ago. In urban areas, 1,000 sub-post offices are competing for business with at least six other post offices within a mile of them, and that at a time when the number of customers is falling.</p>

	<p pid="c.214.0/1">If the core of the Government's argument is that fewer people are using the Post Office and that fewer post office counter spaces are therefore necessary, would it not make sense for the Government to publish that information on a town-by-town basis when they go out to consult? That would make the case for why reductions were necessary, and the debate would then be about which post offices it would be most appropriate to remove if there was a reduction in demand for post office counters.</p>

	<p pid="c.214.1/1">If time allows, I shall explain the process that has led the Government to take their decisions. My hon. Friend will know that there was a consultation process on the overall issues facing the post office network and that we are now moving on to the detailed implementation of the decisions that were taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/2">Before I come to those specific points, however, let me add by way of context that the Post Office is also being challenged by significant changes in people's lifestyles. Eight out of 10 pensioners, for example, have their pension paid into a bank account. Last year, 500,000 people a month renewed their car tax online, and we estimate that about 1 million people a month will do so this year. Other changes, such as direct debit and competition in the bill payment market, have also affected the number of people using post offices. In addition, it is cheaper to pay a benefit or pension into a bank account than to pay them into a Post Office card account or use a girocheque.</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/3">Let me now move on to how the network change programme is being managed, which my hon. Friend raised in his intervention. The Government announced in May that the Post Office would be drawing up 47 area plans based on groupings of parliamentary constituencies to identify post offices for closure. In drawing up those plans, Post Office Ltd must take into account a number of factors, including local demographics and the age profile of communities in the areas affected, the impact on local economies, the availability of public transport, access issues in respect of proposed office closures and the nearest alternative branches.</p>
	<p pid="c.214.1/4">As I said, the Government undertook a 12-week national public consultation before finalising the broad forward strategy for the network. That consultation confirmed the principle of the need for changes and the broad extent of their scale and distribution. The Government do not play a specific role in proposals or decisions for individual post offices. Such decisions are made by Post Office Ltd in light of the responses to consultation and are subject to a four-stage appeals process involving Postwatch.</p>

	<p pid="c.215.0/1">I represent the southern part of the city of York. One of the post offices under threat is Fulford post office, whose owner offered to pay the Post Office a sum equivalent to whatever savings it would make by closing that post office. I raised the issue in a meeting with the Prime Minister in Downing street earlier this month, and he said that such proposals should be considered. I wrote to the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs asking for his views on whether proposals from businesses, or perhaps councils, to subsidise post offices could be considered. I simply ask the Minister to prompt his hon. Friend for a reply.</p>

	<p pid="c.215.1/1">I shall of course bring that point to my colleague's attention and ensure that my hon. Friend receives a reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.215.1/2">Post Office Ltd wrote to Members of Parliament in July about how the local consultation process would work and how they would be involved. Post Office Ltd and the Government have made it clear from the outset that the size of the network would have to be reduced. Local consultations, which are taking place now, are about how, not whether, that will be done.</p>
	<p pid="c.215.1/3">Post Office Ltd has been seeking input from Postwatch and sub-postmasters, as well as local authorities on occasion, in developing its area plan proposals before it goes out to public consultation. There will then be a six-week consultation period about the local plan proposals before Post Office Ltd makes its final decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.215.1/4">Local views are having an impact on the way the programme is being implemented. For example, I understand from Post Office Ltd that an average of 10 per cent. of its original closure proposals have been changed following input by local authorities and other stakeholders during the planning stage&mdash;that is, before formal public consultation. In addition, Post Office Ltd has reversed its original proposals in some cases as a result of the six-week local consultations.</p>
	<p pid="c.215.1/5">According to local circumstances, Post Office Ltd may decide not to seek an alternative closure or may propose an outreach service, rather than the original outright closure proposal. Where an alternative closure proposal is made, however, Post Office Ltd will hold a further six-week local consultation on the new proposal, and there will be no more than one such additional set of proposals in the area covered by each plan.</p>
	<p pid="c.215.1/6">There are two factors to take into account when assessing the profitability of a particular post office, and hon. Members may want to be aware of them. First, we must consider the business done in a post office and the level of payment from Post Office Ltd directly to that branch. Secondly, we must consider the cost of the central support from Post Office Ltd that is attributable to a branch. On that basis, three out of four post offices cost Post Office Ltd money to keep open.</p>
	<p pid="c.215.1/7">To restructure the network in a balanced way and meet the access criteria, some busy post offices that nevertheless make losses for Post Office Ltd and which have alternative branches nearby will have to be closed. That perhaps helps to explain some of the difficulties that my hon. Friend the Member for City of York highlighted with the proposals for post office closures in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.215.1/8">Post Office Ltd has confirmed that the average saving for the Post Office from closing a branch is about &pound;18,000 per annum. On request, it is prepared to share an estimate of the total individual branch saving with the relevant Member of Parliament on a confidential basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.215.1/9">My hon. Friend made a series of points, which I shall bring to the attention of the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs. I shall also bring to his attention the request that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> made for a reply. I hope, however, that I have helped to set out some of the context for the decisions on post office closures in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for City of York.</p>

	<p pid="c.217.3/1">Yes, we are ample. It means that we float if the water gets too high.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.3/2">Some 44 square miles of my county are well below sea level. Ever since Roman times, Somerset people have battled with the raging tides: we have dug ditches, erected earthworks and put in sluice gates. To put it crudely, we have slugged it out with mother nature for 1,000 years. The first ever steam-driven water-scoop wheels were tried in Somerset, in Middlezoy and Othery, by the western Zoyland drainage board, which built a very impressive pumping station, in 1830, which is still going and doing the same job, believe it or not.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.3/3">As the Minister is well aware, in Victorian times&mdash;not even I was there, but perhaps my illustrious predecessor, Lord King, was&mdash;drainage boards were seen as the answer to local flooding problems. They were linked to councils in the area, but it turned out that they had insufficient funds for national foresight to tackle the problem, although, as the Minister will know, drainage boards are having a slight resurgence simply because of the amount that needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.3/4">I dare hark back to Julius Caesar. Fighting against flooding has been met with a drip feed of failure as waters have risen relentlessly. I did not request this debate to criticise the national body responsible for protecting us&mdash;the Environment Agency. I have no qualms about the fact that it does its best. It has an impressive and dedicated team in Somerset, headed by Nick Gubta, whom I cannot fault. It does a very good job and I hope that the same applies in Dorset. It is a huge organisation paid for by the Government, but it is not actually answerable to anyone other than the Minister and there is always the danger that its efforts might be overlooked or wasted, which was proved, as all hon. Members must accept, by last year's floods. As the water closed around Tewkesbury cathedral&mdash;we have all seen the photographs&mdash;and as helicopters plucked stranded people from roofs, it became obvious that, rather like poor old Julius Caesar, the Environment Agency had been caught with its wellies down.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.3/5">The weather is unpredictable. When the floods receded in the summer, the Government asked the south-west strategic health authority chief, Sir Michael Pitt, to conduct a review and make recommendations. His interim findings were published just before Christmas, when unfortunately people had their minds on turkeys and Santa, not particularly on flooding. Unfortunately, the impact was lost. However, it is worth repeating a couple of Sir Michael's recommendations. He said that the Environment Agency should do far more work monitoring ground water levels and identifying areas of special risk, and develop a policy to use temporary water barriers. Furthermore, he said that there has to be a proper national plan, which at the moment there is not, as we are all aware. The implication contained in every one of his 15 recommendations is simple: there is a heck of a lot to be done by an agency that, I am afraid, does not have the lolly to do it.</p>
	<p pid="c.217.3/6">So much of all political debates boils down to hard cash. The Minister will no doubt regale us with the rising generosity of Her Majesty's Government. If he adds up both central and local government spending, he could probably claim that spending on flood defences has risen by 40 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.218.1/1">Whoopee! Great! However, while the Government congratulate themselves on splashing out, the agency itself is splashing around trying to cope&mdash;and facing cutbacks. In the financial year ending April 2007, roughly &pound;15 million was trimmed from its flood risk management budget. That cannot be good. The agency may seem to be getting more money but it is expected to do an awful lot more and to take more responsibility for flooding.</p>
	<p pid="c.218.1/2">The sums just do not add up. For example, the agency was planning a costly flood defence improvement scheme for parts of my constituency and for high-risk areas all the way up the Bristol channel from the Parrett, including the seats of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> and of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1924" name="John Penrose">the Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose)</phrase>, who could not make it today. The agency allocated &pound;25 million for the project, which was scheduled for completion next year, but then a big slice of the work was put on hold, the official explanation for which reads:</p>
	<p pid="c.218.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The Agency at a national level has decided to delay the works until the outcome of the Severn Estuary Strategy. This needs to be completed before local schemes can be implemented. We are doing our best to make the works go ahead and our commitment is still there to protect residents. But we do not know when the Severn Estuary Strategy will be completed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.218.1/4">Well of course not&mdash;nobody does, not even the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="c.218.1/5">I shall provide the Minister with a couple of poignant examples from my area. The cliff next to a hotel run by Mr. Simon Storm, a constituent of mine, from just outside Minehead, has given way&mdash;the baskets on top of the 15 ft of concrete were swept away in last year's storms. I have written to the Environment Agency, the local district council, the county council and Natural England, but the buck has been passed round and round. All he wants is the existing armour to be rebuilt. That is all; but we cannot get a decision from anybody.</p>
	<p pid="c.218.1/6">The Severn estuary strategy is not a strategy at all, but a device to allow anyone with the faintest interest in what happens to the Severn estuary to waste inordinate amounts of time and public money talking about it. It has become a waffle shop standing in the way of essential flood prevention. That goes all the way down the Parrett from Dorset, through Langport, to us. I confess that I am getting worried about the growing weight of waffle and the lack of action&mdash;there is more talk and less work.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05c.218.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" speakername="Oliver Letwin" colnum="218"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0009.htm#08020535000552">
	<p pid="c.218.2/1">Another problem is that sometimes the action is counter-productive. In my constituency, the Environment Agency has just designed a plan to alleviate flooding in one village, Charminster, but managed to produce a result that no one else has ever produced in that village&mdash;total unity among its people. They are united in their opposition to this scheme, for which I and they petitioned for many years, because it was not designed with local people. Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be helpful if, in addition to taking forward big programmes, the agency could liaise more closely with local people to ensure that its schemes work?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05c.219.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" speakername="Ian Liddell-Grainger" colnum="219"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0009.htm#08020535000553">
	<p pid="c.219.0/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is the point I am making to the Minister. It is not done in the right way and money is either moved or abused. As my right hon. Friend says, it cannot be right that a scheme is just put in place. I know that feeling: getting villages in flood plains to agree is almost impossible. So to get them united against a flood scheme is almost unique. I hope that the Minister takes that point on board.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/2">Is the Minister aware of the forthcoming Somerset flood fairs? Maybe my right hon. Friend has similar fairs in Dorset. They are not a celebration of getting soaked, although it sounds rather like that, but genuine events organised by those worthy masters of meaningless waffle&mdash;Somerset county council&mdash;dare I say it.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/3">I quote from my invitation:</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The Flooding Fairs form part of a continuing programme of warning and informing, encouraging resilience and community leadership&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/5">My right hon. Friend knows that that is how to bring villages together. And what is more they get a free lunch&mdash;water included.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/6">The whole thing is being organised for parish councillors so that they can &quot;view exhibits&quot;&mdash;as it says in the blurb&mdash;which means that entrepreneurs eager to sell inflatable boats, sandbags, mops, buckets and wind-up torches will also be present and ready to extract your money. I am not joking. I have no doubt that some people will find such events useful&mdash;good for them, but maybe they ought to get out more. We have known since Caesar that there is a problem, but they have only just worked it out. Most of us, especially in Somerset, know that flood fairs are a waste of money&mdash;another example of village unity. We are aware of the dangers of floodwater and climate change, but the poor old over-worked Environment Agency is being dragged along to give briefings, when it has better things to do with its time.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/7">Meanwhile, another bunch of publicly funded wafflers are also hard at it conducting yet another pointless consultation exercise. I shall give the Minister the background to this one. From Hartland Point&mdash;in the constituency of my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)</phrase>&mdash;on the north coast of Devon, through my constituency, to Weston-super-Mare, the men with clipboards and sharpened pencils will soon be coming our way to seek our views on flooding. Who is paying for it? Neddy Scag, that is who. Neddy Scag is actually the North Devon and Somerset Coastal Authorities Group, or NDASCAG for short&mdash;a tongue twister if ever I came across one. It is, believe it or not, one of 17 voluntary regional coastal defence groups covering the English and Welsh coastlines. I have no problem with that, but they are all engaged in drawing up flood maps and flood plans, and I thought that that was the Environment Agency's job. Together, the collection includes representatives of 105 maritime district councils, English Nature, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the National Assembly for Wales and the already overworked and under-funded Environment Agency. All the chairmen of those unnecessary talking shops get together at yet another waffly forum, the Coastal Defence Forum. Why do we need it? We know the problem. I hope that hon. Members, if they care to, will ask questions of the Minister outside this place to find out what is happening in their constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/8">Anyway, back to Neddy Scag. The group is headed by my great friend and admirer, Humphrey Temperley, whom I have had occasion to mention more than once in this place before. He has made a career out of flooding. If ever he should sit in another place, Baron H2O would be a suitable title. Humphrey is wet&mdash;irredeemably wet. He gurgles when he speaks and squelches when he walks, and he is still chair of the Wessex Regional Flood Defence Committee, or &quot;Werfduck&quot; for short. For that role alone, he rakes in &pound;20,000 a year&mdash;&quot;nice work if you can get it,&quot; as Temperley would say.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/9">Mr. Temperley's philosophy is to immerse himself in waffle. We have a cruel rhyme down in my constituency, which goes, &quot;Humphrey couldn't get his bum free,&quot; because Mr. T. relishes sit-down meetings. He used to be a county councillor, but having been kicked out of Somerset county council, he has moved across the border on to Devon county council, where he gets another bung. He also chairs the Corporate Forum for National Parks, the Exmoor Consultative Forum, the England Forestry Forum, and the regional development agency's rural policy group. He is a quango man to his socks&mdash;and wellies.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/10">I shall refer to Mr. Temperley's website, because the tireless waffler has even bigger ambitions. He now wants to be&mdash;hold your breath, you'll need a snorkel for this one&mdash;a Liberal Democrat Member of the European Parliament. The water rises, the plot thickens and the mud goes down the wellies. Apparently, he is very good in 25 different languages, or as they say in Bideford where he lives, &quot;Merde&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/11">Much of that waffling does not concern me; &quot;I'm not bovvered.&quot; If Humphrey wants to waffle, let him waffle; if he wants to bully, let him bully. But why do we have to pay for another consultation when we know the answer, the Minister knows the answer and the Environment Agency knows the answer? Give us a break and let us get on with the job, because when it comes to flooding, I simply cannot see the point of having so many groups. Why do people like Humphrey want the groups? Why are they so terrified about making decisions that they have to consult on everything?</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/12">Sir Michael Pitt's interim report is out for consultation, and it has encouraged people like Mr. Temperley to do more surveys, but they all cost money and do not tell us anything we do not know. Julius Caesar could have told us. They just waste the time of the Environment Agency, which is where the flooding buck really stops. Sir Michael Pitt, the National Audit Office and the insurance industry have all come to the same grim conclusion: we need a joined-up national plan. I plead for sanity&mdash;no more, no less. More cash for the agency would be nice, and less waffle from factions far and wide would be better.</p>
	<p pid="c.219.0/13">Floods will happen, we know that, and we cannot change climate change. But we can mount a defence. We can make the decisions now without the paperwork, waffle and, dare I say it, inconsistencies. We cannot soak up the floods with waste reports from bodies that keep duplicating research. Ultimately, the decisions that we should make on behalf of our constituents and the nation will not be made, because the paperwork is causing the haemorrhage in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="c.221.0/1">Miss Begg, it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship in this debate about flooding, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" name="Ian Liddell-Grainger">the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger)</phrase> on securing it. I have always found him to be a Member who raises such points on behalf of his constituents in a non-partisan way, and today, he has made some valid points. I shall try to answer his questions, and I shall agree where I agree, and disagree where I disagree. If he wants to discuss specifically the issues that Mr. Storm, the hotelier from Minehead, raised, and if I can cut through the waffle, to use the hon. Gentleman's words, for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase>, who represents the village of Charminster, I shall do so. The hotel trade in that part of the country is very important, and the hon. Member for Bridgwater raised not a trivial but a very important matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.221.0/2">I respect the hon. Gentleman's knowledge of the issue. I know from my dealings in this job over the past few months that he is intimately involved in such issues, and as he rightly said, the geography of his constituency has coped with them for many hundreds of years. He also recognised and made the point that I want to make: climate change will make matters worse, even if we secure the international agreements that we, all of us, want. From the damage that has already been done, we know that the situation will get worse, and we must never forget that. However, we are discussing adaptation, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for his praise of the Environment Agency staff on their behalf. It is an agency, not a Department, and its staff do not often have a voice, so I am grateful on their behalf to hear his words.</p>
	<p pid="c.221.0/3">Sir Michael Pitt's interim report, which was published before Christmas, did not get as much attention as I anticipated and hoped. Sir Michael is one of the country's best people in that field. His experience as a civil engineer and in dealing with politicians is, if not unsurpassed, certainly up there with the best, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for his remarks on that subject, too.</p>
	<p pid="c.221.0/4">We have debated previously the &pound;15 million flood-risk management budget cut. My only defence is that it was a revenue cut, not a capital cut, but it is of course a serious issue. It resulted from financial pressures on the Department owing to animal welfare problems, and I can with confidence say that the revenue and capital budgets for the Environment Agency are being increased, although I shall not crow about it, because the difficult question for me, or indeed anybody in my position, is how much is enough.</p>
	<p pid="c.221.0/5">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of Mr. Temperley. I do not wish to bring party politics into the debate, but the hon. Gentleman did not tell us which party Mr. Temperley had represented at county level. Does the hon. Gentleman wish to enlighten us?</p>

	<p pid="c.222.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for clarifying that point. His central question, which he asked with some frustration, was, &quot;Can we please have a joined-up national plan?&quot; The answer is a resounding yes. That plan is my precise objective, and I shall briefly outline its context.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.1/2">We face increasing numbers of flood situations. Most recently, two weeks ago, the actual flooding was less than we had feared, but it was a very serious situation, with about 15 severe warnings in place. The defences worked, and all of us were pleased, not least hon. Members representing constituents who were most affected. To be flooded once is dreadful, but to be flooded twice, or repeatedly, must be awful, and I have visited many people who have suffered in that way. The tidal surge on the east coast in November 2007 was, again, not as bad as feared, but had it over-topped the defences, it would have been very serious. It was not a lucky escape, because the defences held, but the situation caused great concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.1/3">What changes are we putting in place to improve the management of flood risk, including reducing the risk of flooding; increasing the preparedness of communities, business and areas; and improving warning systems, and emergency responses should the worst occur? The strategy was put in place before last summer's events&mdash;I am not crowing about that, because my immediate reaction to the Pitt interim review was to accept all 15 recommendations. I think that the official Opposition and the hon. Gentleman supported that approach. We had previously published our cross-Government strategy, &quot;Making Space for Water&quot;, and we now have the Pitt review.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.1/4">To answer the hon. Gentleman's question, we will clarify and improve the management of risk nationally by giving the Environment Agency an overview of all forms of flooding. At the moment, coastal flooding and river flooding are its responsibility, and it is important that we bring surface water flooding into that. As the hon. Gentleman knows, flooding is never as simple as just rivers overflowing or surface water flooding; it is a combination of both. As the right hon. Member for West Dorset said in relation to villages in his constituency, the interactions between flood areas are important.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.1/5">I have announced the detailed form that the Environment Agency's new role will take on the coast, and I am considering the form that it should take inland. As with the coastal overview role, the inland changes will be informed by consultation&mdash;but not too much consultation, because I have to get my plan in place. Both inland and on the coast, the Environment Agency will continue to work in partnership with local authorities and the water companies, and with internal drainage boards and other authorities in some areas, as part of its long-term planning and risk management.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.1/6">Part of the challenge of putting together the national plan is to try to have better prediction of flood risks from surface water. It is a complicated matter and I take the view, which I am sure is shared across the Chamber, that the best is the enemy of the good, but we have our best scientists, including the Met Office, working on maps of flood risks from surface water. We also have 15 pilot projects, as one would expect, to help identify improvements in surface water drainage. We shall be making a range of announcements on how to manage surface water drainage in the latest leg of the strategy, which will be published shortly. Some of the questions asked by the hon. Member for Bridgwater will be answered. I cannot predict the local allocation of funding, because it is a matter for the Environment Agency, but I think that he will enjoy his breakfast next week.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.1/7">In addition, we aim to encourage better resilience and resistance of buildings and emergency infrastructure&mdash;a point that hon. Members across the House have made. I see my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> present. He made that point to me when I was in his constituency. We have a &pound;500,000 pilot project with local authorities in six areas, exploring the feasibility of providing some form of financial assistance to households in areas where community defences cannot be justified to make their homes more flood-resilient. As one would expect, we are also working with the insurance industry to consider ways to encourage the public to make greater use of flood resilience.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.1/8">As I have said, I do not wish to crow about the funding, but we have increased it significantly. The balance between climate change mitigation and adaptation is important, but we have to take decisions to improve flood defences. With the Environment Agency, we have a programme to develop a long-term investment strategy&mdash;a national plan that can be put in place over a number of years so that the public and Members know the plan for their areas and can see the timetable for it. I am considering a 20-year timetable overall, but that is not to say that we have to wait 20 years; we are working on it now.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.1/9">Current spending levels for flooding and coastal erosion are some &pound;600 million, which is double the amount 10 years ago. I pick that time at random and for non-partisan reasons, but it is a fact, and facts are stubborn things. It will increase further to a minimum of &pound;650 million next financial year, &pound;700 million in 2009-10 and &pound;800 million in 2010-11. Before the summer floods, the Association of British Insurers, a much respected body, called for capital expenditure of &pound;750 million. Of course, the question is how much is enough. I cannot look the constituents of the hon. Member for Bridgwater in the eye if they have been flooded and say, &quot;I have spent enough money&quot;&mdash;I accept that&mdash;but I am responding to his call to ensure that there is a joined-up national plan.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.1/10">I shall continue properly to appraise and prioritise that public investment of &pound;800 million to ensure that there is maximum benefit. I recognise that the criteria by which the money is allocated is a highly contentious, highly charged political decision, which is why the balance between consultation and waffle, as the hon. Gentleman put it, is important. However, we do have the new criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.222.1/11">On the local allocation, the Environment Agency has published indicative allowances. Of course, it has been waiting for the comprehensive spending review, and it is not for me to determine the exact local allocations, but I hope that when the figures are published in the next few days, the hon. Gentleman will be able to return to his constituents with some satisfaction and say that he has pushed the Government in the direction in which he wishes us to go. I am sure that it will not be far enough for him, but I respect the seriousness of the matter that he has raised.</p>

	<p pid="c.224.0/1">As I have said, I welcome everything that the Environment Agency does. I accept that there will never be enough money. The worry is the money that is spent badly, not the money that is spent well. I cannot fault the defence schemes that the Minister and the Government have put in place. They are extremely good and doing what we ask; there are new sluices, new rhines are being dug out and so on. My point is that the Government should not spend money unnecessarily. We know the problem. Do not ask us what the floods are; we know that they are rain and seepage. We know that they are water. We do not need to tell people that. We need a common-sense approach, which I will welcome when the money comes through.</p>

	<p pid="c.224.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that serious point. Sometimes the experts are right, sometimes the public are right and normally it is something in between. It is particularly pertinent to the hon. Gentleman's constituency that alongside the flood risk management&mdash;the flood defences and the measures that we need to put in place, both concrete and policy-wise&mdash;there must be improvements to the quality of river water.</p>
	<p pid="c.224.1/2">The river basin plans, which I know the hon. Gentleman, as an environmentalist supports&mdash;just as a shot at a political point, I would be interested to know whether Mr. Temperley was as concerned about them&mdash;must be integrated with the flood defence plans. How to protect the natural environment and how to protect the public and agricultural land from flooding are difficult matters. My approach is to be open and transparent and to have national, joined-up plans for both so that Members of Parliament and the public can scrutinise them and say, &quot;Yes, we can go along with this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.224.1/3">My experience is that local people have a good feel for how flooding works in practice. Remember that I represent Saddleworth, Miss Begg, which is not on a flood plain. At least, if it is, we are all in trouble, particularly those of us in the area also represented by the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe)</phrase>, who is present. Local knowledge of how floods occur is important, and things work best where the Environment Agency and the public work well together.</p>
	<p pid="c.224.1/4">I thank the hon. Member for Bridgwater for raising the matter on behalf of his constituents. I hope that he can examine the plans and return to us in the weeks and months to come with some confidence, and say that we have in place a joined-up national plan that is to the satisfaction of his constituents.</p>

	<p pid="c.225.1/1">On the other side of the Atlantic, the American presidential election candidates are facing their super Tuesday. In my much more modest way, I am having a super Tuesday here. Any day on which the two Bradford City fans of the House are in the same place&mdash;I refer to my hon. Friend the Minister and me&mdash;is, indeed, a super day. I have managed to contribute to or be mentioned in four out of the five debates in Westminster Hall today, so it is a super Tuesday. Most importantly, it is almost three years to the day since we last had a debate on this subject. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1694" name="Andy Reed">the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed)</phrase>, who is present, made a contribution in that debate, as I hope he will today. That debate was in late January 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/2">There were many surprises in the political and sporting worlds in 2005. In the political world, I was slightly surprised to retain my seat in the general election, and famously borrowed champagne from my principal opponent to celebrate my re-election for the local newspaper. Much more importantly, there was the Ashes victory, which was a great surprise to many people. That was the last time that test match cricket appeared live on free-to-air television in our nation.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/3">Let me remind hon. Members of some of the moments of that summer. We lost the first test to Australia. In the second, we had the sight of Flintoff consoling a dejected Lee at the end of the match, which became the image of the summer. The third test was drawn and we won the fourth by three wickets. The fifth test was at the Oval, and the beauty of it was that everyone could watch Channel 4's marvellous coverage. The whole nation seemed to stop on that Monday; London was quiet and people were putting up TVs in schools so that the kids could watch it. People were trying to catch a sight of the telly in their workplaces. Every pensioner up and down the land who on that day had nothing else on, and anyone else who was at home could watch it free whether they were rich or poor. It truly was an event of national significance that we could all celebrate.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/4">What happened afterwards? There was the hangover: the realisation that it would be the last live cricket on our TV screens for some years, because cricket test matches were de-listed in the late 1990s. Despite the belief of Lord MacLaurin and the then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, now Lord Smith, who were both in important positions at that time, that the England and Wales Cricket Board would still put some live cricket on terrestrial TV, that gentlemen's agreement disappeared and BSkyB got exclusive rights to cricket.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/5">The Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport wrote a report, in response to which the Government promised a review of listed events, which they later clarified would take place in 2008-09. More and more people began to realise what we had lost. The TV viewing figures went down from more than 8 million watching the Ashes test series to an average of 250,000 to 300,000 on Sky. Australia had to tell us that we had got things wrong. Justin Langer, the great Australian batsman, came to Somerset, which is, incidentally, the county of the chairman who negotiated the TV deal, Giles Clarke. Langer said:</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Maybe I'm getting a bit philosophical but that's a major issue...After the impact of the Ashes I'm amazed that every kid in England isn't able to watch cricket...I have been in this country for four weeks now and I've seen maybe half an hour of cricket on TV&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.225.1/7">People realised what they had lost. They realised that the Australians will be able to watch the 2009 Ashes live in Sydney, if they stay up, because all domestic and international matches involving the Australian team are listed, but that we will not be able to watch it live in Bradford or Selby.</p>

	<p pid="c.226.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. Will he join me in congratulating the ECB on getting money and funding for grass-roots cricket, mostly from TV money? Does he agree with my personal view that a balance needs to be struck between finance coming into cricket and getting cricket to the widest possible audience on free-to-air TV, so that the next generation can come forward?</p>

	<p pid="c.226.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. It is all about balance. Every other major sport such as golf, rugby union, rugby league and football has that balance. They insist on having some live exposure on free-to-air TV. It is about live rights, is it not? Live matches really quicken the pulse. However, they also sell some of their rights to satellite or subscription TV for money to invest in grass-roots sport. He has made my central point for me: it is all about balance.</p>
	<p pid="c.226.1/2">I move on to the summer of 2007. There was a big debate in the ECB about whether it had got the issue right. The counties elected the new chairman. It was nine votes all on the first vote, and Mike Soper, who subsequently lost out to Giles Clarke, made the points that the hon. Gentleman just made. He said that cricket might have to give up a small amount of income&mdash;perhaps 5 or 10 per cent.&mdash;to get wide exposure, but that it would be worth it, as it might also gain from increased sponsorship because of the wider exposure. He narrowly lost out to Giles Clarke.</p>
	<p pid="c.226.1/3">I have always found Mr. Clarke to be the most amenable of men, but not everyone has said that. Mike Atherton rather criticised him in a profile, but Mr. Clarke was unrepentant. He said:</p>
	<p pid="c.226.1/4" class="indent">&quot;I know I was portrayed as a combination of Hitler and Attila the Hun for taking cricket off terrestrial television, but it was the right thing to do. Young sports fans in this day and age have access to Sky TV&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.226.1/5">He is perfectly in order to defend his position, but to get Sky this year costs &pound;438. Many children in Bradford, Selby, Loughborough and Reading will not be able to afford that and may not be inspired to take up the game.</p>

	<p pid="c.226.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. We have been working together on the issue for nine years. He has taken the lead, and I am always grateful to him for raising it. Does he think that cricket will eventually learn from what rugby union went through when it put the Six Nations on to Sky? The viewing figures were almost exactly the same as those he has quoted for cricket. They reduced to 200,000 or 300,000 and rugby union lost sponsorship because the exposure was not there. Rugby as a whole lost out because our English rugby heroes, who did not do so well on Saturday, were no longer out there being seen by millions of people. Instead, they were seen by a few hundred thousand. Getting the balance right requires a combination of the two.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05c.227.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" speakername="John Grogan" colnum="227"  time="013:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0010.htm#08020535000563">
	<p pid="c.227.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an incredibly important point. There are two ways forward. There are rumours that despite the Government's commitment to reviewing the list of events, the ECB is already negotiating its sports rights beyond 2010. I remind hon. Members that cricket is now settled until 2009. The 2009 Ashes series will definitely be exclusive to Sky, but what comes after that is up for debate. If the ECB comes up with another exclusive satellite TV contract without any cricket on live, free-to-air TV, there will be an outcry. I hope that Ministers will make that clear to both the ECB and Sky in private discussions. It would be opportune and prudent of the ECB to wait until after the Government's review of listed events before letting any more contracts. There is plenty of time to do that.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/2">There will be all sorts of debates about what could be added to, or taken from the list. Many cricket supporters realise that the world has moved on, but the Ashes series has national resonance. It meets all the criteria that were listed last time when Lord Gordon, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase>, Steve Cram and others reviewed the list of events. It is interesting that in making its case for de-listing, in the late 1990s, the ECB said that with televised audiences of cricket averaging only 2 million, it was difficult to argue that test matches command large TV audiences. How wrong it was when the Ashes came along.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/3">Listing the Ashes and, some have suggested, the Lords test, would be one way of compromising. I know that there is great disquiet at the Marylebone cricket club that one of our national games at the national headquarters is no longer seen live on TV. Those are some changes that could be made, but I do not want to concentrate only on cricket, because many other sports are covered by the listed events.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/4">Listed events, particularly coverage of the Scottish football team, are becoming a huge issue in Scotland. You will recall, Miss Begg&mdash;whether with pleasure or regret, I do not know&mdash;that England lost out to Croatia in the European football championship. Days before England lost and the nation was blighted, there was a similar tragedy for Scottish football fans.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/5">All of Scotland's away matches for World cup qualification were sold by IMG to Setanta Sports. I have nothing against Setanta&mdash;I am a subscriber myself&mdash;but, given that Sky covers the games in Scotland and Setanta has the games that are played away, that means that Scottish football team games will not be live to free-to-air viewers in Scotland for the foreseeable future. Indeed, the team will have to qualify&mdash;I gently suggest, Miss Begg, that that does not happen all that often&mdash;for the European championship or the World cup before the Scottish nation will be able to see it live on free-to-air television. That has created a furore in Scotland. The Scottish First Minister, Alex Salmond, has spoken about the issue and has referred it to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/6">Scotland is not alone. Wales and Northern Ireland are now in a similar position. Because ITV has done a deal to take over from the BBC next year in showing England's competitive matches, only in England will people be able to see their national football team play live on free-to-air television.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/7">That is not the case in many other European countries. Lists of national sporting events now exist throughout Europe under the television without frontiers directive. In Germany and France, all competitive games played by the national team must be on free-to-air TV or at least offered at a fair and reasonable price.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/8">In Ireland, when Sky bought the broadcasting rights for the national team one or two years ago, again, there was a national furore and a great debate. The Taoiseach intervened and the law was rewritten retrospectively to ensure that all national games involving the Republic of Ireland were live on free-to-air TV. Sky had to accept that, as did the other broadcasters.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/9">So change can occur. I gently say to Ministers that, in the run-up to the general election, this is a contentious issue not just among cricket fans but among football fans, particularly in Scotland, and the Government need to react. If England gets the World cup in 2018, the England team obviously will not have to qualify, but it is unlikely that the qualifying games of any other home nation team will be available on live free-to-air TV.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/10">I have just a few more general points to make. I would suggest one other thing that could be added to the list of protected events. Things may come off the list&mdash;they have in the past. For example, in the 1990s, the Commonwealth games and the boat race came off the list. The last day of the Ryder cup has a national resonance and should be added&mdash;perhaps not the whole of the Ryder cup but the last day.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/11">The sports market has changed dramatically, for the better in many ways. Specialist sports fans can now watch the sports that they love on Sky. Setanta's coming into the market added much-needed competition. Indeed, Ofcom the regulator is looking at the pay TV market generally to see whether increased competition can be brought into it. Sky and Setanta do a marvellous job, but I still support the principle of listed events, which goes back to the 1950s, when the BBC and ITV drew up a list of events that they would not try to broadcast exclusively. Then the Conservative Government maintained the list and, with the rise of cable TV, established the principle that the great national Crown jewels of sport should not be broadcast on pay TV. In 1996, there was a vote in the Lords&mdash;actually, a rebellion against the Government&mdash;that added the words &quot;subscription TV&quot;. That was essential to maintaining the list.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/12">Some people say, &quot;We are going digital in 2012, so there will be no need for the list.&quot; There will certainly be more channels, particularly those on freeview, that will meet the criteria that are necessary for protecting the Crown jewels: Parliament's insistence that 95 per cent. of the people must have access to channels that broadcast the Crown jewels. However, the fact that some people will not be able to afford subscription and pay TV will apply.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/13">In the last debate three years ago, I said, not in a politically partisan way but just as a reflection, that many of us stood on the slogan, &quot;For the many, not the few&quot;. Things such as the Olympics, the World cup and the Grand National should be for the many, not the few. I am pleased that there are Members from the two main parties in the Chamber, and I know that the issue excites passion across the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/14">In summary, the Government should get on with the review, which was promised for 2008-09. I would be more than delighted to chair it. I make that offer to the Minister, and I am sure that other hon. Members would be delighted to participate. The issue will, rightly, be fiercely fought. At the last review, for example, BSkyB vigorously opposed the listing concept. Some of the sports bodies themselves opposed the concept through the Central Council of Physical Recreation. I hope that they will reflect on that. Many of them get a lot of public money. If they are getting money from the Government, the Sports Council or the lottery, they should ensure that some of their product is available on live TV. The matter will be controversial, but the Government and Parliament must put their mind to it. It has resonance among the electorate.</p>
	<p pid="c.227.0/15">I was having dinner in Parliament last night, and who should be sitting next to me but the new Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, having dinner with Ed Richards, the boss of Ofcom. I would like to think that somewhere between the soup and the pudding&mdash;they did have pudding&mdash;the subject of the review and listed events came up. I very much hope that it did.</p>

	<p pid="c.229.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Miss Begg.</p>
	<p pid="c.229.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> on securing this debate. I can call him my friend: as he says, we are both Bradford City supporters, but there are many other things in which we have a common interest, including the fact that we represent Yorkshire seats. This is an important debate on an issue that is important to a significant proportion of society.</p>
	<p pid="c.229.0/3">My hon. Friend has proved to be a vociferous advocate for the ideology behind the listed events regime and worked hard to ensure that major sporting events such as the 2006 World cup were shown on free-to-air terrestrial television as a result of that regime. Most recently, he has been an ardent voice in respect of test match cricket, as shown by his prominent position in the keep cricket free campaign. It highlights his commitment to free-to-air sports coverage, and it is something on which he should be congratulated and about which he should be proud.</p>
	<p pid="c.229.0/4">I assure hon. Members that my hon. Friend's commitment is shared by the Government. This country's love of sport is embedded deeply in our national culture and identity. Sporting moments such as Bobby Moore lifting the World cup in 1966 and Bob Champion's fairytale victory on Aldaniti in the 1981 Grand National are part of our common sporting memory. I should just say to my hon. Friend that I left the Grand National weights lunch early to attend this debate, so I hope that he appreciates my commitment to it.</p>
	<p pid="c.229.0/5">We all know that millions of people want to see such events on their television sets. Families huddle together around their TVs, kicking every ball and jumping every fence. That personal involvement has made many sporting triumphs and, sadly, occasional failures&mdash;we will talk about England and Wales on Saturday with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1694" name="Andy Reed">the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed)</phrase>&mdash;into iconic moments in our national psyche. That is why it remains Government policy to ensure that the most important sporting events continue to be available to all television viewers.</p>

	<p pid="c.230.0/1">Before the Minister moves on, while I agree that sporting events on television are important to the national psyche, does he agree on their importance in providing role models and in motivating youngsters to participate in sport? Some of these great events are the biggest drivers of people who turn up at local sports clubs, and the national governing bodies use them as the driver to get people to participate in sport, not just sit on the couch.</p>

	<p pid="c.230.1/1">Of course, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who does a tremendous amount of work in the sporting arena to ensure that we increase participation, whether through the excellent facilities in his constituency or the work that he does across the range of volunteering. He is right: those people are role models and the inspiration for young people. Obviously, with our target to increase participation in sport by 2 million by 2012, such events can act as inspiration.</p>
	<p pid="c.230.1/2">The Government want the most important sporting events to continue to be made available to all television viewers, including those who cannot afford the cost of subscription television. There is a long tradition in this country of ensuring that everyone can have the opportunity to watch the key national sporting events on television, and we were instrumental in ensuring that that protection was secured at European level.</p>
	<p pid="c.230.1/3">The same can also be said for ensuring that ordinary fans have the opportunity to watch key sporting events live, which is why I have urged sports and ticket-resale merchants such as eBay to introduce strong voluntary arrangements to prevent ticket touts from pricing ordinary fans out of major events.</p>
	<p pid="c.230.1/4">We must also recognise, as my hon. Friend has, that broadcasting income can provide the bulk of a sport's revenue and be crucial to maintaining both an international standard and grass-roots involvement. We therefore need to balance the benefits of free television access with the benefits to the quality and active engagement in sport of broadcasting revenue. I think that that is the balance that my hon. Friend was talking about. That is why, as part of the last review of listed events in 1998, undertaken by my noble Friend Lord Smith of Finsbury, we set out, for the first time, detailed criteria on which the inclusion of an event on the list could be based.</p>
	<p pid="c.230.1/5">There are many different sports and sporting events that are very popular, and unfortunately the Government cannot list them all. That is because sport is a partisan topic. One man's cricket is another man's tiddlywinks and, no matter how hard we try, no list of sporting events will ever meet universal approval. The criteria, established after wide consultation, sought to balance the different interests. As a result, a listed event is one that is generally felt to have special national resonance, not just to be popular with fans of that sport. It should contain an element that serves to unite us as a nation and it should be a shared point on the national calendar, a moment when the country comes to a standstill, as my hon. Friend has said, and we watch, with bated breath, the action as it unfolds. In addition, the 1998 review extended the list of protected events, adding some events to a group A list, protecting live coverage, and introducing a group B list, protecting delayed or highlights coverage. That innovation facilitated a much wider list of protected events, especially for those sports which, because they take a long time, are difficult for mainstream channels to cover.</p>

	<p pid="c.231.0/1">I have listened carefully to the criteria that the Minister listed. May I press him on the basis of that list and on whether he personally agrees with me and other hon. Members present that the home Ashes series should be on that protected list, because it fulfils all the criteria?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05c.231.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="231"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0011.htm#08020535000568">
	<p pid="c.231.1/1">The hon. Gentleman tempts me, but I shall resist. I think that it is clearly something that should be considered, but I shall consider the entire discussion about such events. My natural instinct would be to agree with him, but I am sure that he will appreciate that I must deal with the process in the proper way.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/2">The hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Selby have a particular interest in cricket, and it is important to respond specifically on the issues that have been raised. As my hon. Friend said, at the time of the last review, cricket was a contentious issue. Before 1998, test matches involving England had full live coverage protected. That meant that full live coverage had to be offered to generally available free-to-air channels. However, as recommended by Lord Gordon's advisory group at the time of the last review, test match cricket was taken off the group A list of sporting events. It was placed, instead, on the newly created B list, which protects only secondary coverage&mdash;delayed coverage or highlights only.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/3">In making its recommendation, the advisory group stated that, although it believed that test matches possessed sufficient national resonance to merit some measure of protection, a test series played over 30 days could not be said to be a shared point on the national calendar. The advisory group also considered the practical difficulties faced by terrestrial broadcasters in scheduling tests in full without being unfair to viewers who do not take an interest in cricket, and it had to take account of the likely effect of continued listing on the finances of the sport. As my hon. Friend said, the then Secretary of State, now Lord Smith, was none the less able to agree with the then chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board that it would seek to retain a substantial amount of live free-to-air coverage of home test matches. As hon. Members will recall, unfortunately, when the broadcasting contract was last renewed, at a time when England's fortunes were not at their highest, there was less interest in scheduling live cricket and the ECB felt compelled to sell all the live rights to Sky.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/4">I do not dispute the fact that the viewing figures for test match cricket are down to about one sixth of the average during the last Channel 4 contract, and I do not dismiss the argument that televised cricket can have an impact on the participation of youngsters. Clearly a youngster watching the swashbuckling antics of a Freddie Flintoff or a Kevin Pietersen will be inspired&mdash;I mean, of course, their on-field antics. Youngsters will watch their heroes on television and will then want to grab a bat and a ball and go outside to emulate them. However, the deal that the England and Wales Cricket Board reached with Five to offer highlights for all major matches ensured that the programmes would be shown at peak time, between 7.15pm and 8pm. That is the time when most children, families and working parents can view cricket&mdash;something that was not always the case. Ofcom figures show that 90 per cent. of households with children are able to receive multi-channel television. Of those, 25 per cent. have digital terrestrial television and 65 per cent. have cable or satellite television.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/5">As for the impact on participation, the England and Wales Cricket Board has recently announced a 27 per cent. increase in participation in club and school cricket during 2006-07, with women's and girls' cricket recording the sharpest rise, of 45 per cent. The ECB survey, which sampled 424 focus clubs nationally, also showed a 22 per cent. rise in black and ethnic minority groups playing cricket, a 16 per cent. increase in volunteers and a 37 per cent. increase in school participation in years 5, 6 and 7. The ECB sees those figures as directly resulting from the investment in grass-roots cricket by the ECB since 2005. My hon. Friend will know that, perhaps coincidentally, on Monday the ECB also announced, as part of its new five-year strategy, a doubling of chance to shine funding for the enhancement of cricket in schools, amounting to a total of &pound;5 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/6">I have listened to the arguments of my hon. Friend, but I remain of the view that the decision taken in 1998 about the structure of the list and cricket's position had its merits. That view is shared by the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport in its report on broadcasting rights for cricket, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/7" class="indent">&quot;We have received no compelling evidence in support of cricket returning to Group A of the listed events. The potential damage that re-listing in Group A would do to cricket would be too big a risk to take; the vast sums of money poured into the sport and the achievements of the England teams in recent years would all be put in jeopardy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/8">That is something that we should not dismiss lightly, although I understand what my hon. Friend has said, and perhaps further discussion is needed. By chance, I shall be meeting the ECB immediately after the debate, so I shall be able to raise the matter. I am concerned that any re-listing would potentially mean cuts in investment programmes at all levels of the game, including grass-roots cricket. It could affect the national cricket centre and the England team.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/9">The crux of the debate is the timing of the next review of free-to-air sporting events. I of course understand the concerns expressed by those who are here today about the perceived delay in announcing the timetable for the review. In 2005, the then Secretary of State indicated that it was the Government's intention to review the list around 2008-09 because, at that time, 10 years after the last review, we would be in a stronger position to take account of changes in the broadcasting of sport and broadcasting in general, in the run-up to digital switchover. However, since that announcement, as my hon. Friend has said, the broadcasting environment has continued to evolve rapidly. With regard to sports broadcasting, there is now a greater proliferation of outlets for sports material and a change in audience attitudes towards paying for broadcast sports coverage. Of course, as we move towards a fully digital age, there will be increasing competition for sports rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/10">Within that context, we cannot ignore the fact that the listed events regime represents a significant intervention in the market for sports rights. For example, at European level, some international sports bodies are already challenging the extent of member states' lists because listing is perceived to depress the value of the rights. The Government have, therefore, decided to bring forward considerations of wider issues relating to public service broadcasting. Any decision on a review of the listed events arrangements will be made following the outcome of Ofcom's current review of public service broadcasting and when the convergence think tank's considerations are known. That will allow us to ensure that any decisions about the future of listed events will be made as part of a comprehensive overhaul of issues affecting the broadcasting sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/11">It is vital that any reflection on the importance to society of access to televised sport and of well funded sport on the field should take place in the right context. As today's debate has shown, the importance of sporting events to society is such that it is vital that we do not make a hasty decision, but get it right to meet the requirements that my hon. Friend has set out. The debate is an important one, and my hon. Friend made his points well. I look forward to continuing the discussion.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/12" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.231.1/13" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at <i>one minute to </i>Two o'clock.</p>
