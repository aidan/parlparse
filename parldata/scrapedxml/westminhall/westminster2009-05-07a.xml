<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-07a.137.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" colnum="137"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090507/halltext/90507h0001.htm#090507110000191">
	<p pid="a.137.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that constructive intervention. I shall address that point directly in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/2">I have focused on the progress we have made because it is important to have that as a platform, but equally, there are massive challenges ahead, and we have a long way to go before we can say that we have reversed the trend on AIDS. That is how I shall develop the rest of my opening remarks, and I shall try to articulate the measures we need to take and the scale of the challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/3">There are still more than 33 million people living with HIV, and despite progress in treatment, more than two thirds of those who need antiretrovirals still do not have access to them. For every two people who have been put on to treatment, there are five people newly infected with HIV. That is a shocking statistic. Every day, nearly 7,000 people are infected with HIV and nearly 6,000 die from AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/4">We have learned much about the epidemic and we know what interventions work best, yet access to AIDS services in many places remains totally unacceptable. For example, most prevention strategies are accessible to fewer than one in five people who could benefit from them, and that number is even lower for marginalised groups, such as drug users and men who have sex with men. In some countries, AIDS has reversed decades of development progress towards better health, education and economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/5">The challenges remain most acute in Africa. More than 67 per cent. of all people with HIV live in sub-Saharan African and, in Africa, AIDS is becoming feminised, because it increasingly affects women more than men. In sub-Saharan Africa, almost 61 per cent. of people living with HIV in 2007 were women. However, what concerns us today is the terrible disproportionate impact on children, which is the point that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> often makes.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/6">In response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>, I want to mention two tangible areas where we need real change. First, children&mdash;especially those under one&mdash;are among those who are most vulnerable to HIV and AIDS, yet they are among the least well served. Mother-to-child transmission is the primary cause of paediatric AIDS, which occurs during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding. We know that effective interventions to stop mother-to-child transmission are available and yet only 34 per cent. of women have access to those prevention services. Around 370,000 children are estimated to have become infected in 2007 alone and, without early treatment, around 50 per cent. of HIV positive children will die by their second birthday. What a waste of human potential! Once they are born positive, children who receive early treatment have much better survival rates, but diagnosis of HIV in children remains complex and costly. More needs to be done to get children diagnosed and treated early.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/7">A second major challenge is that children suffer in a significant way because AIDS takes away their parents. In 2007, an estimated 15 million children had lost one or both parents to AIDS. Some 11.6 million of those children live in sub-Saharan Africa and, in some parts of Africa, more than 25 per cent. of children have been orphaned. UNICEF estimates that, on average, only 12 per cent. of households in which orphans and vulnerable children live are getting external assistance, because of the vast numbers involved and the funding bottlenecks. Those children are, of course, vulnerable to stigma, discrimination, poverty and abuse, and they are at risk of dropping out of school. In turn, that makes them more at risk of HIV infection, poor reproductive health and, for girls, early and often unwanted pregnancy; and so the cycle of despair continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/8">In the face of those challenges, the Government's commitment to universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care and support remains unwavering. Last June, we renewed our pledge with the publication of a new UK Government strategy, &quot;Achieving Universal Access&quot;, which sets out our vision of how to deliver that. Again, I can assure hon. Members that our commitment is unequivocal. Through working with others, we will intensify prevention efforts that have proven to be effective, such as mother-to-child transmission, and help with family planning, safe abortion and harm reduction. We will also pursue prevention efforts among adolescents and young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/9">Over the next seven years, we will work with others to bring down the cost of treatment so that more people have access to life-saving drugs. The goal is that everyone living with HIV ultimately gets the treatment that they need. We will help our partners to build stronger health services, which are key to providing effective services now and in the future, and we will work in all sectors&mdash;not just in health&mdash;to address comprehensively the needs of those affected. We are committed to supporting countries and to &quot;know their epidemics&quot; by investing in research, building the evidence base and helping to focus resources where they are most needed and will make the greatest impact. We will continue to champion sexual and reproductive health and rights, and fight the feminisation of the AIDS pandemic. The fresh approach to family planning and the prevention of unsafe abortion that has been signalled by the current US Administration will allow us to work collaboratively in areas that we have not been able to do so before. We have a moment of opportunity, and it is vital that we seize it.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/10">Of course, rhetoric and policy must be backed up by money and other commitments. We are proud to be the second largest bilateral funder in the world of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. We provided &pound;1.5 billion between 2005-06 and 2007-08. More broadly, we will spend &pound;6 billion up to 2015 to improve health outcomes in the developing world. That is in addition to the &pound;1 billion we are giving to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which will provide that organisation with the long-term, predictable funding up to 2015 that is so necessary. In addition, we will also spend more than &pound;200 million to support social protection programmes over the next three years, which will provide greater coverage and more predictable funding for households and children affected by AIDS. Our focus will be on working with Governments and civil society in eight African countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/11">Of course, the UK has led on other interventions, through which we want to begin to achieve transformation, which is so crucial. This point, in a sense, speaks directly to the hon. Gentleman's question about the scale of the challenge and how much progress we still have to make. Our Prime Minister has led the way on finding innovative ways of triggering new resources to put into health. In addition to the resources that donors spend and the resources that we expect functioning states to spend, money is spent through non-governmental organisations. Therefore the work of the high-level innovative task force is crucial in considering the range of new financial instruments needed to close the funding gap that we know exists for meeting our ambitions contained in the health MDGs. Towards the end of the year, we hope that there will be an international settlement from which we can pursue instruments globally to find innovative finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.1/12">This country has also led the way in developing international health partnerships. They relate to the concept that any country that, in the end, wants to meet its population's health needs, has to have a functioning health care system. In states where there is not a functioning Government, of course, we need to spend money on health centres and hospitals, and on getting health to the most remote and deprived communities. In the end, long-term change depends on having a national health system that can pay, recruit and train doctors, nurses, midwifes and support staff, and that can ensure that the necessary supplies of drugs and medication reach every section of society. The model for IHP is that, where countries do not have functioning health systems, we, as an international community, should be incentivising them to develop comprehensive and universal health systems, which offer universal access. We are making progress in that respect. I can provide the hon. Gentleman with a list of countries that have signed up if he wants me to; perhaps I can give it to him at the end of the debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that detailed question. I assure her that the answer will be forthcoming, but it is likely to be in writing. I will ensure that she is provided with some detail following the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/2">We seek to achieve progress through our support for country-led programmes that reach the most vulnerable children, and through our work to ensure a robust evidence base to guide global actions and effective global leadership. At country level, we will ensure that children are reflected in health, education and social protection plans. The strategy commits us to spending &pound;200 million on social protection programmes, and to working in at least eight African countries to develop social protection policies and programmes that provide effective, predictable support for the most vulnerable households.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/3">We are focusing on the most affected countries: Zimbabwe, Kenya, Zambia, Malawi, South Africa, Angola, Botswana, Ghana and Rwanda. There has been a major focus in Parliament on the tragedy in Zimbabwe, but there may now be a glimmer of hope with the new Government. We still want to focus on the need for major reform in that country and progress on the economy and human rights, but there is a glimmer of hope.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/4">Funding must reach the most vulnerable communities and children. For example, in Swaziland, the Department for International Development supports through UNICEF 665 neighbourhood care points, which support more than 35,000 vulnerable children living in the community. In Zimbabwe, we have supported more than 200,000 children through a multi-donor programme of support implemented through more than 100 community-based organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/5">We are ensuring that increased spending is supported by good evidence. We have provided funding to the Joint Learning Initiative on Children and HIV/AIDS, and the Inter-Agency Task Team on Children and AIDS, to inform global actions. This work has informed our response on social protection for AIDS-affected households and children. Social protection, including cash transfers, has been shown to be effective in reaching and strengthening families affected by HIV and AIDS. Social protection can vastly increase the number of AIDS-affected households getting predictable assistance. It helps keep families together and protects both children and their vulnerable carers. That is why, in Malawi, DFID is supporting social protection policy development and the design of a national programme and social protection legal framework. DFID is also strengthening the department responsible for poverty and social protection, which is specifically delivering services in that country to vulnerable children.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/6">We need an effective multilateral response and global co-ordination. Our support for UNICEF is crucial in that respect. In 2004, DFID supported the development and implementation of UNICEF's framework for the protection, care and support of orphans and vulnerable children living in a world with HIV and AIDS, which sets out a global action plan specifically for orphans and vulnerable children. We are providing &pound;5 million to UNICEF's Unite for Children, Unite Against AIDS campaign. The biennial global partners forum on children affected by AIDS, which was held in Dublin in October last year, presented the most up-to-date evidence available on how best to meet the needs of orphans and vulnerable children. Based on the information presented at that forum, we are convinced that our policies and programmes are strongly support by current evidence and emerging global best practice. Over the next seven years, we will continue to measure the impact of our programmes and policies on the lives of the most vulnerable children, and to ensure that global policies for children affected by AIDS continue to be informed by lessons and best practice from DFID-funded programmes and elsewhere at country level.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.1/7">We accept that the situation remains critical. We believe that all the world's children, wherever they live, deserve access to the services they need, and that we have a moral responsibility to do whatever we can to bring that about. I welcome Parliament's devoting such a significant chunk of time to this debate today, which will not only enable us to reiterate our collective commitment to the fight against AIDS, but will shine a light on this issue in an effort to ensure that the world does not take its eye off an incredibly important goal for the future of the poorest people in the world.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-07a.143.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" speakername="Sally Keeble" colnum="143"  time="015:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090507/halltext/90507h0002.htm#090507110000198">
	<p pid="a.143.0/1">I am sorry that I have to leave after speaking, as I mentioned in my note to you, Sir Nicholas. I have a long-standing meeting with somebody that I have already had to rearrange once.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/2">I welcome this debate. The United Kingdom Government play an important role in international development. I welcome the fact that the needs of HIV/AIDS orphans have been recognised. However, it is important to be hard-headed in looking at what is happening to the HIV/AIDS orphans on the ground. Since 2004, I have made that the one bit of international development work that I still deal with, so that I can focus some attention on it. I set up a charity to focus specifically on work with HIV/AIDS orphans. I have to say that, although I fully recognise the UK Government's input, the reality for a lot of orphans is dire and the numbers are increasing. In that sense, the position is getting very much worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/3">It is important, when looking at what the solutions might be, to recognise the severity of the problems facing those children. It is also important to recognise that the solutions are not just in the area of health policy or development policy, but are to do with children's policy. Those children's needs are as complex and varied as those of children anywhere in the world. If we are going to make it possible for those children to take their place in the adult world in future, we have to ensure that we meet all their needs, not just their health needs&mdash;and not just through a development prism.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/4">I want to deal specifically with the needs of the HIV orphans in sub-Saharan Africa, because I have looked at that area in particular. The countries that I have looked closely at, although I am familiar with others, are Zimbabwe, Kenya and Tanzania. I am aware of South Africa, but that is obviously in a slightly different category.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/5">We must recognise that there has always been a problem in relation to orphans in Africa. But it is about working out why the pressures of HIV/AIDS make so much difference. The figures for Kenya show that between 1985 and 2008 the total number of orphans increased from 1,251,878 to 1,852,139. Hon. Members might think that, although that is a substantial increase of over 30 per cent., it is not out of control. But I shall break those figures down and just look at the dual-orphaned, not just at maternal or paternal orphans. The number of AIDS orphans has increased from zero in 1985 to just over 326,000 in 2008 and the number of non-AIDS orphans has decreased dramatically, from just over 240,000 to almost 95,000. So there has been a complete cross-over in children's well-being, in terms of having parents. As we all know from our experience in this country, it is best for a child to have two parents&mdash;preferably a mother, I hasten to say, as all colleagues in the Chamber are male. Certainly, the parents are the prime advocates for the child and they are the child's main defence against all life's disasters. In normal times, if it had not been for HIV/AIDS, through the falling off of the number of orphans we would have seen real improvements in the well-being of children in Kenya. Instead, there is more vulnerability, because of the impact of HIV/AIDS on the parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/6">Parents' illness is also an issue. The figures for Kenya are just for children who are orphans, but there are, in addition, children who look after sick parents for a long time and, in the process, suffer from poverty and from staying out of school and from all the other things that affect children with a sick parent. I met one little girl in Kenya whose mother, a lone parent, had brought her into an emergency shelter before dying. The little girl, who had been looking after her mother, was stick thin&mdash;she was skin and bones&mdash;in a country that should at least be able to feed its children. She had not been to school and had no proper clothes. So, although she had a parent and was not a complete orphan until her mother's death, her chances in life were massively compromised by her mother's poor health. Ironically, in purely material terms she was probably better off in the emergency centre than she had been while her mother was alive, because at least she got food and medicine and had a secure roof over her head at night.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/7">Looking at the numbers, we have to accept that the position is, perhaps, more complex than the simple headline figures sometimes warrant, scandalous as the overall number of orphans is. Enormous improvements have been made in the treatment of adults. That is visible in sub-Saharan Africa, where the levels of illness and the obvious signs of HIV/AIDS are not as they were some years ago. None the less, the numbers of orphans continue to increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/8">This morning I spoke to a person in Tanzania who runs a big centre for HIV/AIDS care and supports a lot of orphans in the community. It supports a network of children living in foster homes or with parents who are ill. The person I spoke to told me of the dramatic increase that the centre had seen in the number of orphans, which had risen from 5,000 to 7,000 in one year. By this September&mdash;just a few months from now&mdash;staff expect to be supporting 9,000 orphans. The orphanage is a big organisation, which is run by a British person, but it does not get a penny piece from the UK Government. All its funding comes from the US&mdash;it has never been able to access UK funding. There are therefore some real issues about ensuring that people know how, when and where to access UK funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/9">We also need to look at the complexity of children's needs. My hon. Friend the Minister was right to spell out the work that has gone into supporting health systems, and he was right about the need to ensure that money was well spent and sustainable. He also mentioned the very real problems of paediatric formulae, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> noted the particular problem of requiring a range of such formulae to provide proper care for children. As he said, such things are not always particularly commercially attractive to companies, so we need to give some real thought to how we can tackle the issue. My hon. Friend also noted the problems involved in ensuring that women do not pass the virus on to their children. Baragwanath hospital, in Soweto, has a sophisticated health care system, but things are quite different when women are giving birth in the slums. That is one of the real challenges that we need to tackle.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/10">In addition to such obvious health system issues, a range of other issues affect children, although I will deal with only some of them, because I would be here all afternoon otherwise. One major issue is children's rights. For example, where both parents die, the children may be left in a hut, and the relatives may come for the hut. In one case that I saw, the hut was starting to break down and there was no repair system in place. In another instance, the husband had died, the mother was nearly dead, the granny was looking after the children and some rustlers came and stole the cattle. There are therefore real issues about children's property rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/11">There is also an issue about children having all their certification. As my hon. Friend will know, cash transfer payments often depend on the children's having birth certificates. Non-governmental organisations have done some interesting work to ensure that children have the certification that they need to get support and cash transfer payments. Those are all important issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/12">Another important issue is children's psychosocial needs. Compared with setting up hospitals and providing medicines, meeting children's psychosocial needs may seem like a secondary issue. As we all know from our experience in the UK, however, it is important to equip children for adulthood and to ensure that they can function as adults and do not carry too much excess baggage of grief from their childhood. I saw some interesting work by faith-based organisations in Zimbabwe, which got children to do memory books about their families and to keep pictures of them. As the children passed from being eight or nine-year-olds into adulthood, they had something to hold on to from happier days when their parents were around, and they could deal with their grief.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/13">The importance of that was brought home to me most as a result of a meeting that I had with a little girl. I will talk about her a bit more at the end. I had previously met her and her family and I had taken a picture of them all to use in things such as leaflets. The following year, I found out that her mother had died, the baby had died, one daughter had been taken away by relatives, the little boy had gone somewhere else and the little girl, who was very ill, had ended up in a shelter. When I met her, I happened still to have the picture of her with her family so I gave it to her. By the end of the day, I had to get a second copy because she had run around with it and worn it out completely. She had nothing to remember her family by except for that picture. That really brought it home to me that we have to meet the psychosocial needs of orphans&mdash;whether in Africa or the UK. It is not about giving a child a pill but about putting proper care provisions in place so that the child can grow and develop.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/14">Obviously, changes have taken place over time, and the biggest change that I have seen relates to food. We could transform the lives of quite a lot of children if, after dealing with the health care system, we found money to feed them. There is not much in the way of food in the store cupboards of many of the projects that support children. There are real issues about who does and does not get access to World Food Programme food and what type of food they get. One of the main things that projects that support orphans do is feed them, but those which feed small babies have no infant formula. There are all kinds of debates about infant formula, but it is not very clever to give a little baby powdered skimmed milk. It should not be beyond the wit of some of us to sort out the provision of something appropriately nutritious for babies whose mothers have died or cannot feed them, perhaps for nutritional reasons. We should be able to do something where babies have no one else to breastfeed them and need better quality food, and it is about the number of calories.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/15">One of the things that most struck me the last time I went to the orphanage outside Nairobi was that food had become chronically expensive. For example, the amount of rice that the children were eating had fallen because it was too expensive, so the variety and quality of their diets had been severely curtailed. Similarly, the amount of meat that they were eating was going down. The orphanage spent about &pound;2.10 a week on food per child, and that met only their basic needs. Again, that is in a country that should have a plentiful supply of food.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/16">There are also issues of governance. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister is very concerned about governance, and the Government are doing a great deal of work on it with developing country Governments. However, there are issues relating to services for children in those countries, just as there are problems with such services in this country. The departments that deal with children tend not to be very important in the bureaucratic hierarchy, so they cannot get much done. Often, those who deal with these issues are in a sub-section of a department that is tucked away somewhere at the bottom of the heap. There is a real need to ensure that departments that provide services for children can deliver.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/17">Let me give a simple example. DFID has bought a large number of malaria nets, which are supposed to be supplied free to young children in malarial areas. The orphanage that I mentioned earlier is in a malarial area just outside Nairobi. The couriers responsible for delivering our malaria nets took them to the district commissioner's office. However, no malaria nets reached the orphanage&mdash;I was told that they had simply ended up in the local market. It is completely wrong that malaria nets paid for by British taxpayers and intended for orphans should not be delivered to orphanages. If there had been strong advocacy from children's services departments to make sure that the malaria nets did not go off into the general distribution but went to the identified centres where the children were living, perhaps those children would have got the malaria nets that could save their lives. Big issues arise from that incident, as they do in relation to other areas of children's services. If the right kind of attention were given to children's services there would also be more training for social workers. A professor in Nairobi is trying to get that issue raised, and to obtain recognition of the need for more trained social workers to make sure that children's services are delivered properly. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be sympathetic to the idea of supporting that work.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/18">My hon. Friend did not speak about the cash transfers that were being considered to replace the &pound;150 million that was earmarked over three years. There have been experiments with cash transfers and in some places&mdash;largely in South Africa, which has more sophisticated financial systems&mdash;they have proved quite successful. However, I hope that, if the main financial support for HIV/AIDS orphans is to be given through a system of cash transfers, there will be clarity about who gets the money and what they get it for, and careful follow-up. If cash transfers are to be given to a family to look after orphans it is important that the money should subsidise the family income generally, and preferably should help the orphans, rather than that it should go to perhaps more privileged family members who do not need so much support. It is also important that if the money is supposed to go to the poorest 10 per cent. of people, as I think it is in some areas, there should be clarity about that, so that it goes to those poor people intact and to good effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/19">I hope that my hon. Friend will carefully consider the very good role of some UK companies and their corporate and social responsibility policies, which have provided community support for some orphans. Business Action for Africa has done a lot of thinking in this area, and has co-ordinated the work of quite a number of companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/20">Finally, perhaps I may give an account of the life of one of the children we are concerned about. It is the little girl whom I met with her mother, who was HIV-positive and a single parent. The little girl&mdash;Beatrice&mdash;had three siblings; there was an older girl, a brother and a baby called Tabitha. The baby was being spoon fed with powdered skimmed milk made up with water that was given by an NGO; her mother chose not to breastfeed because she thought she might pass on HIV to the baby. The mother was on antiretrovirals, so it was thought that it would be possible to stabilise the family, but unfortunately the mother and baby died. The older girl was of reasonable working age and was quickly taken off by family members up-country to work on a farm. The siblings lost touch with her completely. The little boy, who was thought to be HIV-positive, was put in a children's home.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.0/21">The next time I saw Beatrice she was in an emergency shelter in Nairobi. Apart from being HIV-positive, she had tuberculosis and was very ill. Those caring for her managed to deal with the TB and get her into a reasonable physical state. They fed her up, and once she was a little recovered they got her on to antiretrovirals. The next time I saw her she was in the same children's home as her brother. They had no bed nets or running water and not much food. She was starting to lose weight. The next time I saw her she had lost a considerable amount of weight. The next time I went there, she had been moved up-country. The organisation that had done all that work for her was virtually out of funds. My hon. Friend the Minister knows which organisation I mean, because I have spoken to him about it before. If we are going to provide support and protection for the children, it is desperately important that we support and safeguard the organisations that feed them. In four or five years of going to and fro, the state of some of those organisations has got significantly worse.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-07a.148.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="148"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090507/halltext/90507h0003.htm#090507110000201">
	<p pid="a.148.2/1">It is often the individual stories that stick in our memories. Although we speak about millions of children suffering, detailed accounts, such as that given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase>, are the ones that last, and I thank her for her excellent speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/2">At a time when swine flu is dominating our television, radio and press news headlines it would be easy to forget the scale of the subject of our debate, and the problems facing developing countries because of HIV and AIDS. I welcome the debate because it is our duty to lead, and to debate issues that do not necessarily make the headlines.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/3">Within the developing countries it is, as we have heard, the most vulnerable who are hit the hardest. Those are usually the women and children. It has been good to hear from the Minister that the battle continues on behalf of those children, even if the news does not make the headlines. Early this afternoon in the main Chamber there was a debate and update on swine flu, while in Westminster Hall we have this debate on HIV and AIDS. I can guarantee which one will make the 6 o'clock and later news headlines. Nevertheless, it is good to hear about the Government's record, which is a good one. Having visited several of the countries that have been mentioned, I am pleased that the work being done on the ground by the Department for International Development, the UK taxpayers' money that is being spent, and the expertise that is being used, are proving effective. In the economic downturn, to which the Minister referred, we must justify to our hard-pressed taxpayers why we are advocating that more money should be spent. Part of the problem is that with its decreasing value, the pound does not go as far as it did a year ago. If we can guarantee that the money is being spent effectively, and that it is a matter of life or death for many people, we can argue for more resources for overseas aid and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/4">As we have heard, the problem is worldwide. Even on our doorstep too many new cases of HIV/AIDS are diagnosed every week, but children in developing countries face specific problems because of the scale of the numbers involved and because those countries often suffer a wide range other serious problems, including poverty, drought, food insecurity, conflict, and wider health problems. I shall concentrate today on sub-Saharan Africa, not because the problem is less of an issue elsewhere, or that the numbers affected in, for example, India are not significant, but because the UK Government have a long and a good track record of work in many areas of the African continent. However, much more must be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/5">The number of people affected by HIV in sub-Saharan Africa is staggering. At the end of 2007, an estimated 22 million people were living with HIV, with AIDS being the leading cause of death and killing an estimated 1.3 million people in 2007 alone. In the same year, another 1.7 million people became infected with HIV. The epidemic is wiping out development gains, orphaning millions of children, fuelling the spread of other diseases, including TB, and even threatening to undermine national security in some highly affected societies.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/6">Over the past decade, I have visited a number of African countries and seen at first hand the suffering and devastation that AIDS can bring to regions, villages, families and individuals. In the slums of Kibera in Nairobi, I met nursing mothers in a clinic and we were informed that every mother was probably HIV positive. The potential for stopping mother-to-child transmission is great, but for many mothers, it was too late. I welcome the Government's action in that area. In the slums of South Africa, an estimated 5 million people are living with HIV/AIDS and there are 1.4 million orphans as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/7">We often see images of an orphanage in Malawi now that Madonna is a regular visitor, and we often see happy, smiling children. I have been to that orphanage and seen its work, but few images appear on our televisions of the real suffering of children who die daily. We do not see that, and it might be better if we did. We did not see what happened during the bombing in Gaza and Iraq, but it might strike home if we saw some of the problems of HIV/AIDS sufferers in greater detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/8">One problem in Malawi is governance, and ensuring that our AIDS money is spent effectively and that those involved plan for the long term. When I was a member of the Select Committee on International Development, we had a long and heated debate with Ministers from the Malawi Government, and I could not understand why they did not think about the long term. There was so much short-term thinking, and we were trying to stress long-term planning. It was suggested to me afterwards that 60 per cent. of those Ministers were estimated to be HIV-positive. If most of them do not have a long life expectancy, perhaps it not surprising that their prime consideration is for the short term and the families whom they may leave behind. We must press for long-term thinking because it is vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/9">I want to put on the record the number of children who are affected, because it is staggering. According to UNAIDS, at the end of 2007, 2 million under-15s were living with HIV/AIDS throughout the world, and during the year an estimated 370,000 children became newly infected with HIV. Of the 2 million people who died of AIDS during 2007, more than one in seven were children. Every hour, around 31 children die as a result of AIDS. Hundreds of thousands of children throughout the world become infected with HIV every year and without treatment they die as a result of AIDS. Most children living with HIV&mdash;around nine in 10&mdash;live in sub-Saharan Africa, but many also live in the Caribbean, Latin America, India, and south and south-east Asia.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/10">I have focused on sub-Saharan Africa, but it is important to acknowledge that the problem is not solely an African one. Indeed, many countries in northern Africa have lower HIV rates than north America and parts of Europe, so to characterise the problem as an African one is as unhelpful as it is unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/11">As we have heard, many millions more children who are not infected with HIV are indirectly affected by the epidemic, as a result of the death and suffering that AIDS causes in their families and their communities. It is difficult to consider the effect of HIV on children as distinct from its wider effects on society, because a child's life can be decimated by HIV regardless of whether they were born with HIV or contracted it. In countries with a high incidence, it is a depressing statistical reality that a parent or other family member is likely to be HIV-positive. Sub-Saharan Africa has 11.6 million AIDS orphans and a child is orphaned by HIV every 15 seconds.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/12">One impact of HIV in children is that it blurs the boundaries of what it means to be a child. As the number of AIDS orphans grows, more and more children become the head of their household and their family's principal breadwinner. Many more find themselves acting as carers for sick parents. HIV and AIDS not only debilitate and kill children, they erode the very concept of childhood in many of the worst-hit countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/13">I am in regular touch with a young boy whom I met many years ago. He and his sibling are orphans. He is still alive, still surviving, and still shining shoes part time and attending school part time, but I have no idea whether he is HIV-positive or whether he has a long-term outlook. One can only hope for the best. HIV may affect a child's life not just in the family, but in their community, because many schools lose teachers as a result of HIV, and children are unable to access education. Children who have HIV in their family may be stigmatised and suffer discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/14">Preventing children from becoming infected and mitigating the impact of HIV and AIDS should be straightforward, but lack of necessary investment and resources, including adequate testing, antiretroviral drugs and prevention programmes, as well as stigma and discrimination, mean that children continue to suffer needlessly. Around 90 per cent. of all children living with HIV acquired the infection from their mothers during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding. In sub-Saharan Africa, one in three newborns infected with HIV die before the age of one, and most are dead before they are five years old. In developed countries, preventive measures ensure that the transmission of HIV from mother to child is relatively rare, and even when it occurs effective treatment means that the child can survive, often into adulthood. With funding for trained staff and resources, infection and death of many children in lower-income countries might easily be avoided. Sadly, it seems likely that in some of the worst-hit countries there will be a struggle just to continue treating those who are already on antiretrovirals. Countries are understandably reluctant to remove treatment from those who are currently receiving it, but that severely hampers prevention efforts and our capacity to treat new sufferers.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/15">I know that the Government are the biggest contributor to tackling HIV per capita, and the second largest donor overall. We should all be proud of that. I was pleased to hear that DFID has committed &pound;200 million for social protection programmes, and I understand that &pound;80 million of that is new money. However, in the excellent report by the International Development Committee, &quot;HIV/AIDS: DFID's New Strategy&quot;, legitimate concern was expressed that social protection programmes and direct cash transfers would not necessarily guarantee outcomes for children and that measuring the impact would be difficult. I would appreciate hearing the Minister's response to that concern and, in relation to aid effectiveness, what we are doing to ensure that we get value for money from both Government and NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/16">I am sure that we would also appreciate updates, because the economic downturn will continue. The Minister mentioned the impact that that will have on DFID funding, but as the global recession is likely to continue in the year ahead, it would be good to hear how things are developing during that period. He will be aware of reports from the World Bank that drug treatment for up to 1.7 million people with HIV is under threat because of funding pressures triggered by the global financial crisis. I am encouraged by assurances that DFID will be honouring its G8 commitments on meeting the millennium development goals in relation to HIV/AIDS, but we must wonder what we can do to encourage other countries that made similar commitments to hold to those commitments, because it is feared that some are backtracking on those statements.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/17">I know that DFID has had discussions with the United States on its HIV programmes in the past, particularly on the PEPFAR&mdash;President's emergency plan for AIDS relief&mdash;projects. I would appreciate hearing how the Minister expects the American approach to tackling HIV in developing countries to change now that the new Administration are in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/18">We have talked about money for drugs, but perhaps the biggest thing that we can do for children is to educate the next generation about HIV, how to avoid contracting it by having safe sex and, for those who are infected, how to live with it. A country's relationship with its HIV rate is often complex, but by better educating the next generation, particularly on sexual habits, it will have a better chance of improving the situation. As has been said, empowering women and putting them in control of their own bodies in high-incidence countries would go a long way towards tackling the problem. Conflict and state instability can often wipe out progress on HIV rates. It is important that DFID's programmes to tackle HIV/AIDS are tied into a bigger-picture strategy for security and development in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.2/19">It is estimated that 31 children die every hour from AIDS. That means that during this debate, if it runs for the full time, 93 children will die. Later this month, 91 children from my constituency are coming down to visit me. If something happened to kill every one of those children, we would leave no stone unturned in the search for a solution to the problem. We would say that it was unacceptable and must never happen again. Children in other countries are no less important. We in this place must ensure that they are never far from our thoughts.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-07a.152.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="152"  time="015:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090507/halltext/90507h0003.htm#090507110000202">
	<p pid="a.152.0/1">I am pleased to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas. I am also delighted to have heard the excellent contribution from the Minister. It was a very heartening exposition. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> said, it is often the personal examples that stick in one's mind. The speech from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase>, who explained that she could not stay for the final part of the debate, was particularly heartening. It is amazing how one suddenly finds that a colleague in the House has a huge amount of knowledge and has done a great deal of work on a subject that one never knew they were involved in. It was a delight to hear her speech. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West also dealt with the subject comprehensively. Inevitably, therefore, my speech will cover some ground that has already been covered.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/2">The problem that we are debating is a dreadful one. Before I launch into my speech on children in the developing world, I shall just mention that I happened to pick up a free newspaper on the tube today and one of its articles stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Britain has almost twice as many new HIV cases diagnosed in a year as any other west European country, new figures show.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/4" class="indent">There were 7,734 new cases...recorded in 2007&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/5">So although in this debate we have been dealing exclusively with the developing world, we must not forget what is going on in our own backyard, as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/6">Of course, the focus of this debate is the effects of HIV and AIDS on children, and the statistics are particularly heart-rending. They have been cited before, but I make no apology for citing them again. They are in the relevant DFID report. There are 33 million people living with HIV. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West said, 7,000 more are infected every day, 40 per cent. of whom are young people aged between 15 and 25. What a tragic waste. There are 1.8 million children in sub-Saharan Africa suffering from the disease. They account for 6 per cent. of the infected population but, tragically, 14 per cent. of the deaths. Each day, nearly 6,000 people die from AIDS. It is estimated that 15.2 million children have been orphaned as a result of AIDS. Those are tragic and mind-boggling figures, to which we should all pay very close attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/7">However, the effects of this dreadful disease cannot be fully expressed by the statistics, as anyone who has witnessed its effects in countries where HIV/AIDS is endemic can report. Last summer, I was in Rwanda, teaching English teachers how to teach and write English. I had a class of 55 people. On the last day, this nice young girl came up to me. She had made quite a good contribution in the class throughout the fortnight and she said, &quot;I want you to know I have AIDS.&quot; I said, &quot;I am desperately sorry to hear that. Are you getting any treatment?&quot; She said, &quot;No. My diet is too poor; the drugs that are supplied are too toxic.&quot; I would not mind betting that she had just a month or two to live. So the millennium development goal of universal access to treatment by 2010, even if we do not get there&mdash;the Minister realistically outlined today that we might not fully achieve it; we might get only to 80 per cent.&mdash;is still hugely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/8">As many others have said, HIV does not discriminate in whom it affects, but it will consistently devastate. It tears families apart and communities are decimated. A person's chance of pulling themselves and their family out of desperate poverty is quashed, a nation's economic growth is hindered and the cycle of decline continues. However, the children suffer worst, because they are the innocent victims. As the Minister said, their bodies are least able to resist the ravages of the disease. Even if they do not have the disease, they will suffer if their provider dies. I mentioned in an intervention on the Minister the problem of paediatric formulations of the existing drugs. Drug companies need to pay much closer attention to the problem affecting children.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/9">There have been a number of welcome improvements. If I may say so to the Minister, DFID's employees must be congratulated on their work, as must their colleagues in similar Departments in other countries, along with charities and health workers, who have worked so hard in this fight. The future of our country's involvement in combating HIV is shown in the DFID publication &quot;Achieving Universal Access&mdash;the UK's strategy for halting and reversing the spread of HIV in the developing world&quot;. However, that plan must be held up to scrutiny and I hope that we hear from the Minister today a response to some of the issues that I will raise.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/10">Before turning to specifics, I want to raise the issue that was noted by the Minister and remarked on by the International Development Committee. It stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/11" class="indent">&quot;there are some serious questions to be asked about delivery and also about our interaction with donors, with NGOs and with governments in terms of achieving what we say we want to achieve.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/12">It would be interesting to hear the Minister's reply to that. The Government's strategy paper was released in June 2008, almost a year ago. I hope that he will tell us exactly what steps have been taken towards providing answers to those questions, and what the answers are. They are, after all, questions relating to a programme committing a huge amount of funding. We were all very heartened to hear that DFID was committing that funding&mdash;&pound;6 billion directly and another &pound;1 billion through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/13">There are a number of excellent multilateral agencies&mdash;for example, UNICEF, which the Minister mentioned, and the World Bank. There are very good and knowledgeable NGOs doing excellent work, such as Save the Children. There is the charity of the hon. Member for Northampton, North. Many charities and NGOs are working in the field of HIV. However, as the Minister said, some companies are becoming involved with providing patent pools. I met representatives of an excellent company yesterday called Abbott Pharmaceuticals, which is one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the United States. It does not yet have a high profile here. In 2006, it provided more than $170 million of free HIV drugs, and it is participating in the patent pool arrangements to which the Minister referred. Indeed, an increasing number of multinational companies are taking part in excellent corporate social responsibility programmes, some of which are involved in the HIV field.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/14">The Minister may have mentioned this, but I put it to him that one of the key players in the fight against HIV must be the US Government. Given the recent change of Administration, it is important that we interact with them. Indeed, the recent announcement by President Obama that Dr. Eric Goosby, a man with more than 25 years' experience in this field, will be the next US global AIDS co-ordinator, has been welcomed by the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS. As I say, the US is bound to be a key player, and it would be of great interest to hear what interaction the Minister has had with the US.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/15">One country that has not been mentioned is one of the most seriously affected: South Africa. One in six of the world's HIV sufferers live there. Thabo Mbeki, the previous President, had a chequered history in tackling HIV/AIDS, and the newly inaugurated president Jacob Zuma has already caused controversy on the matter. I hope that the Minister will enlighten us on his perception of the effect of the change of leadership in South Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/16">I turn to the important matter of monitoring the processes being brought about by DFID's many policies. In an intervention on the Minister, I cited the terms of millennium development goal 6, which are well known. They are to have halted and reversed the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015, and to have achieved universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS by 2010. Given that 2010 is fast approaching, it seems that we will run short of the latter target. Nevertheless, it is important that we continue to concentrate on those targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/17">I was heartened to hear from the Minister something that I did not know&mdash;that the UK has a worldwide role in co-ordinating the efforts of NGOs and multilateral agencies in other countries in the fight against HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. That is of great credit to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/18">The Select Committee report states that</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/19" class="indent">&quot;the challenge remains for DFID to turn rhetoric into practical implementation and demonstrate much more clearly how it will achieve the targets it has set and the commitments it has made.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/20">Although the &pound;6 billion is admirable, we need to see what effect&mdash;what change&mdash;it is having. I concur with that assessment; and I would add that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1862" name="Andrew Mitchell">the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> has called for intermediate targets to be set for scaling up implementation to full access, and for detailed yearly&mdash;I emphasise, yearly&mdash;impact assessments to be made to demonstrate whether the strategy is on track.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/21">Why should the reporting be more regular? Nearly every minute, one child dies from AIDS and two become infected with HIV. If aspects of the strategy do not work, or the goalposts move, a biennial assessment will not pick up the fact that millions of people would have died in the time needed to detect whether the strategy was wrong. I ask the Minister to consider that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/22">I move on to policies relating to children that arise from the Select Committee report &quot;Achieving Universal Access&quot;. It notes the need for an increased focus on groups that are more affected by HIV. The Minister mentioned some groups, especially women&mdash;I would say, more particularly, adolescent women. There are also children, sex workers, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users, prisoners and migrants&mdash;the last being a particularly vulnerable group.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/23">The Government's strategy has moved towards expanding social protection programmes. DFID says in its response to the Select Committee report&mdash;this is an important aspect, and I ask the Minister to concentrate on it&mdash;that it will</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/24" class="indent">&quot;provide effective and predictable support for the most vulnerable households, including those with children affected by AIDS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/25">The Minister, I am sure, will be aware of the Select Committee's concern that</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/26" class="indent">&quot;many of the most vulnerable children, including orphaned children and street children, do not live in traditional households&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/27">That is self-evident. If they have lost their parents, it is sad but still likely that they may become part of the itinerant child population that we see in so many parts of the world. Therefore, they may not benefit from the change in strategy. Will the Minister say how the strategy will work for those vulnerable groups of children?</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/28">Children suffering from HIV find their immune systems dramatically weakened. The Select Committee makes the clear recommendation that</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/29" class="indent">&quot;Children living with HIV should not be dying needlessly when a cheap and effective antibiotic is available to mitigate their vulnerability to opportunistic infections.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/30">In his evidence to the Select Committee, Dr. Stuart Kean, the chair of the working group on children affected by AIDS, reported that co-trimoxazole costs just one or two pence a day. As the hon. Member for Northampton, North said, &pound;2.10 could feed an entire family for a week. Such small sums can provide a huge amount of money for the third world.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/31">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West said that the pound is not going as far as it used to; I calculate that, because the pound has devalued over the last year, &pound;334 million of DFID aid is not going where it should. One can imagine how many drugs that money could buy. Furthermore, a World Bank report notes that eight countries now face shortages of antiretroviral drugs or other disruptions to AIDS treatment. Twenty-two countries, home to more than 60 per cent. of people on HIV treatment worldwide, expect to face disruptions over the next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/32">I shall now speak about mother-to-child infections. The Minister will be well aware that a mother with HIV has a 30 per cent. chance of passing on the disease to her child; such means of transmission account for 90 per cent. of the disease in children. DFID has launched an ambitious strategy to increase antiretroviral treatments for HIV-infected women from 34 per cent. to 80 per cent. by 2010, to reduce if not eliminate that form of transmission. I hope the Minister will give us an update on whether that target is still attainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/33">The picture is bigger than simply providing drugs, as many others have said this afternoon; on their own, they will not lead to a solution. One key fact is awareness of carrying the disease. As I said in an intervention, only 18 per cent. of pregnant women have received an HIV test. We should remember that the diagnostic testing equipment is becoming much smaller and more portable. If we can pick up on more of the pregnant women carrying HIV, the appropriate treatment can be given at an earlier stage, and we might be able to stop some of the maternal transmission and thus save more young children's lives. As well as the equipment needed for testing, it is vital that countries' health care systems be able to deal with such transmission effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/34">The distribution of drugs in many poor countries is important. Some excellent work has been done on the distribution of drugs, particularly by companies involved in CSR programmes. For example, Coca-Cola is thinking about delivering drugs to remote rural communities&mdash;places that are almost impossible to reach. The company's franchisees operating in those remote areas&mdash;it amazes me that Coke is sold in such remote places, but I am sure that it is&mdash;are considering distributing drugs with the Coca-Cola.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/35">A proper system of distribution is necessary; once the drugs have reached those communities, someone has to be in charge of getting them to those who need them&mdash;and of ensuring that they take the correct amount. One of the tragedies is this. I have heard from more than one source that when a woman is given her drugs, she will go home; but the man will see the drugs and regardless of whether he knows he is an HIV carrier, he will seize all or part of those drugs, and the woman will get none. It is important that the drugs get through to those for whom they are intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/36">The Select Committee notes that DFID's strategy</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/37" class="indent">&quot;fails to explain how the high-level funding commitments will be broken down by country or sector, making it difficult to understand how implementation will occur on the ground.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/38">I think that the Minister addressed that point. He said sotto voce that he could give me a country-by-country breakdown or, at least, put one in the Library so that we can all access it. That might be a very good way of communicating the information.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/39">Although this debate focuses on children, as I have remarked already, the death of adults has a huge effect on the lives of children, and as such, although I cannot go over it in detail, a brief comment on the overall strategy remains salient. Regular monitoring of progress has been carried out, which ties in to all the areas of the strategy, because it is the only means by which success will be achieved. We must also address the need for continued growth in education&mdash;this is terrifically important&mdash;particularly among men, who have a role to play in this whole affair. We must ensure universal access to family planning services. That is most important, as women are disproportionately affected by the disease: two thirds of young sufferers are female. I would also like to hear how DFID has sought to engage more fully with civil society to tackle issues relating to the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/40">I want to raise&mdash;again&mdash;one discordant but important point relating to DFID staffing. I am not the only one concerned; it is regularly raised by the Select Committee, including in its report, as well as by non-governmental organisations. In her evidence to the Select Committee, DFID's permanent secretary&mdash;no less&mdash;noted that</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/41" class="indent">&quot;our staff are very pressed, they are working very, very hard...we are coping but we are struggling&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.0/42">That is a very significant admission from a senior civil servant. It is as close as one could come to saying that there are not enough staff to deliver the programme. Of course, every Department's central office has had its fair share of Government cuts&mdash;</p>
