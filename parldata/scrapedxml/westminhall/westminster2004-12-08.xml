<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-12-08.121.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/784" speakername="Ivor Caplin" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence"  colnum="121"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041208/halltext/41208h01.htm#41208h01_spmin0">
	<p pid=".121.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1299" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase> on securing this debate on the electoral registration of service personnel. I agree that it is an important issue, and I have listened carefully to what he and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1301" name="Peter Viggers">the hon. Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers)</phrase> have said.</p>
	<p pid=".121.0/2">The Government have introduced a number of measures aimed at making voting easier for all voters, including service personnel. The Representation of the People Act 2000 introduced postal voting on demand; voters are no longer required to give a reason if they wish to apply for a postal vote. The Act also provided for pilot schemes to be set up to test alternative methods of voting. Since 2000, there have been numerous pilots covering a range of new electoral procedures, including all-postal voting, early voting and electronic methods of voting. In the combined European and local election in June, four regions held all-postal ballots and in those regions turnout was 42 per cent.&mdash; double the turnout in the previous European elections. I hope that the hon. Members for Chichester and for Gosport will join me in welcoming that increase in turnout. I hope that we can engage even more people in taking part in our elections.</p>
	<p pid=".121.0/3">It may be of assistance to hon. Members if I explain the procedures that apply for the electoral registration of service personnel, as they have changed significantly in recent years, following the Act. As the hon. Member for Chichester said, in the past service personnel have not been eligible to register to vote on the annual voting canvass received by households for inclusion on a local register of electors. They were able to vote only if they had made a service declaration, which, unless updated, stayed in force until they left the armed forces. Those in the United Kingdom could vote in person, by post or by proxy, and those overseas could do so by proxy only. There was no requirement for annual re-registration, and in order to exercise their vote, individuals had to keep their details and voting preference up to date.</p>
	<p pid=".121.0/4">In a highly mobile work force, which the services obviously has, that was a lot to expect and the number of registered service voters was no indication of those who exercised their vote. The Representation of the People Act 2000 and the Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 2001 presented service personnel and their partners with a wider range of electoral registration options. They may now register to vote at either their private or another qualifying address, which could be service families accommodation or single living accommodation. Alternatively, they can choose to register to vote by means of a service declaration. In all cases, a fresh declaration must now be made every 12 months, and an annual renewal notification is sent out by the electoral registration officer with whom they are registered.</p>
	<p pid=".121.0/5">The changes were considered likely to encourage more service personnel to use their votes and to register with an up-to-date address, whether by means of a service declaration or in the standard way, instead of the one at which they had lived when they first joined the services. The changes also meant that the names of service declarants did not remain indefinitely on other electoral lists long after the people concerned had left the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid=".121.0/6">All service personnel and their partners have the option to register as service voters by completing a   yearly service declaration form, which should be returned to the relevant local council electoral registration office. When registering in that way, a service voter's qualifying address is the address in the United Kingdom at which they would be living if they were not in the services. The advantage of that option is that their registration remains constant even if they are moved from one location to another on a tour of duty.</p>
	<p pid=".121.0/7">Since 2000, service personnel and partners have had other options on how to register as electors in line with civilian electors. If they live at a permanent address in the United Kingdom, either at a private or qualifying address, or at service families accommodation or single living accommodation, a serviceman or woman can register as a conventional voter.</p>
	<p pid=".121.0/8">For those personnel and their partners who are posted abroad and who do not wish to register as service voters, there is the option of registering as overseas electors. That facility is available to all British citizens who live abroad but have been registered as electors in Britain within the past 15 years. The disadvantage of that option to service personnel is that overseas electors can take part only in United Kingdom parliamentary and European parliamentary elections. They do not qualify to vote in local council elections.</p>
	<p pid=".121.0/9">As hon. Members know, all households in the United Kingdom receive an annual form from the local council electoral registration officer each September or October. That is for confirming and updating the following year's register of electors. Those registered as service voters or overseas electors also receive an annual renewal notification from the electoral registration officer with whom they are registered.</p>
	<p pid=".121.0/10">In addition to the annual canvass, provision is made for a system of electoral registration that allows individuals to register at any time of year when they move properties within the same electoral registration area, or to another registration area in the United Kingdom. That, together with the requirement for service personnel to register at least once a year, is particularly useful for our highly mobile personnel, because it removes a major reason for members of the armed forces being refused credit, which is not being on the electoral role at their current address.</p>
	<p pid=".121.0/11">Before I deal with the two versions of the register, I should like to address one or two points made by the hon. Member for Chichester. He will be aware that it is for the local authority to determine whether it wants electoral registration staff to carry out house-to-house canvassing. Some issues that I will raise in relation to the edited register will affect whether authorities wish to continue canvassing door to door for electoral registration.</p>
	<p pid=".121.0/12">The Ministry of Defence is committed to discussions with the Electoral Commission. In fact, my officials have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow with officials from the Electoral Commission&mdash;it is not related to today's debate; it just happens to be tomorrow&mdash;to consider some of the issues raised in parliamentary questions and this debate and to consider some of the concerns.</p>

	<p pid=".123.1/1">I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, although I do not know what election he is referring to next May. We do not have local elections then in my city, although West Sussex county council may have them. I am not sure that the statistics and comparison of numbers, which the hon. Gentleman used in his speech, are relevant. I am not sure whether comparing the number of registered service voters since 2000 with the    number today is comparing like with like. The 2000 figure indicated the number that chose to vote by means of a service declaration. Many others will have made the choice to register as ordinary voters or overseas voters, as I was trying to explain in my earlier remarks.</p>
	<p pid=".123.1/2">The simple fact is that there is no way of knowing how many service personnel choose to vote in that way. However, that may indicate that those who have taken positive steps to register as service voters, and whose details are up to date, are more likely to exercise their vote. I am not sure whether there is a &quot;crisis&quot; as the hon. Gentleman says.</p>

	<p pid=".124.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister for giving way a third time. Does not he realise that failing to set out a clear plan of action to deal with what has been uncovered will strike many as blistering complacency? We must take action to get service registration numbers up. It is no good relying on the pre-existing arrangements, which he has outlined for almost 15   minutes and which all hon. Members here knew about already. We need urgent pressure from the Ministry of Defence and the Electoral Commission to get it across to registration officers that they have to get personnel registered. They have to take action, such as has been taken in Chichester. They should can Chichester as a beacon for higher registration for the rest of the UK.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-12-08.133.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1245" speakername="Bob Spink" colnum="133"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041208/halltext/41208h02.htm#41208h02_spnew6">
	<p pid=".133.0/1">A community that has been attacked but has never attacked&mdash;that is what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1165" name="Stephen Pound">the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound)</phrase> referred to in his eloquent, moving and persuasive speech. It is always an honour to follow him; this time, however, it is not a pleasure because of the circumstances. Indeed, it is not really acceptable for someone who uses the English language as poorly as I do even to comment on the hon. Gentleman's performance, but it was quite inspirational.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/2">The history of this dignified, courageous and persecuted people is worth reviewing. The Chaldo-Assyrians have suffered greatly in their ancestral homeland of northern Iraq and southern Turkey throughout the centuries, particularly during the genocide of the Ottoman Turks, which started in 1915 and was known, as the hon. Gentleman said, as the Armenian genocide.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/3">During that genocide, the Chaldo-Assyrians lost about 750,000 people&mdash;about half their population&mdash;as well as a very large proportion of their land. They fought on the side of the allies and incurred heavy losses in battle in the first world war, and the British Government promised them an autonomous homeland in Iraq after the war. That promise, as we have heard, has never been fulfilled.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/4">In August 1933, the Iraqi military turned their weapons against their own Chaldo-Assyrian Christian citizens and massacred about 4,000 of them in villages in what are now the governorates of Dohok and Nineveh. The Assyrian Democratic Movement and the Jubilee Campaign, representatives of which are here today, are calling for urgent and much stronger support for Iraq's community of about 1 million, which remains besieged to this day.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/5">Christians are by far the largest non-Muslim minority in Iraq, and the Chaldo-Assyrians and moderate Muslims in Iraq are the main bulwarks against the growth and spread of Islamic fundamentalism in that country. That is&mdash;the Minister asked about this earlier&mdash;the key reason they are being singled out for persecution and driven out of the country. I hope that he will accept at least that fact today. If Iraq's Christian community is reduced to a very small size, it will have no   power to oppose attempts to impose sharia law in   Iraq. The presence of a vibrant Iraqi Christian community greatly strengthens the ability of moderate Iraqi Muslims to oppose the spread of Islamic fundamentalism. That is in the interests of not only moderate Muslims, but the rest of the world.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/6">Attempts to Islamicise Iraq have grown bolder and stronger since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. In that respect, the war has been subject to the law of unintended consequences. There have, for example, been numerous reports that Iran is trying to take advantage of the instability in Iraq by exporting its brand of so-called Islamic revolution and sending large numbers of agents to support Shi'ite militias friendly to Iran and radicalise the Shi'ite population. The most notorious Shi'ite militia, the Mahdi army, which is led by Moqtada al-Sadr, is well know to have close ties with the Islamic regime in Tehran.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/7">The Chaldo-Assyrians have been among the first and the most vulnerable victims of the Islamic extremists, although that is not to say, of course, that others have not suffered. Several Chaldo-Assyrians, who were alcohol sellers, were assassinated by Muslim militants, and numerous threatening letters have been sent to Christians telling them to adopt Islamic practices such as wearing the veil and to convert to Islam or face death.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/8">Islamic extremists conducted lethal, co-ordinated terrorist bombings on <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-01">Sunday 1 August</phrase> against five churches in Baghdad and the northern city of Mosul, killing 12 people and injuring many more. In the wake of those bombings and other anti-Christian violence, thousands of Chaldo-Assyrians fled, further reducing&mdash;some would say decimating&mdash;Iraq's Christian presence. Iraq's ancient Christian community is now in danger of extinction or, at least, of being greatly reduced.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/9">Since those attacks, Islamic extremists have struck   Christian churches again. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-16">16 October</phrase>, Islamic extremists bombed five Chaldo-Assyrian churches in Baghdad, although nobody was injured. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-08">8 November</phrase>, bombs exploded at two churches in Baghdad within the space of five or 10 minutes, which shows the level of co-ordination of those attacks. At   least three people were killed and 40 injured. That   illustrates for the Minister how the Christian community is being specifically targeted in an attempt to    terrorise, destroy or drive it away so that fundamentalism can triumph. We must fight against that.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/10">The hon. Member for Ealing, North eloquently described how two further churches in Mosul were bombed and another was stormed by gunmen only yesterday. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-04">4 July</phrase>, two Chaldo-Assyrian children&mdash;16-year-old Raneen Raad and her six-year-old brother, Raphid&mdash;were shot dead at their home by Islamic extremists while their parents were away. My hon. Friend also told us about beheadings.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/11">Bishop al-Qas of Amadiya in northern Iraq said that posters had been put up urging Christians to convert to Islam or leave the country. The point we want to drive home today is that Christians need an autonomous region so that they can have security and safety. Chaldo-Assyrian Christians have received threatening letters telling them to support the Muslim rebellion against the coalition authorities and to practise Islam or suffer severe consequences. The recipients of those letters were told that if they did not follow basic rules such as wearing the veil and did not follow Islamic teachings, they would be raped, tortured, kidnapped or killed, or have their houses, along with their families, burned or bombed. Muslim extremists are calling Iraqi Christians crusaders or fifth columnists for the Christian west and the Americans. Three Christian bishops in Mosul have received letters threatening to kill one member of each Christian household&mdash;a little biblical reference&mdash;as a punishment for women not wearing the Islamic veil.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/12">The British Government and their US ally have often said that one positive outcome of the war in Iraq would be the emergence of a free, democratic country setting a good example for the whole region to follow. On that basis, I supported the Government action there. We have learned a lot since then. Yet, if the rights of the   Chaldo-Assyrians, who are Iraq's second largest ethnic group, and its largest religious faction, are not respected, and their security needs are ignored, Iraq will    be deprived of a major force for religious moderation, and a significant bulwark against Islamic fundamentalism. That will gravely threaten its chances of ever becoming a leading example of pluralism, freedom and democracy for the middle east.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/13">Therefore, it is clearly in the interests of Iraq, of the British Government and of all those who do not wish to see Iraq dominated by Islamic fundamentalism and all that that entails to give their full support to Iraq's besieged Christian community. Not only have members of that community had to contend with attacks by Islamic extremists, but they have seen the illegal expropriation of their land and villages by neighbouring communities, depriving them of their livelihoods and shelter.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/14">I urge the Kurdish authorities, particularly the Kurdistan Democratic party, to consider the matter carefully and to respond to what I have said, so that the international community can judge their actions. The Kurds are a great race. I deeply respect and admire them in many ways. They are the largest group in the world without their own homeland, and I have spoken in their favour a number of times in the House&mdash;on at least one occasion in front of you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I see you nodding your assent. I want to be sure that they understand fully the plight of the Chaldo-Assyrian people, and I hope that they will want to be seen to be acting properly&mdash;thereby promoting their own cause. If they do not do so, how can they expect the rest of the world to stand up for them in their persecution?</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/15">At least 58 Chaldo-Assyrian villages have been occupied&mdash;eight completely and 50 partially&mdash;by the Kurds. All of them are in Dohuk province in areas controlled by the KDP. A list of the villages is available from the Jubilee Campaign. It is claimed that the KDP has not yet properly responded to numerous appeals from the Chaldo-Assyrians, requesting that it relocate the Kurdish squatters out of the villages. I await its response.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/16">I apologise for the repetition in this speech. Other hon. Members will have received the same briefing as I   have, and many are more expert than I am on the subject, but I will always take the trouble to stand up and fight for religious freedom and against persecution around the world. As I am a good friend of the Kurds, I hope that they and the KDP will listen to me. I have supported them on many occasions.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/17">Under Saddam Hussein's regime, Chaldo-Assyrian lands in the plains of Nineveh were taken by force and distributed to members of the military and intelligence services, or rented to Arabs or Kurds after the annual auction, as we have heard. Instead of returning those lands to their rightful owners, the current Minister of Defence, Hazim Al-Shalan, has given instructions for the confiscated Chaldo-Assyrian land to be distributed to Iraqi military intelligence service personnel. That is not acceptable. It replicates the odious Ba'athist regime policies that we are supposed to be eradicating.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/18">The Chaldo-Assyrian Christians are highly vulnerable&mdash;they are a community under siege. While the average Iraqi faces many risks in common with them in that unstable situation, the Iraqi Christians are up against even more danger: they have to deal also with attacks from the Islamic extremists from Iran and, for reasons that I have already explained, from those who want to drag them out of Iraq and kill them or force them to convert to Islam.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/19">Those Islamic extremists view the Christians as an obstacle to their dream of Islamicising Iraq, and they   wrongly perceive them as close allies of the coalition forces. I urge the allies, particularly Britain and America, seriously to consider setting up an autonomous administrative region, as requested by the hon. Member for Ealing, North&mdash;and as promised in article 53(D) of Iraq's transitional administrative law. I   want the British to push hard for the return of the Chaldo-Assyrian land and villages in northern Iraq that were illegally expropriated.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/20">An autonomous administrative region for the Chaldo-Assyrians would provide them with a safe haven. That would significantly enhance their security; and the British and American Governments should help bring it about as a matter of urgency in the Nineveh plains and Dohuk province. I would like the Minister to   say&mdash;or he can write if necessary&mdash;that the British Government have taken and will take specific steps to help set up that autonomous administrative region, in line with their promises and with the transitional administrative law.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/21">Now that Britain has influence in Iraq, it should be used fully to protect the human rights of the Chaldo-Assyrians, whose history has been a long succession of persecution, betrayal, massacre and even genocide. The Kurds have suffered similarly, and I hope that they will be especially sensitive to the needs of that severely oppressed minority. The Kurds, above all, should feel the pain of the Chaldo-Assyrians; they should know that they are not a blight against them that needs to be removed.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/22">The Government also have the opportunity to right a grave historic wrong by granting the Chaldo-Assyrians an autonomous homeland. The Government and their US ally also have a duty to enable financial support for the reconstruction of Chaldo-Assyrian villages, schools, clinics and infrastructure in order to allow for the return and resettlement of Chaldo-Assyrian refugees. They should also give whatever support they can to the Christians of Iraq to enhance their security and protection. So far as I am aware&mdash;the Minister may correct me if I am wrong&mdash;Britain has not yet given direct bilateral aid to those people. I have mentioned before that money may still be available from the oil-for-food programme. I do not know if that is so, but if it is we have a good use for it.</p>
	<p pid=".133.0/23">Finally, we need to get the detail right in Iraq. If we do not, we will have failed not only the Chaldo-Assyrian people but the region and humanity.</p>

	<p pid=".141.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1165" name="Stephen Pound">The hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound)</phrase> has done the House a great service in raising an important issue. The House should be a place where we can champion the cause of persecuted minorities all over the world. In his hands, this Chamber is becoming precisely that, and I pay warm tribute to him for the vivid and articulate way in which he put his case. It is what we have come to expect from him. I pay tribute, too, to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1245" name="Bob Spink">the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> for making a   powerful case for more support for the Christian community. I shall talk about that community shortly, but I want to pick up a couple of points that were made.</p>
	<p pid=".141.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/716" name="John Barrett">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> described what we are considering as a war of religion, or at least as being fundamentally to do with religion. Religion often gets a bad press, and we should not lose sight of the fact that all over the world, because of their religion, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Jews or people of other faiths are going about doing good&mdash;building families and communities, and doing acts of kindness, self-sacrifice and courage. Sometimes people&mdash;notably John Lennon in his song &quot;Imagine&quot;&mdash;consider that the world would be a better place without religion. I do not believe that. The acts of terrorism that are being carried out in Iraq are done by bad people. If religion is used as a motivation, that is an abuse of their religion and is not excused by it.</p>
	<p pid=".141.0/3">There is a particular problem with the Christian church in Iraq, which I shall discuss. However, we must recognise that what is happening is partly a reflection of the post-conflict insurgency in Iraq. The Minister will probably agree with almost everything that I will say, but one thing that he probably will not like nevertheless needs to be repeated: what is happening is partly a reflection of the lack of proper preparation for post-conflict Iraq and putting the country back together again. I have said that four or five times and will go on saying it, because it is essential that the Government learn the lesson. I know that the intervention was American led, but if Britain were to become involved in other interventions in the lifetime of this Parliament or in our parliamentary lifetimes&mdash;I very much hope that it will not be&mdash;we should learn the lessons of Iraq: we need to ensure that we know what the outcome will be; we need an exit strategy; and we need to ensure that we know how to put a country back together if we take it apart, bit by bit, with bombs, planes and missiles.</p>
	<p pid=".141.0/4">I am concerned about the state of the Chaldo-Assyrians in Iraq. We have had two powerful history lessons today about their proud and long history and their contribution to society generally. A good friend of mine, Canon Andrew White, works in the middle east and Iraq and stays in e-mail contact with me. I have been following some of the recent attacks on churches through his reports on the ground. The matter is very serious, and I am concerned about the numbers who have fled. I hope that it is a temporary flight and that there will be repatriation when the country is safer. I am, of course, also concerned about the many who have been killed or kidnapped, the churches that have been attacked and the people who are scared to practise their religions by going to church. In a recent e-mail, Canon White wrote:</p>
	<p pid=".141.0/5" class="indent">&quot;There was further bad news regarding the Christians in Iraq yesterday. A mass leafleting to all the Churches and individual Christians took place telling them to leave the country or convert to Islam.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".141.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point mentioned that problem. Canon White continued:</p>
	<p pid=".141.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Our church was also attacked yesterday afternoon but the guards shot at the attackers causing them to flee.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".141.0/8">Here is the powerful sentence:</p>
	<p pid=".141.0/9" class="indent">&quot;The cries from the Christians of Iraq are increasingly desperate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".141.0/10">That sums up the situation.</p>
	<p pid=".141.0/11">We have heard from hon. Members about specific atrocities that have been committed. Such things are happening right now&mdash;they are real and genuine. Being a practical politician, I ask myself what our response should be and what we should hope to hear from the Minister in his winding&ndash;up speech. Wherever possible, we&mdash;the British and Americans&mdash;must ensure that we provide as much security as we can on the ground for the Christians who are suffering in Iraq. We must not turn a blind eye to the persecution of that faith minority.</p>
	<p pid=".141.0/12">Sometimes, I think that it is not politically correct to be a Christian. There are signs sometimes that we give more space and support to people from other faiths. I want the Minister to confirm&mdash;I know that he will be able to&mdash;that we are not turning a blind eye simply because it is a Christian community that is involved rather than a community of another faith that might be more attractive in terms of the current British point of view. I think the Minister knows what I am saying&mdash;and here comes the rebuttal.</p>

	<p pid=".143.0/1">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1165" name="Stephen Pound">the Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound)</phrase> set out his case powerfully and vividly. He has described the tragic history of the Chaldo-Assyrian people. Having said that, my understanding of the situation today is somewhat different from his, as I hope to set out. We all know that Iraq is suffering general lawlessness and that many people of all faiths and political persuasions, including many of European extraction, have paid a high price for that. It is also true that, in some parts of Iraq, notably in the Sunni-Arab area, west of the Tigris river, attacks have been specifically directed at Christians and churches, as my hon. Friend and others described.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/2">We have recently consulted fairly widely with a range of leading Christians in northern Iraq, however, and we can find no significant support for autonomy; indeed, we found significant opposition to it. One of the Christian leaders in northern Iraq to whom we spoke said that the idea seemed to have come from members of the Chaldo-Assyrian community in exile rather than those who live in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/3">One or two hon. Members&mdash;two, I think&mdash;referred to the position of Britain in relation to Iraq in the 1920s. All I can say is that Iraq's position was different in the 1920s from that which exists today. At that time, Iraq was a League of Nations protectorate, whereas we are now dealing with a sovereign Government, and there can be no read-across from the 1920s to the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1259" name="Gary Streeter">The hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> asked whether Christians would be represented in the Parliament after the election. Well, the independent election commission in Iraq is certifying 240 political parties that are hoping to register, so it is probably fair to say that no school of thought will be unrepresented in the elections&mdash;although it will be for the electorate to decide which will be elected. There have been requests to register from parties representing a broad range of Iraqi society, including Assyrians.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/716" name="John Barrett">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> asked about the position of people who applied for asylum on the basis that they had come here and converted to Christianity and therefore felt that they would be at risk if they returned; I am unsure whether he was talking only about Iraq, or about other places as well. All asylum cases are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and if someone can demonstrate that their fear of   persecution is genuine, their case will be considered very seriously. However, I want to draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to a phenomenon that certainly occurs among refugees of my acquaintance, so I will be surprised if it does not occur in other parts of the country: there is a tendency for them to convert at the    last moment when all other options have run out.   Naturally, asylum adjudicators and Home Office officials tend to be sceptical about that kind of conversions.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/6">I endorse the point made by the hon. Member for South-West Devon when he said that he wanted to see Iraq functioning as a multicultural, multi-faith society. I think we all want that.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/7">Many of the problems that have been outlined, and certainly the more recent ones, are a legacy of what happened under Saddam Hussein's regime. There were decades of oppression of Kurds, Turkomans, Assyrians and many others. They were forcibly driven from their homes, and many thousands were forced into exile.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/8">All Iraqis, including Chaldo-Assyrians and other Christians, now benefit from the transitional administrative law, which safeguards their fundamental rights, including freedom of religion, freedom of expression, and other basic civil and political rights. The transitional law will continue to apply until the adoption of Iraq's permanent constitution next year. Of course, Iraqis had no such rights under the regime of Saddam Hussein.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-12-08.148.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/979" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="148"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041208/halltext/41208h03.htm#41208h03_spnew0">
	<p pid=".148.1/1">I am sure that not only is there is much interest in the House of Commons in this matter, but that the good people of Lancashire and the rest of the country share that interest.</p>
	<p pid=".148.1/2">A very important contract, better known as the cut and sew tender&mdash;DC4 BESL/1002&mdash;was let. Quite rightly, Lancashire companies&mdash;in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and in my own&mdash;have been the backbone of the cut and sew contract in the past. Many will say, &quot;Oh, that is not the case, because this went off to Romania.&quot; That cannot be denied, because a smaller part of the contract was carried out there, but the majority of it was done in Lancashire. We must ensure that that is on the record. A company called Cooneen Watts and Stone has got the new contract, after many years of it being held by the people of Lancashire. It is crucial to remember that in the Government's hour of need those people worked round the clock to ensure that the Ministry of Defence and our soldiers had the right kit to go to war.</p>
	<p pid=".148.1/3">We must address the key issue: if there were a contract for Army rifles in order that soldiers could defend themselves, do we really believe that we would put it out to tender and that people would look at the tender list and say, &quot;This company has said that it can supply rifles cheaper&quot;? One would ask for a sample and expect the company, whose sample rifle or uniform was being provided, to be the future supplier of that item. A soldier needs a weapon with which he can defend himself&mdash;a weapon that can be used. Exactly the same is true of a camouflage uniform: if a solder is going to war, his uniform is to defend him against death.</p>
	<p pid=".148.1/4">The right garment of the right quality will last, whether it is washed or weathered. More importantly, when it turns to night and infrared sensors are put on, the soldier no longer looks like a soldier: his image is deflected because the company that supplied the uniform has ensured that the right camouflage has been printed on it. If that camouflage is not right, the soldier becomes a target.</p>
	<p pid=".148.1/5">We know that Cooneen, Watts and Stone has absolutely failed to deliver. More importantly, it has hoodwinked the Ministry of Defence. As my right hon. Friend the Minister of State rightly said in response to parliamentary questions, it bid for the contract when it was not the company that would carry it out. Not once did it tell the Minister that the contract would be taken over by army factory 3533. In fact, the Minister did not understand the meaning of 3533. I understand why: he was never told.</p>
	<p pid=".148.1/6">There is something tragically wrong when the Minister and other Members of Parliament have been hoodwinked. More importantly, the good people of Lancashire may well lose their jobs as a result. If we cannot supply the People's Liberation Army, as we should not, because of human rights, we must ask why on earth a subsidised People's Liberation Army factory should be supplying the British Army. It is totally unacceptable morally. Where does that leave us with respect to our agreements on trade union recognition, because we know that no trade unions are allowed in   China? Morally, it stinks to high heaven. More importantly, what rates of pay operate in the factory, which was described as the factory of &pound;1 a week? This is totally unacceptable. The living and working conditions of the employees are unacceptable. Let us say for the record that this is unfair competition.</p>
	<p pid=".148.1/7">I believe that we have an opportunity. I ask the Secretary of State to investigate fully how someone can pretend that the sample that they have given is of what will be supplied in the future. Someone in competition with British Aerospace could supply us jets, and we would say, &quot;Not to worry. They are now being built in Chile.&quot; They could be built anywhere in the world. That is the danger of what is happening in this case. We must get this right and ensure that the Government address the key issues.</p>

	<p pid=".153.4/1">I shall come to the issue of the testing regime.</p>
	<p pid=".153.4/2">Let me deal with the view that combat clothing is war-like in nature and should be similar to a rifle or any other piece of military equipment. Article 296 of the European Union treaty provides exemption for some defence procurement, usually on the basis of national security considerations. For many years, the custom and   practice have been to undertake military uniform procurement on a competitive basis, without exemption, to secure the best value for money&mdash;not the cheapest price, but the best value for money. It would be inconsistent, even perverse, to change that approach when the Ministry of Defence is active in the EU consultation&mdash;the Green Paper on opening up the   defence procurement market to provide more opportunities for UK small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe.</p>
	<p pid=".153.4/3">We are trying to create a better and more open climate in Europe for British industry. What is being argued is that we should close the door because of one part of the British industrial sector. One can imagine the potential impact that that could have elsewhere as we try to open up Europe so that other parts of British industry&mdash;the manufacturing base and SMEs&mdash;get the opportunity to trade in a more open market.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2004-12-08.154.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/979" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="154"  time="unknown" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm041208/halltext/41208h03.htm#41208h03_spnew27">
	<p pid=".154.2/1" class="italic">indicated dissent.</p>
	<p pid=".154.2/2">Mr. Ingram: Hon. Members can shake their heads, but I am trying to explain that we are negotiating to try to create a more open market so that there are more opportunities for British industry and business in Europe. If we go for the type of approach suggested, that would be used against us. People would say, &quot;You are now adopting opposite practices to those you have applied over the years.&quot; The approach that I have described is not new.</p>
	<p pid=".154.2/3">A number of issues have been raised, and I deal now with the procurement structure and the way in which contracts are put together. I shall come to the issue of China if time permits, but countries that appeared on the list of all the bidding companies included, in different shapes and forms, the Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Sri Lanka, Dubai and China. The idea that there was a sole British manufacturer seeking to place all its output in the UK sector is simply wrong. My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley accepted that, although almost as if it were a side issue. The company that he was talking about does some of its work in Romania.</p>
	<p pid=".154.2/4">All the other companies that bid were also looking at placing the work for the contract elsewhere, outside the United Kingdom. That is the reality that we face, and there is nothing new about it. That is standard practice, not only in that procurement stream, but in high-street procurement.</p>
