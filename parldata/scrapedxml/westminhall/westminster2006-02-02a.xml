	<p pid="a.146.1/1">There is evidence that Indian graduates, whether they are educated in India or in thiscountry, have access to high-quality jobs. In technology, business and commerce in India, there is a follow-through to the available opportunities. I do not criticise that development but it is a challenge for us, which is why we need to respond and to ensure that every person in this country has the opportunity to develop their skills. At present the Government help more than 6 million people to improve their skills every year. Raising the proportion of workers trained in industry can bring a 4 per cent. increase in added value per worker and a 1.6 per cent. increase in wages. This is very much a win-win situation. Because we regard skills as so important, we commissioned Lord Sandy Leitch to undertake an analysis of our skills profile as we move towards 2020.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-02a.154.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1629" speakername="Boris Johnson" colnum="154"  time="015:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060202/halltext/60202h01.htm#60202h01_spnew20">
	<p pid="a.154.0/1">I congratulate the Minister on securing this important debate and on the great verve with which he set out his case for greater emphasis to be placed on training and improving our skills base. He made his case passionately. No one in the House could disagree with him. I agree with 95 per cent. of what he had to say. However, when will he live up to the Government's promise about further education colleges and make sure that students at Henley college are funded on the same basis as students elsewhere in Oxfordshire and receive the same capitation support? I hope that he will return to the matter when he sums up.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/2">I admire greatly the urgency with which the Minister put forward his argument. I want to alert him to a detail in the Conservative party's arrangements. Such is the importance that we attach to higher and further education that we have divided the business of responding to his great brief. I intend to cover only higher education. My learned colleague, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" name="John Hayes">the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes)</phrase>, will deal with further education. I hope that he will catch your eye, Mr. Amess, in due course and get some of the balls back over the net on the further education front.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/3">I want to deal with the relationship between the employer and higher education. It is an important subject and, in a collegiate sort of way, I want to tease out the Minister's thinking and find out how far I can encourage him to agree with me about certain matters, and see whether he agrees with me as much as I agree with him. About 150 years ago, Cardinal Newman produced a definition of a university and, as the Minister will doubtless recall, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/4" class="indent">&quot;It is a seat of wisdom, a light of the world, a minister of the faith, an Alma Mater of the rising generation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/5">He added:</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/6" class="indent">&quot;It is a place where inquiry is pushed forward, and discoveries verified and perfected, and rashness rendered innocuous, and error exposed, by the collision of mind with mind, and knowledge with knowledge&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/7">Cardinal Newman also said that a university is</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/8" class="indent">&quot;the place to which a thousand schools make contributions; in which the intellect may safely range and speculate, sure to find its equal in some antagonist activity&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/9">and that universities are</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/10" class="indent">&quot;great centres of pilgrimage and throng&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/11">in which the student makes use of</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/12" class="indent">&quot;the ancient method, of oral instruction, of present communication between man and man&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/13">and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/14">I find Cardinal Newman's vision of a university still quite inspiring, although it is completely out of date.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/15">The story of British higher education institutions in the past 50 years has been one of fantastic success. As the Minister rightly said, it is also a story of expansion. When my parents met at university in the 1960s, not long before I was born, only 4 per cent. of relevant cohorts were at university. There are now 43 per cent. That means that our assumptions of what a university must be have changed, and the taxpayer is now paying the overwhelming share of the costs. There are about 2.3 million students at British universities. I am sure we consider that to be a fantastic investment for the United Kingdom. Higher generates &pound;4 billion in export earnings alone and is wonderful for students and their future prospects. However, we must ensure that it maximises the rewards for society as a whole. That is an entirely reasonable thing for this or any other Government to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/16">It would be wrong to be too crudely utilitarian. At Question Time a couple of weeks ago, I made my first attempt to find common ground with the Minister. Does he share my preferred definition of academic freedom, which is the one enunciated by the great American Supreme Court justice, Felix Frankfurter, in 1957? I shall repeat it&mdash;I am sure that the Minister knows it, but there may be hon. Members present who do not.&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1571" name="Clive Efford">The hon. Member for Eltham (Clive Efford)</phrase> says something from a sedentary position, which I am afraid I missed, but I shall repeat Felix Frankfurter's definition of academic freedom for his benefit, if for no one else's. He defined it as an institution's freedom</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/17" class="indent">&quot;to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach, what may be taught, how it should be taught and who may be admitted for study.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/18">Speaking for myself, &quot;Ich bin ein Frankfurter&quot;, as I have had occasion to say recently. Does the Minister also subscribe to that definition? He can say so now if he chooses to, but if he prefers to reserve his position on whether he is a Frankfurter, I will happily wait and see. I think that it is a very good definition of academic freedom.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/19">We all understand that there are many courses and disciplines that have no obvious vocational importance, but whose study may none the less be of huge benefit to the economy. At the same time, it is obviously the function of government to encourage and facilitate maximum co-operation between employers and institutions of higher and further education. There are some phenomenal success stories in that department, where synergy is taking place between employers and institutions of higher education with or without government interference.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/20">We all know&mdash;if not, I will tell hon. Members&mdash;what happened in the 1980s when Kumar Bhattacharyya, now Lord Bhattacharyya, arrived at Warwick university. Engineering companies were haemorrhaging jobs in the area and the future looked bleak. There was an innovative vice-chancellor hoping to make his mark, and he made Bhattacharyya professor of manufacturing systems and let him get on with it. Some 25 years later the international manufacturing centre occupied six buildings on campus, having long outgrown the department that spawned it. It is the headquarters of the Warwick Manufacturing Group, formed as a club of largely midlands-based companies that put money into the university in return for research facilities and a stream of well trained graduates. The annual revenue of the operation is well over &pound;80 million, and more than 5,000 postgraduates are educated every year through its worldwide network of operations. I read last week that the Warwick Manufacturing Group has opened a new school in Singapore in co-operation with the Singapore institute of management.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/21">The same phenomenon can increasingly be seen across not just the leading 19 universities but other higher education institutions. Anybody who goes to Loughborough university knows of the dense interconnection between that institution and the JCB plant nearby. The Minister will know what is going on in York, where there are incubators where people can set up cutting-edge technology and science ventures. If they go bust, too bad&mdash;they come and go. I could go on to give countless examples of ways in which universities have been at the forefront of innovation, commercial success and the devising of drugs and patents. Atracurium is an example that springs to my mind; it was devised by scientists at Strathclyde university and is now used in half of all heart operations worldwide as a muscle relaxant.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/22">From the point of view of big business, one can see the attraction of such co-operation with universities. Their corporate laboratories are increasingly uneconomic and are closing down, and they cannot afford to have specialists in every field. We have come a long way since the days of the Bell laboratories, when AT&amp;T had a huge monopoly and could recruit Nobel scientists in this, that and the other, and simply ask them to get on with it. No single pharmaceutical company could now afford to conduct work on all the aspects of the human genome.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/23">We are moving away from research being carried out by great commercial interests in the privacy of their own laboratories towards what is known, in the buzz words, as open innovation. That is a wonderful development. Anybody who knows anything about innovation says that it is not a linear process; it benefits hugely from accident and serendipity, the chance running together of experts from more than one field. It might be that in the common room, or whatever turns out to be the incubator, somebody who knows about computer sciences meets somebody who knows about biology, who meets a third who has a business application in his head&mdash;that is how innovations are generated. That is why the Cambridge area now receives one eighth of the venture capital coming into western Europe, although it has only 0.1 per cent. of the population.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/24">The Minister was absolutely on the money when he described universities as being of huge economic importance to the areas that they are in. Nottingham has 46,000 students. It used to be known as a place where bicycles, motor bikes and heaven knows what were made; now it is a place where 46,000 students contribute hugely to the economy. Such centres are the intellectual resources for entire areas and for the businesses around them.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/25">How should we support such connections? What should Government do to encourage such synergy? What sort of principles should we apply to the question? I should like to see how far we can agree. There is no use in pretending that all universities are equally good at everything.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-02a.159.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="159"  time="015:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060202/halltext/60202h01.htm#60202h01_spnew25">
	<p pid="a.159.0/1">I, too, start by agreeing with most of what the Minister said. I hope that we will have a stimulating debate, and I am relieved that more people have attended, because initially as I was listening to the Minister and thinking, &quot;I do not disagree with much of that,&quot; I also thought that interest would not last long.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/2">However, I hope the Minister is prepared to accept that there are questions to be asked. That does not mean that we are rubbishing what the Government are doing, but surely it is right to be critical about how well particular schemes are working, or about the size of the problem. I hope he takes my comments in that way. The skills are essential to our economy and society. The link between national productivity and international competitiveness is obvious, but we also need to focus on the broader benefits that are contributing to the quality of our lives as individuals, in our communities and in society as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/3">As the Minister indicated, the scope of the problem of our skills deficit is enormous. The Government are having to make up for lack of investment in the past in this incredibly important area. We seem to have been speaking about this matter for long enough, but it seems that it is only in the past few years, with the various strategies, that there has been a real attempt to get to grips with it. The 2004 national employers skills survey shows that one in five establishments reported skills gaps in their work force and some 1.5 million workers&mdash;7 per cent. of the work force&mdash;were described by employers as not being fully proficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/4">There has been progress. The 2001 survey showed that 23 per cent. of employers reported a skills gap and 9 per cent. of the work force was described as not fully proficient. An estimated 3.5 million people go to work each day without being able to read very well. The CBI has calculated the effect of poor basic skills on the UK economy at some &pound;10 billion per year. When talking about the large sums of money that need investing, we must have regard to the cost of not investing in this important sphere.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/5">As Leitch reports, more than one third of adults in the UK still do not have a basic school-leaving qualification, which is double the proportion in Canada and in Germany. Some 5 million people have no qualifications at all. The Government have set ambitious targets for 2020, but worryingly it seems that Leitch's conclusion will be that even if they are met, we will still be far short of having a world-class skilled work force. The challenge ahead is getting bigger.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/6">We have made enormous strides in expanding higher education and I congratulate the Government on that, although we are still lagging other countries. However, it is worrying&mdash;I am picking up on what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1629" name="Boris Johnson">the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)</phrase> said&mdash;that a report last year by Manpower estimated that just over half of graduates felt that they were entering the work force with the necessary skills, while only 37 per cent. of employers were satisfied that the new graduates had the right skills for the job. They are likely to acquire those skills on the job, but even so, that is a worrying gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/7">I am afraid that I am going to refer to some uncorrected evidence from the Public Accounts Committee last week&mdash;I believe I have to tell the House that&mdash;from an interesting sitting in which the Committee questioned the National Audit Office report on employers' perspectives on improving skills for employment. Mr. Bell quoted the Leitch report, talking about the</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/8" class="indent">&quot;tripartite responsibility on skills development&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/9">That is a good phrase, although I would have included the words &quot;plus one&quot;, as I will explain. Mr. Bell continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The individual has a responsibility contribute to&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/11">the skills development. He went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The Government have a responsibility if they want to create a healthy and competitive economy and business also has responsibility. It would be good to encourage employers not just to say 'What are the Government going to do for me?' but to say, 'How can you contribute alongside employees and Government to become more competitive?'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/13">The title of our debate is a bit narrow, because we have to think about the interaction between the individual, the Government and business, as well as a fourth strand, which I would add in&mdash;the providers of the skills training, whether we are talking about further or higher education or public or private provision. There is a lot involved in the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/14">The skills agenda is covered by two Departments. There is also an enormous number of Government bodies involved in the delivery of skills. That is the plus side, for those who like local delivery. However, the enormous number of bodies leads to some questions: is there effective focus on improving skills? Is money being spent to best effect? Are businesses getting the improvements they demand?</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/15">The CBI often expresses the view that the education system should ensure that people leave school with the proper skills. Obviously, we need to address that issue, but as Leitch points out, we must also harness and develop the skills of those who have already left school and who will make up an important component of the 2020 work force. Those are two big issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/16">I think I am allowed to say this: it is a pity that the Government have not fully adopted the Tomlinson proposals for schools. Parity of esteem between vocational and academic studies starting at age 14 is vital. Our education system needs a fundamental overhaul, although that should be phased in. There is good news, however, as companies such as JCB and Rolls-Royce are involved in the design and delivery of foundation degrees, and other companies are involved in the development of the new vocational diplomas. So there is a lot of good news, but could we do better if we really took the Tomlinson proposals on board and were brave enough to implement his recommendations?</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/17">The National Audit Office report makes it clear that improving skills for employment and ensuring that employers get what they want require the co-operation and involvement of those employers. I shall touch on some points made by that very good report. Employers are a diverse group&mdash;that has not been picked up so far in the debate. Small businesses provide a high proportion of our total employment, and it is obviously harder for a small business&mdash;with less than, say, five or 50 employees&mdash;to provide training in the first place. There is also an enormous variation in employer-supported training across the different sectors. So, there is no simple equation; we cannot pour the money in and expect employers to co-operate more. The approach should be more targeted.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/18">As the National Audit Office pointed out:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/19" class="indent">&quot;Recent research estimates that, on average, an eight per cent. increase in the proportion of trained workers can lead to a 0.6 per cent. increase in UK productivity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/20">I think that the Minister quoted similar figures. Given all the benefits and the effect throughout the economy, can we afford not to invest? Obviously, training is expensive, so what will make employers want to invest? They will want direct economic benefits and training that meets their needs. It is difficult to tackle the problem of the lack of level 2 qualifications, which some employers might be reluctant to invest in, and it is too easy to blame the schools system.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/21">We need to make a breakthrough on the issue, which is why I support the strategy of focusing on young people and adults who do not have a level 2 qualification. I have said that to the Minister directly, although I do not like all the side effects of that strategy. There will be a market failure if employers do not have the incentive to invest in level 2 qualifications. I can see no other way around the problem than Government intervention in what is clearly a market failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/22">A few problems, however, are thrown up by the free provision of basic skills and first level 2 qualifications. We have already heard about the impact on the other courses previously provided by colleges of further education. I am concerned that the focus on basic skills provision has cut provision of some other courses that might provide, or lead up to, basic skills in a more user-friendly way for people who have not participated in education for a long time, or who find it hard to participate. The colleges had a real point to make: the ones that are accredited for finance might not be the first stepping stone for some students or adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/23">Also, much of the large amount of money that the Government allocated has been used up on high numbers of 16 to 19-year-olds, who, some say, might reasonably be expected to gain their qualifications at school. I do not think that that is a reason why money should not be invested, but while we are evaluating, we have to appreciate that there are two groups&mdash;those who have just left school and adults&mdash;and that it will take a lot of money to solve the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/24">There is also the matter of what we might see as dead-weight investment; the Government have conveniently provided an opt-out for some employers who might previously have invested the money themselves. I hope that most employers feel that their training money has been freed up, perhaps for investment in level 3. There is a more obvious direct economic benefit to a company from investing in level 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/25">I hope that the Minister does not throw this question back at me, because I am generally not very keen on targets. As far as I know, the Government have not set a target for the number of adults achieving level 3 in vocational or academic subjects. It strikes me that that is a gap in the array of targets, and if a target is missing, that can lead to distortion in investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/26">The Institute of Financial Services looked into the impact of the employer training pilots and did not reach incredibly optimistic conclusions, although I read the Minister's foreword on the subject. The IFS identifies only a small positive effect, and also highlights quality issues. I hope the Minister will respond on that point. Also, there is the roll-out of train2gain, but obviously there were big issues with the pilots. How will he tackle those?</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/27">On the employer training pilots, the principle of skills brokers is absolutely excellent, as is getting employers to talk to other employers. I want briefly to refer to my local college. I was employed there for quite a long time many years ago, so I am in regular contact. I asked the college for some input on its experience locally, and the principal provided me with the college's &quot;working with employers&quot; strategy for 2006&ndash;07. The first paragraph says:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/28" class="indent">&quot;It is the intention of Bournemouth and Poole College to become the automatic first point of contact for employers in the sub-region, as the valued partners of choice for developing the skills of their workforce and supporting local economic development. Our clear message to employers is 'Your business is our business'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/29">It is a very good document, and there are some good examples in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/30">I also considered the university of Bournemouth and spoke to a local leading employer, the chief executive of Hamworthy Engineering, who sits on the board of Bournemouth university and the regional development agency. All that networking and all those links are incredibly important. The university has good roots for continuous professional development.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/31">I want to refer to a case study on Hamworthy Engineering's website, because it brings the &quot;tripartite plus one&quot; strategy to life:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/32" class="indent">&quot;Mary is a degree-qualified engineer working in a medium sized engineering company in Dorset. She graduated some 10 years ago and has risen through the ranks from Junior Engineer to her latest promotion as Project Manager. Mary will manage a team of 10 people . . . and a budget of &pound;750,000. She feels she is lacking skills and understanding in contractual law, and wants to boost her confidence by learning about management accounting. She also feels the need to update her technical knowledge in the specialised area of object oriented design. Mary works full-time so she has a limited amount of time . . . to devote to studying. Mary has embarked on her own, tailored professional development programme . . . Her employer will be sponsoring her study, as part of their staff development plan.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/33">When Mary finishes, she will have</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/34" class="indent">&quot;achieved her personal and career aims, but also gained a postgraduate certificate in Professional Vocational Development&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/35">That is excellent. I also have experience of incubator units, mentioned by the hon. Member for Henley, at the arts institute and at the university.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/36">The Association of Colleges has made a few points to which I can particularly relate. It calls on the Government to adjust the pace of implementation, and I throw that at the Minister for consideration. It would like colleges to be allowed to be funded to offer qualifications in bite-size chunks tailored to local needs, rather than only long, whole qualifications that local employers may not want to buy. I have some sympathy with that argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/37">The association would like national prescription, which does not fit every regional locality, to be reduced to give more local flexibility. In particular, it wants colleges to offer individuals essential stepping-stones training from basic skills to level 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/38">We have mentioned the Foster review, which identifies the fact that experience of employer and college relationships is patchy, although I hope that my own local college is a good example. We also have to be aware that only a small proportion of employers have contact with FE colleges. There are important relationships with private providers, which is important. The Foster report mentions specifically the centres of vocational excellence and the skills academies, which are good examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/39">This issue is a real challenge. We should look not only at the employers' perspective, but at how all four strands interact. There is an issue about how to use the money in the most effective way, although I accept that we have started from a low base. It is very encouraging that the Government are seeking to close the gap between further education funding and schools funding for the same age group, but there is still more to be done in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/40">In the state sector, streams of money still come from lots of different directions. Can we simplify that funding? Like all MPs, I know how off-putting it is to make complicated and bureaucratic applications or bids for public funds&mdash;it takes an awfully long time to deal with the forms. We ought to be proud of how our further education and higher education colleges are developing and taking on the challenges of meeting the skills agenda. However, they need a great deal of support and a little less hassle.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-02a.163.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1571" speakername="Clive Efford" colnum="163"  time="015:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060202/halltext/60202h01.htm#60202h01_spnew26">
	<p pid="a.163.0/1">I shall speak mainly about my local further education college, but before that I want to pay tribute to my local university. The university of Greenwich hosted a business forum in partnership with me, the local chamber of commerce and the Greenwich Enterprise Board. We had discussions with a number of local businesses about the business opportunities in our area resulting from the regeneration of the Thames Gateway, the developments on the Greenwich peninsula, the investment in our local transport infrastructure&mdash;essential for Crossrail&mdash;and, of course, the Olympics. Furthermore, we have heard recently that the tour de France may pass through our borough.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/2">There are a lot of opportunities for businesses and a lot of training needs, and the university of Greenwich was instrumental in bringing those people together. It is working extremely hard to be part of the local community and to play its part in supporting local businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/3">Last week, I visited my local community college&mdash;Greenwich community college&mdash;and spoke to the principal, with this debate in mind. I want to highlight some innovative things that the college is doing for my local community and for businesses there. The key change in further education is flexibility. For too long, we have had straight corridors of education that do not necessarily join up with the needs of businesses. Those are the forms of education that we provide and the routes that we have traditionally gone down, but when students leave college and seek a job, they find that their qualifications do not match up with business needs. That is why the Government's train2gain initiative is essential, as is the flexibility of FE colleges in recognising and meeting the training needs in their local community and marrying them up with the needs of local employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/4">I will give an example of flexibility in meeting needs at community level. I have spoken about this before in the House, but it is an excellent example of the community and further education coming together. I chaired the neighbourhood renewal programme in the south of my constituency. One of the schools had a head who was very energetic and wanted to engage with the whole community, not just the primary school pupils. Her idea was to introduce an adult learning centre in the primary school. She managed to beg, borrow and steal some cash, but the neighbourhood renewal programme came along and provided the financial impetus to make the idea a reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/5">I presented the prizes at the school at the end of the year. We went through the nursery year and all the years of the primary school, but then we got to the adults. In the same presentation, we gave prizes to mums, dads and grandparents who had taken part in basic skills training or family learning, or had worked for GCSEs, as a consequence of the community college becoming involved with the local primary school to provide those education opportunities for the whole community.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/6">When I spoke to the parents afterwards, I asked what had got them involved. First, it was the mutual support from other parents in the school and, secondly, they saw their children moving on to secondary education as an opportunity for them to seek employment. One turned round and said to me, &quot;You lay on the training and I will do it, because I am going to get a job when my child is more independent and in secondary school.&quot; Other parents wanted to improve the education of their children. By improving their own education, they were able to pass that on and assist their children. Some felt that there were gaps in their education that they had never filled, and they were going back and filling them.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/7">In terms of raising aspiration on the whole estate, improving the opportunities for the children within the school and improving the economy&mdash;because people were making themselves more employable&mdash;I could not put a value on the relatively small sum that we put in to furnish the premises and buy the computers, but we need more of that flexibility in the further education system.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/8">As I have already said, there are enormous opportunities in my area. The development of the Thames Gateway, the Olympics, the development of the peninsula, Crossrail and the docklands light railway coming to Woolwich mean that people will have greater opportunities to seek employment, and they will need the training opportunities to make the best of that situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/9">My local FE college is also making a great effort to build links with local businesses. It provides training to 20 small businesses through the train2gain programme, as well as to 20 medium-sized businesses and 17 large businesses in a variety of sectors, including care, catering, engineering and construction. It has even trained classroom assistants, which takes us back to the school that provided the adult learning centre. Some parents there have improved their qualifications to the point where they are training to become classroom assistants&mdash;putting back into the local community some of what has been invested in them.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/10">The large companies that are being supported by my FE college have a range of training needs in customer services, team leading, heritage and visitor services, and business administration, but the key area where the college has been very innovative in its approach is sports and leisure. The millennium dome is now owned by Anschutz and, as we speak, a 36,000-seater stadium is being built within it, which will provide a venue for one of the major events of the 2012 Olympics. In the intervening period, major sporting events, pop concerts and a range of leisure activities will be held there. There is the potential for a casino to be built in the dome, and many hotels and leisure and recreational facilities will open up in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/11">Some years ago, my FE college positioned itself to provide training in that field. It got together with Charlton Athletic football club and opened the London Leisure College, which is based in the Charlton Athletic stadium. It provides training for the whole range of leisure, tourism and recreational activities, and has also entered into partnership with Greenwich Leisure Ltd.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/12">I am very proud about that, because when I was a member of Greenwich council, without getting too political about it, a certain Government were determined to close down many local authority facilities. One way that we got round some of our financial difficulties with our leisure centres was to set up an arm's-length co-operative, which became Greenwich Leisure Ltd. and is now one of the biggest leisure concerns in the country, as well as one of the most successful co-operatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/13">GLL works in close partnership with my FE college and employs 1,000 full-time and 2,500 casual staff. It runs 50 centres and is in 12 partnerships with local authorities and businesses. The FE college in my area is its main training provider. All the training opportunities are provided in close co-operation with Greenwich Leisure Ltd. Indeed, it has one of its own leisure facilities on the Charlton Athletic site. The college provides a wide range of training opportunities in the sports and leisure field with GLL.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/14">Across London bridge, GLL provides a range of sporting, recreational and leisure facilities. It has been invited to run facilities for local authorities as well as going into partnership with businesses in the private sector. The London Leisure College provides accredited training and statutory qualifications, including first aid certificates, the Institute of Sport and Recreation Management supervisor's certificate and pool plant operator's certificate, the Institute of Qualified Lifeguards pool supervision certificate, central YMCA qualifications for fitness instructors and the Amateur Swimming Association swimming teacher's certificates levels 1 and 2. It trains approximately 750 people a year in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/15">The first class leisure level 1 full-time programme, jointly delivered between Greenwich community college and GLL, delivers 60 17-year-old sessional staff through three partners per year, with another 20 planned to be added in 2006&ndash;07. The first class leisure level 2 programme delivers 42 qualified 18-year-old permanent employees per year, and a further 28 will be added in 2006&ndash;07. The intensive recreation assistant academy contributes 60 new 18-plus fully qualified recreational assistants per year, and a further 180 are planned in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/16">London Leisure College is London's leading dual employer. It offers further education collaboration and also designs and delivers learning opportunities and qualifications to meet the needs of the learner and the industry alike. In collaboration with a number of London's leisure employers&mdash;the national governing bodies of sports and the SkillsActive sector skills council, and not just Greenwich Leisure Ltd.&mdash;it is submitting a bid to the Department for Education and Skills to become the London regional hub of a national skills academy for the sport and leisure industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/17">The college is one of the leading lights in its field. It has demonstrated that by anticipating the regeneration of the peninsula and the Thames Gateway. Understanding what the profile of its end-users is likely to be in terms of that regeneration, it has positioned itself to provide the training opportunities for local people that will enable them to make the most of the huge change that has occurred. Winning the 2012 bid has only added to the success of that strategy, but&mdash;there is always a but&mdash;as other speakers have said, FE colleges nevertheless face one or two difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/18">A great deal of money is going into further education, and the changes have been possible only because of that investment. If we look back a short time, we see a completely different picture of FE&mdash;the problems were different only a few years ago. Now, the income for the college is focused on students aged 16 to 19, to the detriment of older students, which places the college in some difficulty. I want to draw the issue to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister, because it is causing concern in FE colleges.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/19">The college's income for the year to <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July 2006</phrase> is approximately &pound;18.5 million, of which &pound;13.8 million, or 75 per cent., comes from the Learning and Skills Council. Of that&mdash;I am sorry to bombard hon. Members with so many figures&mdash;&pound;8.8 million, or 63 per cent., is for adult learners. For 2006&ndash;07, adult funding is forecast to be reduced by &pound;300,000. In real terms, adjusting for inflation and salary increases, that is the equivalent of &pound;550,000. A reduction of that magnitude equates to a loss of 167 full-time equivalent students. The focus on 16 to 19-year-olds is to be welcomed, but there is a knock-on impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/20">We should consider the issues in the context of the overall improvements and increasing funding. Let me quote another statistic. There has been a transformation in the unemployment figures in the past nine years. The Office for National Statistics summary for December shows a huge reduction over that time for non-seasonally adjusted computerised claims by those aged over 25 years and unemployed for more than 18 months&mdash;83.8 per cent. for the UK as a whole and 81.3 per cent. for London. That has been a consistent factor in unemployment: London has resisted the Government's attempts to reduce the rate to that for the rest of the country. There is an underlying long-term unemployment problem in London, which must be considered in the context of a massive reduction. There is still a problem, however.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/21">Further education colleges are a key tool in tackling long-term unemployment and providing opportunities for people to train and make themselves more attractive to potential employers. The impact of funding issues on older further education students can only make tackling the underlying trend more problematic. I urge the Minister to take that concern on board. We are right to focus on the opportunities that further education can provide for young people, but we also need to recognise its vital role in providing opportunities for people of all ages who are trying to get the qualifications they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/22">If the Minister ever wanted to visit Greenwich community college or the facilities of London Leisure College at Charlton Athletic, he would learn a lot and see what can be achieved in real partnership between businesses, the local authority, training providers and the local community when people have a vision and an understanding of what the community needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/23">Charlton Athletic football club has been incredibly far sighted in providing for the community, in its acknowledgement of the ideas put to it by local authorities and training providers, in how it sees its role at the heart of the community as facilitating the big change that is coming about and in the active role it is playing. The further education college is the real driver for what is happening. It set up the London Leisure College to make the most of the employment opportunities that will result from the expansion of the leisure and recreation industry in the area. If the Minister wants to see that at first hand, he will be very welcome.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-02a.167.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" speakername="John Hayes" colnum="167"  time="016:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060202/halltext/60202h01.htm#60202h01_spnew27">
	<p pid="a.167.0/1">What an immense pleasure it is, Mr. Amess, to contribute to a debate under your chairmanship, and how appropriate it is that a patriot like you should be sitting under a portrait of King Alfred. Whenever I think of King Alfred, I think of my constituency and the noble town of Crowland, the birthplace of Hereward the Wake, but that is a matter for another debate, another time.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/2">I have three things to discuss in the debate: engagement, appropriateness and effectiveness. We have already heard a good deal about those, by allusion. I want to end my remarks by speaking about a dream&mdash;not &quot;The Dream of Fair Women&quot;, like that of Henry Williamson, although like you, no doubt, Mr. Amess, I have had many dreams of fair women&mdash;but a dream about a future that is skilled, in which we can deliver the parity of esteem that Governments of all political persuasions have sought over decades and perhaps a generation, but certainly during my lifetime.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/3">Engagement in education and training is a matter of profound concern, with which the Minister dealt at some length. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1629" name="Boris Johnson">the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)</phrase> also dealt with it. It is true that there is a high level of engagement in comparison with previous years and that 75 per cent. of 16 to 18-year-olds are in education or training. However, the Minister will be as concerned as I am about what are rather unfortunately described as NEETs&mdash;young people not in education, employment or training&mdash;and will, I hope, discuss them in his concluding remarks. The 10 per cent. figure masks those about whom we do not know&mdash;Connexions has no real record of them and is not certain where they are. To some degree, the figure also hides regional variations. In the north-east of England, for example, the number of those who are not engaged in education, employment or training rises to about 20 to 25 per cent. of the relevant young people. Engagement among young people is therefore vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/4">I have already mentioned engaging groups that are hard to get at. In an intervention on the Minister, I mentioned my concerns about older potential learners&mdash;those who perhaps do not have basic skills. The report from the Public Accounts Committee on those who are innumerate and illiterate, which we received last week, was shocking. It showed that tens of millions of our citizens are innumerate or illiterate, and that is a significant problem in my constituency. However, in addition to those people who need to re-engage to gain basic skills, there are others who need to be reskilled to meet the demands of a rapidly changing economy. As I said in my intervention, all political parties and all hon. Members present will be aware of those difficulties. I think that the Minister will also be aware of them, and he might want to say something more about the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/5">Also on engagement, there is the matter of the completion of apprenticeships. The Minister said that apprenticeship numbers have risen, and they have. The Government are to be congratulated on that, but the problem of completions remains. It is, in part, a feature of the nature of the placements. In the retail sector, for example, completions are a bigger problem than in some of the more traditional skills areas, such as construction and engineering.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/6">The problem might also be a feature of the practical issues involved in people getting to where they need to be. In an area such as Lincolnshire, in a glorious place such as South Holland and the Deepings, even the delight of living in the fens is mitigated to some degree by the difficulty of getting about. Travelling 10, 15 or even 20 miles to engage in education or training can be a fairly arduous business for a young person. That makes it quite difficult to maintain engagement, particularly over a long time, and I am told by the experts in the field that that can affect completions on education courses and apprenticeships. I am not really surprised by that.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/7">There is also a difficulty&mdash;I sense that this is an aside, Mr. Amess, but it is relevant&mdash;in terms of vocational education for younger people. The Minister will know that, in the 14-plus, group the business of engagement between colleges and schools in rural areas of the kind I am thinking about is sometimes inhibited by the difficulty in getting young people to where they need to be. I shall talk, when I speak of my dream, about bringing learning to the learners. That is a critical challenge for all those of us who are interested in the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/8">Yesterday I was speaking about such matters with the Minister's esteemed junior colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" name="Phil Hope">the hon. Member for Corby (Phil Hope)</phrase> who is also enthusiastic about them. We were talking about construction industry skills and I was able, although not pleased, to point out to the statutory instrument Committee that, during the 1970s, 100,000 people were trained each year in a range of construction industry skills, but that, by 2004, the figure had declined to fewer than 40,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/9">The problems of engagement are a real issue in certain sectors. That is significant because of the need, for example, to build houses. As Kate Barker pointed out in her report on housing supply, one of the inhibitors of her plan to build many more houses, which the Government have, I think, largely welcomed, has been the lack of skills in that sector. We need to talk about engagement on a sector-by-sector, area-by-area basis and to consider what might act as disincentives to people engaging in and completing education and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/10">The second matter is appropriateness. The National Audit Office report has already been referred to and I do not want to be tedious in what has otherwise been a lively and interesting discussion. However, it is worth pointing out that the National Audit Office makes it absolutely clear that, from the employer's point of view, there are barriers to improving employer engagement in training that can be summarised pretty straightforwardly: employers want a simple way of getting the best advice on skills training for their staff; they want appropriate training that meets their needs; they want supply to be in close line with demand; they want more incentives to train their staff; and they want influence in skills training without getting weighed down by bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/11">The report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Through its Agenda for Change, the Learning and Skills Council is seeking to enhance the reputation of colleges so that they are more often the partners of choice for employers looking to develop their workforce. A number of factors can, however, undermine the effectiveness of training in tackling skills shortages: for example, qualifications available may not necessarily directly meet employers' needs; in a particular geographic area there may be shortages of skilled trainers; and there may be a need to use expensive capital equipment for training which is not available.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/13">So, we know that the report deals with some of the issues of appropriateness that the Government need to tackle now and later in the implementation of their policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/14">The Foster report has also been mentioned and it deserves amplification. We have talked implicitly about the link between further education, higher education, other training providers and commerce and industry. The Foster report makes it clear that there are significant problems with further education both in the terms that I described earlier&mdash;the fact that FE colleges often try to do too much, and that is why I mentioned greater specialism&mdash;and in terms of FE's links with the world of work. Those links vary. We heard about some of the good colleges that have managed to develop effective links with the world of work&mdash;the businesses in their area&mdash;but the Foster report makes it clear that that effectiveness is patchy. We need to do much more work to ensure that what we do in the education system&mdash;not just colleges but also secondary education&mdash;is closely linked to the demands of the local employment base and the assumptions of local employers. I may talk later about how we might achieve that but it is certainly the imperative that seems to shout loudly from Sir Andrew Foster's observations about further education.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/15">It would be remiss of me not to say something about effectiveness. Hon. Members will worry about the barriers to engagement and completion in the difficult-to-get-at groups, and about the deficiencies in basic skills that were identified by several pieces of recent research. We anticipate that they will be addressed by the report on the Leitch review, which will be published later this year and to which we are all looking forward with bated breath.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/16">According to the Government's own Leitch review of skills, even if they meet their own target on skills by 2020:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/17" class="indent">&quot;At least 4 million adults will still not have literacy skills expected of an 11 year old, at least 12 million will be without numeracy skills at this level (equivalent to three in ten adults) . . . 6.5 million adults will not have qualifications at the equivalent level to five good GCSEs. In comparative terms, the UK will continue to be an 'average performer'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/18">Those comments are shocking. The problem that we face is not simply that the lack of basic skills inhibits quality of life for the individuals concerned. It also has a collective effect on our competitiveness. We need skilled people to be effective economically and we need a skilled work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.0/19">I hinted in my earlier interventions that the problem is exacerbated by demographic factors. The population is ageing, and that is adding to the skills shortage. It is almost as though the Minister is desperately trying to pour more water into the tank while it is draining out at the other end because of the changing demographics. It might be draining out faster than he can refill it. I would not want him to end up with a dry tank in terms of skills. He needs a rich, full, bubbling tank of skills so that he can draw on it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-02a.173.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" colnum="173"  time="016:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060202/halltext/60202h01.htm#60202h01_spnew38">
	<p pid="a.173.8/1">With the leave of the House, I shall take this opportunity to sum up the debate. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1629" name="Boris Johnson">the hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)</phrase>, who led for the Opposition, that the debate has been constructive. There has been strong consensus, and that should not be a cause for concern, because it broadly shows&mdash;I would say this, would I not?&mdash;that the Government's policy is moving in the right direction. It probably shows also that in the areas in which we are deficient, the problem is sufficiently difficult that it is not easy to come up with other propositions. However, I certainly welcome the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/2">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the funding gap between further education colleges and sixth forms in schools. It has been an issue for a good period, and during our time in government, we have sought to tackle the problem. From talking to FE principals throughout the country, I sense that the announcement made by the Secretary of State at the Association of Colleges conference in November has been welcomed. The commitment during the next financial year to reduce the funding gap from an estimated 13 per cent. to 8 per cent., then to 5 per cent., and then, as resources allow, to move beyond that has been welcomed. There are some anomalies between the funding of school sixth forms and FE colleges, and we have a commitment to tackle that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/3">The hon. Gentleman compared the proportion of young people going to university today&mdash;43 to 44 per cent.&mdash; with the proportion when his parents went to university. We should all regard that expansion of higher education as a force for good and something to celebrate. Inevitably, however, it brings in its train a debate about how to fund such a massive expansion. That is why we took the difficult but justifiable decision to introduce this year a new finance system with variable fees, which is backed up by an improved system of student financial support.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/4">The hon. Gentleman asked whether &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot;. I want to consider the details of that definition carefully. However, I concur with the broad thrust of his argument that there are significant benefits from university autonomy in this country. If we compare the model in Britain with those elsewhere in the world, its quality, independence and investment, and the connections that it has brought, have been of significant benefit. In the Hampton Court declaration during our recent presidency of the European Union, we underlined the importance of the role of universities in helping the European Union to meet the Lisbon goals, in terms of increased productivity and prosperity. We should be working on the British higher education model and sharing it with our colleagues elsewhere in the European Union, because it has been a success story.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/5">I agree that not every course has an immediately realisable vocational outcome. Clearly, there should be a link with the world of work and business, but not every course will immediately have that link.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/6">I am saying that I agree far too much today, but I also agree that not all universities are equally good at everything. The sector is diverse, and that is a strength in our higher education system. Different institutions pursue different specialisms, which is to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/7">The hon. Gentleman commented on our research funding approach. Government policy is to fund excellence, but through that process there has been a greater concentration of research in terms of the number of institutions covered. That process is not unique to Britain; it has been taking place across the advanced world. However, the higher education innovation fund initiative is a means of tackling that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/8">However research is distributed, one of the key issues is to ensure that institutions that are research intensive have good links with those that are not, so that academics and teachers in non-research intensive institutions have experience of and contact with departments that are undertaking significant programmes of research. There is a link between research and teaching and a benefit to be gained from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/9">The hon. Gentleman went on to talk about whether there is a model through which to get more businesses to contribute directly to the costs of higher education. We would like that to develop. With the Secretary of State's funding letter to the HEFCE, which was made public this week, we give a strong steer in that direction, not so much to get businesses to fund students while they go to university, although I encourage businesses to do that&mdash;there is money in the settlement for the forthcoming financial year&mdash;but to encourage, on a match-funding basis, much greater engagement by employers directly with higher education institutions. If we can get a greater match between business and universities, and a university can come in, work with a business and accredit existing training and educational programmes to contribute towards a higher education qualification, not only will that mean significant upskilling within the economy and particular sectors, but it is one of the most effective things that we could do to broaden participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/10">The hon. Gentleman commented on the importance of STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and mathematics. There are concerns, but in this academic year there has, for the first time in a while, been a significant and welcome uplift&mdash;about 10 per cent.&mdash;in students undertaking those subjects. We need to have a better understanding of what has gone on with teaching and learning in science. There are 120,000 more students studying science-related degrees than there were eight years ago, but there has been a shift in the kind of science that students are studying. Some of that is in our control, but some of it, frankly, is beyond our control. It is to do with how the media and the worlds of literature and television present science, but we can do more. One of the most significant things that we can do is to highlight the direct financial benefit for a student undertaking a degree in a STEM subject: the graduate earnings premium is about 30 per cent. more than that for students undertaking degrees in non-STEM subjects.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> spoke about the expansion of higher education and how we compare internationally. We are still behind on a comparable basis. According to figures provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, we are about 5 per cent. behind, so we need to do more to encourage young people and mature students to go into higher education, but it is a bit more complicated than that. When the completion of courses is taken into account, we are doing much better than the initial figure suggests, because we have very good completion rates&mdash;some of the best in the advanced world. In some countries, the institutions get an awful lot of people through the front door, but a huge number of them drop out. We need to do more, but we need to look carefully at the figures, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.8/12">The hon. Lady referred to Tomlinson. I came to this debate as an Education Minister after Tomlinson, and I find the subject a bit theological. We have implemented 90 or 95 per cent. of what Tomlinson proposed. Where we disagreed was over the continuation of A-levels. If she is advocating the scrapping of A-levels, I understand her argument, but happen to disagree with it. We should focus on the new diplomas&mdash;on bringing them in, making them worth while, and getting as many young people as possible who want to do them to choose them.</p>
