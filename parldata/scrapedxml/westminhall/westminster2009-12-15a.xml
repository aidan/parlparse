<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15a.181.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="181"  time="009:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0001.htm#09121532000447">
	<p pid="a.181.2/1">My hon. Friend is right, and all of us are finding such cases arising in our constituency work load. I do not know whether she recalls this, but I believe that it was the first of the strategic health authority's trinity of chief executives who questioned in a valedictory memorandum whether the current level of funding for Buckinghamshire was sufficient to maintain a core service at the level which local people are entitled to expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/2">My hon. Friend put it well: there is little argument today about how health services are evolving and ought to evolve in this country. I am certainly not going to stand here and say that there cannot ever be change, and I believe that most of my constituents want health services to be delivered to them at home or as close as possible to their home. Trends in medical science and the trend toward concentrating specialisms-the treatment of particular cancers or particular types of heart attack-in a limited number of hospitals where all the experts and the best equipment can be brought together are certain to continue and will provide better patient outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/3">The model for the future of a wide range of local, usually community-based services and in-patient stays in hospital reserved for serious conditions, for as short a time as possible, is one that I would endorse. However, my real fear about what is happening in Buckinghamshire is that, although we are seeing that reconfiguration happen, it is driven not by clinical developments and priorities but by the urgency of making the books balance in a short period of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/4">The Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust and the Buckinghamshire primary care trust have agreed a financial plan that involves cutting the number of hospital admissions by 100 a week, and securing a 30 per cent. reduction in admissions to A and E. That all has to be achieved by the end of the current financial year, and we are already seeing the results. I had a letter from a constituent the other day in which she complained that she had received a letter offering her an appointment at Stoke Mandeville hospital for treatment for which she had been referred by her GP, but then she had a telephone call to say that the offer was being withdrawn because her case no longer fitted the new criteria that the PCT had imposed for financial reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/5">I fear that community services, primary care and preventive services not only will not be developed in time to meet the demands of the new model of health care but are actually under acute strain at the moment. Let us look at what is happening with the PCT. I have been told by local GPs that the health visitor service has been cut, and moved from GP surgeries into a central office location. When I visited a GP surgery on one of my most deprived estates the other week, I was told by the nurses and other staff that it is sometimes difficult to get hold of a health visitor because health visitors often do not know from one day to the next where they will be based or which people they will be able to see. Comprehensive coverage by health visitors of the poorest areas of Aylesbury may still be an aspiration, but it is not happening in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/6">The same is true for district nurses and the school nurse service, which is desperately stretched. The truth about primary care in our county is that anything that is not the subject of a specific Government target is liable to be squeezed and cut.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/7">There is little scope for GP innovation that would push up the standard of service. GPs tell me that they feel frustrated when they come up with a new idea but are then told by the PCT that, unless it can afford to fund the innovation throughout the county, no practice is allowed to provide it. That undermines professional responsibility and stifles the possibility of some real improvement in the quality of health care locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/8">I have already referred to the pressure on Wycombe and Stoke Mandeville hospitals to cut admissions and attendances at A and E, but we have learned recently that there is to be a further regional review of hospital capacity, which will involve Berkshire and Buckinghamshire and possibly Oxfordshire as well-my understanding is that the John Radcliffe hospital is also under acute financial pressure. Local people will greet the prospect of a further hospital review with horror, and there will be fear that another round of hospital cuts is on its way.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/9">If we are to move to the new model of health care, it is clear that an effective ambulance service will be important. Paramedics need to be able to reach patients quickly and to stabilise their condition, and we need an effective ambulance service if more patients are to be transported significant distances to the specialist hospitals and units of the future. However, the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Trust is already struggling to meet its targets. Yesterday, I had a letter from the chairman of the trust, who said that services in rural areas of the south-central region in particular were under huge strain.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/10">The other element that is missing from the discussion about the new model of NHS care is the place of county council social services. As the Minister will know, Buckinghamshire county council is already a floor authority, and news has just come through that it will again receive the smallest grant increase of any shire county in England for the next financial year. The eligibility criteria for access to social care are being tightened year on year. My fear is that, inevitably, that will mean that more elderly and disabled people, and more people with a chronic illness who are unable to qualify for care that they might previously have received, will fall over or have accidents. They will be admitted to A and E, and possibly for an in-patient stay in hospital. Paradoxically, that would increase rather than reduce the financial pressures that some of the reductions and reconfigurations in service have been designed to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/11">In conclusion, I want to leave the Minister in no doubt that those are not just my views as a politician. The view of nearly every doctor and nurse in my constituency to whom I have spoken is that the local health service in our county is struggling, and that, yes, there needs to be a coherent look at the configuration and pattern of health care in Buckinghamshire, but that that needs to be linked to an examination of the funding system to ensure that people get the quality of service they are entitled to through payment of their taxes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15a.183.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" speakername="Paul Goodman" colnum="183"  time="009:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0002.htm#09121532000448">
	<p pid="a.183.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase> on securing this debate. Despite her heavy commitments elsewhere, she has proved again this morning that she is a relentless and doughty champion of the health care and other interests of her constituents, as all of us in Buckinghamshire try to be. It is worth putting on the record once again that our colleague <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40031" name="John Bercow">the right hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> cannot be with us, but my hon. Friend spoke for him.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.0/2">I cannot rival my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> in my use of the local NHS, although I have been through Wycombe hospital accident and emergency and in a ward there for a brief period, so I have had some personal experience of the NHS in Bucks, as well as the constituency experience that my hon. Friends have had as Members of Parliament. However, I do not want to start a Monty Python-type competition, where colleagues and others compare their experiences of woe, especially-on a more serious note-given the experiences of some of my constituents, which I have heard about in my surgery and outside it over the past eight years. Given that I am leaving the House at the election, I shall speak at least partly in a valedictory spirit.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.0/3">In my eight years as a Member of Parliament, undoubtedly the most important constituency issue has been health care: no other single issue compares to it in terms of the interest, concern and anxiety it arouses. In those eight years, the cuts and closures at Wycombe hospital-the loss of our children's ward, maternity ward and full A and E service-have created a huge ruction in Buckinghamshire. I want to make three simple points about that whole experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.0/4">First, when I arrived as a new candidate in 2000, I visited Wycombe hospital and spoke to a gentleman called Roy Darby, who had been the chief executive there-Wycombe and Stoke Mandeville had recently been merged into a trust-for at least 10 years and, I think, longer. The NHS has always been primarily a nationally orientated and directed service, but the structures were reasonably stable and people such as Roy Darby knew their way round the local NHS backwards and exhibited a particular sense of responsibility, ownership and knowledge of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.0/5">Since my being elected our regional health authority has been merged, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham said. The three primary care groups that existed at the time of my election became three primary care trusts, some of which had deficits-as my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury is fond of saying, no one has ever found the balancing surpluses-and then became a single Bucks-wide primary care trust. The mental health trust has been merged with Oxfordshire and the ambulance trust has been merged. Wycombe hospital had just gone in with Stoke. We have experienced a kind of permanent revolution, as in Mao's China. Local people undoubtedly feel that their ownership of the service, which was never particularly strong, has been compromised in the past eight years, and that, when cuts and closures have been put on the table, besides some of the improvements that have taken place, they have not had any say in what has happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.0/6">Secondly, on the cuts and closures, as I have said, good things have happened and are happening at Wycombe hospital. I have good relations with the management team there and with the PCT, as my colleagues do: we try to work together. However, in 2004, when this wave of cuts and closures was announced and rippled through large parts of the country-including in substantial areas of the south of England, where Government Members of Parliament appeared to be less well represented than Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs-there was a feeling that managers had been sent in from outside to ram these changes through.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.0/7">Thirdly, the main substance of my hon. Friends' speeches is the problem with the funding formula. In a rational dispensation, spending would be related to need, meaning that spending would largely be related to age. As my hon. Friends have said, we have an ageing population in Buckinghamshire, particularly in south Buckinghamshire. In a rational dispensation, deprivation funding would be allocated from a separate budget. Under such a system it is unlikely that Buckinghamshire would receive 17 per cent. less per head than the national average, which is the case. I am sure that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> will say more about this later.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.0/8">Essentially, given the pace and scale of change that my hon. Friends are describing, in Buckinghamshire we are like the Red Queen in &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, who had to run to stand still. Given the funding disadvantage, our NHS staff and managers have to climb a steep incline to get on top of their deficits and manage the restructuring at a time of great change, because there is an enormous knock-on effect from our having 17 per cent. less funding per head. For example, there is a clear effect on my poorer constituents in areas such as Castlefield and Micklefield. My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury mentioned the poorer areas in his constituency, such as Quarrendon. In effect, our poorer constituents, because they are not surrounded by others who are as poor as they are, are disadvantaged compared with poorer constituents elsewhere living alongside those who are as poor as they are. That has had a substantial effect on communities in my constituency containing people who may not speak English as a first language, some of whom have recently arrived and many of whom may not always have grasped how rapid the pace of change has been and what effect these changes were having on their local services.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15a.186.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" speakername="Dominic Grieve" colnum="186"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0002.htm#09121532000451">
	<p pid="a.186.0/1">It is a pleasure to be able to participate in this debate. I hope to do so briefly, because much of what I want to say has been said by my hon. Friends. In particular, I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase> for securing this debate and opening it.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/2">It might be helpful for the Minister if I try to step back a little from the immediacy of the funding issues that we have described, and go back to some basic principles. It will be widely acknowledged on both sides of the Chamber that NHS resources are not infinite. If my party has the opportunity of forming a Government, we will face exactly the same funding constraints, particularly in the current financial climate, that the Government must face. However, those constraints should not allow us to engage in propaganda exercises to pretend that something is when it is not. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> rightly highlighted the extent to which the Government have met the promises that they made pre-1997, but it is impossible to reach that conclusion for Buckinghamshire as a whole and south Buckinghamshire in particular because of the extent to which services have been curbed or cut.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/3">A live issue is the extent to which an area should receive funding in relation to its need or indices of deprivation. The county, including my constituency, is prosperous by national standards, so one can understand that the Government might argue that the population's health care needs are likely to be proportionately less. That may be correct, and the indices of overall health in Buckinghamshire do not seem to be very bad, but the difficulty that arises with that approach is that as services are progressively phased out, those who may need them will be unable to access any service at all. That is the hallmark of the problem that I face in my constituency. It consists of some people who are very rich, and some who are on middling incomes and who can manage, but it also has pockets of extreme poverty which is every bit as bad in one or two places as in inner city areas in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/4">One of my wards was, and still may be, ranked 13th in the indices of deprivation in the south-east, although that is not as bad as some of the wards in the constituencies of some of my hon. Friends here today. People there find that the services that they need and cannot access through the private sector are simply not available in the health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/5">This is an old theme, and the second or third time that we have had a similar debate about the problem of funding of health services in Buckinghamshire. Returning to that theme, I well remember that one of the Government's first actions when it came to office in 1997-I give this to the Minister by way of illustration of the problem-they removed the tax breaks for people of pensionable age taking out private health insurance. I remember that vividly, because the consequence was to create the first winter crisis after I was elected to Parliament. Those people could no longer access private health care, particularly in my constituency, or beds in private hospitals when they had pneumonia in winter, so they started to fill the hospital at Wycombe. I remember the administrators saying that they believed that that was the cause of that sudden surge, thereby making it even harder for those who were more deprived to obtain access.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/6">How does the problem of chronic underfunding manifest itself? My hon. Friends have made some important points, and I do not want to repeat them, but I endorse what they said. I shall give the Minister some examples that may interest him in understanding what is going on. The first has been alluded to, but I am returning to it. It is the problem of the reverse turf war between social services and the health service. Generally in a turf war, people are told to get off someone else's patch, but throughout my time as a Member of Parliament since 1997 I have witnessed the struggle between social services and the health service in asking the other to come on to their patch and take over responsibility for the services that they should provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/7">We have discussed acute services, and I want to move away from that a little. A matter that fills my surgeries weekly is arguments about elderly people with modest circumstances in hospitals, where they will go next to be cared for, what the element of nursing care should be and who should take responsibility for it. Leaving aside the fact that I am perfectly aware that individuals may have a financial interest because of the extent to which they must pay from their pockets, that happens even when people will never be in a position to make a contribution to their care if they move into a care home. It is a source of endless correspondence, and all because the PCT and social services want to pass responsibility round and round because neither has the resources to meet the need.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/8">That is one example. The second is the PCT's approach to those who are, perhaps fortunately, a small minority but who, for one reason or another, need specialist provision that falls outside the competence of the Buckinghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust and Thames valley hospitals. I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge that what should be a reasonably rapid bureaucratic process by which referral to a specialist London hospital that will provide what is sometimes life-saving care takes weeks, and almost inevitably requires my involvement in writing letters to him, or to the head of the PCT or the regional trust trying to kick someone into acknowledging that specialist provision that can be accessed only at, for example, St. Thomas's hospital, should be provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/9">There is a constant, underlying theme of difficulty in moving the bureaucratic logjam. Although 99 times out of 100 we will probably end up getting what we asked for because it is the right thing to have-I say that to reassure the Minister-in the meantime, the patient and their family can legitimately claim that the wait and delay have had a significant impact on the health of the individual. I do not regard that as acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/10">Given the human condition, I know that we will never have a perfect service, and I do not expect one. However, the amount of time, effort and energy that is devoted to bureaucracy is worrying and must also cost money. In my role as an MP, I keep thinking about the amount of money that could be used in front-line services that is being squandered in shoring up the bureaucratic paper round. That process dilutes the amount of money that I and wealthy members of my constituency pay in tax, before the money can be translated into the service and used to the advantage of the person who needs it. Such bureaucracy adds to that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/11">Mental health provision has been mentioned. It is a subject of interest to me, and in the past I have been involved with Mind, where I was vice-chairman of a group in London. Mental health provision in the county is, frankly, poor. That is not the fault of the professionals who provide it, and if I were to be optimistic I would say that it is perhaps on a mildly improving graph. There was a period about two years ago when mental health provision had become so bad that I thought it had reached the abyss.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/12">My hon. Friends have highlighted the issue of counselling services, and I would like to pick up that subject to illustrate my point. Counselling services are accessed directly on referral by a GP. One of the features of the briefing that was helpfully provided by Buckinghamshire primary care trust, is that it wants to cut costs by lowering the number of admissions to accident and emergency and referrals to hospitals. We all know that mental health problems exist, and with the economic downturn and the various other financial pressures on families, I get the distinct impression that that trend will be rising.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/13">Counselling and referral systems operated in the county very cheaply. Buckinghamshire PCT gave a &#163;300,000 funding subsidy, which it is now withdrawing. Of that, &#163;90,000 is being withdrawn from Bucks Mind which, as the Minister will know, provides a largely voluntary service. On the face of it, that is not a large sum of money, although I accept that in the context of the PCT this is probably an essential cut to try and meet budgetary constraints and to save money. However, if that service cannot be provided because the money has been withdrawn, what will the consequences be on the need to access more specialist services through accident and emergency or elsewhere?</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/14">This is a classic illustration of where by trying to make savings and cuts of this kind-particularly the virtual closure of a voluntary service that simply needs help with its overheads-we are likely to put greater pressure on the health service elsewhere. When the cut was proposed, it was suggested that the referral service for counselling to Buckinghamshire Mind was not a good system. However, Buckinghamshire PCT was clearly aware of Mind's effectiveness, as it had been happy to fund it without any difficulty for years in the past, arguing that it was extraordinarily good value for money. The fact that the PCT now believes that such funding will no longer be possible, illustrates that a series of warped priorities have been imposed on it due to the current problems that it faces.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/15">I will not go on at great length, but I will conclude with another illustration of my point. The ambulance service has been mentioned, and we learn that although the apparent needs of the area are not as great as elsewhere, the service has seen an inexorable rise in volume demand by over 6 per cent. per annum in recent years. It is currently running at 8 per cent. up on last year, and has pointed out that that is not sustainable given that only 60 per cent. of patients go to hospital when an ambulance is called out, and only 10 per cent. need extended hospital treatment on admission. That strongly suggests that the ambulance service is being used as a bottom-line safety net for the provision of primary care services to the local community-indeed, I know that to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/16">All of us on this side of the Chamber are supportive of the Thames Valley air ambulance service, which is entirely voluntarily funded. One of its complaints is that it is being used for routine hospital transfers to save the ambulance trust cash. It resents that because it is a specialist emergency service that intervenes when somebody has to be transported rapidly from one place-often removed from a road-to a hospital. I hope that the Minister will forgive me this digressory tour to illustrate what is happening on the ground in our area.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/17">I do not expect the Minister to be a miracle worker. I know that his Government have wrecked the public finances and now have to pick up the pieces, and I fully appreciate that the area I represent will never receive the same amount of funding per head of population as a place such as Liverpool or another great city that has higher levels of deprivation. However, we cannot go on in this way. At some point, this will all go badly wrong for the Government. Illustrations of serious failures will be visited on the Minister, which will be entirely due to a failure to do any creative, sensible, medium-term planning for how to secure effective services in health care for our constituents locally. It requires doing something more than submitting the poor old primary care trust-which in my view does its best-to an endless cycle of crisis management.</p>

Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase> on securing this debate, and on getting a good turn out from her colleagues, who have all spoken passionately about the health needs of their county.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/2">The hon. Lady spoke about the impact of 12 years of Labour rule in Buckinghamshire. However, to introduce a note of discord, we must remember that when the Conservatives left office in 1997, we were spending a third less than the European average on health, and the consequences were there for all to see. The problems about access to health care continued for some time, and when I arrived in Parliament four years later, my first debate in this Chamber was on orthopaedic waiting times in Norfolk. At that time-I am sure that it was similar in Buckinghamshire-people sometimes waited for three years to get to hospital for a hip or knee joint operation. The situation was not good in those days, and there was a strong case for increasing investment in the health service. If that investment had not happened, I have no doubt that the position in Buckinghamshire would be even worse than it is today. None the less, the hon. Lady pointed to some important issues about how funding is allocated around the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.0/3">What the hon. Lady said about her experience and what her hon. Friends described reminded me of the situation in Norfolk-a rural county with quite an elderly population. The pressures and strains on the health service in such an environment are very real. The ambulance service not meeting its target for getting to emergency calls on time was one issue that the hon. Lady raised. Poor access to dental care was another example that she gave. The ever increasing number of emergency admissions to acute hospitals is causing enormous strain. Her hon. Friends also made the point that there was the sense of the whole system under intense strain, and that is a picture that I see in my county of Norfolk.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15a.191.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" colnum="191"  time="010:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0003.htm#09121532000456">
	<p pid="a.191.1/1">I am grateful for that clarification. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham said that the funding formula delivers 17 per cent. less for her area than the national average. There is concern in many parts of the country that the funding formula does not sufficiently recognise the cost of delivering health care in rural areas, particularly in areas with an elderly population. Even if an elderly population happen to be relatively well off, they still have health needs. It still costs money to provide for operations in acute hospitals and so on. However, the funding formula does not appear to recognise that sufficiently.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/2">All the problems that the hon. Lady described, fairly and accurately so far as health services in Buckinghamshire are concerned, are likely to become significantly worse unless we are smart about how we use the available resources in the health service. Whichever party wins the general election next year, the prospects for the health service look bleak, because even if we ring-fence, protect, or safeguard funding for the NHS, the reality is that throughout the developed world, we are seeing rises in health costs. That has happened over many decades, and that trend is likely to continue with an ageing population and with lifestyle conditions such as obesity and others caused by alcohol abuse and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/3">Another factor is the cost of new drugs coming on stream. A fortnight ago, I talked to a group of consultants in Norfolk who told me that two new drugs approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence had a cost impact on Norfolk PCT of about &#163;2.5 million. That is from a fixed budget, not a budget that is increased by that amount to fund it, so something else has to give. The impact of an ageing population, new drugs coming on stream and lifestyle conditions means that we have rising health costs at a time when health budgets are likely to be fixed or rising very slowly. That creates the potential for a perfect storm, and the risk is that the most vulnerable lose out in those circumstances. Some of the public health services to which the hon. Lady referred are often most at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/4">When the health service was last under financial pressure, in 2005-06, the Select Committee on Health concluded that services such as mental health and public health programmes were cut, rather than services that might be able to take the strain a little better. There was no attempt to improve productivity at that time, or no success at improving productivity. Services such as mental health took the hit.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/5">There is a risk that when the financial pressure increases, crisis management takes over and there is a process of slash and burn. Instead of doing that, we must consider how we can redesign services to improve the efficient use of resources in the health service. One problem is that financial levers in the health service incentivise activity. We pay acute hospitals more and more for doing more activity. We do not pay to optimise health care and quality. We do not pay to incentivise primary care to keep people out of hospitals. The system of payment by results was criticised by Mark Britnell, the former director of commissioning in the Department of Health. Just before he left in the summer, he said at a conference in London that there was an urgent need to abolish or radically reform payment by results. That is the Government's own system, and it was the director of commissioning who made that case.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.1/6">The Government have introduced a concept called practice-based commissioning, which is designed to encourage primary care to do more and to take work that is currently undertaken in acute hospitals and do it closer to home, in the community. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> made a very good point. When GPs go to the PCT with proposals for services that they could provide under practice-based commissioning, all too often they are turned down. I understand the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham that sometimes we try to redesign services too fast, but when there are opportunities to develop community-based services around GP practices, those proposals are rejected by PCTs, which simply refuse to engage in the whole concept of practice-based commissioning. The person responsible for practice-based commissioning for the Department of Health has himself said that the concept appears to be failing and is almost dead in the water. That system to encourage GPs to do more, closer to home, appears to be failing. What should the way forward be, given the acute financial squeeze on public services such as health, which means that little new money is coming in and that costs are rising? There are a number of elements-</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15a.193.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" speakername="Anne Milton" colnum="193"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0003.htm#09121532000459">
	<p pid="a.193.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1495" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)</phrase> on securing the debate. I welcome the fact that she also spoke on behalf of the constituents of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40031" name="John Bercow">the right hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>, who presides over this place.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/2">My hon. Friend described PCT and local health care services that are in absolute crisis. She rightly highlighted the fact that the current reconfigurations are taking place much too quickly to enable standards of care and quality to be maintained. She highlighted the 40 per cent. cut at clinics in Amersham and the complete cut in counselling services.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/3">As my hon. Friend said, the right hon. Member for Buckingham is concerned about mental health services-&#163;35 million has been stripped out just so that they can break even. Our greatest concern is that it is precisely mental health services that are being cut back to deal with our financial deficit. As the Minister is well aware, mental illness costs this country &#163;77 billion. Sadly, after 12 years of this Government, they remain a Cinderella service and they are very vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> spoke of the reduction in health visitors, school nurses and district nurses and of particular concern at the Wycombe and Stoke Mandeville hospitals. He also spoke of his extensive use of NHS care, which is perhaps why he looks so well this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> talked of his constituents' massive concerns about the significant changes at Wycombe hospital. He spoke at length about reconfigurations and the fact that the Government have continued the ghastly cycle of constant change.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/6">I sat on the Health Committee when it undertook an inquiry into reconfigurations, and there has been one reconfiguration every 18 months since the NHS started. At the time, the Committee highlighted the significant loss of focus that occurs following reconfigurations, as well as their absolutely paralysing effect, and that has never been truer than it is today. At the end of the day, reconfigurations deliver few cost savings; in fact, they are a cost in themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/7">The funding formula is the crux of the debate, and my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury rightly pointed out that the supply of money is not infinite. However, demand probably is. When I first trained as a nurse, people would come into A and E wheeling their hernia in a wheelbarrow in front of them, but expectations today are such that they probably would not accept a 1-inch hernia. Expectations have rightly gone up, but the demand is a constant pressure on the NHS, which does not have an infinite supply of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/8">There is rightly concern about the dance that takes place between the NHS and social services, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury pointed out. At times such as this, everybody scurries around trying to dump the costs of care on somebody else. In my constituency, there is concern that the move to reconfigure services and look after people in their own homes will see the NHS dump costs on social services, which face similar budgetary constraints. The patient ends up being looked after in their own home and receiving worse care and services-less physiotherapy and less occupational therapy. Indeed, they are often unnoticed by services.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/9">On the funding formula, I must tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> that the issue is not just what we spend, but how we spend it. Buckinghamshire receives 17 per cent. less funding than the average, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham rightly said, her constituents' needs are not 17 per cent. lower than the average. The cost of providing ambulance services and many other services in areas such as Buckinghamshire is also greater than the average. The Government White Paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot; was quite explicit about the fact that changes in services should not be made in response to short-term budgetary constraints, but that is exactly what we are seeing.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/10">Healthy and wealthy areas often have older populations with a much greater need for health care services. As has rightly been said, it is simply not the case that wealthy areas have less need. Although such areas are relatively affluent, they are the big users of health care services. Wealthy areas also have significant, albeit small, areas of deprivation, and people should not live in such areas, which do not attract the significant funding that other areas do.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/11">When I sat on the Health Committee, we also did a report on budgetary deficits, and I point the Minister to the work of Professor Sheila Asantha, who looked at the impact of the Government's funding formula on wealthy areas. She pointed out that those living in wealthy areas get the worst health care services, because the funding formula is skewed towards areas of deprivation, which need money for public health improvement but do not necessarily have demand for health care services.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/12">The Government have never fully understood that issue. In this season of good will, I do not want make too many party political points, but I hope that the Minister can respond and demonstrate that he has some understanding of the difference between money for public health improvements, which needs to go to deprived areas, and money for health care services.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/13">We need to separate the money for health care service delivery from the money for public health improvements, and that is the Conservative party's policy. As I am sure the Minister is aware, improving public health takes more than money in the health service. In many ways, it is not appropriate to deliver such measures via the health service-we also need social and economic change if we are to make a difference. That is exactly why we have seen health care inequalities rise despite the Government's best efforts. The Government have been ill informed.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/14">Targets have been mentioned, but not as much as they should have been. Again, as I said, the issue is not just the money we spend but how we spend it. I recently went to a conference attended by a lot of senior doctors and surgeons, although I will not identify it because of the comments that were made. However, there was quite a lot of talk about targets, and that is the same wherever I go. Those at the conference went on and on about targets distorting clinical priorities. Indeed, people in the audience started talking about the fact that they now have training days to work out how to play the system-it is called gaming.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/15">The problem with process-driven targets is that care that does not have a target simply does not happen. The Government have never fully understood the difference between a process-driven target and an outcome. To take as an example follow-up for long-term conditions, many people with diabetes and conditions such as epilepsy need follow-up in secondary care; however, they currently do not get it because of Government targets relating to first appointments. The process is driven entirely by centrally-driven Government priorities, not clinical needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/16">My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury mentioned paperwork, of which targets attract a huge amount. We have many people now employed in the health service solely to deal with that. There are outstanding questions, but I realise that time is short so I shall draw my comments to a close.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/17">Perhaps the Minister can explain what is happening to the &#163;30 million of reserves that the strategic health authority currently holds. What plans do the Government have to look again at the funding formula? Can the Minister state, hand on heart, that the reconfigurations in the past 12 years have produced better delivery of health care services? Does he understand how damaging that change has been, and how much it has cost?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15a.195.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="195"  time="010:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0003.htm#09121532000464">
	<p pid="a.195.4/1">The hon. Lady is of course in regular conversation with her NHS organisations and I am sure they would be delighted to write to her about the details that she and her hon. Friends have raised, which are of course a matter for local NHS organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/2">We have had a decade of expansion and of a massive catch-up in health funding, which has yielded big improvements throughout the country, Buckinghamshire included. Opposition Members will know that in Buckinghamshire 99 per cent. of patients attending accident and emergency are now seen within four hours; 91 per cent. of patients now receive treatment requiring hospital admission within 18 weeks, with that figure rising to 97 per cent. for day cases; and more than 93 per cent. of suspected cancer patients are seen by a specialist within a fortnight of referral. As far as delivering outcomes in the past decade, those figures are a testament not only to the additional funding from the Government, but to the hard work of local NHS staff, whom I thank for their efforts. We are determined to bank that progress and to continue to improve standards in a very different financial climate.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/3">I think that every hon. Member who has spoken has raised the issue of the national funding formula and suggested that it penalises Buckinghamshire unfairly. The new funding formula that we are using was developed by the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation, an independent panel of experts. It has been designed to meet the twin objectives of equal access for equal need, and reducing health inequalities-themes that hon. Members repeated throughout the debate. The funding formula recognises that the principal cause of variation in health care needs is the age structure of the population, so it factors in the number of older people and the expected number of births.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/4">It is widely acknowledged that poverty significantly increases people's chances of getting sick and needing health care, so the formula also increases funding if a primary care trust region has a high level of deprivation. In Buckinghamshire, the proportion of people over 60 is 22 per cent., the same as the England average. I agree that there are pockets of deprivation, which is something that local providers must take into account when providing services and allocating resources. Overall, however, although I would not describe Buckinghamshire as rich, as the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield did, it is, as other hon. Members said, one of the more affluent parts of the country. That means, according to the funding formula, that it receives a lower proportion of funding than somewhere with, say, 30 per cent. of its population aged over 60. The point is that it is the independent expert panel, the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation, that believes that the formula is the best way of allocating funding. Whatever the arguments about the formula-and I believe I have made a powerful case for it-Buckinghamshire's funding will continue to grow. The NHS in Buckinghamshire will still get more than &#163;652 million this financial year and &#163;686 million in 2010-11-more than a 10.5 per cent. increase over the two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/5">The route to financial health for Buckinghamshire, as for all parts of the NHS, lies not in questioning the funding formula, although I have heard the points made by the Opposition, but in radical action to improve the quality and effectiveness of local services. The NHS has faced long-standing financial pressures locally; that point has been made and I recognise it. However, it has told me that it is working to address those issues. Both the hospital trust and the PCT are working to break even for 2009-10. They believe that they are on the front foot in re-engineering health services; they have formed a Healthy Buckinghamshire leaders group-a joint plan of action to deal with current financial problems; and their summit plan is already making a difference. The new Buckinghamshire-wide out-of-hours service is already up and running, not least in the constituency of the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, and there are plans for a new GP-led centre based in Wycombe hospital. The hospital trust tells me it expects a 15 per cent. drop in demand for out-patient services in the next few years as care is increasingly-and rightly-delivered by GPs and other community services, as the hon. Member for Aylesbury remarked.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/6">The way patients use NHS services means that demand drops for some out-patient services, and it is not a good idea to run half-empty clinics. That is why clinicians across the NHS in Buckinghamshire are exploring how to combine out-patient clinics to make the make best use of available resources. A smarter NHS will mean more services coming out of hospitals and into the home or the community, although I recognise the points about concerns over rural ambulance services. I understand that the review is taking place in Buckinghamshire, and the final report will be presented to the south central health overview and scrutiny committee in January 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/7">A point was also made about psychological therapies. The PCT's professional executive committee, led by clinicians, agreed the recommendation to refocus psychological therapy resources, totalling more than &#163;4 million, on evidence-based therapies. As the Minister responsible for mental health I can tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> that a 50 per cent. increase in funding for mental health services since 2001- a &#163;2 billion increase-is remarkable and puts this country's mental health services at the forefront of those in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/8">I have tried not to be too party political in this debate, but other hon. Members have made it so, and I therefore conclude by saying that when the Conservative party left office in 1997 the NHS was on its knees. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> was right. In the past 12 years the Conservative party voted against every Budget, with record increases in NHS spending that brought benefits not least to Buckinghamshire. Finally, the Conservatives are approaching the general election pledged to abandon key criteria for waiting times, and to create an austerity Britain, with smaller Government. From what we have heard today it appears they intend to reintroduce tax breaks for private insurance schemes and abandon deprivation formula in the funding allocations.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.1/2">Credit for setting up the Select Committee on Reform of the House of Commons should go to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House, and particularly so for appointing exactly the right person to chair it.

It demonstrates what a clever and shrewd man he is.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.7/1">I agree with all of that. I see no reason why the House needs more than 400 Members. We would probably do a better job if fewer of us were focusing our attention on our work. The report was about rebuilding the House, not about casting a new constitutional settlement, although we may well come to that in the fairly near future. I am sympathetic to what the hon. Gentleman says, but that is not what the Committee was about. We need to focus on how to improve and rebuild the House, which is badly in need of it.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.3/1">That is self-evident. Those of us who think that we personally are being elected will find when we stand for re-election, in May or June or whenever it is, that it is our party that will be re-elected. Of course, the hon. Lady is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.3/2">We are sent here to be a check and a balance on Government, which is in the interests of both the public and the Government. If we do our job properly and rigorously, it makes for better Government. Sadly, however, we are failing in our duty. Over the past 100 years, Parliament has been getting steadily weaker and more enfeebled, and government has been getting stronger and more almighty, and that is not in the interests of Parliament, good government or the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.3/3">Parliament, therefore, is not working. At the moment, the Government decide everything that happens in this place: when we come here, what we debate, what we can vote on and what substantive motions are put down on the Order Paper. We in this House are the creatures of Government. We come here when we are called, go away when we are told to, debate the subjects that the Government think are proper and vote when we are asked to do so. How we vote is a different matter. Parliament has lost the sense of its own identity. Its identity is distinct from that of Government; the Executive and the legislature have two totally different roles, and there is no longer a clear distinction between the two.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.3/1">I absolutely take your point, Mr. Chairman, and it is very kind of you to attribute the fact that I am taking rather longer than I had intended to my generosity in taking interventions. I feel that I am probably taking too long to introduce this debate anyway, because I know that in Westminster Hall today we have people who sat on the House of Commons Reform Committee and who have very important contributions to make to this debate. Therefore, I will try to bring my remarks to a close.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.3/2">If we are to fulfil our responsibilities as a Parliament, we need to get control not only of the business of the House and not only of the membership and chairmanship of the Select Committees, which this report identifies so clearly as an issue, but of the Standing Orders of this House, which the report identifies rather less clearly as an issue. The Standing Orders determine the future of this House and at the moment they can only be amended effectively by grace of the Government. They are our Standing Orders, not the Government's Standing Orders; they are the Standing Orders of this House and we ought to control them.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.3/3">There are things in the report that one could imagine, in an ideal world, being slightly stronger and places where it could go wider, as hon. Members have already mentioned, but the fact of the matter is that I think that the report is a superb beginning and a superb indicator of where we ought to be going. What we now need to do is to take this debate on to the Floor of the House and have it on a substantive motion, which many Members in Westminster Hall today have been pressing the Government for. There is an indication that we may get that substantive debate by the end of January. I hope that we will get it by that time. It would be very foolish of the Government, having done the difficult job of setting up this Committee, appointing the right people to sit on it and to report on this issue and getting, to their own credit, an excellent report if we were not allowed to debate the report and take the issue forward as quickly as possible. To leave such a debate to the next Parliament would be a terrible mistake. Furthermore, if we are right in thinking that a third, or perhaps even more, of the Members of the next Parliament will be new MPs, those new MPs will not know how this place works as well as some of us perhaps do, having experienced the virtues and vices of the present system. We need to move fairly fast in the next few months and I hope that we will do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.3/4">It is up to us to bestir ourselves and to identify what is peculiar about Parliament and our identity that is different from that of Government. If we do that, we will be laying a foundation for what this report calls itself, which is &quot;Rebuilding the House&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.2/1">I welcome the fact that we are having this debate today and I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> for introducing it. Regrettably, I must say that I do not entirely agree with the thrust of what he said. I am afraid that the report to which he has referred was far too timid; it needed to be a good deal more robust. I accept that there was an element of compromise about it and one certainly hopes that at least what has been proposed in the report will go through as a starting-point to what I think will be a radical reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/2">I say that because I think that there is little doubt that the allowances scandal, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, will cause what I suspect will be the largest shake-up in parliamentary practice since the Great Reform Act of 1832, and not before time. It is perhaps not entirely coincidental that the momentous upheaval in 1832 came as a result of a crisis of confidence in many other institutions. At that time, it was the established Church of England and the monarchy-after the scandals that had surrounded George IV and George III before him-that were in crisis. Of course, today's crisis in confidence in Parliament arrives hot on the heels of an unprecedented economic firestorm in the past two years, whereby the catastrophe that has befallen financial institutions has shaken public confidence in the capitalist system and with the inquiry that is currently being conducted into our going to war in Iraq there is again a sense that the Executive has been allowed to get away with blue murder.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/3">However, I feel that the reforming steps that we have taken so far will not necessarily be sufficient. In the next Parliament, I suspect that we will see a huge turnover of MPs, even without the turnover that my own party hopes will happen as far as the general election result is concerned. However, there is a concern that we will be filling this House with a lot of inexperienced men and women who will regard themselves as being little more than cheerleaders for their party leaders. The worst possible outcome, in my view, would be the reinforcement of a parliamentary class made up of people with little or no experience outside the political sphere.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/4">It is also possible that expenses woes will encourage many of Edmund Burke's &quot;good men&quot;, and women, simply to give up on the idea of democracy. I do not lament the scandal's unveiling, but I mourn the hopeless way that politicians dealt with a time bomb that had been waiting to go off for years, as many of us recognised. It did not have to be that way. We must grasp the rare opportunity in the aftermath of the scandal to implement overdue but lasting reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/5">I reiterate some of what the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central said. First, we must pare back the control exercised by the Executive. In my view, successive Governments and Opposition leaderships deserve much of the blame for the parliamentary expenses fiasco that has blown up so spectacularly over the past six months. We have witnessed repeated grandstanding by party leaders who refused to implement independent salary reviews but turned a blind eye to the cynical-and, at its extreme, fraudulent-manipulation of the second home allowance, whose annual uplift was never reduced, reversed or even capped, and which became a salary substitute. The 24/7 media world in which politics operates militates in favour of any close-knit team around party leadership being on message, but Executive patronage must now be curtailed.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/6">I agree with much of what was said about Select Committees. They need to exercise real power. In my view, the appointment of all Select Committee members, not just Chairmen, should be by a secret ballot of all MPs. As was rightly pointed out, chairmanships have too often been handed out by the Executive to former Ministers or senior Back Benchers on the basis of their compliance and willingness not to rock the boat. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central referred to the late Gwyneth Dunwoody and to Ian Gibson. Unfortunately, they are the exceptions that prove the rule about our Select Committee system. One of the biggest oxymorons in British politics is a phrase that one often hears in the media: &quot;the influential Select Committee&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/7">Select Committees should be much smaller. I am grateful that the report goes in that direction. The number mooted was 11, but in my view, Select Committees should number between five and eight members, who should all be fully committed to acquiring or developing genuine expertise in the field. The current situation involves a ludicrous charade in which ill-prepared MPs, on the rare occasions when they attend, parrot planted questions cobbled together by a Committee Clerk rather than even pretending to hold witnesses or Ministers genuinely to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/8">We should also have a much smaller House of Commons, although I risk talking myself out of a constituency. Curiously, the only Members who tend to propose reductions in the size of the Commons are those on the cusp of retirement. I see a few such individuals here. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I hasten to add that in their case it is voluntary retirement rather than involuntary. The size of Parliament should be reduced substantially. My party's policy is a 10 per cent. reduction, but I think that that should be a first step. Ideally, a fixed-size Parliament of 450 to 500 Members should be our medium-term goal. The primary priority of all MPs, therefore, should be holding the Executive to account rather than acting as local ombudsmen on constituency issues more appropriately dealt with by local authorities, law centres and citizens advice bureaux, to name but three publicly funded bodies properly designed to deal with parochial concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/9">I would like the process of separating the legislature from the Executive to begin. That final element of my wish list is probably a step too far even for my more reform-minded colleagues, for now at least. If Parliament is to have any future relevance beyond making up the numerical armies required by Governments to pass their legislation, we should regard law-making as an end in itself rather than an essential stepping stone towards holding ministerial office. My preference-it will not happen at this election, but perhaps at some future election-is to have two votes on election day, so people can vote for the Prime Minister and for their local Member of Parliament. It might well result in a split slate, but I do not think that that would be an unhealthy state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/10">There is one important caveat, which I mentioned in my intervention, that must be addressed before we begin a headlong rush to empower individual parliamentarians. Many MPs-perhaps even most of us-do not regard any of the foregoing, and still less the constitutional duty of holding the Executive to account, as their main role. Increasingly, the House of Commons consists of a cadre of super-councillors who keep much of their attention and their burgeoning work load in a constituency-focused comfort zone. We are all proud of the work that we do in our constituencies, and it is important to have a finger on the pulse, but if we are to ensure reform and put power back into the hands of Parliament, this generation of MPs and the next must be properly equipped to play their key role in the transformative Parliament that democratic renewal in this country so desperately needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>. I can give him some comfort. I have just done a quick count around the Chamber and a clear majority of Members did not vote for the Iraq war. Let us glory in our purity for a few moments. I speak as a member of the Select Committee on Reform of the House of Commons. It was a pleasure to serve on that Committee and work with colleagues on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/2">I shall respond to some of the issues raised and then make a couple of points. I say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> that he should beware of giving too much praise either to the Prime Minister or the Leader of the House, because thus far the reaction to and reception of our report has been lukewarm. The Prime Minister is on the record as saying that he fully supports some of the recommendations, and the Leader of the House has yet to give us time for either a debate or a decision-a substantive vote-on the report. So the pressure needs to be put on not just my Front Benchers but Conservative Front Benchers-I say that to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase>. As someone who has organised many events in this place, I assure him that dark forces are gathering and manoeuvrings are taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/3">Opposition Front Benchers' enthusiasm for reform is wilting as the day of the general election gets closer, because all Governments like to control everything and feel that they have to be control freaks. It is part of our job to challenge that, whoever forms the next Government. I want to challenge the notion that we can somehow do our job better with fewer MPs. I ask hon. Members to reflect on the arguments they have made. What they are saying is that too often we are super-councillors, we are doing too much casework, we should be doing more scrutiny, and we should therefore have bigger constituencies and do less casework. That does not necessarily add up, because there may be some transitional problems. People might want to think their arguments on that through.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/4">I say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase>, for whom I have huge affection, that I utterly reject her minority report. I thought it was a cop-out and that it merely talked about transferring the decision-making process to another Parliament. That report did not address the clear terms of reference that were set up for our Committee to a very tight time scale, which the Committee addressed. We did not have time to dance on the head of a pin concerning what we mean by reform or anything else.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/5">With due respect, I say to my hon. Friend that she should beware of being sucked into the arguments that were given to us in the evidence from my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1557" name="Hilary Armstrong">the Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong)</phrase>, the former Chief Whip. She gave us a staggering thesis that basically went along the lines of, &quot;It's all in the manifesto and it's the Government's job to get that through, so what are you doing here?&quot; I am not entirely sure that we are paid &#163;64,000 a year merely to nod through what is in a manifesto without any element of parliamentary scrutiny. We need to be careful about going down that road.</p>

Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>, who is sadly not in this Chamber now, I absolutely support getting rid of MPs' second jobs and moonlighting-in fact, I proposed a private Member's Bill on that issue back in 2007. If we contrast the top 50 outside earners in this place with their voting records, it is clear that the public lose out in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/7">On the recommendations of the reform Committee itself, we considered three issues. We passed over the matter of the election of the Deputy Speaker, but I very much support the principle of that, particularly the election of the Chairman of Ways and Means, who may have a key role to play in a future business Committee. That matter has been passed to the Select Committee on Procedure and, again, its recommendations need to be implemented sooner rather than later.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/8">We also considered the election of Select Committee Chairs. In 2001, a fiasco occurred within the parliamentary Labour party because of the Executive's attempts to determine who their scrutineers were and to decide that Donald Anderson and Gwyneth Dunwoody were too good at their jobs and would therefore be excluded from the list of people put forward for the Select Committee. The parliamentary Labour party for once was not a poodle, and it rose up. As a result, we brought our internal democracy into that process, and the elected Back-Bench Members in the PLP had a say in the names put forward. We are relatively content with our internal system and I commend it to other parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/9">We grappled with the notion of electing every single place on a Select Committee, which would be very difficult to do. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire: in the context of a new Parliament, how are we going to weigh up the credentials of one newly elected MP against another? I am not sure that I would want to say who the eleventh member of a Select Committee should be from a particular party. That is a matter for the parties themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/10">If we agree the balance-the public decide that as a result of the number of MPs from different parties who are sent here-it is for the parties themselves to come forward with a sensible, coherent and transparent system. However, it is for the House to decide who the Chairs of those Select Committees should be. Let us be honest: the Select Committee Chairs are not going to be newly elected Members of the House; they will be people with some experience who have a contribution to make. It is healthy for us to have that internal debate, but there is no doubt that the type of people who will triumph in those elections will be those who have shown independence of spirit and who really are formidable scrutineers. It is those people whom we need to chair our Select Committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/11">The case for the House to have control over its own business is overwhelming, particularly regarding non-governmental time. I would like us to go further. The farce of private Members' Bills is currently an exercise in using up time. We march the non-governmental organisations and lobby groups up to the top of the hill, and an inordinate amount of time, paper and rain forest is wasted in debating matters that will never get through, because a Government Whip can stand up on a Friday morning and shout, &quot;Object.&quot; For goodness' sake, we have to be better than that. We have to have something better than a system of institutionalised filibustering, which is effectively how a lot of our time and energy is wasted. I would like us to go further in terms of the House controlling its own business.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/12">A small part of the report that I had some influence on concerns how the public can be better engaged in what goes on in this place. Currently, early-day motions are no more than political graffiti. We sign too many of them, there are too many of them and they are on too many subjects. I would like early-day motions to be limited and a system introduced-we allude to this in the report-whereby if an EDM gathers support from across the House in sufficient numbers, a debate can take place on the Floor of the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15a.214.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="214"  time="012:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0006.htm#09121532000514">
	<p pid="a.214.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his comments, and other Members on their comments as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/2">The report, &quot;Rebuilding the House&quot;, opens with a quote from Sir Robert Worcester:</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The public are sullen, some even mutinous.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/4">You can say that again. There has been no such disquiet in recent times about the state of our politics and our Parliament. Although the expenses scandals are part of that, let us not confuse what is symptomatic from what is causative. The problem is that people do not know what Members of Parliament are for, and if they do know what they are for, they know that we are not doing the job in the way they would want it done. That means that we must reform our political processes to make them more effective and relevant. It is instructive that those newspapers that were most vocal on the inadequacies of Parliament were unable to devote a single column inch to the Committee's report when it was published. They do not want to see Parliament made more effective, but I am happy that some Members do.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/5">I believe that there is a much wider agenda on democratic renewal, which other Members have touched on today. It would not be appropriate in this debate to discuss all the things I believe we should be looking at, but they include fixed-term Parliaments, the way in which we are elected to the House, the funding of political parties, which I spent six months discussing with colleagues and which has resulted in very little, and reform of the House of Lords, which I spent another six months discussing with other parties and which also resulted in very little. That agenda would include proper devolution and subsidiarity so that we move power to local government in this country and from the European level to the national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/6">Today, however, we are concentrating on Executive control of our legislature. We ought to recognise-those who do not should look at other Parliaments around the world-that this country is almost unique in having a Parliament dominated by the Executive. It is within our power to address that issue, if only colleagues from all parties in the House recognised the need to do so. It is within our power to address it, but we only have the opportunity to do so if the Executive allow it. That is the conundrum at the heart of the matter: we can change the balance of power between the Executive and the legislature only if the Executive let us do so, and we need to look at that.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/7">I do not believe that the Committee's report answers all the questions. It is a good report, but the Committee was constrained by its terms of reference and the time frame within which it was required to report, so there are issues with which its report does not deal. However, it does deal with much of what is going wrong. For instance, it asks questions what happens to Bills on Report. It is a catastrophe for the House that large and important Bills, often dealing with matters literally of life and death, pass unscrutinised to another place so that it can do the job that we in the elected House should be doing. That is an outrage.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/8">Even when Bills are brought before us that we are told will set a paradigm for the way in which such matters will be treated in future, that is not the case. When the Equality Bill was recently introduced in Parliament, the Leader of the House told us that it would be an example of the way to do it. Well, it was an example of the way we do do it, because half of it was not scrutinised on Report and was passed to the other House for it to do the job we should be doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/9">Access to the agenda of the House is a key area, and not just for the public. I absolutely agree with hon. Members who have said that the public should have a way of influencing what we discuss, but Back Benchers, Opposition parties and Members who have a genuine interest in bringing a matter forward, must have better access to the agenda. It is in that regard that the proposed business Committee becomes so important, but it is the one area on which I have doubts about the Select Committee's recommendations, because I would prefer a single business Committee. There should be a business Committee-I have no doubt whatever about that-because that is transparently what works in other legislatures, yet we leave it to the Executive to decide what we debate, which I find extraordinary.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15a.216.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="216"  time="012:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0007.htm#09121532000518">
	<p pid="a.216.3/1">My personal view is that it would be a Committee for all business of the House. I believe that we scrutinise expenditure extraordinarily badly. On the days on which we are supposed to deal with estimates, the one thing we do not discuss is the estimates. It is extraordinary that we devote a minimal amount of time, with minute participation, to eye-wateringly large amounts of taxpayers' money. That is what we are there to scrutinise on those days, but we do such a poor job of it. That problem is not fully addressed in the Committee's report. It does deal with control of Select Committees, which is an important issue, but, in the great scheme of things, not the most important issue. However, it is certainly something on which we should make progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.3/2">Private Members' business is important, as it is about re-establishing the respect for the role of the individual Member in the House and for the idea that we are here as legislators and we have things to say on behalf of our constituents. It is for Parliament to determine whether what we have to say is relevant in the wider statute book, rather than for a single member of the Government-a Whip-to shout &quot;Object&quot; and ruin many months of detailed work.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.3/3">The report has produced a draft resolution for the consideration of the House, so the question is this: why on earth are the Government not simply putting that draft resolution before the House? They said that that was a matter of urgency, but they have dillied and dallied for weeks. They have written to me and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1475" name="Shailesh Vara">the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara)</phrase>, the shadow Leader of the House, whom I am pleased to see in the Chamber, and asked what we think about the matter. It is not for me alone to think about those issues, but for the House to think about them. I believe that that resolution should be put before the House and that we should have a debate on it, because there is still detailed work to be done on making changes to Standing Orders if the House agrees to the draft resolution, as I hope it will. The most important issue before the House is how we make Parliament work effectively. It is a matter of urgency, of massive import and cannot be delayed.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.3/4">There was a Roman senator-I believe it was Cato the Censor-who used to finish every debate with &quot;Carthago delenda est&quot;: Carthage must be destroyed. If I had the same discipline, I would end every speech with &quot;<phrase class="standing-order" code="14">Standing Order No. 14</phrase> delenda est&quot;. We must remove that Standing Order to give back control of this House to its Members, not the people who serve as Ministers, who should not have that responsibility.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.3/1">There have been some important changes and reforms. It is important, as we look forward, not to lose sight of the fact that there have been some good reforms that have helped matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.3/2">The systems of pre-legislative and post-legislative scrutiny give a more systematic approach to scrutinising Bills. I understand that there are issues regarding the scheduling of Report stage and so on, which hon. Members have raised, but we have got better at our task of scrutiny: the current Bribery Bill is one example of that. Post-legislative scrutiny memorandums have also helped.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.3/3">The Equality Bill, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, was complicated legislation that replaced eight former pieces of discrimination legislation. Although perhaps not all the processes helped, some of them, including interleaving the easy-read guide, helped hon. Members and the public to work on the Bill. Those things are important.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.3/4">Most of the changes I have mentioned have been welcomed, although some more than others. Last night we were here from 10.20 pm to 11.20 pm, setting up the London Regional Select Committee. That took a little while, but those innovations are important.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.3/5">As hon. Members know, events this year related to the crisis surrounding hon. Members' use of allowances have created a pressure for reform of the system, but more generally too, and that is mentioned in the Committee's report. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-10">10 June</phrase>, as hon. Members have mentioned, the Prime Minister said that he was happy support the proposal from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> to chair that special commission, as we called it then, to advise on the processes that the Committee took forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.3/6">The Committee reported three weeks ago. It recognises that its report contains conclusions and recommendations that are directed not at the Government, but at the House, Ministers and Back Benchers alike. The Committee said that it expects a Government reply on some points, and that it would be due around the end of January. The Committee also said that it expects a debate. The Leader of the House has said that the Government intend to make time for a debate on the important matters we have debated today, and she reaffirmed that at business questions last week. I cannot add more detail to that, but I expect her to announce a date in the usual way. I take on board the point made by the hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire about ministerial statements being made on the day. The Leader of the House said she would try to make sure that that did not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.3/7">Returning to the report, as my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West said, the appointment of Deputy Speakers was considered by the Procedure Committee, and we will respond on that debate too at the same time as discussing the other matters I have mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.3/8">The report of the Reform Committee touches, importantly, on areas in which further work is needed, such as the Liaison Committee's re-examining the current role of Select Committees. We have heard a great deal in this debate about the role of Select Committees. The task of looking again at them may tie into the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire. There has been strong support voiced in a number of contributions about changing the way the House appoints the members and Chairs of Select Committees, but an important difference was expressed by my hon. Friend, who said that, although we accept that Select Committees work well, we need to consider what we are proposing. As she said, secret ballots of the whole House may not work. The Government could, with a majority, foist their choice of Select Committee Chairs on the House. That needs thinking about. My hon. Friend also asked how such ballots would get a gender and geographical balance and a mix of levels of experience. That deserves detailed consideration. As we have mentioned previously, there will probably be a large number of brand new MPs in the 2010 intake. We need to consider how a ballot would work with a large number of new people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15a.226.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="226"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0008.htm#09121532000532">
	<p pid="a.226.1/1">I accept what the hon. Gentleman says-there is probably a systemic problem. The Department might have been good at administering expansion, but it is not good at administering contraction. There does not appear to be a rational, systematic way of making choices, which goes to the heart of what I want to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/2">I accept that we are dealing with a financially austere environment, but the issue is about how it is managed. I am not suggesting that my constituency-or the institutions in it-be spared from economies made across the country. It would be easy to say, &quot;Not in my backyard; deal with the problem somewhere else.&quot; I recognise that there are 160 Government science laboratories, and they must all be treated fairly and be subject to the same systematic form of assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/3">I have not come here to attack the Government for their handling of science. Over the past decade, a lot of investment has gone into science. There have been good Science Ministers, such as Lord Sainsbury and Lord Drayson, who are very committed to science and are knowledgeable about the subject. I know that the Prime Minister takes a personal interest in boosting science, as does the Secretary of State. However, having built up a reputation for being pro-science, there is a serious danger of the Government blowing that reputation if this more difficult phase is badly handled.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/4">I am not here to attack the Department either. The director of the National Physical Laboratory has gone out of his way to point out that its relationship with the Department has generally been good and productive. I can attest to that, as some years ago there was a difficult process of managing the private finance initiative project that rebuilt the laboratory. It was handled sensitively and came to a successful conclusion. It is more worrying that in a very difficult environment, the process is not being carefully managed, and we have across-the-board cuts without any attempt to prioritise and establish costs and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/5">I would like the Minister to provide some reassurance that a proper process is being established to look at how a more difficult resource environment can be managed. At some point, a process must be established that asks what things are in the science budget that cannot be dealt with by the private sector-if the private sector will do them, there is no need for the Government to do them. However, almost by definition, measurement science for the most part cannot be dealt with by the private sector. If we go back to mediaeval times, long before Governments accepted the need to provide roads, let alone schools and hospitals, a basic function of government was to provide a common or standard system of weights and measures. Providing that basic public good is basic government, and it cannot simply be shifted on to the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/6">The things that survive and are given priority will presumably be those that produce the highest returns to society. I have quoted figures from the Minister's Department which suggest that this area is very productive, and surely that should be the rational basis on which decisions are made. When establishing priorities, it is clear that some activities must be focused on the things that will matter in the future-the whole carbon economy problem is obviously at the centre of the Government's priorities. I worry that as a result of the cuts, the critical mass needed in British measurement for dealing with the carbon economy might not be there.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/7">My question to the Minister is this: has the Department got a method? Has it got a system of risk assessment? There is no need to rush into these cuts. The Government agree with my party that although we will have to economise substantially on public spending, we should not rush to do so during a recession-that would be the worst thing to do. It would be better to act in a measured way and establish a proper system for assessing risk and costs and benefits. I am pressing the Government to indicate how they will do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/8">At the same time as announcing cuts, the Government have announced increases in spending in something called a strategic investment fund. I think that &#163;200 million has been allocated to that, and I am sure that it is a desirable thing to do. However, who decided which money goes into the expanding field and which money is taken out of other scientific institutions? Is there a basis for calculating such things? I notice that technology for video games is included in the list of activities funded by the strategic investment fund. I do not want to be snobbish; I am sure that video games could usefully benefit from improved technology as much as anything else. However, who has decided that &#163;3.5million invested in video game technology is more valuable than &#163;3.5 million invested in measurement science? There must be a system for doing such things systematically.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/9">To conclude, and to give the Minister a proper opportunity to reply, I have not come here to launch a tirade against the principle of cuts, or to lecture the Government on their poor performance in science, because in general they have been very pro-science. I want to make two simple points. First, I want an assurance from the Minister that a proper, rigorous, deliberate process will be set in train to decide how the cuts in the Department will be made, and that they will not be made on a scattergun basis or on the basis of &quot;10 per cent. off everything&quot;. We need a proper, rigorous process for evaluating this.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/10">On a more personal level, I hope that it will be possible to pursue these issues in more detail with the Minister for Science and Innovation. Perhaps, as the icing on the cake, we could persuade the Secretary of State to come to the laboratories in Teddington, which is just down the road from Westminster. He would be extremely welcome, and I am sure that he would learn a great deal.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15a.239.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1879" speakername="Adrian Sanders" colnum="239"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0010.htm#09121532000537">
	<p pid="a.239.1/1">I wish to declare an interest, as the part-owner of two properties that are currently rented out.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/2">Let me start by praising the measures that have improved fire safety in residential properties over the past 20 years. More than 80 per cent. of homes now have smoke alarms compared with 9 per cent. in 1987, and fire deaths have halved from 1988 to 2008. Many fire authorities have carried out sterling work in increasing public awareness of not only the need to have working smoke alarms but a range of other fire safety measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/3">I pay tribute to the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, which has worked hard on a range of prevention measures. Following a serious fire in my constituency, the authority installed more than 1,200 new smoke alarms in just two months. Building regulations currently dictate that new-build extensions and alterations should be equipped with hard-wired smoke and fire alarms. Furniture regulations also play their part in reducing the number of avoidable domestic fires, or lessening their impact, and Government have wisely invested in an effective publicity scheme. All those measures have had the impact of reducing fire deaths and increasing the number of working smoke alarms across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/4">Figures clearly show that as awareness about fire safety increases, deaths and injuries decrease, yet casualties and preventable fires continue. We have seen a number of tragic fire deaths in recent months, quite often involving rented properties. The figures speak for themselves. In 2007, there were 331 deaths from fire. Of those, 222-or two thirds-occurred in places in which there was no working smoke alarm. In 137 cases, there was no detection system at all. Is it not possible to argue that a working smoke alarm could have saved one of those 222 lives or helped to prevent one of the 9,066 non-fatal casualties from that year?</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/5">There are gaps in the regulations governing fire prevention. Outside of houses in multiple occupation, it is only guidance or good practice that governs the provision of smoke and fire detection. The majority of landlords in the private and social sectors ensure that smoke alarms are available, which not only provides safety and reassurance for tenants, but is in the interests of landlords. However, a minority of rented homes do not have smoke alarms and they may well house some of the most vulnerable members of society. There is something of a correlation between the propensity to fire and the lack of fire safety devices. The Association of British Insurers highlighted that in 2001, 81 per cent. of homes had smoke alarms, but fewer than 60 per cent. of homes suffering fires had alarms.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/6">Promoting voluntary good practice among landlords has been very positive. The number of landlords becoming accredited is increasing and that reassures tenants not only that their property is relatively safer, but that their landlord appreciates their duty of care to them. Sadly, the majority of private-sector landlords do not join landlord associations in which best practice can be shared and standards raised. The good landlords pay a heavy price in reputation for the actions of the bad.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/7">Social housing providers also need to ensure that they are working to best practice. When a recent house fire in my constituency highlighted the issue of fire safety, it was found that around a quarter of the properties of Riviera housing trust had no smoke alarm. Much to its credit, the association has now pledged to ensure that all properties have working smoke alarms by March 2010. Nevertheless, Government guidelines are clearly lacking if a housing association can provide a service to vulnerable people without needing to ensure safety from fire.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/8">The key word here is &quot;guidelines&quot;. The Housing Health and Safety Rating System highlights 29 factors that may be taken into consideration by local authorities when assessing risks to all residential properties. If fire is seen as a category 1 hazard, enforcement action can be taken. Other guidance documents over recent years have stressed the importance of smoke alarms, but local authorities are free to do as little as they wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/9">A number of cases have highlighted the need for better regulation. At a recent inquest into a fatal fire in Yarcombe near Honiton in Devon, the coroner resolved to contact Ministers from the Department for Communities and Local Government to urge them to review whether smoke detection could be mandatory in rented domestic dwellings.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.1/10">Earlier this year there were fire deaths in two incidents in Northumberland; at Ashington and Bedlington.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15a.240.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1879" speakername="Adrian Sanders" colnum="240"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0010.htm#09121532000540">
	<p pid="a.240.2/1">I am more than happy to congratulate the young lady on her spirited civil action. The hon. Gentleman is right when he says that houses of multiple occupation have been identified as most at risk, which is why they already come under statutory legislation. My point today is that we need to extend that legislation to all housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/2">In September, an elderly woman died in a fire in Porlock, Somerset. Again the fire authority found no smoke alarms. Indeed, fire officers have told me that they have never attended a fatal fire where working smoke alarms have been present. The number of cases reported in the local press of smoke alarms saving families from death and/or injury is significant. There should be a straightforward solution to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/3">In 2004, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Select Committee, of which I was then a member, produced its report on the fire service with the following recommendation:</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/4" class="indent">&quot;We believe that functioning smoke alarms save lives and reduce injuries. The Committee congratulates those Fire Services which operate initiatives to fit free smoke alarms for the vulnerable. We welcome the requirement for alarms to be hard-wired in alterations, extensions and new buildings. We recommend this requirement be extended to include all existing tenanted properties, housing of multiple occupation and housing for vulnerable members of society. If the design of such buildings makes installation of hard-wired alarms impossible, we recommend use of alarms fitted with 10 year batteries.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/5">As those recommendations were not adopted, I feel that it is time to review the matter. Moreover, I should like to stress one further point of the recommendation and that is the hard-wired nature of smoke alarms. Many landlords in both private and social sectors rely on battery-powered alarms to serve as safety devices. Although they are good and far better than having no detection devices at all, they throw up some problems. They are not always as accurate as mains connected systems, and over-sensitive alarms can easily be turned off by disgruntled tenants having to hear an alarm every time they toast a piece of bread. Furthermore, such alarms require regular testing, and with vulnerable tenants that is not always something that can be devolved to personal responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/6">A more serious issue is that of failure to trigger. Figures show that since 1997 the failure rate of mains-linked smoke alarms has been between 9 and 13 per cent. That compares rather starkly to the failure rates of 37 to 44 per cent. for battery-operated smoke alarms. The majority of the latter cases are due to flat or absent batteries. That is not to say that smoke alarms are the only solution; we need to explore issues such as more regular inspections of electrical systems in rented properties and more awareness over how to prevent fires starting in the first place. However, where saving lives and preventing injury from fire is the issue, it seems indisputable that smoke alarms have a significant beneficial effect. Making smoke detectors compulsory in all rented properties has broad support. I have already mentioned the ODPM Select Committee report. Early-day motion 263, which endorses mandatory detectors, has cross-party support.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/7">I must also register my thanks to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1575" name="Chris Grayling">the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase> for pledging his support to the cause in my local newspaper. Sir Jeremy Beecham, the then chair of the Local Government Association, also spoke in favour of compulsory smoke detectors in 2003. Landlords have a duty of care to ensure that gas systems are kept in good order-they even need an energy performance certificate-so why do we not ensure that all landlords provide adequate protection from fire? For the majority of landlords, such a requirement would not make any difference as they already fulfil all the guidelines. However, for tens of thousands of existing tenants and future tenants, it could provide considerable reassurance and, more importantly, save dozens of lives every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/8">It is good progress that new dwellings are guaranteed a good standard of fire detection and warning, but it is fundamentally important that that protection is extended to those people who live in older properties and that guidelines should be turned into a necessity.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/9">Research carried out earlier this year for the Australian Fire and Emergency Authorities Council showed that just less than a third of countries across the developed and developing worlds have legislation in place to make smoke alarms mandatory. So it is not an unusual or draconian law to consider introducing. As the deputy chief fire officer of the Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service has said on this issue:</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Some of our most vulnerable people are affected by this gap in the law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/11">We know that fire death rates are higher for the over-80s than for any other group.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/12">Legislation must be part of a solution to the problem of fire casualties. The financial incentive of cheaper insurance for more responsible behaviour, coupled with good education, can only go so far. Therefore I urge the Minister to find a swift solution to this problem. The figures that I have set out today show that the absence of a smoke alarm is at least a factor in more than 200 deaths and in thousands of injuries every year. We have legislated to make landlords ensure that gas appliances and flues are safe, so why can we not legislate to ensure that tenants have a good chance to survive any fire in their property?</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/13">There are a few realistic measures that we can consider taking. For example, will the Minister consider amending section 2 of the Housing Act 2004 to make the absence of appropriate fire detectors and alarms as well as the presence of defective fire detectors and alarms separate category 1 prescribed fire hazards? Will he look at other delegated legislation to ensure that the responsible person-in other words, the landlord-equips dwellings with appropriate fire detectors and alarms? Will he look at including questions in the home information pack's property information questionnaire that relate to the presence and standard of fire detectors and alarms?</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/14">Fire authorities across the country have done their part by raising awareness, giving advice and fitting alarms. Now it is the Government's turn to act and I urge the Minister to do what he can to help prevent future tragedies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-15a.242.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1542" speakername="Shahid Malik" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="242"  time="013:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091215/halltext/91215h0011.htm#09121532000541">
	<p pid="a.242.0/1">Mr. Hood, I want to commence by saying what a pleasure it is to engage in this debate under your stewardship.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/2">I also want to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1879" name="Adrian Sanders">the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders)</phrase> on securing this debate. He has an obvious passion and commitment for this cause and for his constituency. That passion does not surprise me, because some 15 years ago he had equal passion on issues relating to the third sector and helping the poorest in society. I had the privilege of working with him then.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/3">In England, we have a strong record on fire prevention, a record that we can be justifiably proud of. Any deaths or injuries in house fires are regrettable, but the latest statistics show that fire deaths in the home in England are at their lowest since 1980 and, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, 40 per cent. lower than in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/4">Our key strategy to drive down preventable fire deaths across all housing sectors has been proactive community fire safety activities-education, information and publicity-as has been highlighted. Most fires in the home are preventable. Community fire safety is about providing basic fire safety information to householders, to help them to alter their behaviour and think more about how fire safety could affect them and their families. In particular, it is about reminding people of the importance of having working smoke alarms installed in their homes and testing them regularly.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/5">The installation of properly maintained smoke alarms in every household has been the centrepiece of our efforts to reduce fire deaths in the home, as they provide the vital early warning of fire and consequently help people to escape. The Government have conducted high-profile national television campaigns that promote the use and maintenance of smoke alarms, which have proved very successful. We have recently launched a new national advertising campaign, &quot;Don't Drown in Toxic Smoke&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/6">We have targeted advice and guidance at more than 1 million social homes, by advertising in social housing newsletters through a partnership with the &quot;Wise up to Fire&quot; campaign. That work, conducted in collaboration with editors of tenants' newsletters, involved a fire safety advertorial that provided top fire safety tips, including highlighting the importance of having a working smoke alarm installed, and guidance on the responsibilities of social housing landlords.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/7">Since 2004, the Government have invested &#163;25 million in grants to fire and rescue authorities to enable them to purchase smoke alarms to install in domestic dwellings. I want to join the hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to his local fire and rescue service-the Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service-for the work that it has done, which he described in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/8">That initiative resulted in nearly 2 million home fire risk checks being carried out in England, with more than 2.4 million smoke alarms being installed, saving an estimated 53 lives per year. I know that the hon. Gentleman recognises the importance of that initiative and indeed applauds the initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/9">The increase in ownership of smoke alarms as a result of such campaigns and other actions is a major success story. As I think the hon. Gentleman himself mentioned, in 1987 only 9 per cent. of dwellings were fitted with smoke alarms. By 2007, that had risen to 85 per cent., an almost tenfold increase. Indeed, the English house condition survey suggested that in the social rented sector more than 88 per cent. of homes had smoke alarms by 2007. The social sector also leads the way in fitting hard-wired and mains-powered smoke alarms, with nearly 40 per cent. of dwellings in that sector having such alarms compared with less than 16 per cent. of dwellings in the private sector. The hon. Gentleman powerfully articulated the increased efficiency and effectiveness of mains-powered smoke alarms.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/10">There is absolutely no room whatsoever for complacency about health and safety matters in our homes, which obviously includes fire safety matters. In the first instance, each of us must take responsibility for the safety of our own households. So, fire safety in individual domestic properties is generally a matter for the occupier of the premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/11">Any new measures that we introduce through regulations must, of course, be proportionate and justified in terms of the lives that they save and the injuries that they prevent. For instance, it has been a requirement in building regulations since 1992 that new dwellings should be fitted with mains-powered smoke alarms. That requirement applies to the erection of new buildings, extensions and to certain alterations and changes of use.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/12">Legislation also exists to govern fire safety in certain types of existing residential accommodation. As the hon. Gentleman indicated in response to an intervention, blocks of flats and houses in multiple occupation are covered by that legislation. The Housing Act 2004 introduced the housing health and safety rating system, which is the principal tool for assessing fire safety risk and for regulating standards in all types and tenures of residential accommodation, in both individual dwellings and housing blocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/13">Creating legislation to insist that all local authority and social housing landlords install smoke alarms is by no means straightforward. I do not think for a second that the hon. Gentleman was suggesting that creating such legislation would be straightforward; I think that his argument was that it is necessary. There are complex issues involving maintenance and liability. Also, of course, many residential buildings also contain premises for other uses, such as commercial and retail, which complicates the picture further.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/14">The HHSRS reflects our preference for proportionate and risk-based regulation supported by the encouragement of best practice rather than blanket requirements across the piece. That is also reflected in the advice issued in 2001 to which the hon. Gentleman referred, which emphasised the value of installing smoke alarms in social housing and clarified the legal implications for local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/15">All good landlords will wish to ensure the health and safety of their tenants and the safety of their property, which is their asset. In the vast majority of cases, local authorities and housing associations, as responsible landlords, have taken the opportunity to install smoke alarms. Although the decent homes standard does not require that smoke alarms be installed, an assessment of fire risk is necessary to meet the statutory minimum standard for housing under the housing health and safety rating system. A fire assessment under the HHSRS considers the likelihood of a fire starting, the chances of its detection, its speed of spreading and the ease and means of escape.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/16">The decent homes programme does not and could not cover all aspects of a building, but we will keep the matter under review as we maintain the standard in future. That does not prevent landlords from installing smoke alarms when undertaking other works, as local authorities and housing associations are encouraged to do, and the evidence suggests that many social landlords are doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/17">Of course, attention to fire safety is not confined to individual dwellings. Under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, landlords, as &quot;responsible persons&quot;, have a duty to risk-assess fire safety in the common parts of buildings, take adequate precautions and manage any remaining risk. Although the order applies only to the common parts of premises, in many residential premises the responsible person will in practice need to take account of fire safety measures in place in the individual dwellings. Fire and rescue authorities have a legal duty under the order to enforce its provisions in the common areas of residential accommodation such as blocks of flats and houses in multiple occupation. Local authorities have inspection and enforcement responsibilities under the Housing Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/18">In recognition of the complexities, we have worked closely with the Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and the Chief Fire Officers Association to develop guidance to ensure that the risk of fire in multi-occupied buildings is actively and appropriately managed. That work continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/19">In our response to the consultation on reform of council housing finance, we proposed, in the context of local authority self-financing after 2011, the inclusion of ongoing maintenance of lifts and common parts in addition to the decent homes standard.</p>

	<p pid="a.245.1/1">That is a valid point worth considering. I will take it away, consider it and write to him. From a common-sense perspective, it seems like an appropriate opportunity to carry out a check for fire alarms if one is taking place for other potentially hazardous elements within the household.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/2">The framework includes six standards for social housing providers, one of which is the home standard covering quality of accommodation and repairs and maintenance. The Tenant Services Authority's proposed quality standard means the decent homes standard or higher, and it is proposed that providers should give their tenants the opportunity to agree a local standard reflecting their concerns and priorities. If fire safety matters are a concern for tenants, the framework would enable tenants to shape their local standard to reflect that.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/3">The hon. Gentleman has pressed for provision of smoke alarms to be made a statutory requirement on all landlords. As I have emphasised, the Government share his concern to ensure full take-up of smoke alarms in every dwelling. That is why we have focused so heavily on it in campaigns aimed at householders, tenants and landlords alike. I have already stated that the number of smoke alarms taken up has increased tenfold. There has been a step change in getting smoke alarms into dwellings; the latest campaign seeks to ensure another step change in terms of people checking them once a week. Our view is that checking is woefully inadequate at the moment, hence the campaign. Hopefully, it will have the same impact as previous campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/4">I assure the House that we will continue to encourage social landlords to provide smoke alarms-particularly hard-wired systems, for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman highlighted-when carrying out other works to their stock. We think that that, rather than introducing another regulatory requirement, remains the right way forward, notwithstanding the point that I made earlier. As I indicated, we will keep the matter under review, not least as we maintain the decent homes standard in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/5">It is still worth noting that householders can take some responsibility for their own safety, including fire safety, and the vast majority do. For as little as &#163;8, anyone can buy and install a smoke alarm for their home to help protect themselves and their family from the dangers of fire. Anyone unable to do so themselves can contact their local fire and rescue service and ask it to undertake a home fire risk check. Depending on the person's circumstances, the fire and rescue service will consider supplying and fitting a smoke alarm free of charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/6">We remain committed to reducing deaths from fire so that tragedies such as the ones that we heard about today will not be repeated. All the hon. Gentleman's requests and suggestions are undoubtedly sensible and reasonable, but he will understand that introducing new requirements in legislation sometimes has unintended consequences. If we can do things without going down a legislative route, that would be the preferred option. As he highlighted in his intervention, we have opportunities to increase fire safety in the home without being too onerous or complex about it, and I will consider some of them. I thank him again for raising an issue that is incredibly important not just to his constituents but to people throughout the country.</p>
