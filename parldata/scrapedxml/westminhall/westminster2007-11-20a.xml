<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-20a.40.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" speakername="Diane Abbott" colnum="40"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071120/halltext/71120h0001.htm#07112055000506">
	<p pid="a.40.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has made a very important point, to which I will return. Whatever people's views on our system of immigration control, whether they think that it is too strict, not strict enough or just very badly managed, which is my view, we cannot have a robust system without the figures, and both on the general question of children and on the particular question of children in immigration detention, the figures are not robust enough. I have been very disappointed, in doing the research and looking at previous responses to questions, with Ministers' approach. Whatever the House believes the direction of travel should be on immigration control, at the very least we need robust figures. On the basis of the figures available to me, we are talking about some 200 children in the first quarter of 2007, but I will return to the question of the figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/2">Let me begin to talk about the conditions in which the children are held. There are general issues that make those conditions deplorable. The first general issue that makes the detention of children for immigration purposes deplorable is the arbitrary nature of the detention process. I ask hon. Members to reflect on the fact that a child who has committed a criminal offence and is put in prison, who is serving a sentence at Her Majesty's pleasure&mdash;that is how sentencing is termed for children under a certain age&mdash;has more rights than a child held in immigration detention and is dealt with in a more transparent way. Immigration detention is not ordered or sanctioned by a court; it is an administrative power. People are not being detained because they have committed a criminal offence. That means that there is a lack of transparency and accountability and it gives the immigration service the kind of control over people's lives and rights that a court would not have. The first thing to say about the detention of children is the arbitrary nature of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/3">The second general issue, which is worth a debate on its own, is medical treatment. The medical treatment available to detainees in a detention centre has been a general concern. I want to refer to issues raised by doctors and groups such as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res. It is tragic that an organisation that is used to dealing with medical concerns in war zones and famine regions had to come to Britain to do an investigation into our detention centres. Among the issues raised by doctors in research that I have seen are depression and suicide. Many people in detention centres have post-traumatic stress disorder or are depressed. Some have been tortured and are not receiving therapy for that. Some are HIV-positive, but are not receiving the treatment that they should receive in the detention centre. Some come from areas of the world where malaria is prevalent, have lost their immunity to malaria after coming to the UK and have difficulty getting the proper course of treatment. Some suffer from tuberculosis. Those are general medical issues covering everyone being held in detention centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.1/4">I suggest to Ministers that a detention centre is a peculiarly unsuitable atmosphere for detaining children. The arbitrary nature of the process&mdash;people do not know what will happen to them&mdash;and the problems with medical treatment are two general concerns.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.1/1">We are the only country in the world. I shall return to the point because it is a grave and shameful matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/2">The UNHCR regrets that the UK has made a reservation to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in order to be able to pass immigration legislation without reference to its obligations under the CRC. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/3" class="indent">&quot;UNCHR strongly disapproves of the UK's reservation in this area, which the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has stated is not compatible with the objects and purpose of the CRC. However, it is important to note that the reservation is at least limited to the passing of legislation only, and so would not appear to operate as a relevant factor in questions relating to operational matters, such as decisions made regarding the implementation of immigration detention policy in specific cases. The Government, therefore, is free to follow humanitarian and moral imperatives to inform its policies on the detention of children.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/4">The Minister will doubtless be relieved to know that the Government are free to allow humanitarian and moral imperatives to inform their policies on the detention of children.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/5">I turn to what other stakeholders and people who have visited those children have said. The Children's Society states:</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/6" class="indent">&quot;We don't think it's ever acceptable to detain children for the purposes of immigration control. In practice it's very difficult for families to abscond because they need contact with services like health and education and it's much harder for a family to disappear.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/7">The Refugee Children's Consortium has called on the Government to use the UK Borders Act 2007 to stop the detention of children. The four UK children's commissioners have expressed &quot;profound&quot; concern about the detention of children.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/8">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees states that it views the detention of minors as</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/9" class="indent">&quot;a special cause for concern, and we are clear in our guidance that minors who are asylum seekers should not be detained at all...where exceptional circumstances necessitate the detention of asylum seeking children, states should also make provision for the independent monitoring of the mental health of detained asylum-seeking children, which should be facilitated by access to appropriate non-governmental organisations&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/10">Save the Children, in its report &quot;No Place Like Home&quot;, suggested that children in detention were vulnerable on account of being children, being detained and being immigrants. The all-party group on refugees published a report in July 2006, to which the Govt have not responded, saying that the detention of children</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/11" class="indent">&quot;makes a mockery of children's rights legislation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/12">Finally, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, in its report on the treatment of asylum seekers in March 2007, found that the UK was in breach of its human rights obligations by detaining children. One of the report's authors, Lord Avebury, said that</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/13" class="indent">&quot;lack of accountability for all aspects of the detention of children pervades every level of policy and practice, and is exemplified by the Government's steadfast refusal to publish comprehensive statistics on the matter.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/14">The lack of accountability pervades every level of policy and practice. Today's debate is my humble attempt to try to shed some light on the process and to bring some accountability to it.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-20a.45.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-20b.45.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-20a.45.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" speakername="Diane Abbott" colnum="45"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071120/halltext/71120h0002.htm#07112055000512">
	<p pid="a.45.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. When the matter originally came before Parliament, there was a consensus that detaining the family for one or two days might be necessary as part of the process of removal. However, no one taking part in that debate&mdash;some hon. Members who are here today were present then&mdash;ever envisaged children being detained for three months or beyond. No one ever envisaged that periods of detention would be so long.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/2">I turn to what the Government are doing. I would not want it to be thought that the Government had paid no attention to lobbyists. First, the Minister for Borders and Immigration made a welcome statement about the need to incorporate a code of practice on the treatment of children as we rolled out the borders legislation. That statement was greeted with some gratitude by those who had lobbied on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/3">Let me set out the Government's position on some of the issues that I raised this morning. First is the question of the reservation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. A question was tabled about the subject in July and the immigration Minister responded. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The Government believe the reservation remains justified in order to maintain an effective immigration control.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/5">The Government justify the reservation in the name of immigration control. We come back to the media and polling pressures&mdash;and the political pressure. In the end, a robust and sustainable system of immigration control, which is what Members from all parties want, has to be a system that the community as a whole, including even the asylum-seeking community, believe is firm but fair. A system of immigration control that is chaotic, badly run and contains a deeply flawed approach to vulnerable people such as children, will never achieve a consensus, and it will continue to be problematic. In his written answer, the Minister also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/6" class="indent">&quot;we are proposing to introduce a code of practice to ensure that in carrying out its functions in the UK the Border and Immigration Agency takes appropriate steps to keep children safe from harm while they are in the UK.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-07-09.1350"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 July 2007; Vol. 462, c. 1350W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/7">That was a welcome statement. However, Ministers have also said things that were not quite so welcome. For instance, in a debate on asylum seekers in Westminster Hall in March 2007, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> raised the question of the detention of children. The Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/8" class="indent">&quot;We have also debated the question of detention. I am anxious to explore alternatives to detaining children. Sometimes, parents have a responsibility too; when I sign off cases of children who have been in detention for some time, I often find out that that has been because their parents have been disruptive or abusive or have exhibited dangerous behaviour towards staff&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2007-03-28.482"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 28 March 2007; Vol. 458, c. 482WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/9">What is the Minister for Borders and Immigration saying but that children are being detained because of misbehaviour by their parents? I urge the Minister for the Home Department to read again the relevant UN convention. It is quite wrong and contrary to best national practice that children should be detained or punished as punishment for the behaviour of their parents, but that is what the immigration Minister said in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/10">In response to efforts in debates on the UK Borders Act 2007 in October to get further protection for children, Ministers spoke about the problem of judicial review, saying that trying to give asylum seeking children the protection of children's legislation would</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/11" class="indent">&quot;create a risk of judicial review and other legalistic devices being thrown against the agency, which will slow down its ability to remove people to the country&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-10-29.553"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 October 2007; Vol. 465, c. 553</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/12">The Minister for Borders and Immigration said:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Judicial review presents a serious problem: between January and March this year we received an average of 79 judicial reviews a week challenging enforcement activity...I fear that the change to section 11 proposed by the hon. Member for Ashford would simply multiply those barriers.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-05-09.233"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 May 2007; Vol. 460, c. 233</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/14">I have been a Member of Parliament for 20 years, representing a part of the country with one of the largest numbers of immigration, refugee and asylum seeker cases. No one knows better than I do about vexatious judicial review applications or deplores them more than I do. They are a waste of time and hold up false hope to my constituents, who all too often have to find money out of their own pockets to pay for applications that are going nowhere. When I see that they are going nowhere, it is now my practice to ring the solicitor and ask, &quot;Where exactly are you going with this?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/15">I do not believe in giving false hope to constituents, and deplore the fact that some of the poorest and most marginalised constituents have to find hundreds of pounds to pay for what are essentially legal delaying devices. If there is a problem with vexatious judicial review applications, however, the Government must deal with it, and not use it as an excuse not to meet the spirit and letter of their obligations to children. One understands the point made about jails, but it does not justify the wholesale abrogation of this country's obligations under the convention on the rights of the child.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/16">Another part of the Government's response, on which many people have lobbied, is the pilot project on whether there are alternatives to detention. Apparently, those in the pilot are in supported family accommodation in a hotel and are being helped to work towards voluntary return. Families are expected to stay within the pilot scheme for eight weeks. It is too early to say how it is going. Worth while as the pilot is, however, it does not help children in detention at the moment, there is no indication of how it has reduced, or will reduce, the number of such children, there is no information on the criteria for entry into the pilot scheme, and there is no sign of how it will be independently evaluated. Although the pilot is welcome, one would like to see more transparency and a hope of independent evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/17">Furthermore, as part of the Government's response, we have a report, entitled &quot;Review of UKIS Family Removals Processes&quot;. It was commissioned by Dave Roberts and written by Judith Evans. I do not know if either of them is in the Chamber today. If they are, I hope that they will not take this personally, but I found it a bizarre and inappropriate document. It talks about putting the welfare of the child at the centre of the removal process, but that seems to amount to the idea that, as part of the removal process, immigration officers should keep a particular eye on the child. It does not talk about referrals. The report states that officials</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/18" class="indent">&quot;should consider appointing named officers during any detention visit to review the reactions of the child to the process of detention.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/19">Let us stop and think about that. Officials bang on someone's door at 8 am&mdash;they have said that they will not knock on people's doors before then&mdash;and a named official watches the child to see how they react to having their door knocked down and their mother dragged off to detention. What is the point of that, other than to make a token and derisory concession to the need to put the welfare of the child at the centre of our approach?</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/20">The report makes an even better recommendation. Obviously, the people who wrote it have read the same things as I have about how frightened and traumatised the children are by the process of being dragged away to detention, so they have thought very hard about what can be done about the psychological impact on children and proposed that the uniform of immigration officers be changed. They seem to be saying that what is frightening the children is the fact that the uniforms are navy blue or black and suggesting that they should be a pale colour&mdash;maybe pink or lilac! The idea that a child will be less traumatised by having their door kicked down and being dragged off to detention for an indefinite period by officers wearing a pink uniform rather than a black one has no place in an official Home Office report. Even when I was in the Home Office, which is now 25 years ago, we could have done better than that. It seems to me that the report was produced to address the widespread concern about the conditions in which such children are held, but it does not address the relevant points.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/21">I know that hon. Friends involved closely with this issue wish to speak, so in conclusion, may I say that I am very concerned about the figures for children in detention. In particular, I was concerned by the response to a parliamentary question tabled in July by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>, who asked the Secretary of State:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/22" class="indent">&quot;how many cases were referred to Ministers for review of the continued detention of children on immigration grounds beyond 28 days in each of the last three years&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/23">If a child is to be kept beyond 28 days, the case is meant to be referred to a Minister, although no Minister has yet turned down such a request. The Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/24" class="indent">&quot;The information requested on referrals is not centrally collated and could be provided only...at disproportionate cost.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-07-02.916"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 July 2007; Vol. 462, c. 916W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/25">If we are serious about the welfare of children, at the very least we ought to keep centrally figures available on a monthly basis on the number of children we are holding beyond 28 days. Whatever a person's view on immigration control, it is not acceptable that we are keeping children beyond 28 days&mdash;in one case that I have raised with Ministers, for three months, in another, 112 days&mdash;and that those figures are not kept centrally. If one thing comes out of this debate, I hope that it will be a commitment from Ministers that from now on they will look at their record keeping on children and unaccompanied minors in detention. In particular, they ought to be able to provide Members, on request, with the number of children being held beyond 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/26">We also need to do some really robust research into whether detaining families with children is necessary. The argument is that if we do not detain them, they will abscond. People assert that that is not the case. However, I am yet to see comprehensive research that proves it one way or the other. Above all, however, I put it to Ministers that reports that suggest changing the colour of uniforms are derisory. If Ministers are taking seriously the trauma that children go through, the Government need to commit themselves to bringing down the number of children in detention. How many times do international organisations, children's pressure groups, Her Majesty's inspectorate and the commissioner for children have to raise the point that the Government must bring down that number?</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/27">I accept what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1462" name="Nick Palmer">the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer)</phrase> said; there might be occasional cases when a child has to be kept in detention for a few days. But the fact that increasing numbers of children are being detained for increasing periods, and that Ministers cannot say at any given time how many are being held for longer than 28 days, simply is not acceptable. I accept that the front page of the <i>Daily Express </i>will not be calling, five days a week, for action on children in detention. It is also perfectly true that nobody ever made their career in government by building a fair and humane system of immigration; one builds a career by the constant rolling-out of crackdowns, toughness, fresh initiatives and so on. However, I put it to Ministers that in 2007, it is time for one of the wealthiest liberal democracies in the world to comply with international standards on the detention of children. As other Members have said, it makes a mockery of our children's rights legislation that children in immigration detention continue to be held in such numbers for so long and in such conditions. I hope that Ministers will take on board some of what is said this morning, and that we can make some progress on the issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-20a.51.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="51"  time="010:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071120/halltext/71120h0003.htm#07112055000526">
	<p pid="a.51.1/1">I did hear some of that conversation, but not all of it. My hon. Friend raised those points. Children in detention should be under the protection of the Children Act 2004 and have access to full-quality national health service care and, if necessary, to social services protection, just like any other child in the country. I am not convinced that the reality of detaining children guarantees any of those things.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/2">The campaigns on Yarl's Wood are considerable. Local people have often complained about it and there have been many demonstrations outside it. There is a history of problems in its administration. There is a wider point, however. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March 2006</phrase>, the Refugee Council pointed out that more than 2,000 children a year are locked up by the UK Government for immigration purposes. It had launched a new campaign and stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The campaign is demanding an end to detention for children because:</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/4" class="indent">It causes children distress, depression, creates behavioural changes and confusion. It can cause and exacerbate physical health problems; and lead to lack of sleep and weight loss. It disrupts a child's education, and can seriously undermine their ability to learn. It runs contrary to various international standards, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/5">I could not have put it better myself. This country is proud of being a signatory to the UN charter, the European convention on human rights, the 1951 Geneva convention, the convention on the rights of the child, torture conventions and all the others. They apply to us here, as well as to the demands that we make on people in other parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/6">Bail for Immigration Detainees, which has done good work, produced a handbook and press release on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>. The press release stated that children are being damaged by immigration detention because</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/7" class="indent">&quot;No special consideration is given to the needs or best interests of children when deciding to detain a family. Detention is not clearly justified in each case, and existing alternatives to detention are not fully considered. Families, and children, do not fully understand why they are detained, have no automatic legal representation and their detention is not subject to a time-limit or independent review. Processes for welfare assessments of families and ministerial authorisation for detention beyond 28 days do not protect children from prolonged and harmful detention.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/8">I hope that the Minister will give us some hope that all children who are being detained will be subject to ministerial decision so that we know exactly how many are being detained and why. I also hope that she will consider the Swedish system of having a case worker assigned to a family, going through the whole process with them as a supportive mechanism. Very few, if any, children are detained there, and I do not see why we cannot do the same in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington rightly referred to the statements made by Anne Owers, the former chief inspector of prisons. Like her, I know Anne Owers well and admire her work hugely. The fact that she made an unannounced visit to Yarl's Wood some time ago, in February 2006, made her statements and expressed concerns about children in detention, should be taken seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/10">My final point has an international context, relating to UN conventions. I attend UN Human Rights Council meetings as a non-governmental observer and have taken part in a lot of activities surrounding them. Many people there fulminate about abuses of human rights around the world, and rightly so&mdash;I join in all that&mdash;but that also applies to us. The United Nations Human Rights Committee expressed its concern that</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/11" class="indent">&quot;asylum seekers have been detained in various facilities on grounds other than those legitimate under the ICCPR, including reasons of administrative convenience.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/12">That statement was made some time ago, but the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has expressed concerns about the UK Borders Act 2007. It has stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/13" class="indent">&quot;UNHCR would like to encourage legislators to examine alternative arrangements for children to ensure that required contact management will be conducted in a child friendly manner and within the overall normative framework of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 1951 Refugee Convention.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.51.1/14">We signed the convention on the rights of the child and pride ourselves on being a country that has democratic institutions and a robust defence of individual liberties and human rights. Detaining children defeats all those things. I appeal to the Minister to re-examine seriously the whole policy of detaining children and recognise the damage that it does to them. As a start, Ministers should know exactly how many children are detained at any one time and why, and they should have to give personal approval for that detention. That would show us to be taking seriously the rights and needs of children. I hope that we can move on to a system in which it is simply not necessary to detain children at all. We are damaging them, it is wrong and it is not morally correct.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Olner, for calling me to give the first winding-up speech. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> not only on her speech but on using such parliamentary occasions in the most effective way possible&mdash;to highlight an ongoing area of Government policy that a Member regards as deficient, giving a Minister an opportunity to justify or, better still, alter and adjust it.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.0/2">I agree with the hon. Lady's broad observations about the party political context that underpins much of the debate on immigration and asylum. It is shocking that the leaders of some political parties in this country seem to regard polling evidence in marginal seats as the main determining factor in deciding on policies that have a direct impact on people's well-being. She mentioned the front page of the <i>Daily Express</i>, but it could have been any one of a number of papers&mdash;even the one that, until recently, was edited by the new chief spin doctor of the Conservative party. That paper takes an aggressive view of this area of policy and seems to put pressure on the Government and other political parties to respond in rather draconian terms, which often jars with the better and more liberal instincts of millions of people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-20a.56.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1379" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="56"  time="010:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071120/halltext/71120h0003.htm#07112055000539">
	<p pid="a.56.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that cogent intervention. The more we delve into this matter, the more depressing the situation appears. I am sure that the Minister would like to address that.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/2">I have some sympathy for the Minister, because there is a case for saying that in a system of controlled immigration we need to have the power to detain people at some point, and may need to detain families. As did other hon. Members, I visited Yarl's Wood, and, like any normal, civilised human being, I came away profoundly uneasy at the sight of young children behind bars, of doors being clanged shut and of jailers&mdash;that is what they are&mdash;with huge bunches of keys, yet behind those doors were children playing happily.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/3">There is something about that situation that would give rise to a huge sense of unease in any civilised person. That is why many hon. Members rightly raised the prospect of alternatives. Many mentioned the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which stated in its 1999 guidelines that detention should only be resorted to for a minimal period in cases of necessity. It also made a point that was made earlier about the UK Borders Act 2007. I moved amendments to the Bill, which, it should be said, were supported by Liberal Democrat Members, that would have applied the conditions of the Children Act 2004 to the Bill, but the Government rejected them partly for the reasons that were set out by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington, and partly because they said that such conditions would render impossible the proper work of immigration officers. We doubted that on the grounds that the same duty is already applied to police officers who clearly have to make positive and occasionally coercive interventions against children. As it does not stop them doing their job, I was not convinced by the Government's arguments.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/4">Nevertheless, even the UNHCR accepts that detention is needed in some circumstances. There are two central questions for the Minister to answer. Are we detaining as few children as possible for as short a time as possible, and are there alternatives to detention that would be equally effective?</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/5">The first question, which involves delays, is a long-standing problem of the whole asylum and, indeed, wider immigration system. Delay is still endemic. Asylum and immigration tribunals are overwhelmed because cases are not handled in the most efficient manner possible. Some of the victims of delay and incompetence are children, who are held in detention for far longer than I suspect even Ministers would wish to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/6">I, too, have asked many parliamentary questions about Yarl's Wood. I was told that few children are held there for more than 28 days, but I doubted that response. Some of the evidence that has been produced today suggests that my scepticism was justified. It is clear that delays happen. They are part of a wider systemic problem. As was said earlier, Ministers talk tough but act ineffectually in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/7">The second big question is around potential options or proper alternatives to detention, which were discussed by the all-party group on refugees. I would like the Minister to deal particularly with two of the options that it mentioned. The Swedish option has already been discussed. Another option is electronic monitoring and tagging.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/8">The UNHCR report on alternative detention notes that the 2001 Home Office evaluation of tagging in the criminal justice field stated that there was a 90 per cent. compliance rate among criminals. I am aware of recent research that is less positive about tagging, but I would be grateful if the Minister could address it as a possible option. The point has been made that, of all the people who may be detained because of asylum and immigration matters, families are probably the least likely to abscond. Therefore, would tagging be effective?</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/9">The other alternative that I would draw to the Minister's attention is the work in Melbourne, Australia, of the Hotham Mission. I am sure that she is familiar with it, as everyone who deals with this area has been told that it works extremely well. It seeks to ensure a sound basis for improved welfare and to establish a safe environment for those who are the equivalents of those detained in this country. It houses 120 asylum seekers in 38 properties, provides support and runs a befriending programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/10">Clearly, outcomes are important. The point about the Hotham Mission is that, of the people who had gone through the project, 43 per cent. received immigration status, 57 per cent. had their claims refused and left the country, and 0 per cent. absconded. That is a spectacular figure for this difficult area. If there is a project somewhere in the world in which 0 per cent. of people end up absconding, we should be looking hard at it.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.0/11">Regardless of the wider immigration crisis, which shows no sign of improving, it ought to be easier to cope with the asylum system than it was a few years ago, as the numbers have come down&mdash;thankfully, largely because of the present absence of Balkan conflicts. I hope that the Government's refusal to insert a duty of care for children into the 2007 Act is not symbolic of their general attitude. As I said, I have some sympathy with the Minister, but I still need convincing that the Government are being either efficient or humane in their treatment of children in immigration detention.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.1/1">I welcome the opportunity to debate this important subject and I look forward to being under your chairmanship, Mr. Olner. I also thank the Minister for being here to answer our questions, because he had to rearrange his diary to do so, and I am particularly grateful to him because he is the Minister responsible for this issue. A number of colleagues from Norfolk are also here. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">The hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase> contacted me to say that he is unable to be here because of a Select Committee commitment, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> may grace us with his presence later.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/2">I initiated the debate to express my concerns about the Government's minded proposal to have the boundary committee consider a unitary authority based on an expanded Norwich city, and about the consequent changes for the county and district councils in Norfolk. The view in Norfolk&mdash;certainly among Labour members in Norwich&mdash;is that a Norwich unitary authority is a done deal and that Ministers have already made their decision. Indeed, so confident is Norwich city council that, in September, it appointed a director of transformation&mdash;that is almost like something out of J. K. Rowling's &quot;Harry Potter&quot;&mdash;on a modest stipend of &pound;90,000 a year. We should remember that that was before the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill had passed through the House. The director's remit was to help to &quot;shape and deliver&quot; a new unitary council&mdash;no ifs, no buts.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/3">My purpose this morning is to impress on the Minister that there is, to say the least, a considerable lack of support in Norfolk&mdash;and, I suspect, limited support in Norwich&mdash;for his specific unitary proposal. There are serious questions about the nature of the proposal, the impact on local communities and the danger that the county of Norfolk as an administrative unit will be abolished. Whatever people's views on the issue, however, perhaps the most fundamental question is about democratic accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/4">I remind the Minister that for many of us in Norfolk this latest initiative follows the failure of Norwich's bid this summer to become a unitary authority. It failed to meet the Government's own criteria, and that was thought to be due to the inherent weaknesses of the city's current boundaries. The Government have therefore now decided to move the goalposts and establish a unitary authority based on an enlarged city boundary.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/5">I represent the constituency of Mid-Norfolk, which is shaped rather like a large banana resting on top of Norwich. There are two district councils in my constituency&mdash;Breckland to the west and Broadland to the east, and local government in both gets high marks for council tax and the delivery of services. Parishes in Broadland are divided between the constituency of Norwich, North and my constituency, so I must declare an immediate interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/6">Following the original bid earlier this year, I did not receive one letter, telephone call or e-mail supporting the bid for a Norwich unitary authority and the possible impact on Broadland district council or Norfolk county council. In fact, quite the opposite happened, and I received hundreds of letters, phone calls and e-mails opposing the proposals. Every town and parish council formally objected, and those formal objections will be on the files in the Minister's Department. Those objections were based on a perceived threat to county and district councils that were efficient, gave value for money and which the Government themselves rated highly for the delivery of services. Sadly&mdash;this is sad&mdash;the perception of Norwich city council was the opposite, and the Audit Commission qualified its accounts in 2004-05 and 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/7">Local Norfolk opinion was best summed up in an editorial in the <i>Eastern Daily Press</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-23">23 June 2007</phrase>, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/8" class="indent">&quot;We have long believed that there is no need for the change. Norfolk County Council is a four star authority, while Broadland has the best record in the country on such issues as recycling. Why, then, hand the keys to a council&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/9">Norwich&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/10" class="indent">&quot;far beneath the Premier League on performance and service delivery?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/11">That opinion is as relevant today as it was in June. My concern is that the Minister has decided to use the model of a Norwich unitary authority as a baseline to reorganise local government in Norfolk, and that his unofficial riding instructions to the boundary committee have ruled out the status quo.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.1/1">I do not know, frankly. I want to have an honest debate in which all the options are under consideration. As I have tried to emphasise, it is obvious that the template must be the status quo, but it is not on the agenda. There are perfectly legitimate reasons for considering different variations as regards unitary authorities, but the status quo must be considered as a template or an option.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/2">We now come to consider and question the process by which the Minister seeks a unitary solution. He is minded to ask the boundary committee to consider the issue. Much to the surprise of many of us in Norfolk, the boundary committee, under its chairman, Mr. Max Caller, has begun the process. To date, it has received no written terms of reference from the Minister, but that did not prevent it from beginning consultation even before the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill had been passed in both Houses. Indeed, it has effectively issued an ultimatum to the county and district councils to produce proposals based on a unitary model by the end of the month. They have been told that the status quo is not an option, and non-participation will mean non-consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/3">By means of letters and telephone calls, I have attempted to establish the boundary committee's remit. My noble Friend Baroness Shephard of Northwold attempted to do the same in a debate in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-12">12 November</phrase>, as did my noble Friend Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market in a debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November</phrase>. Neither obtained a satisfactory answer. The point that they made, and my point now, is that the boundary committee's demand for councils to produce proposals by the end of the month, when there are no ministerial terms of reference, may, as my noble Friend Lord MacGregor put it, be illegal&mdash;and it is certainly, to say the least, bad practice. Will the Minister confirm that as yet there are no terms of reference for the boundary committee? If so, will he advise the boundary committee to cease its harassment of our councils and remove the arbitrary deadline of the end of the month? I was told by one boundary committee official that the purpose of the deadline is to enable the boundary committee to consider proposals according to a timetable.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/4">I have used the term &quot;harassment&quot; advisedly. All the Norfolk councils that I have spoken to have said that the chairman of the boundary committee and his officials have been very pro-active, and rather menacing. Indeed, in an interview that the chairman gave to the <i>Eastern Daily Press</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-06">6 November</phrase>, the reporter noted that local council leaders and officers had been told that he &quot;carries a big stick&quot; and that non-co-operation in the process is not an option. Despite still being opposed to the unitary authority case, those district and county councils have been forced to prepare options that are not their first choice, have serious cost implications and are not supported by any public mandate.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/5">To illustrate how biased the process is, I shall quote from an interview that the chairman of the boundary committee gave to the BBC's &quot;Politics Show&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-26">26 October</phrase>, which can be found on its website:</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Q: Is retaining a two tier authority an option? Because many people claim that this exercise is now a paper one and that a unitary future is inevitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/7" class="indent">A: Well a lot will depend on the terms of the invitation that the Secretary of State gives the Boundary Committee but we think we are going to be invited to propose a pattern of unitary local government for the county, and the only way we would not propose such a pattern is if we were convinced that the two tier system was better than any unitary proposal that we could come up with. And I honestly think that's unlikely.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/8">So it has already been decided&mdash;that is a fact&mdash;by the chairman of the boundary committee, before his terms of reference have even arrived.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/9">It seems to me once again that that creates fertile ground for a future judicial review, and the involvement of the Audit Commission. It is almost Alice in Wonderland. Hon. Members will recall the Queen of Hearts who was always screaming &quot;Sentence first&mdash;verdict afterwards.&quot; Whatever the merits or demerits of the local government reorganisation for Norfolk, we can be sure of one thing: the people of Norfolk will be consulted only on the margins. In the BBC interview that I mentioned, the chairman of the boundary committee said:</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/10" class="indent">&quot;It's not the function of the Boundary Committee to hold a referendum, that's not the way we do business. We want to know that there is a broad cross section of support but that's not the same as a referendum. And it's evidence and argument that we're interested in rather than five thousand emails all saying the same thing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/11">Up to a point I agree with that. We have all been subject to a mass lobby. However, it seems to me that that is the attitude of a non-elected functionary who has already made up his mind, rather than someone approaching an issue with an open mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/12">I remind the Minister and the chairman of the boundary committee that democracy matters. In fact, that statement is the logo displayed proudly at the bottom of the boundary committee's notepaper. The trouble is that public opinion will count only in a very general, loaded way. As far as I am concerned, democracy counts when we have elections and issues are placed before the people. In the May local elections my party took seats from other parties in Broadland, and the same thing happened in South Norfolk. That was achieved on a platform of opposing the Norwich unitary authority. That is cause and effect. It matters. It is direct democracy&mdash;not a lot of sham workshops, stakeholders' meetings and what Baroness Hollis of Heigham, opposing a referendum in Norfolk in a debate in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October</phrase>, at column 72, called a &quot;reiterative process&quot;&mdash;whatever that consists of.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/13">The Minister and the chairman of the boundary committee must face facts. There is no majority constituency in Norfolk for their proposal. Indeed, the more coverage the fixed proposal receives, the more it arouses the opposition of Norfolk people. At a purely constituency level, I should be very grateful for the publication by the <i>Eastern Daily Press</i> of the enlarged boundaries of a greater Norfolk. The reaction that I have received has been considerable. I have not even touched on the costs incurred in the exercise. Norfolk county council has already allocated &pound;250,000. The borough council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk has allocated &pound;200,000, South Norfolk council &pound;200,000 and Norwich a minimum of &pound;90,000. What about the time, effort and morale of officers working in the district and county councils?</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/14">We have been here before. The Minister may not be aware of it, but for the past six years the primary care trusts have been organised and reorganised from one to six and back to one. In the latest attempt of the Norfolk primary care trust to rationalise local community hospitals it was forced by public opinion to beat a retreat. I am grateful that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" name="Charles Clarke">the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> is here, because I also want to refer to the example of the proposed amalgamation of police forces&mdash;Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. We were told that it was a done deal. All the arguments stacked up. It would happen. Everything was prepared. Thanks not least to the efforts of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1738" name="Richard Bacon">the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon)</phrase>, the right hon. Member for Norwich, South was sadly&mdash;I mean that&mdash;forced to resign as Home Secretary, and within a week his successor had said that amalgamations would not take place. How does the Minister think the people of Norfolk and Norwich will trust Government proposals such as the present ones? Nothing is set in concrete.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/15">In case I am being too parochial, let us consider what is happening elsewhere in the country, with the process of forcing unitary authorities on counties. In Cornwall, there is chaos and confusion; in Cheshire, there was a judicial review, which was rejected, but a right of appeal has been granted; in Bedfordshire, councils have been set at each other's throats, and there are calls for judicial review. None of the time lines laid down by Ministers has been adhered to. That relates back to the time line set by the boundary committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/16">Given the present dog's breakfast, I suggest to the Minister first that he should establish and publicise the terms of reference for the boundary committee, taking into account the majority desire across Norfolk for the status quo&mdash;he should recognise that as an option that must be considered. It might turn out not to be the option that he, or, indeed, the majority of Norfolk opinion, goes for, but it should be considered seriously. Secondly, I suggest that he should advise the chairman of the boundary committee to remove an artificial deadline for the submission of proposals by councils, given that there are no terms of reference. The deadline of the end of the month must be removed. Thirdly, he should establish a proper way by which any proposals may be tested against public opinion&mdash;what Norfolk people want or specifically do not want. That should encompass Norfolk across the board&mdash;the people of Norwich, Cromer, Aylsham, Watton and King's Lynn all have a right to know. It is just dawning on people beyond greater Norwich that the Minister's proposals will have a direct impact on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/17">This is an issue on which different MPs and parties will hold different views, but there is a suspicion in Norfolk that a done deal has already been accepted, and that Norfolk will just have to accept what is given to it. The chairman of the boundary committee, with his experience in Haringey, may think that we are a bunch of hicks. Let me tell him that we are not. Democracy matters. Norfolk will not let itself be abolished.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.0/1">I am grateful to you, Mr. Olner, for that comment and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> for organising the debate&mdash;it is an important subject and I am glad that he has done so. I am also grateful to the Minister for the decisions that he took in the summer to deal with what was a long-standing and significant issue&mdash;namely, the absence of unitary status for a great city such as Norwich.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/2">I begin from the position of believing that unitary authorities are, in principle, beneficial. There are a number of issues, such as planning, transport and economic development, particularly in a growth area such as Norwich, which make it extremely important that there is a coherence rather than dislocation of public authorities. I could cite a great number of examples of discontinuities between the county and the city on important development issues around the city, but I do not wish to take up everyone's time. Those problems are acute because Norwich has been identified&mdash;rightly&mdash;as a major growth area for the coming period, and the large amount of economic development will involve matters relating to infrastructure. I profoundly believe that we will get more coherent, transparent and effective decisions if we have unitary local government, as in other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/3">It would be bizarre if places such as Peterborough and Ipswich were to have unitary authorities, but cities such as Norwich did not. That is why I applaud the decisions taken by the Government and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government earlier this year, specifically regarding Norwich, because the difference between its municipal boundaries and its actual physical boundaries&mdash;the built up areas that fall within a number of hon. Members' constituencies&mdash;is greater than any in the country. That is a reflection of the fact that Norwich has been a growing city for decades, but the municipal boundaries have not changed to take account of it. The various inconsistencies are still more acute in Norwich than they would otherwise have been. I am glad that the Secretary of State decided to look at Norwich's situation and the case for unitary status on the basis of wider boundaries than were previously suggested, and that the Minister was able to carry through and announce that. I welcome those decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/4">I must contest the assertions made by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk on popular support. It may seem strange to him, but we in Norwich also have elections. The elections that took place in Norwich on the same day as those in his constituency gave an overwhelming mandate for unitary status. The Labour party, the Green party and the Liberal Democrats were strong supporters of unitary status for the city of Norwich. Overwhelmingly, those parties make up the elected city council of Norwich. The Conservatives were against the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.0/5">I am glad to tell the hon. Gentleman that I read the <i>Eastern Daily Press </i>every day. My problem with what he said arose from the fact that I could not draw out his position from his interviews with the paper, because it appeared to have a lack of coherence. However, he has now made clear his opposition to unitary status in all circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.0/1">All hon. Members who have spoken so far are from Norfolk and obviously have much more detailed knowledge of local circumstances than I have or the speakers who are likely to follow me have. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> on securing the debate and on an excellent, detailed exposition of the facts. The one point that was slightly non-factual but on which I agreed with him wholeheartedly came when he referred to the Alice-in-Wonderland style of the process&mdash;sentence is passed first and the evidence is looked for afterwards. That analogy certainly appeals to me. I made that comparison quite recently in the House when debating the rather strange, Alice-in-Wonderland way in which this place often works.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/2">The hon. Gentleman referred to the boundary committee logo, which is the statement &quot;Democracy matters&quot;, and asked, quite appositely, how that could be when in a review such as this, the views of local people and the various local councils involved were ridden over roughshod or ignored completely. He described the process as a dog's breakfast, talking about the cost when it is supposed to save money, about the problems of judicial reviews across the country in similar circumstances, about the confusion that arises and about the timelines and time scales that simply are not being met.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" name="Charles Clarke">The right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> made a legitimate point from a different perspective; it is possible to see a logical case for cities being unitary authorities. In my county of Derbyshire, some years ago, when a Government of a different complexion tried to impose unitary authorities, the compromise arrived at was that Derby City would become a unitary and the rest of the county would continue with the two-tier county and district or borough structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> made many valid points. As he said, if we were starting with a clean sheet&mdash;starting afresh&mdash;we might well be able to see the logic of a unitary system. Other hon. Members made that point, too. However, we are not starting with a clean sheet; we are not starting afresh. The current situation has developed over a long time and is not the clear-cut situation that we would have if we were drawing up plans for something from the beginning.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/5">My hon. Friend asked where the evidence was for going through the process and for the conclusion that we are told we will reach even before the process has begun, which is a unitary system. He made a number of telling points when he spoke with the boundary committee, asking what the evidence was for the process, what the benefits for co-ordination would be and where value for money would be gained. The boundary committee said, &quot;Well, actually evidence isn't conclusive on that at all.&quot; In that case, why are we going down that expensive, time-consuming, frustrating road in the first place, especially when, as several hon. Members have pointed out, we are facing a considerable squeeze on Government finance that will get much worse in the next three years under the common spending round that has just been announced?</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/6">The Government asked for proposals to be submitted before the terms of reference were even laid out. All the authorities involved were supposed to propose their ideas for a costly upheaval and reorganisation without knowing on what grounds they would be judged. We have come across that all too often in various government reorganisation schemes. The point was made several times that the time scale had been rushed.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/7">My hon. Friend made another telling point. He had found out by means of a freedom of information request that two of the authorities involved had already spent more than &pound;500,000 on initial preparations alone. If we add in the cost of all the other authorities' initial preparations and of the whole process, if we continue down that road, a very considerable amount of money will have been wasted on a bureaucratic process that is supposed to benefit the council tax payers of Norfolk.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/8">I was particularly impressed by the suggestion of a Norfolk convention, to which I shall return, but all options should be considered. How can a genuine consultation be held if some options, such as the status quo, are ruled out from the start? My hon. Friend spoke of the democratic outrage at how we have gone about the matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.0/1">It is a pleasure to be here under your chairmanship, Mr. Chope. If I did not know the Minister better, I would be inclined to say that he should simply stand up and give in. If this were a decently refereed boxing match, it would have been stopped long ago on points. The tidal wave of good sense that has come his way in expressions of huge concern about the proposals that we are debating would convince any neutral observer that something has gone badly wrong with the process of government for us to be here discussing them in this way. I should be grateful for a few minutes to illustrate some of my concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> on his opening speech, which touched on many of the points that have been amplified during this debate. I thought that he spoke with suppressed outrage on behalf of his constituents and, I suspect, the vast majority of the people of Norfolk. He spoke of his constituents' views, expressed both to him and through the ballot box, and of the quality of performance of local authorities, which may be swept away in a reorganisation. He spoke of the bullying&mdash;let us be plain about the word&mdash;of the boundary committee in how it started and has gone about its work. He spoke about the concerns that this might be a done deal, raised the issue of whether the people would be consulted and mentioned the boundary committee's motto, &quot;Democracy matters&quot;. Well, we shall see.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" name="Charles Clarke">The right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> spoke of his belief in the importance of the unitaries in Norfolk. He is entitled to do so&mdash;anyone is entitled to put their view in this debate&mdash;but neither he nor the council that he is promoting are entitled to be the tail wagging the dog. There is neither the numerical majority to do that, nor, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1737" name="Henry Bellingham">the Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham)</phrase> made clear, the moral authority, given the quality of the councils being wagged by the unfortunate tail of Norwich city. The right hon. Gentleman is entitled to express his views, but it should be borne in mind that the tail should not wag the dog.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> made a key point about the democratic base and the case that had recently been put to the electorate, and he ended with a series of questions to the Minister that I shall reiterate.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1497" name="Paul Holmes">The hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes)</phrase>&mdash;he is an outsider in this debate, as I am&mdash;admirably summed up our concerns. He made a key point about Labour's manifesto, saying that it gives the Government a completely open-ended chance to reorganise local government, with no parameters. It effectively gives them the opportunity to do what they want, no matter what the opinion of the majority might be in any particular place&mdash;an utterly wretched situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1738" name="Richard Bacon">the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon)</phrase> raised many questions about the way in which the process had been put together. His contribution was not only illuminating but entertaining. I agree with him on the process and about the timetable problems that have already arisen. The reorganisation has not run according to the timetable. Indeed, it is already well off it. The trouble is that it will result in a rushed process that could be dangerous to the processes of democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/7">My hon. Friend was joined in that concern by Sir Michael Lyons in his consideration of the future of local government. In page 11 of his executive summary about local reorganisation, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The vast experience of reorganisation in this country provides a warning about the risks of poorly developed or executed change, and shows that it is by no means a panacea. I therefore put a much stronger emphasis on the responsibility of authorities to develop effective and flexible coalitions, which transcend boundaries and seek joint solutions to problems where those offer potential advantages.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/9">Most on this side of the Chamber would say that that opportunity ought to remain in the minds of the Minister and of the boundary committee; it is a much better way forward than what seems to have been proposed. My hon. Friend stopped short of declaring the whole thing a shambles, but what is in process might yet turn out to be one.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> asked whether there was any evidence about costs. He spoke of asking the boundary committee, with regard to its evidence-based process, what evidence it had for going forward. He got the honest answer, &quot;Well, it's a bit mixed.&quot; He could have gone to others. He could have asked the previous Minister for Local Government, now Minister for the Environment, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" name="Phil Woolas">the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas)</phrase>, for his views. I did so when the Public Bill Committee was debating the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. We spoke about the costs of the process of reorganisation, and I asked whether we should be wary, on the basis of our collective experience, of those who wave cost savings at their electors as the potential good news behind restructuring. The Minister answered:</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/11" class="indent">&quot;The answer to that is yes.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official </i><i>Report, Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill Commi</i><i>ttee,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February 2007</phrase>; c. 89.]</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/12">If even the Minister cannot see that as a key point to be taken forward, none of us should be under any illusion about the matter. If a reorganisation or restructuring is not being pursued for financial reasons or efficiency, what is it about?</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/13">I have two concerns about this reorganisation. The key one is democratic accountability. It is clear that the council submitted its proposal under the formula and the timetable, but that it failed utterly on every ground to convince the Government of its case for it being a unitary authority. The Government's invitation to councils to take part in the process, published in October 2006, gave a clear indicative timetable. It said that by July 2007 a final announcement&mdash;no ifs, no buts&mdash;would be made of those areas that would be restructuring into unitary authorities. Well, it was not final. Out of the shambles of the application came the invitation to the boundary committee to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/14">I task the Minister with this question. If all the other councils in Norfolk say that they do not want a change, if they say that they want to remain with the status quo because it delivers effective and efficient local government in Norfolk, is he seriously prepared to allow the case being made by only one authority to override the views of those who are democratically elected in other parts of the county? I should be grateful if the Minister were to answer that.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/15">My second concern is the invitation to the boundary committee. Most of us are quite surprised, given the width of its remit, that it has taken the job on. On what basis or criteria did the Government decide to invite the boundary committee to do the job? There is no doubt that they have the power, but I have heard no explanation of why, in some cases, it was decided to call a halt to the process and why, in others, it was decided to involve the boundary committee. It seems difficult to avoid a sense of arbitrariness.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/16">I conclude by raising publicly the questions that I asked the Minister in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November</phrase>. They adequately sum up the concerns that have been expressed today. My first question was about the remit given to the boundary committee in relation to Norfolk, and whether the Minister would publish it. It is extraordinary that the committee is beginning work with no one else knowing what it has been tasked with. I do not see the point of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/17">The second question was what time frame had been set for the review to be conducted, where it was set out and when it would be made public. The third point was that the timetable set out in the original invitation to councils in England had proved valueless for a number of proposed reorganisations. I asked what guarantee the people of Norfolk would have that the current timetable of the boundary committee, should we ever know it, would be adhered to.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/18">The fourth question was about the powers that the boundary committee has to compel local authorities to submit information to it while it is conducting its review. We heard of the sense of menace with which the boundary committee is asking for information. That is a reflection of what has happened to local government. Many Members are concerned about that, and if the Minister can do anything about it in the years to come, it would be appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/19">There is a sense that local authorities now look upwards to those from the Government and partnership agencies that are running them&mdash;and that they are afraid of not doing what they are asked to do&mdash;rather than looking outwards to those who elected them. That fundamental change in local government has been emphasised over the past 10 years, and it desperately needs to be cracked into.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/20">My fifth question was whether any options for the structure of local government in Norfolk had been ruled out. We hear about the status quo not being a viable option. Who said so? Where does it say that it cannot be allowed? I have not seen it said in any Government document that two-tier local government is no longer acceptable in Britain. Of course it is. Why is it being ruled out in this case? Who said so? And who told him to say so? Is it possible for the local authorities to argue that the retention of the status quo is the best solution to the structural review?</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/21">My sixth question was about who is to pay the costs of the work of the local authorities engaged in the review at the request of the boundary committee and the Government? It is not that the majority of councils in Norfolk accepted the invitation and that the financial costs should therefore be on their own heads. They have been sucked into it, through matters completely outside their choosing.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/22">My seventh question was about what intention there is to consult the public by way of a referendum to seek their views on the existing structure of local government and any proposed changes. The eighth was about whether the change would be implemented without the public being consulted by way of a referendum?</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/23">Those questions sum up our concerns. The Minister has a clear sense of them. Having been to a meeting in Dereham last week with a number of councillors from all the Norfolk authorities, I can say that their concerns have been more than properly expressed this morning. The real concern is that people have not asked for the change, they were not consulted about it, and they are unaware of any benefits. They do not know what they are being asked for or why. They do not know why the man who is asking them has the powers to do so, because nothing has been published. If the Minister can help us this morning, we would be much obliged.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-20a.84.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" speakername="John Healey" colnum="84"  time="012:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071120/halltext/71120h0008.htm#07112055000583">
	<p pid="a.84.3/1">I knew that I should not have given way. If the hon. Gentleman will give me the time, I shall deal precisely with that point. Other hon. Members have made it, including the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1738" name="Richard Bacon">The hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon)</phrase> brings his considerable experience from the Public Accounts Committee to the wider perspective on this debate, and we have debated before many of the issues that he raised. The steps taken over the past 12 months have met precisely the lessons that he draws from his PAC experience. We have studied proposals, some of which were based on benefits. The risks have been considered and there has been, and in some cases continue to be, a very close examination of the costs and financial viability&mdash;given my background, I ensured that that happened. The timetable for views and comments is far from being rapid and compressed. In fact, I am being urged by many to ensure that it does not take too much longer. I realise that delaying this process will not make many of these difficult decisions any easier, but I want to ensure that I take into account fully all the information and representations that we have received when coming to final decisions, just as I propose to do with the terms of reference and guidance for the boundary committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> set out three tests: efficiency, better services and decision making closer to the people. That is quite right. Each unitary proposal that we are proceeding with has met those tests, which will continue to be applied to any proposals that might emerge from the process led by the boundary committee. Either I shall cover the questions posed by the hon. Gentleman and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>, or they will be contained in the terms of reference. I have met leaders of local authorities that might be affected and am ready to do so again at appropriate stages of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/4">On the general question of unitary authorities, I would like hon. Members to think back to the relevant White Paper and the invitation to submit proposals. Those were in response to evidence and arguments put to us at the time that, in some two-tier areas, existing arrangements simply did not deliver the governance that we require from our local communities and authorities in this modern day. There can be a duplication of services, confusion and inefficiency between the two tiers&mdash;the points outlined by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase>. We were also told that for some areas a move towards a unitary authority could improve accountability, create stronger leadership, and improve efficiency and services to local people. Those have been the objectives throughout the process and the criteria against which we have judged any proposals. That is very far from change for change's sake.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/5">On Norwich in particular, far from failing on every count, as the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire suggested, the Secretary of State judged&mdash;I confirm this&mdash;that there was a reasonable likelihood of the unitary proposal from Norwich meeting three of the five criteria: strong, effective and accountable strategic leadership; neighbourhood flexibility and empowerment; and support from a broad cross-section of partners and stakeholders. The problems were with value for money and affordability. By looking at the boundaries, we can take a closer look at whether there is a viable unitary option based on Norwich but, perhaps, encompassing a wider city boundary. From meetings that I have had recently, I am quite clear about the interests that will be in the terms of reference and guidance, and I shall reflect on points put to me in this debate and meetings before issuing those terms of reference, which I aim to do in January, so that the boundary committee can formally begin its work on the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/6">The boundary committee has begun a preliminary process of contacting local interested parties and authorities to explain the process of the review and to instigate informal discussions to get background and ideas for the future. I deplore the accusations that the boundary committee has acted with menace, harassment or bullying. The plain fact is that if local authorities do not participate, they cannot play a part in and influence the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/7">The boundary committee does not have powers to compel local authorities to submit information. It is a matter for local authorities to decide how to respond. The terms of reference and guidance will set out the boundary committee's remit, which will be made available in the House Library. I will also make them public and send copies to all hon. Members who have participated in this debate and who are affected by the constituencies covered. The time frame will be set out in the terms of reference as well. To be clear, the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 does not require us to conduct referendums, but the process will last a number of months, and there will be plenty of opportunity for local authorities and the public to make their views known throughout.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/8">I shall address a point about which the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk was particularly concerned. When asked for advice, under the terms of the 2007 Act the boundary committee can recommend that the Secretary of State implements the proposal without modification or that she does not implement it&mdash;in other words, that the status quo should remain&mdash;or it may make an alternative proposal. If it does the latter, it must undertake clear consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/9">In summary, there is no predetermined number of local authorities at the end of the process, which will be open and widely consultative. The way that it will be conducted is set out in statute and there will be plenty of opportunities for hon. Members to play a full and influential part in the House and in their constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.1/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again, Mr. Chope. Just to be clear about the scope of this debate, it is primarily focused on digital radio broadcasting services, although I shall touch at the end on digital television and ask the Minister one or two questions about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July</phrase>, Ofcom announced a licence to provide a multiplex digital local radio broadcasting service in Gloucestershire. Having studied the advertisement and discussed it with colleagues who are more technically knowledgeable than I am about such matters, I had several concerns about how well the digital multiplex would serve my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/3">I wrote to Ofcom's chief executive on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-13">13 September</phrase> to express my concerns about the tender advertisement. First, it implied that there would be a big focus on a transmitter at Churchdown, which would leave my constituents disadvantaged, due to the geography of our county. I also expressed concern that the tenders would inevitably focus on the urban and more densely populated parts of the county, which has Cheltenham and Gloucester at the centre geographically, and that they would tend to leave the more outlying rural areas, including my constituency in the Forest of Dean, somewhat at a disadvantage. I had a response from Ofcom on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-05">5 October</phrase> which I thought was rather dismissive of the concerns that I had raised on behalf of my constituents. I did not think that it dealt adequately with my concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-24">24 October</phrase>, applications closed for the licence for Gloucestershire. There were two applicants: MuxCo Gloucestershire Ltd and Now Digital. Having taken some time to study their bids, I believe that neither would provide decent or acceptable coverage for my constituents in the Forest of Dean. The bid from MuxCo is much the worse of the two, from my constituents' point of view. Looking at the mapping that has been provided, it seems that the whole western part of my constituency and three of the four towns&mdash;Cinderford, Coleford and Lydney&mdash;would be almost completely excluded from being able to receive the digital radio signal. My rough estimate is that well over half of my constituents would be excluded from the company's broadcasts.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-20a.102.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" speakername="Lyn Brown" colnum="102"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071120/halltext/71120h0010.htm#07112055000600">
	<p pid="a.102.1/1">Before I outline some of the difficulties faced by my constituents because of pressure on the housing market in Newham, I want to welcome the commitment in the Queen's Speech to a housing and regeneration Bill, and in particular to increasing the amount of new social housing to be built. The key challenge will be to ensure that homes that have already been promised are provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/2">I want to focus on housing pressures in my constituency which need to be addressed if the Government's aim of ensuring that everyone has access to a decent, affordable home is to be realised. My first concern is that the new homes built in my constituency should be suitable for the people who most need them. To put it simply, we must build homes for those who are in the most need&mdash;those who are already on the housing list for affordable, acceptable accommodation. I speak particularly of the 5,000 people in Newham who are housed in temporary accommodation for years on end, shunted from property to property because their salary does not allow them to get their foot on the first rung of the housing ladder.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/3">Let us not misunderstand what that means to those families. They are often shunted from home to home as their leases finish. They do not have the stability that comes with a permanent home. They do not manage to put down roots; they cannot sign on doctors' lists; they cannot participate in local leisure clubs; they cannot participate in the community in which they live. Children must often move schools, or travel long distances for their education, which makes it difficult for them to fulfil their potential. That situation obviously does not make for a good community, but neither does it make for an equal society. Moving home is also an expensive business, and the cost affects the very poorest people in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/4">There is currently a waiting list of 30,000 for Newham. We must build enough homes to ensure that each of those 30,000 households can find an appropriately sized home at a price they can afford. The waiting list for a two-bedroomed property in Newham is about eight years, rising to 10 years for a three-bedroomed property and 13 years for a four-bed. That is the waiting list for a property&mdash;not a house. I hope that the Minister will accept that those waiting times are far too long. It is larger family homes that are most urgently needed in the borough, but those are the least likely to be built.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/5">In a prime example earlier this year of the pressure on housing in Newham, a three-bedroomed council property in Plaistow was named by <i>Roof </i>magazine as the UK's most desirable property, not because of any palatial views or extensive landscaped gardens, but because Newham council received 1,035 applications for the property from would-be tenants. Why? Although the property is well maintained, I am sure that the &pound;81 per week rent, which is a third of what one would expect to pay in the private sector, would make it very desirable indeed for the tenant who secured it. On average the council receives more than 330 applications for each property that it advertises. What practical measures are the Government taking to ensure that new homes are an appropriate size for those on the waiting list? Living in temporary accommodation is not acceptable and does not make for effective or sustainable communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/6">A second pressure that should be considered when appropriate housing build for my community is being determined is the dreadful overcrowding that families endure. Size does indeed matter. During the summer of 2006, only 6 per cent. of the homes being developed in the borough had three bedrooms, whereas 65 per cent. had two bedrooms. Smaller properties are a safer and more attractive opportunity for investors, but as young single people become couples, and lucky couples become families, the need for bigger properties grows. Those bigger properties are not available. Newham has the highest average household size in the country. According to the 2001 census it has the greatest number of households in the UK with five or more residents&mdash;20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/7">The lack of bigger homes is a principal cause of overcrowding, which is a huge problem in Newham, where entire families often live in one-bedroomed flats. The negative impact of overcrowding on family, education, health and community cohesion have been ably demonstrated by organisations such as Shelter, but, sadly, those impacts are all too frequent in my borough. The 2001 census showed that more than a quarter of Newham's households are overcrowded, lacking at least one room for the number and type of people in the household. It is a London-wide consideration, and the draft London housing strategy proposes that 42 per cent. of social rented homes entering the programme should have three or more bedrooms.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/8">Research by the Housing Corporation in 2006 indicates that about 82 per cent. of people aspire to own their own home. Nationally those aspirations are gradually being realised, with 70 per cent. of homes owner-occupied, but in Newham less than 50 per cent. of houses are owner-occupied. I hope that our aspirations to assist people to realise their home-ownership aspirations will be taken seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/9">That brings me neatly to the issue of the right to buy&mdash;its regulation and its impact on West Ham. I should certainly welcome measures to cool the overheated buy-to-let market, which has helped both to ratchet up the cost of temporary accommodation for local authorities, at an extreme cost to the Exchequer, and to decrease the affordability of housing for ordinary working families, above all in the capital. Housing benefit spend in my borough is &pound;245 million. A third of that&mdash;&pound;67 million&mdash;is spent paying private landlords. The average amount of housing benefit paid to council tenants in Newham is &pound;70 a week. The average housing benefit payment for temporary accommodation is &pound;350 a week&mdash;five times that paid to council tenants. It does not take a genius to recognise that funding additional social housing provision in my borough could prove beneficial to the Exchequer, not to mention to those families who cannot afford to work and keep a roof over their heads.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/10">Official Newham statistics state that of the 950 new homes completed in 2005-06, only 132 were for the social rented sector. I have no doubt that the bulk of that new private accommodation will be buy to let: 45 per cent. of the market homes in London are bought to let, and the proportion is greater in areas where property is cheaper. In comparison with many parts of London, Newham is cheap. I recognise the importance of the private rented sector for those who cannot yet afford to buy their own home, and for those who are seeking more temporary accommodation, but rents are climbing as rapidly as house prices. We do not want to return to the Rachman era in London, with people being forced to pay exorbitant rents because they have no other choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/11">I want to touch on regulation. The Housing Act 2004 introduced a welcome mandatory licensing scheme for larger houses in multiple occupation. It placed the onus on the landlord to register the property with the council, or face a fine. That means that environmental health officers have a much better chance of finding the properties that are more likely to endanger the health and safety of the occupants, and of improving the immediate physical conditions and management standards. I do not want the Minister to get me wrong: some landlords understand their responsibilities both to their tenants and to the wider community. However, a small number exploit their tenants, graze on housing benefit subsidies and ignore the impact of antisocial behaviour on neighbouring residents. I have lost count of the number of complaints that I have received from my constituents about absentee landlords.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/12">There are two principal problems with the current regulations in my constituency. First, the mandatory licensing scheme only covers homes with three or more storeys. The borough contains the largest building site in Europe&mdash;if it is not, it feels that way&mdash;and some of the population is made up of migrant workers who often live in small homes, many to a room. The homes are too small to accommodate the number of people living in them, and many facets of living, some with significant links to health problems, overflow into the street and garden. Secondly, the exceptionally high levels of occupancy are causing stress in local communities, and the local council does not have the power to do anything about it. Residents have told me that they will most likely sell and move if the situation does not improve, and their homes are more likely than not to be bought and let, thus exacerbating an already difficult situation. I have discussed the matter, albeit briefly, with the mayor of the borough, and I understand that he would not welcome additional powers unless they were accompanied by severe penalties. The financial reward for cramming houses with large numbers of people is so great that paltry fines do nothing to deter such behaviour; rather, they reinforce the contempt in which some hold the law and those who enforce it.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/13">Little is done to protect those in smaller houses of multiple occupation. Some 80 per cent. of such homes are not covered by the mandatory licensing regime, and the vast majority in my constituency fall outside the mandatory threshold. Newham's environmental health officers must play detective to check that standards are being met, which wastes precious time and resources. If they finally get a landlord to court, he or she would face only a risible fine. I hope that the Minister will consider extending the threshold to all houses of five or more occupants and ensure that the penalties are sufficiently severe and easy to enforce to deter those bent on breaking the law for the easy-to-obtain and high financial benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/14">I am also concerned about the density at which new homes will be built&mdash;higher density properties where viable are encouraged by the new proposals. Density of new properties has increased by almost 60 per cent. in this country. In 1997, there were an average of 25 dwellings per hectare; in 2005, there were 42 dwellings per hectare. I appreciate that higher density housing will mean that less land is needed for the proposed 3 million new homes, and that that will help to protect what little remains of Newham's green and pleasant land, but I cannot advocate a return to the tower block estates of the 1960s and 1970s, which so drastically altered the physical landscape of our towns and cities, produced innumerable social problems, and destroyed communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/15">Newham has had many high-density housing developments and by the 1980s had one of the highest concentrations of tower blocks in Britain. The developments failed as communities and the resulting social problems cost the borough and the country huge amounts to put right. The blockbusters programmes of the 1980s attempted to get rid of blocks throughout the country, so why would we want to build more of something that we have recently disposed of? Why would we knowingly recreate the same problems? Public confidence in the high-rise tower-block living has been severely eroded, and therefore new blocks are unlikely to include mixed communities. I urge the Minister to look again at the issue and to ensure that we do not create isolated tower blocks of social housing that are destined for failure and disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/16">I am concerned about density. I listen incredulously to nimby debates in the House in which representatives of Her Majesty's Opposition speak against any housing development in their area. They demonstrate little appreciation of others' living conditions, particularly people in the capital. Newham is already densely populated and will undoubtedly become more so as we approach 2012. I am told that we will build a city the size of Portsmouth within my constituency by 2020, but even now, even in the backstreets, it is impossible not to notice the constant bustle and the number of people walking by.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/17">The 2001 census, which is disputed locally as it tended to under-count the population, showed the population density of London to be 45.6 people per hectare. My borough, Newham, was shown to have 67.3 people per hectare, almost one and a half times the average population density of London. The 2006 estimate for the population density of Newham was yet higher at 72.4 persons per hectare. At 45.6 persons per hectare, London is the third most crowded of the major European cities after Paris and Barcelona. Some 15 per cent. of the UK's population lives in London, but it covers less than 0.5 per cent. of England's land mass, which has an obvious effect on the quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/18">In conclusion, I wish to put on the record issues about which I have spoken in the House before. There are clear interrelationships between housing and poverty in my borough. The exceptional cost of housing and the problems caused by a lack of public sector housing are compounded by the impact of the benefits system. I have spoken previously of evidence from my constituents that housing benefit and the way in which it combines with other sources of income, benefits and tax creates a poverty trap for those in low-paid work. Overcrowding and unsuitable housing contributes to the stark health inequalities that people in my area face as compared with their peers in Westminster, Kensington or Chelsea. The interrelation between high housing costs and other types of deprivation is clear to me, as I hope it is to the Minister, and I believe that a strategic approach to combating the problems engendered by housing affordability and supply is imperative.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/19">I have outlined a whole agenda of issues that I have brought to the Minister directly from the community I serve. The issues arise from a challenging reality, and are urgent and immediate to my constituents and those of many other hon. Members who serve areas in which there is high stress on housing. Will the Minister recognise that we must find real and lasting solutions to these problems? Not to do so would undermine much of what the Government are trying to achieve in the creation of a fair and equal Britain.</p>
