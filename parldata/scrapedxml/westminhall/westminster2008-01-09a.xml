<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-01-09a.75.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" speakername="Michael Penning" colnum="75"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080109/halltext/80109h0001.htm#08010978000309">
	<p pid="a.75.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. May I also praise him for his quick response before Christmas when the hydrocracker at the Coryton refinery exploded? I have some knowledge of the hydrocracker because when I was a fireman in Basildon, I was on the first response unit that went to deal with it when it blew up many years ago. I know the fears that exist, and I am conscious that my hon. Friend did not go in the opposite direction; he went straight down to see the firefighters to ensure that they, too, were looked after.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/2">To answer my hon. Friend's question, when the first explosion took place at Buncefield, the damage occurred several kilometres away. If he has an opportunity to read the interim reports from the health and safety inquiry, he will find that because there was nothing structurally to prevent the explosion spreading outwards, or the subsequent suction inwards after the oxygen had been used up, properties as far away as St. Albans, Redbourn and the centre of Hemel Hempstead, which is several kilometres away, were subject to serious structural damage. One school in St. Albans had its central heating boiler sucked up through the flue, which blew up boilers throughout the school. Subsequently, the school did not open. That is the sort of damage that occurs in such explosions.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/3">I was told many years ago, when I trained on such fires, that we could expect only one tank to catch fire, and probably no explosion. That remained the advice until Buncefield happened. I was told that an explosion such as Buncefield had not been modelled and no one knew that it could happen. I pointed out that it had happened in New Jersey and Florida, so we could have predicted it. However, we could not have predicted the subsequent explosions in other tanks.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/4">I find something slightly difficult to understand. There was a tank containing unleaded petrol, and some 200 tonnes flowed from it when it was full. Someone who does not think that an explosion will take place if the safety devices fail does not really understand petroleum and should not be in charge of safety at such a depot. It will be for the inquiry to come to conclusions on the matter, and I shall return to that later. The fears of the constituents of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>, of people in my constituency and of others around the country about the safety of such depots are understandable.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/5">So where are we today? An inquiry is being conducted&mdash;astonishingly, through the Department for Work and Pensions&mdash;by the Health and Safety Executive. It is headed by the independent chair, Lord Newton of Braintree, who is doing an excellent job considering the remit that he has been given. Sadly, it inquiry is being conducted behind closed doors, so public confidence in it is somewhat diminished. While the fire was in full flow&mdash;the fuel was still flowing, which was why there was such a large plume&mdash;I said that for the sake of public confidence in such installations and the confidence of my community, it was vital that there was an open, public inquiry. I entered into negotiations with the then Deputy Prime Minister suggesting that we hold an inquiry similar to the one that took place after the Marchioness disaster. I freely admit that that inquiry took place not under the last Conservative Administration but under the new Labour Administration. It is sad that there was not an early public inquiry in that case, as it would have saved a lot of anguish and concern for many of the relatives concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/6">Sadly, once the fire was out, the role of the Deputy Prime Minister was removed, and I was told immediately that the inquiry would be conducted by the DWP, which is responsible for the HSE. I cannot understand why that was the case. It was a massive local situation that had nothing to do with work and pensions and everything to do with the community. The then Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was in charge of the fire service, and the issue was about local government and local communities. That is why I was desperate for a Department for Communities and Local Government Minister to respond to this debate, and I thank the Minister for his attendance.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/7">Two years on, an inquiry is in progress, and it has produced interim reports. We now know, within reason, what caused the explosion. There has been extensive modelling, and it seems as if every safety device between Buncefield and Coryton in Essex failed. As I said earlier, 200 tonnes of unleaded fuel escaped through the air venting at the top of tank 912 and caused a vapour cloud. Something&mdash;the inquiry and others are not yet 100 per cent. confident about what it was&mdash;ignited the cloud, causing the first of the three explosions and the subsequent 20-tank fire.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/8">The costs to my community, the region and the nation as a whole were large, and I shall try to break them down. I shall probably ask the Minister more questions than he can answer, and I appreciate that he may have to ask other Ministers to write to me. There was a great deal of concern about the decision to put the fire out. When there is a fire of such a size firefighters contain it, usually with a water curtain, before deciding to try to work their way in and put it out. I apologise for having too much knowledge on the subject&mdash;it comes from having a previous life outside politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/9">When the decision had been made to contain the fire and there was no longer a real worry about more tanks exploding, a decision had to be made about whether to allow the fire to burn itself out&mdash;all fires burn themselves out once the fuel goes, whether it is wood, building or, in this case, oil and petroleum&mdash;or try to put it out. I took part in broadcasts from the site, and it was obvious to me that if we tried to put it out, there would be environmental risks because of the wash-off of the firefighting water, which would take with it contamination from the site. It is plain what sort of problems would have resulted.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/10">Knowing such refineries, it was clear to me that the bungs designed to hold the fuel would never be able to cope with holding the firefighting water and foam. I did not know at the time that the mastic that had been used on the bungs was not heat-resistant and had melted almost instantaneously, causing the water to flow out. I did not know that the engineers had drilled 7 to 8-in holes in the bung wall through which to feed pipes, but had not corked them, so it leaked straight through. I did not know that some walls were damaged so badly by the explosion that water was flowing straight out. It is for the inquiry to conclude who was responsible and whether there was any negligence.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.1/11">I did know that perfluorooctanyl sulfonate&mdash;or PFOS for short&mdash;is a carcinogenic chemical used in a lot of firefighting foam. For those who do know, PFOS is a sticking agent. It is used in firefighting and fire equipment, but over the years it has also been used extensively in insecticides and pesticides on agricultural land. I shall come on to that point later. The Environment Agency asked for a delay. There was consultation in which I was not involved&mdash;I understand at gold command&mdash;and the decision was made to put out the fire. Fireman always want to put fires out; they are robust creatures and join the fire service to fight fires. If they are told not to fight a fire, they put up a robust argument against that instruction&mdash;I can say so from experience. Sometimes, however, it must be decided whether it is worth risking the life of firefighters&mdash;in my consideration no building is worth anybody's life&mdash;and whether there is a risk to the environment.</p>
