<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0001.htm#10011948000456">
	<p pid="b.1.2/1">Good morning, Mr. Streeter. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time. I thank the Speaker for granting me the opportunity of this Adjournment debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/2">I declare a non-pecuniary interest as a trustee of the Arthritis Research Campaign, one of the largest medical research charities in the country, which is soon to be renamed Arthritis Research UK, which indicates the sort of work that it does. As a major research charity, ARC has pioneered much of the research on arthritis and many of the developments in its treatment, including anti-TNF drugs-tumour necrosis factor blockers-and has supported the medical research community in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/3">The UK is a world leader in research into musculoskeletal conditions, which, unlike cancer and heart conditions, are not immediately life-threatening for most people. Sufferers are not traditionally the most vociferous in shouting about the shortfalls in care and their needs, but I hope that that is about to change with the advent of Arthritis Research UK, which has set 10 ambitious goals. They include ensuring that people with arthritis remain active; reducing the economic impact on patients, their families and the wider economy; reducing the number of deaths and severe complications of arthritis in all its forms; and reducing pain and disability in childhood arthritis, leading to a normal future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/4">I acknowledge the help and support of ARMA, the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance, of which ARC is a member, and particularly for the work of Ross Meek and Tony Redmond and their support and advice when preparing this debate. ARMA's report, &quot;Joint Working? An audit of the Department of Health's musculoskeletal services framework&quot;, provided a major impetus for this debate, along with Dame Carol Black's 2008 review of the health of Britain's working-age population, &quot;Working for a healthier tomorrow&quot;, the National Audit Office report &quot;Services for people with rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, as well as my early-day motion 1930, which was tabled on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-20">20 July 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/5">&quot;Musculoskeletal conditions&quot; is a broad term encompassing more than 200 problems affecting the muscles, joints and skeleton. They include sprains and strains, pelvic fractures, low-back pain, repetitive strain injury, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia and Marfan syndrome. Such conditions affect more than 10 million people, or one in four of the adult population, and last year the NHS spent more than &#163;4.2 billion-more than &#163;11 million a day-on their treatment, which is the fifth highest programme budget of all NHS gross expenditure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.2.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" speakername="Bob Spink" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0001.htm#10011948000457">
	<p pid="b.2.0/1">I declare an interest in that my family is affected by rheumatoid arthritis. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that drug access is absolutely central to the problem, particularly the new biological anti-TNF drugs, and that their prudent and early use may not only help the patient tremendously, but have a massive societal and economic impact and reduce further costs for the NHS in the longer term? We must ensure that those drugs are used effectively and quickly.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.2.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0001.htm#10011948000458">
	<p pid="b.2.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point. I was about to come to the effect on society. I agree with him that early treatment-not just drug treatment, but other support such as pain relief and so on-is vital. This debate is different from most debates because I am not asking the Minister for huge sums of money for new miracle drugs; instead, I am asking that the available money be better co-ordinated and better used.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.1/2">Dame Carol Black's report, &quot;Working for a healthier tomorrow&quot;, which referred to the point made by the hon. Gentleman, found that musculoskeletal conditions are the most common work-related illnesses, costing society more than &#163;7 billion a year. The Health and Safety Executive estimated that, in 2007-08, 28 million working days were lost in the UK, a quarter of them due to musculoskeletal conditions. In their response to Dame Carol Black's report, the Government said:</p>
	<p pid="b.2.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Every day, working people are calling on the NHS for support, especially for mental health and musculoskeletal disorders. We are committed to improving access to key services that are proven to be effective in helping people with these conditions manage their return to work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.2.1/4">That is a laudable aim, but ARMA found that 57 per cent. of primary care trusts had made no contact with the Department for Work and Pensions' pathways to work providers to ensure that local people were assisted back to work, despite Dame Carol Black's review finding that, once in receipt of incapacity benefit or employment and support allowance, those with a musculoskeletal condition had a greater probability of returning to work. The musculoskeletal services framework that the Government adopted in 2006 stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.2.1/5" class="indent">&quot;PCT's...are strongly recommended to make links with the DWP Pathways to Work pilots...being set up in their area&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.2.1/6">but clearly, that has not happened. Making such links is an urgent priority if the Department for Work and Pensions is to get people on incapacity benefit back to work. The framework emphasises my point that this is not about needing new drugs or new money, but about using what is available to assist people to live normal lives.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.2.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0001.htm#10011948000459">
	<p pid="b.2.2/1">I declare an interest, having suffered for 35 years with ankylosing spondylitis, a condition that my hon. Friend has not mentioned. The National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society has been considering the problem and I have been working with the society to make representations to the Government urging the introduction of a national clinical director of musculoskeletal conditions. My hon. Friend is entirely right in what he says about the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions working together. That requires not extra money, but cross-departmental co-ordination to improve people's lives and to reduce the amount of benefit that is paid to support people when they are off work.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.3.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0001.htm#10011948000460">
	<p pid="b.3.0/1">I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. I requested this debate because we could do a lot with the available money if there were better co-ordination.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.0/2">In 2006, the Government published a framework for musculoskeletal services, &quot;A joint responsibility: doing things differently&quot;. It did exactly what my hon. Friend says and was produced with input from a range of Departments, including the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Transport, to produce a co-ordinated response on dealing with such conditions. However, unlike other frameworks that predated and followed it, there was no clear standard or framework to guide the development of services for people suffering from musculoskeletal disorders. For example, despite one in five patients presenting with a musculoskeletal disorder, standards were not written into the GP contract, no network was created and no health tsar was appointed to ensure the establishment of a common framework. That is in stark contrast to diseases such as cancer or heart disease, where treatment, time frames and follow-ups have been rigorously applied nationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.0/3">Funding for musculoskeletal conditions is incredibly variable across PCTs. ARMA reported a threefold variation in the average funding provided for each person with a musculoskeletal condition, ranging from &#163;204 per patient in Camden PCT to &#163;632 in Gateshead. In my region in the north-west, average spending in 2007-08 was &#163;474 per patient, compared with a national average of &#163;401. Only 18 per cent. of PCTs in the north-west reported that they had audited the outcomes of people living with long-term conditions such as a musculoskeletal condition, compared with a national average of 40 per cent. If we do not audit what happens to people and the services that are provided, how can we make the best use of the huge financial resources?</p>
	<p pid="b.3.0/4">Only 25 per cent. of PCTs in the north-west reported that they had mapped the resources available to support people living with long-term conditions such as a musculoskeletal condition. Such mapping is a key recommendation of the musculoskeletal services framework, but again, the national average for that is only 16 per cent. In the north-west, 47 per cent. of PCTs have made links with local pathways to work-I mentioned that earlier. It is a key pledge and recommendation in Dame Carol Black's report, and we must ensure that it is done. On mapping and indicators, Bury PCT-which is next door to my constituency-was perhaps the most honest: in response to the ARMA questionnaire, it said that it did not use outcome indicators because there are no nationally agreed outcomes. Clearly, that is a glaring error.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.0/5">At a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-23">23 November 2009</phrase> to consider the National Audit Office's report on rheumatoid arthritis, David Nicholson, the NHS chief executive, agreed that improving musculoskeletal services and outcomes was primarily about management and planning rather than additional resources. I hope that the Minister will assure us that we will see that co-ordination and planning to ensure uniformly good provision on the ground. There are huge variations between what is available and what patients can receive. In my view, Oldham PCT, which is next door to my constituency, is a beacon that shows what can happen when a primary care trust gets its act together and brings together teams of clinicians and support to assist people to live normal lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.0/6">Yesterday, I visited the Chapel Allerton centre in Leeds, which has been supported by ARC and NHS research and is a model of the research community working with the NHS to improve clinical outcomes and services that are provided for people in the north of England. However, there is a totally unacceptable postcode lottery. Why should where someone lives or which condition they have determine the level of their treatment? That is unacceptable for cancer, where clear targets have been set-the Government are to be congratulated on that-so why should a condition that affects one in four of the working population and which, as I have said, costs the country dearly, not have the same co-ordination? Again, I emphasise that this is not about additional resources; it is about using what is available and better co-ordination.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.0/7">We would like to see the following proposals, which were mentioned by ARC in its report and picked up by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> First, to improve co-ordination and ensure delivery on the ground, we need the appointment of a national director to ensure that current and future initiatives have a strategic focus and to help to develop a proper musculoskeletal network across the country. Treatment should not depend on where someone lives or on a particular hospital or PCT in their area. People should get the early treatment that they need, which can make such a difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.0/8">The second point, which was picked up by Dame Carol Black, is that because GPs are on the front line and many of their patients present with a musculoskeletal condition, there should be enhanced training for GPs, through both PCTs and centres of excellence, to ensure that doctors are kept up to date. A key Government response to Dame Carol Black's report set targets for that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.0/9">Thirdly, we need better information about expenditure and outcomes, so that we do not have a repeat of the situation where Bury PCT reported that it did not bother measuring outcomes because there was no set standard. There must be agreed outcomes. If we have a standard on getting people seen within 18 weeks, why can we not do the same for people with musculoskeletal conditions, so that they know what they can expect? Another important point picked up in the ARMA report is follow-up: it is no good seeing someone within 18 weeks if they then have to wait six months for a follow-up appointment to see how they are getting on. People could move backwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.0/10">The fourth thing we need is better information about spending and outcomes, including a common framework. Finally, we need to improve public awareness, so that people know where to seek treatment, what is available and what they should avoid.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.0/11">We are not asking for a new miracle drug or for the Minister to commit billions of pounds to new research facilities-ARC already provides the bulk of such research. We are not asking for brand new hospitals, although a centre such as the one in Leeds is a model and beacon of what can happen. We are asking for co-ordination and better use of that &#163;4.2 billion of resources, so that patients-our constituents-do not face a postcode lottery, but can go to a doctor where they live and be guaranteed early treatment, continuing support, advice and, when they need it, a specialist centre. I do not think that that is a lot to ask in the 21st century.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.5.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" speakername="Graham Stringer" colnum="5"  time="009:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0001.htm#10011948000461">
	<p pid="b.5.0/1">Good morning, Mr. Streeter. We occasionally see each other's post because our names begin with the same few letters, and it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time. May I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on securing this important debate? He made a comprehensive and compelling case, especially his last point about the introduction of a clinical director for musculoskeletal conditions. That is the first-possibly the most important-point that I want to make, and I would like an answer from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/2">When we look across the provision of health services in the country and see that there are 17 clinical directors-so-called tsars-it is difficult to see why, when there are 9 million to 10 million people suffering from musculoskeletal diseases and so much money is spent on them, we do not have a tsar for those conditions. That is particularly the case given that, as the hon. Gentleman explained, we could have much better services and, if we want to consider the economics and the effectiveness of it, better value for money if there was better integration and co-ordination of those services. If there is any doubt about that, he gave the figure that has been spent-&#163;4.2 billion-and said that was a &#163;600 million increase on recent budgets. Did that &#163;600 million increase going into the budget for people suffering from those conditions lead to better outcomes? Rather tragically, the answer is no, which is another indication that we need better co-ordination of services.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/3">When the Minister deals with the question of why there are 17 clinical directors for other services, but not for musculoskeletal conditions, will she tell us what criteria can lead to a decision to give us directors in other areas, but not in this one? If we consider the intensity of pain, the need for better provision and better co-ordination of services and the number of people involved, I cannot think of any criteria for setting up directors that would not include musculoskeletal conditions. That case has been well made and I look forward to my hon. Friend's reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/4">I would like to focus on something to which the hon. Member for Rochdale referred-rheumatoid arthritis, which is an auto-immune disease. Many people do not know that it is an auto-immune disease and just think that that is a name for another kind of arthritis, which it is not. Approximately 500,000 people suffer from it and 26,000 new cases are diagnosed a year. About one third of the people diagnosed stop working within two years of diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/5">Professor Emery of Leeds university has said that rheumatoid arthritis is the most common cause of treatable disability. If one third of people diagnosed are out of work very quickly and it is a treatable disability, why is more not being done? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> made the point that many drugs are available now. We have gone through a process whereby analgesics were the main treatment. Then it was DMARDs. I have to look up what DMARDs stands for-disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. We are now in a new era of biologics, and whereas DMARDs can lead to remission for a period, biologics-used either on their own or in combination-can lead to true remission. I keep returning to the point that the hon. Member for Rochdale made: not enough people are receiving that treatment as quickly as possible, and speed is important.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/6">There have been four recent reports: the National Audit Office report, the King's Fund report, the new clinical guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the ARMA report. All, in different ways, point to exactly the same solution to the problem. Diagnosis does not take place quickly enough. There is not co-ordination and integration of the different services that sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis need. Public awareness, so that people go to their GPs quickly, is not what it should be, and GPs themselves have a low awareness of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/7">I shall give some statistics, as the hon. Gentleman did, that apply to my own city and constituency, but if we go back to the previous statistics and do the division sums, we see that about 40 or 50 cases a year are presented to GPs per constituency and that that is less than one case per GP. If there are 800, 900 or 1,000 sufferers per constituency and less than one case per GP per year, it is not really surprising that GPs are not as aware as they should be of the disease. It was a very strong recommendation of the National Audit Office report, supported when the Public Accounts Committee had its hearing, that GPs be made more aware of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/8">I then looked at the statistics applying to Manchester, and in a way, the situation is worse than a postcode lottery. The figures vary, from &#163;95 being spent per patient in Lewisham to &#163;1,379 spent in west Cheshire. It is an extraordinary range, with an average of &#163;407. In Manchester, &#163;348 is spent per patient. We have to ask why. We do not expect exactly the same amounts of money to be spent, because there are different areas of the country, different conditions and different patients, but there can be no justification for that extraordinary range of expenditure by different primary care trusts. In terms of the previous statistics, Manchester is not a bad primary care trust. On the four things that it was asked to do, it did not audit outcomes, like a majority of primary care trusts, and it did not map the resources available, but it did link with the pathways to jobs and it did assess the clinical services, so it was a very mixed report. However, there can be no justification for the range of input of cash and not checking the outputs in the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/9">It is clear that the musculoskeletal community-that sounds bizarre, but it is the community that deals with people suffering from rheumatism and arthritis-has three main demands. One, as I have explained, is for a clinical director. The others are for an update of the musculoskeletal framework and, partly to deal with the lack of co-ordination and coherence of the service, for stronger commissioning of the services from primary care trusts. I cannot see how the Minister could not respond positively to those very reasonable demands.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/10">I shall finish by thanking the British Society for Rheumatology for providing some of the statistics and information that I have used and by reflecting on the first point that the hon. Member for Rochdale made, about shouting loudly. I first became involved in campaigning on health issues in the 1980s, when members of the Government and certain editors and members of the tabloid press thought that HIV and AIDS were not an infectious disease, but a moral condition. Trying to get the right treatment and services for people was a major campaign in the 1980s, as was getting the public health information out, but it made me realise that there is not an objective set of criteria in the Department of Health-there is not some philosopher king sitting there, deciding on the allocation for brains, kidneys, livers and cancer. The apportionment of resources partly depends on how loudly both the advocates on behalf of particular patients and the patients themselves shout.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/11">Today, the Minister is hearing those who represent sufferers of arthritis, rheumatism and rheumatoid arthritis shouting on behalf of patients. They are not necessarily asking for more resources, but want more direct and better co-ordination of services to ensure that we have better health service delivery to patients.</p>

	<p pid="b.7.0/1">It is a pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Mr. Streeter. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> for allowing me to climb on to one of my hobby-horses, although I shall try not to detain hon. Members for too long. My interest in this issue comes from the fact that I have spent a large part of my professional career battling on the side of patients with the inflammatory arthritises, so I am pleased to be able to speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/2">I will talk under four headings, the first three being diagnosis, management, and work capability assessments for people with long-term conditions. I will then repeat the recommendations that were made so eloquently by the hon. Gentleman and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/3">Diagnosis is one of my hobby-horses. How can we treat anybody in medicine unless we have the correct diagnosis? Right at the beginning, we have to divide the musculoskeletal disorders into two groups: the inflammatory illnesses, which can lead to crippling deformity and disability, and the disorders that are due to acute strains, backache and degenerative change.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/4">The word &quot;arthritis&quot; is an absolute bugbear. When a GP tells somebody that they have arthritis, they immediately leap to the conclusion that they have the worst sort of progressive arthritis. The word needs explanation. I have looked at the current dictionaries and, to my great relief, the &quot;Chambers&quot;, &quot;Oxford&quot; and &quot;Webster's&quot; dictionaries all get the definition right. They define arthritis as a disease that causes painful inflammation and stiffness of joints, which is absolutely right. When I look at &quot;Black's Medical Dictionary&quot;, however, it says:</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Arthritis refers to any condition of joints of the limbs or spine associated with inflammation or structural change&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/6">Straight away, it lumps osteoarthritis-degenerative change-with all the other conditions. We really should have a campaign on that to ensure that people with a degenerative change or a strain change realise that it is not potentially progressive.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/7">If we are to have better diagnosis, as has been said, we need better training for students, refreshers for GPs and greater awareness among people more generally. As with the cancers, there is a group of common symptoms that presents for the inflammatory arthritises. The first is stiffness that is much worse in the morning. Anybody who has painful joints with swelling, morning stiffness and signs of inflammation has an inflammatory arthritis, and they will have to jump up and down until their GP organises the basically simple blood tests that will confirm that they have an inflammatory illness. If it is potentially progressive, the earlier it can be tackled, the better.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.0/1">The hon. Gentleman hits the nail on the head-early diagnosis is a significant issue. I mentioned that I have ankylosing spondylitis, but I was not diagnosed for six years. Late diagnosis is a common concern, particularly as the condition progresses a great deal. However, the problem goes across the specialties, because AS can present as iritis or in other ways. Will he comment on the idea that we need to work across the specialties? This is not just an issue for rheumatology; the specialties have to talk to each other.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. Ankylosing spondylitis is a very specific and interesting inflammatory arthritis, but it needs early diagnosis. The treatment for most back pains is &quot;Put 'em to bed and rest 'em,&quot; but somebody with ank spond who is put to bed to rest will stiffen up. We see people walking around who were treated years ago yet even now have stiffened up in a hopelessly bent condition. When I was in the Air Force, I had to treat a high-ranking officer with ankylosing spondylitis. He had been treated badly and had curled up. The only time he was comfortable was when he was lying in a fighter aircraft, in which pilots would lie with their feet stretched out and their head looking in the same direction. Amazingly, this chap was still allowed to pilot an aircraft.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I actually said that there was a simple test to determine whether an inflammatory process was going on, not whether someone had rheumatoid arthritis. Obviously there are tests for rheumatoid arthritis, as the Minister knows, but the crucial thing is the simple test for inflammation.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.3/2">I hate to put it like this, but ankylosing spondylitis is one of the most interesting of the inflammatory arthritises for the doctor treating it, because it affects so many bits, although I will not describe all those that it could affect for fear of upsetting <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase>. However, it is vital that an early diagnosis is made, and anti-TNF drugs are useful in treating this condition, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.3/3">I now turn briefly to the management of conditions. Obviously, everything depends on the diagnosis. Although I want to concentrate mainly on the inflammatory arthritises, it is now recognised that the medical profession treats backache badly, and some osteopaths and alternative practitioners are probably just as good, if not better. On the inflammatory arthritises, however, it is crucial that sufferers are treated by a multidisciplinary team. Gone are the days when someone saw a consultant rheumatologist and that was that. People must have specialist nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, podiatrists and ready access to psychologists and orthopaedic surgeons. There are huge worries about such provision, however, given that financial resources will inevitably be reduced over the next few years. The attack will come on specialist nurses and physios-</p>

	<p pid="b.9.1/1">I am glad to see the Minister shaking her head because physios and occupational therapists are always seen as low priorities when we talk about emergency medicine and emergency surgery and it is important that we protect them.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/2">Obviously, I have seen huge changes in treatment during my professional life. Until about 15 years ago, disease-modifying drugs were very toxic and not that effective. We had things such as gold and penicillamine. Then we had methotrexate, which was quite a breakthrough. Recently, we have had the unbelievable advance of the so-called biologicals, which have been mentioned. When they work, they can be almost like a miracle, but they require careful follow-up and specialist staff, particularly specialist nurses, are needed to do that follow-up. With such conditions, people cannot be referred back to primary care for follow-up unless the GP has been specially trained in following up people on anti-TNFs, so they have to be followed up by the specialist in the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/3">The take-up of anti-TNF drugs has been mentioned. I was at a meeting of the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society last February at which Professor David Isenberg, a consultant rheumatologist at University college London, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Postcode prescribing results in huge variations across the country. Why does it happen that one patient can get a NICE-approved drug straight away, but for another patient they might have to wait three months?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/5">He added:</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/6" class="indent">&quot;So far as the anti-TNF treatments for RA are concerned, only 5-10 per cent. of UK patients are receiving them, despite NICE approval.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/7">That was virtually a year ago, so I hope that the Minister will tell us that things are better now.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/8">Hon. Members have already mentioned the crucial importance of better records and information-I echo those comments. As for employment, since emphasis was placed on capacity for work rather than incapacity, and since the change from personal capability assessments to work capability assessments, I have heard several complaints about the nature and accuracy of the medical assessments, particularly for people with long-term conditions. The tests are performed by a firm called Atos, and some of those about which I have heard complaints have been overturned on appeal. I wonder whether the Minister has received complaints about those medical assessments, and especially about lack of notice. I was so concerned that I wrote to the Department for Work and Pensions, and I received a reply from the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" name="Jonathan R Shaw">the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw)</phrase>, who is the Minister responsible for disabled people. A particular concern was that medical evidence that had been submitted was not really taken into account. The Minister wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The guidance for examining healthcare professionals specifies that they are required to read and consider all the evidence on file in preparation for the interview with the claimant.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/10">I also wrote to Dame Carol Black and she passed the letter to the chief medical adviser for the DWP, Dr. W. J. Gunnyeon. He replied:</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The healthcare professionals carrying out the WCA receive training tailored specifically to the task of carrying out the assessment...As the purpose of the assessment is to identify the functional effects of those conditions, the specific training which they receive focuses on disability analysis.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/12">The reply from Atos was:</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/13" class="indent">&quot;It may be beneficial if I explain that the HCP provides their medical opinion based on the documentary evidence, the interview and observation of the customer and on an appropriate medical assessment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/14">We therefore have it absolutely straight that the previous illness and medical evidence must be taken into account. I should be interested to hear from the point of view of the Department of Health whether the Minister has had complaints about such assessments.</p>

	<p pid="b.10.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention, because I did not realise that that was the number. I am encouraged to think that it is worth hon. Members continuing to take the matter up with Atos and the Department. There is nothing more distressing than seeing someone with a genuine, very long-term condition being put through unnecessary appeals. I know of one case when that happened once and then again the following year, and the person concerned won the appeals.</p>

	<p pid="b.10.2/1">The situation is even worse than the hon. Gentleman suspects. People in my area were called for interviews to a building with no disabled access, so people with very serious complaints could not get in to establish that they were disabled.</p>

	<p pid="b.10.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising that.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.3/2">I must finish, so I shall summarise my points. A priority for people with long-term conditions that has not been mentioned is prescription charges. Professor Ian Gilmore of the Royal College of Physicians is carrying out a study on that, and I wonder whether the Minister has any inkling of when the report will be published. As patients with cancer are being excused prescription charges, I hope that the same will go for people with long-term conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.3/3">I support the wish for a national clinical director. Cancer and cardiac care have come on tremendously, at least in part because of the appointment of the clinical directors. In the case of the inflammatory arthritises, we have the almost miracle of anti-TNFs, which can be equated with the huge advances that have happened in cardiac care. We want someone to push forward so that such drugs are rapidly made widely available. We have mentioned training, public awareness and better information gathering. If the Minister addresses all those things, we shall have done some good for people with long-term conditions, particularly the musculoskeletal ones.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.10.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="10"  time="010:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0002.htm#10011948000473">
	<p pid="b.10.4/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Streeter. I think that this is the first time I have done so. I am sure that your elevation was recent, and it is certainly well deserved.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on initiating this important debate and taking up the cudgels on behalf of musculoskeletal sufferers. This is clearly an important topic, but it is also, as my hon. Friend made clear, a huge one, covering a range of conditions, some of which have clear and definite physical symptoms that can be seen on an X-ray, and some of which, such as fibromyalgia, are rather more difficult to tie down, and to treat. The topic is huge also in the sense that it involves 10 million people in the UK. It is important to the sufferers, who endure daily torment, but also to the nation. The National Audit Office report established that better treatment of rheumatoid arthritis could save the nation &#163;1.8 billion, and we could do with an extra &#163;1.8 billion at the moment. Apparently, &#163;7 billion is lost to the economy from all musculoskeletal disorders.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/3">It is important that the NHS should get the treatment of those 10 million sufferers right. All the research that I have looked at identifies a crucial role for primary care to play-particularly GPs. The NAO report, which I think centred exclusively on the issue of rheumatoid arthritis, said that there was sometimes a nine-month wait between when symptoms first occurred and the start of treatment, which made quite a difference to long-term outcomes. If things are not got right in the early stages, the disease will progress more rapidly, with more damage. There is thus a crucial role for primary care.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/4">The literature makes it apparent that there is a crucial role for the primary care trusts. In every PCT worth its salt, there is talk about the expert patient initiative-and voluble talk about how long-term conditions can be managed by the patient and practitioner together. Much of that, however, going by evidence presented by my hon. Friend and others, is lip service, because there is not effective bespoke commissioning everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/5">PCTs without such commissioning can learn something from those where it exists about employing interventions that work-because things are not going that well in the national health service. According to statistics given to the Liberal Democrats under the Freedom of Information Act, in the past three years, 3,337 NHS staff with a range of conditions, the bulk of which were of the musculoskeletal kind, went for treatment outside the NHS. That leads one to be suspicious about whether they were able to find good enough treatment wholly available within the NHS. Then, of course, there is the collateral damage to the ability and confidence of those affected. There is also the unspoken problem of mental health. People who cannot move very well and do not feel very good about themselves may suffer more frequently with depression and the like.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/6">Three quarters of people diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis are found to have it while still at working age-a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>. When identified, the prognosis is rather dim. They end up being off work for long periods and, worse still, sometimes without much sympathy. The back has always been the passport for malingerers wanting to get out of a job, so those who have a genuine problem with their back do not necessarily get the sympathy that they might receive if they had another sort of complaint.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/7">Given all that, an awful lot of people tend to be plain philosophical. My mother suffers with rheumatoid arthritis, but she just gets on with it. She moans about it from time to time, but she does not do anything about it. She regards it as an occupational hazard of getting old. She does not like us drawing attention to it, because its disfiguring aspect upsets her. She prefers to ignore it and get on with her life as best she can.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/8">It is obvious that if such conditions are allowed to develop unchecked, they will become severely disabling. There are knock-on consequences for other aspects of health. For instance, the cardiovascular system can be affected, and mental health problems can occur. If it is unchecked in the nation-or at least not well checked-it could have a huge social and financial impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/9">What needs to be done? We obviously need to tackle the problem with more urgency. We also need something that was alluded to earlier-a recognition that we need more diversity. If 200 different problems can be encompassed in musculoskeletal conditions, as we were reliably told by my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale, and I believe him, it is unlikely that they can all be resolved with the same solution. Various professionals will be involved in the treatment-physiotherapists, physiologists, occupational therapists, and even acupuncturists and bone surgeons-but it is important to recognise that it is a diverse problem that requires a range of solutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/10">My hon. Friend spoke of the need for more co-ordination and coherence, and we cannot argue with that. Certainly a good interconnection is needed between those who prescribe and those who manipulate, between the secondary and the primary sectors and between the workplace or the Department for Work and Pensions and the surgery.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/11">The literature that I have seen does not demand that the Government do something new, but they have been asked in parliamentary questions whether they have any intention of updating the musculoskeletal framework. They responded in various ways. They did not reject the need to do something, but they pointed out that they are committed to improving care and outcomes for people with long-term conditions. They said that they want to improve the quality of service in a safe and effective way; that they will start fit-for-work pilots; and that they have learned something from &quot;Working for a healthier tomorrow&quot;. All those things were said in answer to parliamentary questions, but clearly not to the satisfaction of many hon. Members here today.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/12">I have a small element of sympathy for the Government. We can give too much credence to a framework, as though it would magically abolish the problem-as if, once it is in place, and the tick-box exercise has started, everything will be better. I an anxious that the Government may be too firm and overarching in dictating local priorities, as all hon. Members would want to support local provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/13">I have a little sympathy with the Government's wish to conduct pilots. Before they tell people what to do, they genuinely need to know what is best practice and what works best. The problems that we are debating are slightly different from those linked to cancer, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend. For a start, there is greater variety. I know that cancers vary, but musculoskeletal conditions vary even more.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.4/14">Some people may fear that pilots will become a substitute for action-that a pilot is doing something about a problem to which the Government have been alerted. There is clearly no need to pilot certain things. For example, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> said, key conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis are well understood and are relatively easy to diagnose. We do not need to reinvent the wheel. The challenge for the Government is to act on National Audit Office findings and the many representations made here today and by the associated bodies and charities that support people with such conditions. Unless we take another hard look at ensuring effective action to deal with the problem, we will be wasting money and wasting people's lives. We will also be wasting known medical expertise.</p>

	<p pid="b.13.0/1">May I say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Streeter? I apologise for my loss of voice, which may mean that I shall be brief.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on scoping out so well some of the issues that face those with musculoskeletal problems. &quot;Joint Working? An audit of the implementation of the Department of Health's musculoskeletal services framework&quot; by the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance quoted a number figures, as have several hon. Members who have spoken today. I shall try gather them together-they vary, but I hope to show at least some of the range.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/3">The ARMA report noted that musculoskeletal conditions place a significant burden on the NHS, accounting for between &#163;3.5 billion and &#163;4.5 billion of NHS spending every year. They also cause a loss of working days every year: we were given a figure as low as 11 million but it could be as high as 28 million. The report expresses concern, which is shared by hon. Members who have spoken in the debate, that the Department of Health's musculoskeletal services framework has been implemented inconsistently, and recognises the variations in standards of care across the UK for patients living with those conditions. That concern should be addressed. The report also calls on the Government to consider the recommendations, and I am sure that the Minister will want to respond to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/4">There are between 150 and 200 musculoskeletal diseases and syndromes, which are usually but not always progressive and which are associated with pain. Indeed, a number of hon. Members here could say that they have at some point suffered from a musculoskeletal condition, albeit minor-except for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase>, who is no longer in his seat, for whom it is more significant. Such conditions result from trauma and inflammation or a number of other factors. Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, low- back pain, and limb trauma are particularly significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/5">More than 50 per cent. of the population have reported musculoskeletal pain at one or more sites for at least a week. Population surveys show that back pain is the most common site of pain, and the prevalence of physical disability is higher in women than in men. It increases with age; 60 per cent. of women aged over 75 who live in the community have reported some physical limitations. In individuals of working age, musculoskeletal conditions, particularly back pain and generalised widespread pain, are a common cause of sick leave and long-term work disability. Hence, they are a big problem for the individuals affected and have significant economic consequences for society.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/6">Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are associated with loss of independence and sufferers require more support in the community or admission to residential care. Between 15 and 20 per cent. of GP consultations are about musculoskeletal conditions-they take up a significant time in GPs' surgeries-and many of those people are referred to allied health professions, such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists or chiropractors. We should not underestimate the huge impact that such professionals have in improving the life and prospects of people with musculoskeletal conditions. Then we have the rheumatologists, orthopaedic surgeons and the rehabilitation specialists, of whom <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> is one-we always welcome not only his professional expertise but his significant contribution to debates such as these.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/7">In most European countries, total joint replacement-knee or hip-is one of the most common elective operations for old people. We are therefore talking about a significant disease that has a significant impact on our economy and the well-being of the people in this country. Much of the treatment is not complex: massage, physiotherapy, drug self-management and vitamin or mineral supplements are all used to relieve pain. As the disease progresses, joint surgery and more complex drug treatment are also necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/8">In 2006, the musculoskeletal services framework recommended offering care closer to home, with improved ways to access diagnostic services. The document aimed to help local health communities to improve orthopaedic services and to deliver a waiting time of 18 weeks. However, as hon. Members have said, there are problems about diagnosis. Setting a target of 18 weeks may be laudable, but the clock starts ticking only when a patient has that much-needed diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/9">The musculoskeletal services framework dealt with such issues by describing best practice, which is built around evidence and experience. It also promoted a redesign of services, full exploitation of skills and roles, and better outcomes for people with musculoskeletal conditions through more actively managed patient pathways, as well as sharing of information and responsibility agreed between stakeholders in all sectors. The central tenet of the document was to provide the appropriate level of high-quality information, support and treatment to those with musculoskeletal conditions. Sadly, however, that is not happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/10">If the problem is bad now, it will get worse with an ageing population. The associated problems, which have been touched on, are not just a loss of working days and the cost of musculoskeletal problems, but an increase in mental health problems. As people become less mobile, they become more isolated, and the burden is then placed on family and friends. I repeat: the problem will only get worse with an ageing population.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/11">It is very hard for people with musculoskeletal conditions to get the attention they deserve. Despite the figures, public and media attention is often difficult to grab. Questions continue to be raised about whether GPs always recognise the problem-I have already mentioned the problem of diagnosis. We must focus on GP training and continuing professional development. Complaints about diagnosis relate not only to musculoskeletal conditions, but to illnesses such as epilepsy and asthma. It is an area that we must get right. I know that a great deal is put on the plate of GPs, but it is vital that they continue their professional development and that we continue to emphasise the importance of early diagnosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/12">I smiled to myself when the hon. Member for Wyre Forest mentioned multi-disciplinary teams. Multi-disciplinary teams go in a little box of things that I remember coming into being in the early 1980s, when I was a district nurse-the Minister may share this memory. Like many things from 30 years ago, the idea appears to have languished on the beaches-although it is often mentioned in documents, it is, sadly, rarely put into practice. There is no doubt that multi-disciplinary teams have a huge role to play in treating musculoskeletal conditions. We need to see them working on the ground. The teams need a lot of leadership from not just Government but local PCTs and GP practices to ensure that they play their part in treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/13">In my party, we have talked about speeding up National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence drug appraisals; that is critical, particularly in the later stages of treatment. If that were done, fewer drug cases would have to go to exceptional cases panels, because PCTs would have earlier guidance on what should be prescribed for such conditions. We also believe that the societal costs of disease should be taken into account in NICE appraisals. That is particularly relevant for people with musculoskeletal conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/14">Individual budgets have a crucial role to play. If someone with a long-term condition who was living at home could be assessed through a single assessment process, which incorporated both health and social care needs, a &quot;pooled budget&quot; could be determined for them. The calculation of the budget would consist of two parts: one would relate to social care and be means-tested, the other would be health care-related and free. Based on that, an individual and their carer would be given the flexibility and empowerment-most important if one is suffering from a long-term chronic illness-to choose their providers and where they get the care to alleviate their problems. They should be able to exercise that flexibility across the social and health care divide.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/15">Giving real choice to patients and allowing professionals to decide on the best strategies for providing health care will not be possible unless GPs, patients and providers can access sophisticated data about the performance of treatments, hospitals and doctors. I am confident that the provision of high-quality information, available in the public domain and presented to patients by GPs, will make the providers of NHS care truly accountable to patients and improve the standards of care. I am even more confident that, as information drives greater choice for patients, so patients' experience of their health care will improve.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/16">Some 20 to 25 per cent. of our constituents suffer from musculoskeletal problems, and they account for one in four visits to GPs. Up to 28 million working days a year are lost due to musculoskeletal problems, which is some 22 per cent. of our long-term capacity. Will the Minister tell us what the Government have done and what they intend to do to resolve the huge range of problems?</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/17">ARMA states in its audit of PCTs that only 60 per cent. of those responding have mapped resources for long-term conditions and their use by people with musculoskeletal problems. Some 60 per cent. of PCTs have not audited outcomes, which is shocking, and 57 per cent. have not linked up to local pathways-to- work schemes. Most important, David Nicholson, the chief executive of the NHS, agreed that improving the outcomes for people with musculoskeletal problems was about management and planning rather than additional money. That is a joy to the ears of all of us in these very difficult financial times. We have a chance to improve the mobility, the well-being and the productiveness of millions of people without additional costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/18">I have a number of questions for the Minister. What can be done to improve the working practices affecting sufferers of a musculoskeletal condition? According to a survey by the Office for National Statistics, the majority of MSC sufferers over 60 do not have access to health services due to a lack of information and help from their GPs. What can be done to ensure that those who need both information and care receive them? Is the Minister aware-this was also raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>-that the King's Fund report of 2006 found that spending on musculoskeletal problems varied eightfold across PCTs in the country?</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/19">The Minister must also be aware from work on the Government's musculoskeletal services framework that MSC patients have endured some of the longest waiting times for hospital care and have, in many areas, faced fragmented and incoherent services that provided poor access to care. Four years on, can the Minister tell us what has happened and what she is now doing to address the situation? Will she also say why the Department of Health does not take a clinical lead? I mentioned leadership earlier and said that leadership must not only come from Government, but that a Department of Health clinical lead would have a significant impact by giving people and their musculoskeletal problems the attention that they deserve. Finally, what steps is she taking to improve commissioning of services?</p>

	<p pid="b.16.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on securing the debate. I would also like to add my own tribute to you, Mr. Streeter, as we serve under your chairmanship today.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/2">I want to acknowledge the gallant leadership that has been shown by the nurse sitting opposite me today: <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase>. In this debate, of course, we have heard from two nurses, in the hon. Lady and me; a physician, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase>; and a scientist, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>. I am not sure about some of the attributes that other hon. Members present have brought to the debate, along with their concern for their constituents, but they have been able to demonstrate their abilities and interests in this area. I also congratulate the hon. Member for Rochdale on his relationship, as a trustee, with the Arthritis Research Campaign. I applaud the imaginative title of &quot;Joint Working?&quot;, the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance report to which that he referred.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/3">Before I address in detail the concerns that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members have raised, I would like to recognise the excellent work of NHS staff that is taking place across the whole of Rochdale. Those staff are delivering a better quality health service than ever, which benefits the hon. Gentleman's constituents and those of other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/4">It is estimated that nearly a quarter of adults and about 12,000 children are affected by long-standing musculoskeletal problems-with your permission, Mr. Streeter, I will refer to musculoskeletal as &quot;MSK&quot; throughout the rest of my speech. MSK conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis and other bone, joint, spinal and muscular diseases, can cause tremendous pain and anxiety to sufferers and their families on a daily basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/5">When someone sees their GP with a suspected MSK problem, there is often no single diagnostic test that can confirm a particular condition, because symptoms can vary, as was set out earlier in the debate. For example, the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are similar to many more common conditions. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest gave a very good description of the symptoms that people might experience when they awake from sleep. As he did so, I looked around the Chamber and I could see Members and officials perhaps thinking, &quot;Was that how I felt this morning?&quot;, as they awoke with stiffness and swelling of joints. It is very common for us to feel that anxiety about such symptoms with which we struggle in many areas of our life. Of course, &quot;struggle&quot; is what most people do if they have any of those conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/6">Early diagnosis of those debilitating conditions is essential, because if treatment is started early, the damage to joints can be minimised. There is an increasing amount of evidence that aggressive treatment soon after the onset of symptoms can lead to remission.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/7">Hon. Members have quite rightly raised the issue of why some primary care trusts fund GPs with specialist interests while other PCTs do not. Some PCTs have alternatives to GPs with specialist interests. For example, we now have consultant-led teams working in the community and, as has been mentioned already, we also have nurse-led clinics that have access to a consultant.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/8">For example, the Pennine MSK partnership in Oldham adopts a community-based approach. Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust co-ordinates care between hospital departments, and GPs and nurses in the community. Of course, the very important physiotherapists and occupational therapists also play their role. As is the case with so many long-term conditions, there will now be a team approach to MSK conditions. PCTs need to decide how best to provide services with their local populations.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/9">Commissioning is exceptionally important. World-class commissioning will help PCTs to align their more strategic priorities with the key health outcomes that will deliver for their particular local population. PCTs need to ensure that they commission the services that are needed for their patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/10">In the Department of Health, we continue to work closely with key stakeholders to share this learning, because learning is what we are doing. We are learning how to treat long-term conditions of a very difficult-often chronic-nature together in the community. Therefore, good practice must be shared.</p>

	<p pid="b.18.0/1">I think that the Minister said before that diagnosis of some of those conditions is quite a complex matter and that it is not quite as simple as the hon. Member for Wyre Forest represented it earlier. Clearly, there will be differential patterns of success with regard to early diagnosis. What I want to know is whether there is a statistical basis for examining those patterns. In other words, are data collected on the success of particular practices, or particular PCTs, in the early identification of versions of rheumatoid arthritis?</p>

	<p pid="b.18.1/1">I hope that I will go on to demonstrate that, because we have published examples of good and innovative practice in MSK services. We have also introduced a national orthopaedic coaching programme, which is working with 80 NHS organisations across all 10 strategic health authorities, to spread learning across local health communities, to share good practice and to deliver improved services.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.18.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="18"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0003.htm#10011948000478">
	<p pid="b.18.2/1">The Minister is talking primarily about differentials in therapy or treatment-or whatever-and the variety of good and bad practice that exists in treatment. What I was wondering about was whether there was any statistical base for suggesting that there is good and bad practice in diagnosis, either in practices within the same PCT, or in PCTs themselves.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.18.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" speakername="Ann Keen" colnum="18"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0003.htm#10011948000479">
	<p pid="b.18.3/1">I hope that I will demonstrate that as I progress. If my response is not sufficient, perhaps I could address the issue outside this particular debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.3/2">What is being done to help GPs to understand the symptoms of MSK conditions? We are providing information for patients and professionals on the symptoms and treatment of a variety of MSK conditions via NHS Choices, NHS Evidence and the map of medicine. We are publishing good practice and commissioning pathways for inflammatory arthritis for PCTs to adapt locally. We are developing that programme to include a layer of information for patients to cover all aspects of their stages of treatment. Of course, it is very important that we remember that the patient is at the centre of this information-giving activity and that, in many instances, they will be very aware of all the information that they require, which might at times be a difficulty-not a threat, but a difficulty-for some health professionals who have less knowledge of this particular subject than others.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.3/3">We are attending events across the country to promote the 18-week commissioning pathway for inflammatory arthritis. For example, the Department of Health recently attended a Nursing in Practice event in Birmingham to help to promote the pathway and information about rheumatoid arthritis among primary care nurses. We also attended the National Association of Primary Care conference to promote good practice among a wider audience, including GPs, PCTs and practice-based commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.3/4">On rheumatoid arthritis specifically, we are working with clinicians and support groups to understand how awareness among GPs and the public can be raised. For example, we are considering how to support the Rheumatology Futures Group and the Royal College of General Practitioners to raise awareness of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.3/5">NHS Choices is a comprehensive web-based information service that is intended to help the public to make choices about their health, from lifestyle decisions through to the very practical aspects of finding and using NHS services in England. It provides a wealth of information to patients and health care professionals on a wide range of conditions, including information on the symptoms and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.3/6">The map of medicine provides GPs with information to help them to determine the best possible treatment options for their patients, including information on the various patterns of onset, diagnostic tests and medical treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is a map of best available research evidence and of best-evidence clinical guidelines. It displays this knowledge in a pathway that is easy to use and presented in a particular format, reflecting the patient journey and providing a framework for developing local pathways.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.3/7">The Rheumatology Futures Group is examining how to raise GPs' and primary health care professionals' awareness of inflammatory arthritis, including through educational material for GPs and practice nurses to increase awareness of early inflammatory arthritis in primary care. It is also examining pharmacists encouraging their patients who attend regularly for analgesic medication to seek advice from their GP, if inflammatory arthritis is a possibility. That is a different approach, as I am sure hon. Members will recognise. If someone regularly attends a pharmacy for anti-inflammatory painkillers, the pharmacist could ask, &quot;Have you been to your doctor?&quot; From all the evidence that I have described, it is evident that there is a willingness, a desire and a need to treat MSK conditions differently.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.3/8">Hon. Members have rightly mentioned the economy and Dame Carol Black's review. We agree on the importance of early diagnosis, and PCTs need to work with their providers. In our response to Dame Carol Black's review of the health of the working-age population, &quot;Working for a healthier tomorrow&quot;, the Government set out a number of new and existing initiatives to support people entering, staying in or returning to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.3/9">Pathways to work, which is available to all individuals claiming benefits due to a health condition or disability, offers a mixture of mandatory interviews and voluntary programmes. I heard what was said about the interviews, how they are called and, in some instances, the ridiculousness, in terms of access, of where they are held-<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I think that the hon. Member for Guildford has spread her throat infection rapidly across to me, although I am not sure how that has been achieved. The interviews need to be reviewed. I note the serious comments that have been made, not just as a Minister but as a constituency Member of Parliament, because I am also aware of some of the concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.3/10">The condition management programme, which is voluntary, is delivered by multidisciplinary health care professional teams to empower individuals to understand and manage their health conditions in order to return to work. We must recognise how difficult it is for some people in our communities to work. Employers must engage with adaptation, if necessary, or provide a different role in the workplace. We all know that working gives people not only a better income, but a better quality of life. As a nurse in the community and among my own friends, I have witnessed how easy it is for people with chronic conditions to become isolated, especially if it is one of the dreadful inflammatory diseases involving joint disfigurement that can lead to embarrassment about the way that one looks.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.3/11">Leadership has been mentioned, and it is so important. I will put my cards on the table about the call for a national MSK clinical lead. Many requests have been made for champions for various clinical areas. Hon. Members can imagine how many people want a clinical lead for their speciality. As we announced last year in &quot;High quality care for all&quot;, we decided to set up a National Quality Board to advise on future clinical priorities and what steps might be taken, such as the appointment of clinical champions, to promote clinical quality in identified priority areas. The National Quality Board recently conducted a stakeholder engagement on the criteria and process for setting priorities and the initial list of topics for consideration. Relevant NHS patient and professional organisations have been invited to suggest possible topics and submit evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.3/12">We felt that that was the fairest way to manage huge demand. We recognise the difference that champions have made in cardiovascular, liver and neurological diseases and in cancer. I understand what people are saying, and I can only suggest that Members continue to take note of stakeholder groups. The organisations to which they belong, and in which they play such an important role, will help.</p>

	<p pid="b.20.0/1">I appreciate that everybody wants a clinical lead, but does the Minister agree that drawing media attention to musculoskeletal diseases is particularly difficult? She mentioned heart disease and cancer, which get quite a lot of attention. Musculoskeletal conditions are a specific concern, particularly bearing in mind that they have such a huge impact on our society.</p>

	<p pid="b.20.1/1">I agree. Because those conditions are not perceived as life threatening, they are not considered serious. This matter is complex, but as has been said so well in this debate, the pain has a significant effect on quality of life, whether that is working life, social life or the life of a child approaching adulthood. It is important to take such conditions seriously and to consider what sufferers' futures hold for them. I believe that this debate will progress that, which is why I again congratulate the hon. Member for Rochdale on securing it.</p>

	<p pid="b.20.2/1">I am listening carefully to what my hon. Friend is saying. I realise that, unfortunately, she cannot change Government policy on her feet in this Chamber. However, if I understand what she is saying-I would be grateful if she corrected me-she agrees with us and wants us to keep shouting for a clinical director, because the case is made and the Government just need to change their policy. Is that what she is really saying?</p>

	<p pid="b.20.3/1">That is a skilled way of using my words slightly differently. I laid my cards on the table and said what we were doing. I said that we were engaging with stakeholders. My hon. Friend will be able to engage with them and will, I am sure, continue to champion the issue in the way that he has demonstrated in this debate. He also mentioned the best and worst services in the country, possibly in relation to the King's Fund report. We now have a constitution that must be followed and guidelines within the constitution on the practice of administration and the availability of new drug treatments and services. PCTs must be called to account to their own communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.3/2">The 18-week time standard has significantly improved access to treatment for many patients, including those with MSK conditions. In August 2007, just 68 per cent. of non-admitted rheumatology patients received treatment within 18 weeks of referral. Hon. Members will be pleased to know that by October last year, that figure had jumped to 98 per cent. Personalised care plans are a new concept for patients with long-term conditions and their families. They allow people to take control of their own care instead of being dictated to by professionals, particularly in relation to their pain level. The patient's pain level is what the patient says it is.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.3/3">We now have expert pain management clinics to help people live with chronic conditions. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> said that his mother puts up with hers, but the &quot;mustn't grumble&quot; days are over for people with such conditions. They must grumble-a lot of grumbling has been done in a managed and professional way in this debate. I believe that with the advent of the movement of long-term conditions into the community and away from a consultant-led, in-hospital approach, which uses serious resources inappropriately, we all need to consider quality, safety and the personalised care of patients with chronic conditions such as MSK, as we have a duty to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.1/1">I am delighted to initiate this debate, because manufacturing is crucial to our country's economy. Our future depends on the health of the manufacturing sector. The current political obsession with debts, deficits and borrowing is obscuring the importance of the manufacturing base, which is, and has been, shrinking. We have an opportunity to rebuild and expand it, because we are now more competitive. I urge people to seize this opportunity with both hands and rebalance the economy-which has become lopsided, with a bias towards an overwhelmingly heavy financial sector-back towards manufacturing so that we can pay our way in the world. The national mood, which has long been fairly hostile and cool towards manufacturing, is turning back towards being sympathetic to and supportive of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/2">To my surprise, I have been deluged with representations from all sorts of manufacturing bodies, such as the Chemical Industries Association, the Engineering Employers Federation, the Food and Drink Federation and representatives of the aerospace industry, which have emphasised the importance of manufacturing and urged me to concentrate on their particular sector and its problems. I will not do that, because this is a general debate. The situation is well summed up by the Engineering Employers Federation pamphlet, &quot;Manufacturing. Our future&quot;. It undoubtedly is the future; I agree with just about everything in that manufacturing manifesto.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/3">Having burbled about debt and finance for over a decade, even the economic commentators-those great weather vanes-are coming back to recognising the importance of manufacturing. Messrs. Smith of <i>The Sunday Times</i>, Elliott of <i>The Guardian</i>, Keegan and Bootle-my main weather vane-are all writing about the importance of manufacturing and building up our manufacturing sector again. Even the Lord high Mandelson has said that we should be concerned with engineering, rather than financial engineering. If it has reached that level of recognition, it must be a successful doctrine.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.2/1">The First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, whom my hon. Friend mentioned, came to the Corus steelworks in Rotherham in the summer. I must say that since his visit, things have turned around. We are now narrowly in the black and the unions have worked co-operatively with the management. Mr. Stuart Sansome, the leader of the Corus steelworkers, made a presentation to the Corus board with the local management, which showed partnership at work. Let us place it on the record that Lord Mandelson, about whom my hon. Friend and I have made many comments over many years, might be on the side of the angels on this matter. He might help Britain's steel industry to have a future, which was far from certain this time last year.</p>

	<p pid="b.23.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we must look carefully at patent protection to ensure that specialist and innovative manufacturers can take advantage of their innovations and manufacture their goods in this country, rather than have their patents stolen and the goods manufactured elsewhere? I have a meeting with Lord Mandelson on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-02">2 February</phrase> to discuss that point. Would the hon. Gentleman care to join me in that meeting with specialist manufacturers from my constituency?</p>

	<p pid="b.23.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. We are an innovative country. Although manufacturing has been badly battered, our manufacturing industry is still an innovative source of ideas. It must be able to follow those ideas through to profit, so the ideas must be patented and the patents safeguarded. I agree with that absolutely.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.3/2">Trade is the main contributor towards this country paying its way in the world and most trade is in manufactured goods. Although the manufacturing sector has been making a strong contribution, its share has declined and it has been suffering. In the light of the experiences of developing countries, exports are the key to growth. For too long, our manufacturing has contributed only on the home market. We are now running a deficit in manufacturing trade.</p>

	<p pid="b.23.4/1">My hon. Friend is making an important speech. On exports, all the projections for the growth of the world economy show that growth will happen among the fast developing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China-the so-called BRIC countries-and not in the traditional large economies. Britain has a very low market share in those countries, particularly in China. Does he agree that we must urge the Government to emphasise exports, particularly for small manufacturers in innovative sectors, which could make a real difference, but which cannot break into those markets at present?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.23.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" speakername="Austin Mitchell" colnum="23"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0004.htm#10011948000492">
	<p pid="b.23.5/1">I agree-it is amazing how many interventions I agree with. It is important that we make a contribution in that area. However, we must face the fact that much trade is in manufacturing sectors that use quite low technology. There are markets there too and we must not neglect them. We have been suffering in all markets. I am arguing that we have an opportunity to win back the share of trade we have lost, as we can now replicate the competitiveness of countries such as China because our exchange rate is more competitive, which lowers our cost base compared with China and developing countries. We are much more competitive because of the fall in the value of the pound.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.5/2">Cambridge university's studies on the economic future show that our trade deficit is going to grow unless we rebuild manufacturing to fill the gap. Oil is not going to fill the gap in the way that it has done; nor is the City, which is a busted flush. If we do not fill the gap by expanding manufacturing, we will have to borrow to pay for imports or import less and reduce our standard of living. The other option is that the world will eventually refuse Britain's credit card on international markets. That is the future unless we rebuild manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.5/3">The past 30 years have been disastrous for manufacturing. The Thatcher Government indulged in an orgy of destruction of manufacturing, particularly of our basic industries. Steel and coal are the classic examples. It was called &quot;creative destruction&quot;, but it did not create, and only destroyed.</p>

	<p pid="b.24.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend entirely. Does he agree that Wales was one of the places most affected by the closure programmes for steel and coal? Particularly disturbing was the fact that the Thatcher Government did not apply for European objective 1 funding for Wales, but let it wither on the vine.</p>

	<p pid="b.24.1/1">Again, I agree. It was an orgy of destruction. It was not only Wales that was affected badly, but all the manufacturing areas of the country, including my area of Yorkshire and Humberside.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/2">Instead of conserving the oil and investing its proceeds for the future like the Norwegians, Mrs. Thatcher used it as a cushion for an orgy of destruction of manufacturing. Unfortunately, that destruction continued under my Government-I say &quot;my&quot; in a proprietorial sense because clearly I strongly support them. Manufacturing continued to decline, and our concern has been the war against inflation, which is fought with a high exchange rate, which makes it cheap for overseas exporters to compete in the British market. Such an approach forces industry to cut costs and labour forces, in a kind of snowballing anaemia downhill. The figures show that manufacturing declined from 27 per cent. of gross domestic product in 1977, when the previous Labour Government were in power, to 20 per cent. in 1997 and about 11 per cent. in today's recession.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/3">Employment has similarly declined. There were 6.9 million people employed in manufacturing in 1978, and there are now 2.8 million, which is only 10 per cent. of total employment. Greater de-industrialisation has taken place here than in any other country. In all countries, manufacturing will shrink comparatively as it becomes more productive, but not in the absolute way that it has here. I said that manufacturing makes up 11 per cent. of our GDP. In Germany and Japan, that figure is 20 per cent., because they have conserved, invested, rebuilt and reconstructed their manufacturing sectors. We have not done that; we have destroyed manufacturing, which is disastrous.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/4">We must rebuild manufacturing because, first, it is the main-indeed, I would say the only-source of productivity gains; secondly, we cannot close the gap in the balance of payments unless we do so; thirdly, doing so will mean that manufacturing is the main source of jobs, which are now at a premium in our economy; and fourthly, it will spread employment and activity around the country instead of focusing everything on London, which is a centre of wealth and speculation that is under the rule of the City and the financial sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.0/1">My hon. Friend contrasted Germany with Britain. In many ways, those countries should be rather similar but, in fact, Germany has a massive trade surplus in manufacturing and we have a massive trade deficit. Germany is doing something that we are not.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.1/1">Germany is an example that we should follow. The way Germany has restructured and invested in its industry is an example to us all but, after successful adjustment, it is now strangled by the fact that the euro is too high. Until the introduction of the euro, Germany was concerned about keeping the deutschmark competitive-indeed, throughout the '60s and '70s, it resisted American pressure to up-value the deutschmark. I am curious that Germany has accepted that valuation with the euro because of concerns about inflation. That has been damaging for Germany's development, but it has also provided an opportunity for us.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.2/1">On the question of exchange rates, the hon. Gentleman has welcomed the fact that the pound is lower at the moment. However, does he accept that that is a double-edged sword, because one of the signs of a weak economy is a low exchange rate? For most of my life, Italy was in poor shape and the lira was worth nothing. In Zimbabwe, a low exchange rate is a sign of that country's problems. Is it simply a great thing that we have such a low exchange rate?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.25.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" speakername="Austin Mitchell" colnum="25"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0004.htm#10011948000498">
	<p pid="b.25.3/1">I do not accept that. Zimbabwe is not an industrial economy. The exchange rate is crucial to manufacturing. It is interesting to note that all expanding countries-from Germany's rebuilding after the war right through to China today-have started with a low exchange rate that they have kept low and competitive to encourage export. That has meant such countries built up a big exporting sector in which economies of scale began to operate and that they entered a virtuous cycle of investment and increasing productivity. An enormous industrial strength was therefore built up on the back of a competitive exchange rate. A low exchange rate is crucial to manufacturing, rather than to the City, which wants a high and over-valued exchange rate to manipulate money around the world and buy assets overseas. Manufacturing needs a low and competitive exchange rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.3/2">We have not done the same as other industrial countries, which have increased productivity. However, we have had occasional illustrations of what is achievable when devaluations have taken place in this country. For example, in 1949, 1967, 1971-under the Heath Government-and in 1992, when the big devaluation meant we left the exchange rate mechanism, there was a boost to manufacturing, growth and productivity on every occasion, and the economy was revived, which shows the importance of having a competitive exchange rate.</p>

	<p pid="b.26.1/1">In 1967, it was the stringency of Roy Jenkins's budget, which has in a sense been paralleled today, that was responsible for the ejection of Labour from office in 1970. That happened because of the measures to tighten and toughen up the economy, rather than because of devaluation, which opened the way to greater prosperity and economic growth. We benefited from that devaluation.</p>

	<p pid="b.26.2/1">My hon. Friend almost answered the question. Would it also be fair to consider how many people had real jobs then compared with now? This country was exporting all over the world at that time, which was the benefit. We built the economy on manufacturing at that time</p>

	<p pid="b.26.4/1">Of course I agree that it is important to have the flexibility to have the right exchange rate. However, does my hon. Friend agree that, in a global economy where so many things are sourced from other countries, the competitive advantage that devaluation gives is offset by the higher costs of inputs? There cannot be a race to the bottom-cutting the exchange rate as a way of boosting manufacturing. The need for financial structures and the ability of firms to take a long-term view is one of the most important lessons we can take from Germany, not least in relation to the success of BMW in my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="b.26.5/1">I am afraid that I do not agree with my right hon. Friend, because the question is about value added in this economy-what we add in value to what we import. That is the crucial test, and that is where we have been failing. The exchange rate translates our costs into a price on foreign markets. We have had a 25 per cent. devaluation-30 per cent. against the euro-and the opportunity we have now is to reduce our cost base. That is important because most manufacturing investment, particularly in low-technology manufacturing, can be made just anywhere. Such investment goes where the cost base is lowest, and it has not come to this country because the overvaluation of sterling has meant that our cost base has been high. It has simply not been profitable to invest in this country-it has not been possible to turn a profit on investments here-but devaluation gives us the opportunity to get round that.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.5/2">The exchange rate is not a phallic symbol that we can be proud of when it is hard and be filled with post-imperial triste when it softens. It is essentially a market clearing mechanism, and a competitive exchange rate is one that clears markets in conditions of high employment and growth. That is what we need in this country.</p>

	<p pid="b.26.6/1">I do not disagree with my hon. Friend. Of course, his comments on flexibility, market clearing and all that are correct. However, I invite him to accept that there are downsides to the depreciation of a currency. First, it makes inputs more expensive if they are imported from elsewhere. Secondly, it cuts the living standards of British workers-that is one way such an approach leads to competitiveness, and we do not advocate that.</p>

	<p pid="b.27.0/1">My right hon. Friend's interventions are very evocative of similar exchanges between us when he was a Minister-he was wrong then and he is wrong now. After previous devaluations, fears of a massive increase in inflation were not realised. There was an increase in inflation, but it was not substantial, and there was an even bigger increase in production and value added in this country. That is what we should aim for through the use of devaluation.</p>

	<p pid="b.27.1/1">Is not the reality of exchange rate policy that it is not about good or bad, strong or weak concepts, but about balance? The problem in the UK economy was that the balance was not right. The exchange rate was too high because it favoured the service industries and the financial sector at the expense of manufacturing. There was an imbalance and, as my hon. Friend is saying, the rectification process of some competitive exchange rate movement is good for manufacturing and for the whole economy because the balance will be better.</p>

	<p pid="b.27.2/1">My hon. Friend puts his point in a moderate and balanced way, as is his wont as chairman of the parliamentary Labour party, and he is right. We want to rebalance the economy away from finance and towards manufacturing; devaluation and new competitiveness give us the opportunity to do so, because they will revive manufacturing and give us a chance to rebuild. They have done so in the past, but we have always let the opportunity drift away by letting prices and the exchange rate rise and by putting up interest rates to defeat inflation. We must not do that again. Manufacturing needs a long-term prospect of competitiveness.</p>

What a shame that there is just a single Conservative here interested in manufacturing, but there is nothing new in that. I promise that this will be my last intervention. The alarming year-on-year inflation rate of 3 per. cent, which was announced this morning, is partly due to the fact that everything we bring into Britain-we are an importing nation-is now more expensive as a result of our devalued pound. To be frank, inflation, if it pushes up interest rates, will do far more damage to access to credit for manufacturing, as well as lower the purchasing power of my constituents. I am with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> on this matter, but the balance was not right.

	<p pid="b.28.0/1">I have taken many interruptions while making my main and straightforward point, but I am now moving on to more controversial ground, so I do so with some terror. Devaluation and competitiveness are necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for the revival of manufacturing. We must also have an industrial policy-words that have been anathema to the Government for a long time, and which certainly were to the previous Government-if we are to seize the opportunity we now have.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/2">We are pouring money into the banks, which are still constricting the flow of credit and helpful funds and investment into manufacturing. One small example is that of a bed manufacturer in Grimsby, who came to me to explain that his mortgage had been closed down by the Royal Bank of Scotland. That is what the banks are doing. That stops the bed manufacturer operating and puts people out of work. It is callous brutality. Banks are not channelling funds as they should be, given the fact that we saved them. We should have given them the duty to channel funds into manufacturing, which is what industries need if they are to survive in the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/3">The policy of quantitative easing, which basically means printing money to buy back Government debt, does not help manufacturing. It helps the financial sector, particularly the hedge funds, including foreign ones, which hold much of the debt. They then use the money to invest in assets and push up the stock market, which does not help manufacturing in any way. We are helping the banks, but not manufacturing. We need to help manufacturing more, and that is the first step in an industrial policy. I do not mean a policy of picking winners, which is a discredited idea; the market will effectively pick the winners as it develops and industry gains competitiveness. A strong manufacturing sector is the only way to spin off winners and innovations, which do not come in a sterile, dead environment or when manufacturing is declining. They come from a viable, lively and expanding base in manufacturing. The alternative to that is despair. Manufacturing can grow quickly, as the experience of China and the young dragon economies of the far east shows, but it needs the guarantee of profitability and competitiveness and the low costs that we now have, compared with international costs, to allow it to develop.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/4">We need an industrial policy to facilitate that process in several ways. First, we should be saving those manufacturing industries and plants that will be necessary in the upswing but that are now being closed, because manufacturing has been particularly hard hit in the recession. It has been more seriously hit than most other sectors, with an 11 per cent. fall in output, because international demand has been greatly reduced. We can use the competitiveness produced by the devaluation only if there is strong international demand, yet manufacturing is suffering. We must help to save steel manufacturing on Teesside in the miraculous way my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase> described. What about the Bosch plant in Wales, where there are 700 jobs? What about the Vestas plant on the Isle of Wight, which is the only manufacturer of the kind of green technology we are supposed to be developing? We must put our efforts into sustaining those plants and manufacturing, rather than into the banks.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/5">Secondly, we need manufacturing policy to channel investment and provide venture capital. Thirdly, we need to break bottlenecks through training, particularly in skills. Fourthly, we need to ease the burdens on manufacturing. We have privatised all the utilities, with the result that they are imposing higher charges on manufacturing for energy, water and everything else; now, we are proposing to reduce the rebate on the climate change levy, which will hit manufacturing. It is crazy to impose such burdens when we need manufacturing to expand. We must concentrate on small and medium-sized plants.</p>

	<p pid="b.29.2/1">My hon. Friend says that there is a need for interventions, and I think that that is a key dividing line between us and the Opposition. Will he give credit for the interventions the Government have made, such as the car scrappage and boiler scrappage schemes? In Wales we have the ProAct and ReAct schemes to keep people in jobs and training, and we have a &#163;1 billion future jobs fund to keep young people in employment. The Government have made some interventions.</p>

	<p pid="b.29.3/1">Absolutely, and my hon. Friend is right to correct me. Perhaps, in my impetuous enthusiasm for demanding a revival of manufacturing, I pitched the case too high. There have been useful interventions, such as the car scrappage scheme, but I want bigger and more effective interventions to sustain manufacturing, concentrating on the small and medium-sized firms that now make up the majority of our manufacturing. They need help with research, design, development and advice, and all that help can be provided by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.3/2">We must, as the main part of the industrial policy, make manufacturing central to the preoccupations of the Government and to the activities of BIS, or whatever alphabetical soup the Department is now called. BIS has a second chance, and now we have that second chance, so I hope that it throws itself into a policy of sustaining and nurturing manufacturing, so that we produce more, sell more to the world and improve our standard of living and our productivity to stop the low, slow decline of manufacturing. Manufacturing is our future. We must seize it now or lose out for ever.</p>

	<p pid="b.29.5/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> on securing the debate. The subject is incredibly important, and one that is well worth our spending our time on. I agree with much of what he said.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.5/2">Manufacturing has a strong tradition in cities such as Glasgow, where I come from. We have moved away from the huge, heavy industries we once had, but we still have a lot of the smaller manufacturing industry and much of the service industry as well. It is disappointing that we do not have the huge steel industry we used to have, or the railways and shipbuilding, but perhaps it was unrealistic to think that those could continue from the 19th century. However, there are many positives and potential in Scotland and across the wider UK. For example, aerospace is very positive, as are chemicals, pharmaceuticals, electronics and, certainly in Scotland, food and drink and high-quality textiles.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.5/3">We need a balanced economy. We should not have all our eggs in one basket, be that basket financial or anything else. My father, who was an engineer, believed that the only people who contributed to the economy were engineers and that I made a huge mistake by becoming an accountant. Be that as it may, I certainly agree that we should re-emphasise manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.5/4">Exports, imports and the exchange rate are clearly part of the manufacturing equation, but I wish to make a few comments about the exchange rate. I believe that it is not where we should put all our faith for meeting the challenges that lie ahead; it is not a panacea for all our ills. I agreed with the hon. Member for Great Grimsby when he said that the exchange rate is not a phallic symbol. However, it is a mark of the strength or weakness of other people's faith in our economy, and where the exchange rate is says something about the UK at present. We need balance on such issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.5/5">I find it strange that so few people have spoken out recently about the pound's lower level, because it is clearly making life difficult for many of our constituents. Anything they buy that has been brought in from overseas is more expensive, and many of our population nowadays expect to go on foreign holidays every so often, which also becomes much more expensive. There is a loss of well-being for our constituents as the exchange rate goes down.</p>

	<p pid="b.30.0/1">I have heard none of my constituents complaining at all about the depreciation of the pound. Many of them feel that their jobs are safer because we have a more competitive exchange rate, and they are pleased about the depreciation-and glad that we are not in the euro.</p>

	<p pid="b.30.1/1">Apart from the last point, in general I agree with the hon. Gentleman. However, as was correctly pointed out earlier, there must be a balance. I fear that it is a little simplistic to paint a lower exchange rate as all good. Yes, the exchange rate is a big part of the answer in the short term, but we need to look elsewhere in the long term.</p>

	<p pid="b.30.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, but does he not recognise that there is now a chance of manufacturing coming back to the UK because of where the pound is and because we are more competitive? We are seeing the results of that with inward investment coming back from Europe.</p>

	<p pid="b.30.3/1">Yes, I agree that there is certainly a short-term boost, and, from that point of view, it is welcome. I am not arguing against it, but my question is where we will be in 20, 50 or 100 years. Will we just keep on devaluing? Will that be our long-term answer, or will there be something else?</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/2">Clearly, wages and costs are higher here than in some other countries, so we find it difficult to compete. Part of the answer is higher-quality products, of which, from a Scottish point of view, whisky is a good example. We can produce something of a quality that we believe other countries cannot compete with, and people are willing to pay more for it. However, if we take shipbuilding, yes, perhaps we can build a slightly better ship than can be built in some other countries, but the cost difference is huge. Can the shipbuilding industry survive long term on Ministry of Defence orders? Can we ever again compete in shipbuilding in the world market?</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/3">As has already been touched on, some suggest that the answer is to cut our costs, that we should go down and down and try to meet other people's lowest costs. We hear from some quarters that we should get rid of the minimum wage, but I cannot agree that that is the answer. That seems to be the argument on pensions, too, which are obviously another cost. Some say that we have to get public sector pensions down, but that kind of answer and that kind of thinking just store up problems for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/4">Surely the other option in the seriously long term is that other countries' costs and standards have to rise. In my lifetime, there has been a huge change in countries such as South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. When I was a child, one expected from them cheap and poor products, which were often the subject of jokes. Clearly, that has changed: one now gets good-quality products from such countries and, more recently, from countries such as India and China. Producing good-quality, competitive products means that countries get a decent price for their products and employees' standard of living starts to rise. We have certainly seen that in countries such as South Korea. Just look at the tourists coming here now who would never have come in the past. Clearly, they have money to spend that they did not have before. To mention whisky again, there has been a huge boost for the whisky industry and the Scottish economy because we can now sell to countries such as India and China. We could never have sold such a product to them in the past.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/5">Fair trade-by that I mean small f and small t as well as capital F and capital T-must play a part in the equation in the long term. If we are trying to compete with workers in poorer countries, they must get a decent wage, which would help them and us. Only a few years ago, it was only tea and coffee that we would expect to get on fair trade, but this past Christmas I bought a decent quality, reasonably priced shirt for my brother and suddenly realised that it was a fair trade product, and that people were getting paid a decent price in some of those other countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/6">In the long run, part of going ahead will involve putting pressure on shops and importers to ensure that suppliers are paid a fair wage. If we buy something in this county, we should ask where it has been made. Has child labour been used? I would say that public opinion is with us on this and that we can move in that direction. I accept that we cannot do that immediately, but, sadly, I go into some shops and look at the price of some clothes and think, &quot;Who made these clothes? Has child labour been involved? What are the health and safety conditions?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/7">Surely, in the long term, fair trade has to be part of the answer. We should not try to stay elite compared with the rest of the world; instead, we should pull the rest of the world up with us. I accept that that is for the long term-it is not a short-term goal-but it has to be part of the equation that would boost our manufacturing and allow us to export more overseas.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.0/1">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> will not be surprised to hear that I agree with everything that he said. I have come along enthusiastically to support his excellent contribution this morning.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/2">I represent Luton, which was a large manufacturing town. I am pleased to say that it still has some manufacturing, but when I moved there 40 years ago, General Motors employed some 38,000 people in the conurbation. Now it employs fewer than 2,000, and we had difficulty saving the plant last year. We must express thanks to my noble Friend Lord Mandelson, the Business, Innovation and Skills Secretary, for helping to save Vauxhall. We still need to put in a new vehicle for beyond 2013, but at least we have saved it. That was about not only jobs and the local economy but local pride, which is important as well. My hon. Friend and others were right in saying that the Business Secretary has changed his view. I met him several times and have written to him at length several times pointing out that the debate is about not just Luton but about British manufacturing and saving manufacturing for the future as a basis for rebuilding and expanding it.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/3">My hon. Friend spoke about foreign ownership. It is significant that Cadbury is apparently about to be sold today to a foreign owner, which is regrettable. It is noticeable that other countries such as Germany are far more reluctant than we are to allow their companies to be sold overseas. One cannot imagine Germany sitting idly by while BMW was sold to Rover, but, because British Aerospace wanted a bit of pocket money, we let Rover go for a song to BMW and did nothing about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/4">While I have been a Member of Parliament, Luton has lost Electrolux, SKF is a tiny proportion of what it was, and many suppliers to the motor industry and other companies have lost jobs as well. We know that productivity has increased, that manufacturing is therefore much more capital-intensive and that there are fewer jobs in it, but the real evidence that we have a problem in manufacturing is, as my hon. Friend said, the trade deficit.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/5">In 2006, the trade deficit in goods was &#163;76 billion. It went up to &#163;89 billion in 2007, and to &#163;93 billion in 2008. It has started to come down since the depreciation, and is probably on track to be about &#163;80 billion this year-still a massive sum, but the trend is at least pointing in the right direction. Depreciation has clearly been important. Obviously, we have had the J-curve effect where things get slightly worse before they get better; nevertheless, we are on the right track. If anybody thinks that the European Union helps, some &#163;40 billion of that deficit is with the EU-not with poor or low-wage countries but with Germany. As I said in one intervention, something has gone right in Germany but not here.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.1/1">The hon. Gentleman knows what I am about to say. Does he accept that the &#163;40 billion or &#163;45 billion trade deficit with the EU blows apart the argument that is often made that, if we were to leave the EU, we would suffer the loss of jobs in this country? Quite the opposite would probably take place.</p>

	<p pid="b.33.0/1">There is a bigger debate to be had on that, but the hon. Gentleman is right. We are not advocating that. We are advocating our retaining our own currencies at an appropriate value so that we can at least have a breathing space to compete and invest in manufacturing and so that we can stand tall in future.</p>

	<p pid="b.33.1/1">To counter that Europe-bashing, may I give the example of Airbus in north Wales, which is a pan-European project involving France, Germany and Spain and 52,000 people, with 6,000 employed in north Wales alone? It is one of the most successful companies in the world and it has developed because of the co-operation within Europe.</p>

	<p pid="b.33.2/1">I accept that co-operation is important, but long before we were in the EU, we co-operated on Concorde.

Co-operation is nothing to do with the EU; it is to do with agreement between ourselves and other countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.33.4/1">My hon. Friend is right. The point about intervention was mentioned earlier. I believe that Governments should intervene to ensure that their economies work well. In relation to General Motors in Luton, the Business Secretary was prepared to intervene and put in some &#163;400 million to &#163;500 million to help out. The state aid rules from the EU are complete nonsense, because when it matters countries always intervene and rightly help their industries.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.4/2">Germany did so well because it was permitted for a long time to run a low value for the deutschmark and have a competitive edge. Chancellor Erhard, the author of the West German economic miracle-now the German economic miracle-made sure that that was there. I wrote a number of pieces on economics in the 1970s and '80s when I worked in the trade union movement. I once attended a meeting with the Anglo-German Foundation at which I mentioned the German trade surplus, but I was immediately shouted down by a German representative who was terrified that I would focus on the German trade surplus, because that is what it was about: even then we were running a substantial trade deficit with Germany.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.4/3">The Bretton Woods agreement, which built the post-war economy-it was a good idea and it was nonsense to throw it all away in the early 1970s-worked between 1945 and 1970: we had full employment and growth like we had never had before, rising living standards, growing equality, and all that. Keynes said that he wanted an arrangement where countries that were in deficit would be permitted or encouraged to devalue, but those in surplus would be encouraged or required to revalue. Had that been in place, Germany would have been required to revalue and we would not have had the imbalance between Germany and Britain, which otherwise are similar economies.</p>

	<p pid="b.33.5/1">Does my hon. Friend not accept that another lesson to be learned from Germany is how its corporate structures, and particularly its financial structures, enable and even encourage companies to take a long-term view on investment strategy so that they are not so vulnerable to short-term market vicissitudes as companies in this country?</p>

	<p pid="b.34.0/1">Absolutely. The German Government did not allow the financial sector to get away with murder, as we did in Britain. They encouraged collaboration between unions, management and Government to ensure that Germany plc worked. We have not done that; we have become true aficionados of the free market, and the free market with a strong currency has been disastrous for us. The Germans were not so silly. The west permitted Germany to do that because its great fear after the second world war was that communism would encroach from the east, and had it not ensured that Germany was a successful economy-a big showpiece for capitalism-there might have been slight problems there. Indeed, looking at the strength of the communist parties in Italy and France, people can see why the west was seriously worried and why western Europe, and Germany above all, had to be made to work. The same was true of Japan as well.</p>

	<p pid="b.34.2/2">Finally, on employment for young people, not six months ago <i>The Guardian</i> published an article showing that rising street violence, violent crime and crime in general correlates closely with the decline in manufacturing employment. When we had full employment, young men used to leave school on a Friday-at 15 in my youth and, later, at 16-and get a job at the local factory on the Monday, staying in work for the rest of their lives, earning a decent wage. They were able to settle down, marry and have children and become citizens. In those jobs they were socialised, became trade unionists, gained an understanding of politics and became proper citizens. That opportunity is now denied to millions of young people, particularly if they are lower skilled.</p>

	<p pid="b.34.5/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is not just timely-in fairness, it is one that my hon. Friend has been forcing on those who would listen over many years. He is right, however. One of the realities of the UK economy-progressively over recent decades-has been the substitution of our traditional manufacturing strength with undoubted strength in the service industries. Although that is not unwelcome, it has certain consequences for an economy such as ours, particularly since the geographical concentration of financial services has tended to be in one part of our island and because that sector does not have the reach of manufacturing. There are spatial as well as economic reasons why we need to look at the importance of manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.5/2">I am aware that others wish to speak, so I will try to make some concentrated remarks. On the point about the importance of training that was made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> in his exchange with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>, we still have one thing to do. We have come an awful long way in the years of this Labour Government with respect to how important intermediate skills training is-in other words, away from the concept that unless we get everybody through higher education, we are somehow failing our nation. In fact, it is rather the opposite: we need people who have high skills at different levels. That is why the reinvention of the apprenticeship, which was effectively dead in 1997, is so important.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.5/3">We are now reinvesting in a generation of people in respect of the kind of skills that manufacturing will need for the future, but I emphasise that we have a long way to go. Although we have taken those first steps, industry-the private sector-has a long way to go if it is to learn the lessons that it ought to absorb. There was an exchange earlier about the success of German manufacturing, one reality of which has been the commitment of German industry, particularly medium-sized and small firms, to training and their direct responsibility for it. We still have not properly established that in this country and we need to continue to get that message across.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.5/4">Although I do not expect that my hon. Friend the Minister will agree with me on this-publicly, at least-I still think that training levies need to be considered. There is a need to say to say to those who freeload in the training system that they can do that only if they are prepared to make a financial contribution to support those who are prepared to do the training. Good companies do train, but they often do so at their own expense and see others getting the benefits of that. We need to establish mechanisms whereby that process is more socially and economically efficient.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.5/5">On access to capital-this relates to a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby-the failure rate of start-up companies and new firms in low-tech or high-tech industries is high, particularly in manufacturing, because those firms often start off under-capitalised and struggle because of the difficulties of obtaining capital from our financial services industry. The financial services industry has not been efficient, and has not looked at the economy's needs, so I want to talk about the financial needs of high-tech companies.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.5/6">High-tech companies in the Manchester area have identified to me the significant capital gap, which arises partly because the financial system simply does not understand high technology, and does not know how to assess or take on board such risk. The Government should investigate intensively and quickly the sort of support that the financial system needs to assess risk in high-tech industry, or even take the more radical step of creating a publicly owned investor in high-tech companies, because there is a gap.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.5/7">A significant number of hon. Members in the Chamber do not come not from the golden triangle of Oxford, Cambridge and London. A high-tech company in my constituency told me anecdotally that a London-based banker with which it was engaged said that it would not obtain finance if it operated in Manchester, and asked why it did not move to Cambridge, Oxford or London. It is ridiculous to suggest that companies should move. It is socially divisive, and not acceptable to those in Manchester. I want the financial system to support the link between Manchester's good universities-this also applies elsewhere in the country-and the companies that they spawn so that the incubation process leads to successful commercial development. I urge the Minister to consider that.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.1/1">I also urge the Government and the Opposition parties-the Government probably do not need urging-to recognise the importance of the comments by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the International Monetary Fund, who said the other day that early withdrawal of Government intervention in our economy could be disastrous. If allowing that to happen could be disastrous generally, it could be specifically criminally insane for our manufacturing industry. I trust that, for the good of manufacturing, our economic policy recognises that intervention must continue until we are out of the recession.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.1/2">My final point almost replicates that made by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby. In a modern economy, we must consider how to help our manufacturers to export-and not just large companies. Many small and medium-sized companies will never be more than that, but they play an important role in our economy and still need help in accessing export markets. That has always been the case with our traditional export base in the EU and north America, but it is even more the case for those who want to export to China, Brazil and so on when there is lack of experience and confidence. I urge the Minister to examine what we should be doing to help those would-be exporters to obtain access to those markets, and to begin the process by recognising that growth in the world economy will be in China, Russia and Brazil, not in Germany and north America.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.4/1">I am the only member of the Select Committee on Business, Innovation and Skills in the Chamber. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has a great role to play in the future of manufacturing, which is why this debate is so important, and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> on setting out his case. We should be backing a buy British campaign. People in France buy nothing but French goods, and the same applies in Germany and other countries. Their procurement policies back their own manufacturing, and the sooner our Government engage in support through procurement, the better.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.4/2">The Minister rides around in a British-built car, but most Ministers ride around in Japanese-built cars with not one British component and involving not one British job-nothing is worse. Procurement is the first step, so let us start backing Britain and UK manufacturing. The car and truck industries are important, and the Government have done a lot to support car manufacturing. The car scrappage scheme was so successful that it should be extended-the sooner the better-because nothing would be lost by doing so. We have a great truck manufacturing industry in Leyland Trucks, which is part of DAF and PACCAR, an American company, but it is the last major truck manufacturer in the UK. I want more support for truck manufacturing because it is so important.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.4/3">We have talked about apprentices, but those people need real jobs. We do not want to fall into Thatcher's folly of YOP schemes-the youth opportunities programme-which were not the answer. If we are serious about apprenticeships, as I believe that the Government are, we must ensure that there is real manufacturing, as well as real jobs to back up those apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.4/4">British Aerospace has been touched on, as has Airbus, which is important in the north-west and Lancashire. We are the centre of cutting-edge technology for building aircraft. That is an important subject, and if the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen were to give Back Benchers an extra couple of minutes to speak, it would help the debate. I look for support from the Opposition spokesmen and from the Minister because some key points need to be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.4/5">British Aerospace in Lancashire is important, and more jobs could be created through the maintenance of heavy-lift aircraft for the RAF. That deep maintenance should be carried out in the north-west, which would protect jobs and extend our skills in British Aerospace.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.4/6">Any manufacturing base needs the ability to produce steel, and it is folly that we are considering the closure of plant on Teesside when we know that we are going ahead with the carriers and more ships for the Royal Navy. We will not have the ability to produce enough steel if we allow plants to close, and the Government must learn some lessons.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.4/7">Green technology is also important. We talk a lot and use fine words, but the proof is the delivery of jobs. There has been failure in the production of wind turbines by Vestas on the Isle of Wight, and we no longer produce anything for the future of green technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.4/8">We should not put UK companies up for sale-Cadbury has been mentioned-because that leads only to closures. Why are we not having a summit on UK jobs and manufacturing, or a conference to bring all the manufacturers and unions together to stand up for Britain, to create more jobs, and to give the UK a future? The regional development agencies are important in backing that up, and no one is more important than Steve Broomhead of the Northwest Regional Development Agency, which creates the jobs. I look to the Minister to provide even more support and to hold that business manufacturing conference here in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.38.0/1">In the two short minutes remaining, I hope to raise a few points from a north Wales perspective about how manufacturing has developed since the advent of this Labour Government, and to comment on some of the dividing lines between us and the previous Conservative Government. I have touched on European co-operation, which has enabled Airbus to flourish in north Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/2">In 1981, we had the biggest lay-off in British industrial history. In Shotton, 7,000 workers were laid off overnight by the Conservative Government. From those ashes, employment rose through Airbus and, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> rightly said, it arose through an interventionist policy by the Labour Government, because we believe in key intervention at key times. Launch aid of &#163;450 million was lent to Airbus-it has since been repaid-and that shows our belief in intervention. The public and private sectors co-operated to create 6,000 jobs at Airbus with 600 apprenticeships, some of them at degree and post-degree standard. That shows our belief in our young people, and why we have a target of getting 50 per cent. of young people into universities. That is not supported by the Conservative party, and it is another key dividing line.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.0/3">Another issue is European funding, which the Labour Government have claimed, but the previous Conservative Government did not. In my constituency, that funding has helped to fill the St. Asaph business park. It was built by the previous Conservative Government at a cost of &#163;11 million, but lay empty for 10 years. Under this Labour Government, however, it has been filled with 3,500 jobs. Such a thing has not happened only in that business park. According to an answer to a parliamentary question, we have seen such measures across north Wales, not just in my constituency. In the constituency of Caernarfon, the number of jobs has increased by 38 per cent. from 24,000 to 33,000. In Delyn, the increase since 1997 has been from 26,000 to 33,000, while in Ynys M&#244;n it has been from 23,000 to 30,000. The increase in Clwyd, West was from 26,000 to 34,000, and in my constituency there has been a 27 per cent. increase from 23,000 to 29,000 jobs over the past 10 years. That is living proof that interventionism, co-operation with Europe, and co-operation between the public and private sectors has helped manufacturing jobs in north Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.38.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> on securing the debate. Before I respond to him, however, I shall pick up on a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> about green industries, on which he was absolutely right. There is amazing potential in my part of the world for offshore wind and marine tidal energy, but there is a big danger that all the platforms will be made in Rotterdam, instead of in Nigg and all our constituencies, using the steel that we want in this country. If there is one thing that I have urged the Government to do-both the Department of Energy and Climate Change and BIS-it is to look at supply chain issues and ensure that we are capable of fulfilling what is needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/2">Having made that personal plea on behalf of my constituency, I will move back to the speech made by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. He made two overriding points in his opening remarks. The first was that manufacturing is strategic, and that we forget the strategic importance of manufacturing to UK industry at our peril. His second point was about the need to rebalance the economy away from such dependence on financial services. Interestingly, I came here from a sitting of the Treasury Committee, where Professor Goodhart and Professor Kay were having a solid argument about how that should be done. Everybody is agreed, however, that the days when the financial services industry dictated how the economy of the country should be run are over. We need a financial services industry, but it must be the servant of commerce and industry, not the master of speculation. The hon. Gentleman was right to raise that issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/3">There has been an interesting debate about the concept of the exchange rate, and there is no doubt that the exchange rate has been a tremendous boost to a number of manufacturers. I have previously cited in this Chamber a company in Invergordon called Kirker Europe, which makes nail varnish for most of Europe. Its biggest competitors are in China, but during this period of financial uncertainty, most of its customers have returned. They are ordering not simply on price grounds, but because of security of supply and the fact that Kirker Europe can deliver anywhere in Europe within three days, whereas goods would take five or six weeks to come from China. Therefore, in the debate about cost in Britain, it is worth remembering that there is more to value than simply cost. The United Kingdom offers many things in its manufacturing industries that make up components of that value, and although cost is important, we should not talk down all the other factors that we have going for us.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/4">This is the fourth debate on manufacturing in which I have spoken over as many months, and it is fascinating to note that each Member who secures such a debate addresses the subject from a slightly different angle. The central thrust is the importance of manufacturing and what we need to do about it, but many hon. Members have come at that from different directions. It is right to continue to raise the subject, however, as it is one of the most critical issues for our future. One hon. Member-I am not quite sure who-said that perhaps by having such debates on a repeated basis, we will get across to those concerned just how important the issue is.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/5">I attended a business breakfast in the House last week that was chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase>, who chairs the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee. It was the launch of RBS's &#163;1 billion loan fund for manufacturing. One of the most important points raised at the meeting was that we always talk a great deal about manufacturing when there is a recession, but forget about it as soon as the recession is over. If there is one lesson that I would like whoever next sits behind the desk of the &quot;Lord High Great Grand-everything&quot; to learn, it is that we should not forget. We need to learn that lesson this time round in a big way.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/6">The hon. Member for Great Grimsby said that RBS was the bank involved with the bed manufacturer that he mentioned. RBS has launched a fund of &#163;1 billion of secure money for manufacturing, and it has asked for MPs from all parties to let it know of companies that the money could help-I am dutifully passing on the message.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/7">The other point made at the breakfast was that although we are good at talking ourselves down, a great British characteristic is that we do not talk up what we do well. Let me repeat what I have said before about the importance of manufacturing. We have the sixth largest manufacturing industry in the world, which accounted for more than &#163;150 billion in 2008. Depending on whose figures we believe, between 2.7 million and 3 million people are employed in it. There has been growth in real terms, but it is right to say that there has been a decline in relative terms, for which there are a number of reasons. I believe that manufacturing is a success story for Britain and an opportunity for the future. Anyone aspiring to be in government must recognise that opportunity and undertake to support it.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/8">There are three key drivers that will take forward all industry, particularly the manufacturing industry. First, without a stable financial system, we will not have an economy that can grow. Getting the banking system right-I happen to be in favour of narrow banking-is an absolute prerequisite. More than that, we must learn one of the critical lessons that has come out of the financial crisis: we cannot rely nearly so much on debt as part of the finance mix. More equity must be available, but it must be available across the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/9">At the top end, the listed companies have not had any great problems in restructuring their balance sheets. They have been able to go to the markets and acquire more equity, now that that is in vogue, and the analysts are not asking them to sweat those balance sheets. However, that is a much more difficult proposition for early stage companies, small and medium-sized enterprises, and regional firms. For that reason, it is important that we put mechanisms in place to allow people with individual net worth who would like to invest in companies in their area to do so. I have put forward some ideas, one of which is a local enterprise fund. That is about not Government money, but creating a mechanism to connect the investor with the company. However, I do not have enough time to go into detail about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/10">The second vital area is getting our skills base right. The last time I spoke in the House on manufacturing was on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-02">2 December</phrase>. The previous day, I had attended a reception by Engineering UK, which had put across the scale of its problem. It estimates that we will need 587,000 more engineers by 2017-roughly 80,000 a year. On the other side of the skills equation, however, we are losing 30 per cent. of our further education lecturers, because they are retiring and not being replaced, and there is a 17 per cent. drop in the number of students. That is a major problem and I would like a form of bursary support for those in engineering and science to ensure that the right number of graduates come through.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">The hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> spoke about apprenticeships-I could not agree with him more. I regret the day that the hotel and catering training levy board was taken away. I argued against that closure from the day it happened, and I will carry on with that argument for as long as I can.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/12">My last point is about innovation. We are very good at innovation in this country. We do it well in the lab and in companies-we even do it quite well in the garden shed-but what we do not do is commercialise, and we need to work to be able to get to the stage at which innovations that start in this country are commercialised in this country, rather than ending up being commercialised overseas.</p>
	<p pid="b.38.1/13">It is essential that we learn the lessons of the recent past and apply them wisely for the future. The greatest lesson that we need to learn is that manufacturing is strategically important, and woe betide any Government who do not understand and support that.</p>

I shall refrain from opining for too long on the weak pound, other than to say that it reflects our weak economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/2">The year 2009 was traumatic for many UK manufacturers. Investment in businesses dried up, production was down as demand in many sectors froze, and productivity weakened to the extent that hundreds of businesses were forced to close. The facts are that under Labour, since 1997, 10 per cent. of manufacturing businesses have closed and more than 1.5 million manufacturing jobs have been lost. Following the pre-Budget report in November 2008, the Government introduced a number of schemes designed to support businesses through the recession, but more than a year on from the announcement of those mainly loan guarantee schemes, a great cause for concern is the lack of progress from the Government's approach to the challenges facing the UK manufacturing industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/3">The Government were asked to support our industry-an industry that has lost 280,000 members of its work force in the past year alone. Businesses across the UK have experienced, and still are experiencing, acute shortages of finance and working capital, which the Government declared their intention to ease.</p>

	<p pid="b.41.2/1">Will the hon. Gentleman give the figures for the previous recession-the Conservative recession? How many manufacturing jobs were lost at the same point in that cycle? In north Wales 10 years ago, in the last recession, 29,000 people were unemployed; now, it is 14,000 people.</p>

	<p pid="b.41.3/1">It is not a question of bandying around statistics. I am simply saying what the situation is at the moment. What we hear from businesses today is that the Government designed their multitude of schemes in such a complicated and confusing fashion that third parties, initially including banks, often did not understand how to operate them or which one to operate. Indeed, it was not always clear on what terms support was being offered to business.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/2">It is telling that the trade credit insurance scheme was quietly shelved by the Government in the most recent pre-Budget report. Announced in the 2009 Budget, the scheme was originally intended to provide up to &#163;5 billion in the form of top-up insurance guarantees to help firms whose credit insurance cover had been reduced. Out of that &#163;5 billion, which was ring-fenced, just &#163;18 million of cover was provided, to just 72 businesses. A similar pattern can be seen with the Government's now withdrawn working capital scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.3/3">Even if a business was eligible for a scheme, it often elected not to take part, either because it did not understand the workings of the scheme or because it felt that it could get a better deal on the open market. Indeed, one gets the impression that many of the schemes were more about Government press releases than about delivering any real relief and support to UK manufacturing.</p>

	<p pid="b.42.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to consider the relationship between Government and manufacturing, but I wonder, in that context and in the context specifically of discussions about policies of this Government and the alternative Government, what he makes of the comments of Jeegar Kakkad, the senior economist at the Engineering Employers Federation, which is not normally a supporter of this Government. He said of the Conservative party's plans:</p>
	<p pid="b.42.0/2" class="indent">&quot;Reducing the level of capital allowances would be a big problem for manufacturers...cutting the rate to 12.5 per cent. would be a disaster&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.0/3">Is he right?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.42.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1649" speakername="Jonathan Djanogly" colnum="42"  time="012:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0007.htm#10011948000549">
	<p pid="b.42.1/1">Well, if one looks at capital allowance alone, but of course one has to look at it in the context of our overall plans for taxation, which are to reduce the burden.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.1/2">Conservatives believe that manufacturing should be at the heart of the economy if the UK is to achieve sustainable economic growth. Even given its current challenges, the UK still has the sixth largest manufacturing economy in the world. Manufacturing still produces more than half the UK's exports and still constitutes more than 12 per cent. of our gross domestic product. The firms that emerge from the recession will be stronger and leaner for the experience and will be a key factor in UK economic growth. Conservatives want to support such firms. Rather than burdening UK business with more burdensome red tape and complex regulatory schemes as the Government have done, a Conservative Government would provide simple practical solutions to help UK manufacturing businesses to recover from the economic crisis.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.1/3">Last October, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1924" name="John Penrose">the Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose)</phrase> published a paper setting out the Conservative vision entitled &quot;Regulation In The Post-Bureaucratic Age&quot;. It outlined how excessive red tape and the innumerable quangos established by the Government have undermined the UK's economic competitiveness and left business drowning in red tape. By sweeping away the Government's ineffective system of bureaucracy, a Conservative Government will reform the approach to regulation, thereby allowing policy goals to be achieved in a less burdensome and less intrusive way.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.1/4">The British Chambers of Commerce has warned that the burden of taxes and regulation on business under this Government is set to reach &#163;25.6 billion over the next four years. Only today, the director general of the BCC commented:</p>
	<p pid="b.42.1/5" class="indent">&quot;The cost of employing people must be reduced if future governments are serious about giving businesses the freedom to create jobs and drive our economic recovery.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.42.1/6">It is clear to Conservatives that this country needs urgent cuts in the regulation and red tape suffocating our industry and business. For example, under a Conservative Government, regulatory impact assessments will be followed up, three to five years after legislative changes, to ensure that any new regulation is not having a negative impact on UK business. A new Star Chamber Cabinet Committee would enforce a strict one-in, one-out policy on regulation, providing that any new laws must be associated with cuts in old laws, with a target of reducing the net regulatory burden by 5 per cent. Additionally, sunset clauses will be applied to regulations to ensure that their necessity is reviewed. Furthermore, during the first term of a Conservative Government, all regulators will be reassessed and their duties reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.1/7">A prime concern of a Conservative Government would be to cut back the overwhelming amount of regulation facing employers in UK business. A good example is the Labour Government's attempt to suffocate the temporary agency worker market with their rushed proposals relating to the agency workers directive. Such is the red tape and bureaucracy attached to employment laws, albeit with the aim of protecting workers, that ironically many UK businesses are telling us that they do not even want to hire people any more. A Conservative Government would seek to roll back much of that redundant and counter-productive gold-plating of European legislation, with the intention of getting businesses employing people again.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.1/8">To stimulate further growth, Conservatives aim to cut the rate of corporation tax from 28 to 25 per cent. and the small companies rate from 22 to 20 per cent., so that businesses have a chance to get back on their feet. We also want to reverse Labour's job-destroying increases in national insurance. A Conservative Government would further embark on a formal process of tax simplification to make it significantly easier for businesses to predict, calculate and pay their taxes. During the recession, Conservatives would have continued to press for the establishment of a straightforward and easy-to-use &#163;50 billion national loan guarantee scheme that would directly underwrite lending from the banks to viable British businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.1/9">Conservatives are committed to taking rigorous action to tackle unemployment and help with the reskilling of the work force as part of our &quot;Get Britain Working&quot; plan. The &quot;Work Programme&quot; campaign-a new integrated welfare-to-work initiative-is based on four supplementary programmes. First, the &quot;Work for Yourself&quot; initiative would offer business mentors and other opportunities to would-be entrepreneurs and is designed to encourage people into self-employment. Secondly, the &quot;Work Together&quot; project connects people to volunteering opportunities in their area and will allow people to develop their skills in new areas of business. Thirdly, there will be work clubs-places for people to receive mentoring, skills training and help in finding local job opportunities. Fourthly, the &quot;Youth Action for Work&quot; campaign will provide a huge number of additional apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.1/10">The Conservative party has set a target for the United Kingdom to overtake Germany and become Europe's leading exporter of high-tech products. To fulfil that goal, we need a long-term strategy based on increased investment in talent, technological innovation and raising the nation's skill base. That is why Sir James Dyson is leading a Conservative taskforce to set out a clear vision for boosting high-tech production in Britain. We are confident that by harnessing our resources, a Conservative Government could generate a major expansion of high-tech product development and renewable energy, address the capital gap and create real sustainable growth in the UK economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.1/1">Rather than hitting out at individuals, we should look at the reason why British manufacturers are moving their jobs overseas-that is what the next Conservative Government will do.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.1/2">Manufacturing has an important future in the UK. It has doubtless faced a testing period, which has stretched the resources of many businesses to breaking point, but a Conservative Government will offer the hope of change and renewal. Only Conservatives can now give business access to the finance that it needs to grow and the skilled work force that it needs to compete with the best on the global stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.2/1">It is a pleasure to appear before you, Miss Begg. I am grateful to all hon. Members who have contributed to the debate, but I am particularly grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1649" name="Jonathan Djanogly">the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly)</phrase>, who gave us an illuminating outline of Conservative policy towards industry. Of course, hon. Members on both sides of the House have experienced that policy before, and we do not need a crystal ball to know what it would be, because we have read the book. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1894" name="Chris Ruane">the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane)</phrase> said, the book included 7,000 redundancies at Shotton in the early 1980s, and there were more than 1,000 redundancies in the steel industry at Brymbo, just outside my constituency, in the early 1990s. That is the history of the Conservative approach to manufacturing.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.3/1">Will my hon. Friend give way?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.44.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1947" speakername="Ian Lucas" colnum="44"  time="012:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0007.htm#10011948000554">
	<p pid="b.44.4/1">I will have to proceed very quickly because of all the contributions that have been made, so I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me if I do not.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/2">As we have heard, the Government take an active approach on supporting manufacturing, which contrasts markedly with the approach that the hon. Member for Huntingdon has just outlined. There may be differences among Labour Members, but it is noteworthy that seven Back-Bench Labour MPs have contributed in a disciplined manner to the debate. We have also had positive contributions from the hon. Members for Glasgow, East (John Mason) and for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso). I contrast that with the approach that the Conservative party appears to take.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/3">The Government believe in an active industrial strategy, which was set out in the &quot;New Industry, New Jobs&quot; document and outlined more recently in Lord Mandelson's speech on growth, which I commend to all hon. Members, if they have not read it already. The Government are strongly committed to promoting growth, which will be an intrinsic part of reducing the deficit over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/4">The Government not only talk about action, but invest in industry. We have heard about the launch investment given to Airbus, which represents a &#163;340 million investment in the aerospace industry, in which we are the second most powerful manufacturer behind the United States. We have also heard about the car scrappage scheme, which provides support for our automotive sector. Conservative Members did not oppose it, despite the fact that they consistently opposed other such investment on the Floor of the House. When we said that we needed to invest in the economy to support it, the Conservative party did all that it could to oppose us at every stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/5">Similarly, the construction industry has been supported and sustained through a difficult recession over the past year by the &#163;3 billion of public investment that the Government put in. The Conservative party opposed that investment. The loss of jobs had that policy not been pursued would have had a profound effect on all our communities. That is the difference between our parties' approaches to manufacturing, and it can be seen in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/6">No one will doubt my commitment to manufacturing. I have been in the House for nine years talking on behalf of a manufacturing constituency, and my father worked in manufacturing for more than 40 years. In my current role, I am hugely encouraged by the fact that I meet individuals in British manufacturing who believe that we have a great future built on innovation and partnership. In the automotive sector, the Government have just set up the Automotive Council so that we can-I say this to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase>-develop supply chains and ensure that smaller businesses benefit as prime companies produce world-beating products.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/7">In that respect, I had the pleasure of going to see the Mini plant in the constituency of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase>. BMW came to the UK to invest and it has made a fantastic job of taking a totemic British product out to the world and developing hugely impressive facilities. It has worked in partnership with the trade unions, been supported by them and produced a world-beating product. We therefore have world-beating products in aerospace and the automotive sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/8">The UK is an innovative country. We have a great fund of ideas and we are determined to seize the opportunities that lie ahead in the manufacturing sector. The Government strongly believe that the future lies in a low-carbon manufacturing strategy, which will involve exploiting opportunities in the UK. We have heard the sad story of Vestas on the Isle of Wight, and I am afraid that many members of the Liberal Democrat party have opposed the development of onshore wind turbines, which has led to the diminution of the UK market and not helped the development of the industry. The Government are working hard on the development of offshore wind capability, which will also provide an opportunity for the steel and cable sectors. Indeed, I visited a cable company in Ely that was supplying a wave project off the shores of Cornwall. We need to tell business that that type of project and opportunity will be available over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/9">We are talking about not only a domestic opportunity, but an exporting opportunity for industry. Although the disappointments at Copenhagen raise difficult issues, we know that we have a low-carbon future, and that is true not only in the UK, but outside it. We have heard reference to the exchange rate, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> not only for initiating this important and informative debate, but for his views on devaluation. He gave us an interesting resum&#233; of devaluation policy and political history over the past 50 years, which I enjoyed very much. The exchange rate now gives us an exporting opportunity. We have the ideas and we are an innovative country; indeed, we were the first industrial nation and we have a proud history of innovation, thanks to James Watt, George Stephenson and the rest. We have ideas that are being put into practice now.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/10">I was interested in what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> said about Manchester university and the work that needs to be done to develop finance. The innovation investment fund has been set up to support businesses in all parts of the country working with universities to develop innovative products. In my role, I have been fortunate enough to see some tremendous products, which will become world-beating products in due course. We need to support businesses to export such products, and my good friend Lord Mervyn Davies is working hard with UK Trade &amp; Investment to develop the UK's exporting potential.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/11">I am short of time, but I want to touch briefly on training and skills. We have heard a lot about Germany, and we need to emphasise the importance of the apprentice and technician class there. That is something that we want to develop strongly in the UK, and we are making increasing use of apprenticeships. We need to get into schools to indicate the importance of the industrial sector. Yesterday, I heard of a project being developed by Nissan, which will see 2,500 schoolchildren go into its factory in Sunderland to find out how exciting the manufacturing industry is and how exciting careers in industry are.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/12">When I talk to many of the leaders of UK manufacturing companies, many of whom were apprentices themselves years ago, they tell me that they are committed to carrying forward the message that manufacturing in the UK has a great future, that we need to work to improve the proportion of the economy that is based on manufacturing and that the rebalancing that is taking place in the economy gives us an opportunity to ensure that Britain manufactures better than anyone else in the world.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.47.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="47"  time="012:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0008.htm#10011948000555">
	<p pid="b.47.1/1">Miss Begg, may I tell you that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> would also like to make a brief contribution to the debate, as the matter affects both our constituencies? The Minister's office will, if it has done its homework, have spotted from past debates that the matter was first raised by the two Members of Parliament for the constituencies in the London borough of Sutton as long ago as May 2001, when the Minister was Estelle Morris, who subsequently became Secretary of State for Education and Skills and is now in another place. The Minister may not feel that our arguments have any validity, but he must at least acknowledge that they have been consistent over the past nine years. Nine years after that debate, the issues are just as pertinent.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/2">Sutton has outstanding schools. That is in no doubt. I checked the Times Online website yesterday and several Sutton schools-Nonsuch, Wilson's and Sutton grammar-appear high on its list of high-performing schools. Also, interestingly, Stanley Park high school, one of our local comprehensive schools, has recently been identified as one of the top 10 fastest improving schools in England, which is a tribute to the excellent work of the head teacher, governors, teachers and pupils. We have a very good range of schools in the borough and their strength has made Sutton a victim of its own success.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/3">Anecdotally, if the Minister wanted to come to Sutton, he could see children from all over London and the south-east piling off trains at Carshalton and other local stations, to go to schools in the borough. The statistics on children educated in the London borough of Sutton who come from other boroughs or counties show that in some selective schools, just a quarter of the year 7 intake comes from within the borough, with three quarters coming from outside of borough. In others, the ratio is slightly lower, but still perhaps one third come from within the borough, and two thirds from outside. By contrast, many of the comprehensives take, as one would expect, a significant percentage of their pupils-close to 100 per cent.-from within the borough. If those figures are averaged out across the borough's secondary schools, the ratio shows that roughly two thirds of pupils in our schools are from within the borough and one third are from outside it. That, again, is a reflection of the very strong performance of Sutton's schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/4">When we have argued in the Chamber for changes to the system, which would give Sutton pupils greater priority in Sutton schools, the Government have said that we are arguing for the removal of choice. In the debate held nine years ago, the Minister responsible spoke about asking</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/5" class="indent">&quot;a Government to change a system where we are doing what we can to give as many parents their first choice of school, regardless of where they live&quot;.-[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2001-05-02.294"><i>Official Report, </i>2 May 2001; Vol. 367, c. 294WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/6">Unfortunately, her argument does not stack up. In Sutton, there is limited choice, if any, for most pupils, for the simple reason that the pupils with choice are either those who score a very high result-not just a pass-in the 11-plus or its equivalent, or those, clearly, whose parents can afford to pay for private education.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/7">Apart from those two categories, for the overwhelming majority of parents and pupils in Sutton, the only choice, if they are lucky, comes from their happening to live close to a comprehensive school. If they do not-the schools are located in such a way that they may not, if they live in certain parts of the borough-they may have no choice, or none of a school in the borough. Thus parents who live literally across the road from a very good local school, to which they are keen to send their children, are told, &quot;I'm sorry; we can't give you a place there, but we have identified a place in a Croydon or Kingston school&quot;-although, incidentally, parents who live in the vicinity of those schools have voted with their feet to take their children elsewhere. The borough therefore has to tell parents, &quot;We can offer you a school that is far from where you live, and one to which ideally you would not want to send your child.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/8">The principal factors in play are the Greenwich judgment and selection. In relation to the Greenwich judgment, I understand the Government's argument-I think it is a strong one-that if a school is located close to a boundary with another borough it does not necessarily make sense to say that the borough in which the school is located should have exclusive rights over places. I acknowledge that, but equally it is not right that the borough should, as in the example I just gave, have to tell parents that although they are Sutton council tax payers they cannot be offered a place in a Sutton school. That is just as ludicrous as a pupil who lives across in the road in, say, Merton, being unable to go to the school in Sutton. That issue needs to be addressed, and perhaps more flexibility could be shown on the operation of the Greenwich judgment to allow Sutton at least to be able to make parents an offer of a school place in the borough.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/9">The second issue is selection. As I have acknowledged, some schools in Sutton are among the highest achieving in the country academically, because their admissions are based on selection. I think that the decision about whether schools should operate selectively should be taken locally by councillors, but there are ways in which those schools could tweak their admission procedures to allow entry to more pupils from the borough. For instance, a system that would still require children to pass the 11-plus or its equivalent, without requiring them to get 98 per cent. in the exam, could be a way of ensuring greater representation of local children in local schools. It is disappointing that the schools adjudicator did not support the borough when it deployed that argument. A further issue concerns faith schools. One of Sutton's faith schools uses a very tight definition of Christianity, and if it were to be slightly more flexible about its focus on Catholic religion, rather than Christianity, it might allow more local pupils to get in. Selection and the Greenwich judgment have affected the borough significantly. We can change those things slightly to improve the probability that Sutton schools will be for Sutton pupils, and to make that a reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/10">I have one further point to make, which I have not mentioned to the Minister-unless my office managed to get the message through to him-about something that was confirmed for me on Friday about the new Stanley Park high school. I was informed a couple of months ago that it was proceeding full steam ahead. The school will be built with Building Schools for the Future funding. I was told that the primary care trust and the local authority had agreed the sale of the land; the PCT land was to be sold to the borough. A couple of months ago, I was assured that the problem was resolved, but I understand from my meeting on Friday that it is not.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/11">If the Minister is to take one thing away from this debate, I hope that he will talk to whichever Health Minister has responsibility for oversight of the primary care trust and ask him to say to the PCT, &quot;We need you to make a decision on this, because the future of a new school built with Building Schools for the Future funding depends on you releasing that land.&quot; That has to happen promptly if the school is to open in September 2011. I hope that the Minister will ensure that the subject is raised elsewhere. We need an answer, because I want to see that school opening its doors in September 2011. I am sure that the Minister-he is an Education Minister-would also like to see that happen.</p>

	<p pid="b.49.0/2">I first referred to the question of school admissions policy in my maiden speech in 1997. The matter has been raised many times in one way or another, and I am sure that that will continue. At its heart, the debate is about what is fair. It is about how to ensure a fair system for allocating school places and for allocating resources to ensure that everyone who wants a place gets one.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/3">Arrangements for secondary school places in Sutton are complex. Competition for places is incredibly fierce, because the schools are popular, not least because we have a mixed economy of comprehensive and selective schools in Sutton, all of which are successful. Changes to admission rules, particularly by selective schools, are altering the character of the schools' intakes. They are changing from local schools into regional or sub-regional schools. As a result, even bright children in Sutton struggle to secure places, and coaching is seen as an essential investment. Coaching, which is paid for privately, is a great way of excluding many of those who cannot afford to pay for it. That is now happening in Sutton. Those who can afford it can buy the coaching and bump up the chances of their child getting a place.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/4">A straight count of high school places in the borough suggests, on paper, that there is no problem. However, that is not the reality experienced by those of my constituents who live in Worcester Park. They live on the edge of the borough, and it seems that they do not benefit from the Greenwich judgment, because there are no schools in the vicinity on the other side of the border. It is for that reason that I strongly support my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/5">We need legislation that will bring some flexibility, allowing admission authorities to prioritise places for children resident in the borough-if necessary, by clarifying or, in my view, by overturning the Greenwich judgment. We also need a strengthening of the role of the school admissions forums. In my experience, they are tied down too much by vested interests. They need to be genuinely of and for the interests of parents and the borough, and they should speak first and foremost for those interests.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/6">Last week, my hon. Friend and I met the Minister for Schools and Learners, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase>. I suspect that the Minister knows about it, as we were making a case for additional funding to support the schools' and Sutton council's efforts to deal with the rapid and rather unexpected rise in demand for school places, which has occurred as a result of a 29 per cent. increase in the birth rate between 2001 and 2008. That increase is not spread evenly across the borough, but is concentrated in Worcester Park and certain parts of central Sutton. For various reasons, a higher proportion of parents are electing to send their children to local state primary schools. The combination of a higher birth rate and a higher number electing to go to local state primary schools is causing pressure.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/7">We welcome the fact that the Government have set up the basic need safety-valve fund to help to deal with that pressure, but we are sad that Sutton was not successful. However, &#163;30 million is still left in the fund, and between &#163;2 million and &#163;3 million would enable Sutton to plan to provide not only additional classroom accommodation but the essential space for staff and children to meet the Government's standards and avoid the risk of schools being cramped and overcrowded.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/8">I hope, Miss Begg, that you and other hon. Members will understand that I shall have to depart shortly, because St. Dunstan's Church of England primary school is visiting the House today with its head teacher, Mrs. Christine Smyth. Earlier, I took the school on a rather inadequate tour, but I hope that everyone found it useful. It is one of those Church of England schools that operates a generous and fair admissions policy. I have not been told to say that; it is true. I shall soon be given a rough grilling by the pupils. I look forward to reading and discussing with my hon. Friend the Minister's response to the debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.50.0/1">It is good to serve under your chairmanship again, Miss Begg. May I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> on securing this debate? He said that he has mentioned the subject in the House a number of times. He is right that it is an important matter; it is about the provision of good, fair and quality schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/2">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the matter today. As a long-standing Member, I am sure that he will agree that, thanks to unprecedented and sustained rises in investment from this Government, and the huge amount of work undertaken by teachers, governors, parents and pupils, the quality of learning in Sutton's schools is higher than ever.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/3">Education spend per pupil has increased by 34 per cent. An extra &#163;1,160 is being spent on each pupil. That spending has helped to fund a rise in the number of teachers from 1,390 in 1997 to 1,850 last year, and a massive jump in the number of teaching assistants from 160 in 1997 to 560 last year.</p>

	<p pid="b.50.1/1">I agree-praise where praise is due-that there has been a substantial and welcome increase in investment, which is why I am absolutely desperate that the investment that the Government, to our satisfaction, have already agreed to provide in relation to the new Stanley Park high school is allowed to proceed, and that the primary care trust does not get in the way of that. I ask the Minister to pursue that point.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.51.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="51"  time="012:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0008.htm#10011948000559">
	<p pid="b.51.0/1">I acknowledge what the hon. Gentleman says. I was not aware of the problems at Stanley Park. I pledge to take the matter away and to write to him as soon as possible. He will be aware that local authorities and primary care trusts are autonomous. However, by working in partnership, a good solution can be found that is in the interest of all.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/2">I turn to the importance of capital; the hon. Gentleman will understand that it provides investment in buildings and facilities. He will know better than I do that in 1997, capital spending on Sutton's schools was &#163;4 million. Last year, it was &#163;20 million. I realise that he will want me to address the specific concerns that he rightly raised today, but it is worth acknowledging that in the last dozen years, thanks to Government money, Sutton has built three new schools and substantially rebuilt a further six. It has added 169 classrooms and 61 science labs, and has improved sports facilities and modernised kitchens at a further 11 schools. Not only are Sutton's children and young people benefiting from higher standards of teaching, but they are being taught in modern, world-class and fit-for-purpose buildings and facilities. I hope that he does not mind my mentioning those matters, but it is important to put things in context, given the real success that has taken place over the past 12 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/3">The hon. Gentleman raised several concerns. I have dealt with Stanley Park, and have pledged to write to him on that subject. His central theme, however, was the provision of fair and accessible places for his constituents and their children in his constituency, and the question of out-of-borough students attending Sutton schools. He will know that local authorities have a responsibility to ensure fair access to educational opportunity. Councils are in the driving seat to ensure fair access for students. He will also know that maintained schools and academies, as well as local authorities, admission forums and school adjudicators, are all expected to act in accordance with the school admissions code and associated legislation. The Government have provided a strong framework for admissions authorities, so that they can set fair arrangements that support equity of access.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/4">Each school has an admissions authority to set its admission arrangements and decide which children will be offered places-for a community or voluntary-controlled school, it is the local authority; for a foundation or voluntary-aided school, it is the school's governing body. Grammar schools can lower their testing pass mark to help to accommodate some of the hon. Gentleman's concerns, or they can set a percentage to allow more pupils from the local area to be admitted.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/5">It is important to stress that admissions authorities can operate any admission arrangements they choose, as long as they comply with admissions legislation and the school admissions code. As part of the consultation process, local admissions forums have a duty to look at admission arrangements in their area to ensure that they are fair, and that they do not affect fair access. Such a duty directly addresses the hon. Gentleman's concerns about out-of-borough arrangements. With the greatest respect to him, I suggest that he contact the London borough of Sutton, which is controlled by his own party, to ask it what plans it has to address the problems that have arisen from the Greenwich judgment, and how it will ensure that there is fair access and provision for his constituents' children in schools in the borough.</p>

	<p pid="b.52.0/1">I have a regular ongoing dialogue with my local authority. As the Minister is well aware, there are many issues over which the local authority has no control, including those arising from the Greenwich judgment and from the admissions policies operated by some schools in our borough. He has talked about the responsibility of operating a fair admissions process, so it is incumbent on him to respond to the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase>, who said that children are being tutored, often at great expense, to ensure that they get into some of the schools. Therefore, a fair admissions process is not operating. In many cases, a process based on how much people earn is what is operating.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.52.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="52"  time="012:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0009.htm#10011948000561">
	<p pid="b.52.1/1">Like many hon. Members, I came into politics because I believe in equality of opportunity. Along with other matters with which the state should help, the provision of excellent high-quality education for all regardless of ability to pay is a core belief that should be at the very heart of education policy. Regardless of where someone lives, who their parents are, or whether they can pay, every pupil in this country should have access to world-class educational excellence. That is what the Government have been trying to do since 1997. They have achieved a lot, but much more still needs to be done. Achieving that access is, quite rightly, the aim and objective of their education policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/2">The local provision of school places is the duty of the local authority as the strategic commissioner of school places. It is down to the local authority to ensure that there are sufficient school places in the area, and that that provision is related to need. The Children, Schools and Families Bill, which is currently in Committee, will introduce a new duty on local authorities requiring them to run an annual survey of parents alongside the admissions round. The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> will be particularly interested in that provision. The survey will seek parents' views on the range and quality of secondary school provision in their area. Where there is &quot;material parental dissatisfaction&quot;, the local authority will have to undertake a review, and publish a response plan detailing how they will address parents' concerns. The hon. Gentleman talks about dissatisfaction with the fact that out-of-borough children are coming in and taking school places. That is an issue that must be addressed by the local authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.52.2/1">I thank the Minister for giving away again; he is very generous. He must acknowledge that the survey may well identify the fact that parents are dissatisfied because their child cannot get into the school of their choice, but the local authority can do precisely nothing about it because of how the Greenwich judgment operates and how the admissions policy operates for some schools. What will the local authority do when that annual survey says that parents are dissatisfied?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.53.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="53"  time="012:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0009.htm#10011948000563">
	<p pid="b.53.0/1">Let me surmise here, because I do not want to prejudge the passing of legislation in this House and the other place or what Sutton constituents might say regarding the survey. Let us examine the scenario in which there was material parental dissatisfaction. The local authority would have to publish a response, saying how it would directly address parents' concerns. If a significant proportion of parents felt that the plan did not address the issues that they had raised-it may be that they could not get their child into a school of their choice-the local authority would be required to refer the plan to the schools adjudicator for a determination. I am confident that the measures that are under scrutiny in the House, and the powers, duties and framework that have been outlined, will help to address the hon. Gentleman's concerns and show him that local authorities, and in his case, the London borough of Sutton, have considerable autonomy to consider fair access for pupils in their area.</p>

	<p pid="b.53.1/1">The Minister has now confirmed that if the local authority fails to satisfy parents, the matter will be referred to the schools adjudicator, but it was the schools adjudicator who found that schools should be allowed to take an increasing number of pupils from out of borough. It is unclear how they will be able to respond to parents who are complaining in large numbers that they cannot get their children into a local school because they have already said that it is fine for schools to take many more pupils from out of borough.</p>

	<p pid="b.53.2/1">The difficulty is that the schools adjudicator is an independent arbiter of the situation. They will consider the situation in an open, transparent and independent way and come to a decision. It is not for me as a Minister or the hon. Gentleman as a Member of Parliament to say, &quot;I am sorry, but I do not agree with the schools adjudicator's decision.&quot; The system has been put in place to have that open, transparent and independent decision about what is fair and accessible in the provision of school places in that particular London borough.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.2/2">With local authorities in the driving seat, we can ensure that there is suitable, excellent provision of primary and secondary places in the borough, and which takes into account concerns or nuances of a particular area, such as the high proportion of places going to out-of-borough pupils. Working in partnership and collaboration with schools, colleges and other providers, they will ensure that there is excellent provision. If parents are unhappy or dissatisfied with the provisions that are in place, the mechanism that I have identified will allow an independent authority to look at the matter and decide what is appropriate. That is a suitable framework, and it will be further strengthened by the provisions in the Bill that is before the House. I hope-but I do not think that I am right in this-that the hon. Gentleman will welcome the plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.2/3">I welcome the matters that the hon. Gentleman has raised. With regard to Stanley Park, I promise that I will take the issue away and look at it, and write to him shortly. The whole point of my response has been to stress that it is for local authorities and schools to decide their own admissions criteria. The hon. Gentleman quite rightly said that local people know best what is needed in their areas. Local authorities and schools, working with parents, are the experts in their local area. It is up to them to decide whether to accept pupils from other boroughs.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.2/4">Let me thank the hon. Gentleman for bringing the matter to the House and reassure him that the Government will continue to place fair access at the very heart of our education system, and put in place provisions to ensure that local authorities act in accordance with the framework that has been set down by Parliament.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.55.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1645" speakername="Barry Sheerman" colnum="55"  time="012:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0009.htm#10011948000566">
	<p pid="b.55.1/1">Thank you for calling me to open this debate, Miss Begg. I also thank the Speaker for seeing fit to allow this debate on the topic of universities and their role in the regeneration of towns and cities.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/2">Miss Begg, I am sure that, like me, you know very well how important universities have become to all the cities and towns where they have a presence. If I may recount briefly, when I first became the Member of Parliament for Huddersfield 30 years ago-in fact, my constituency was Huddersfield, East in those days-manufacturing employment was at a very high level. In my part of Yorkshire-west Yorkshire and particularly Huddersfield-such employment was very strong, ranging from the engineering sector, including light engineering, for example in David Brown Gear Systems, David Brown Tractors and so much else, through to textiles. Huddersfield still is a centre for the finest worsteds in the world, but in those days the textile sector employed many, many people. There was also a chemical industry associated with textiles-dyestuffs and much else-and again the companies in that sector were very large employers. At one stage, 6,000 people worked on the Imperial Chemical Industries, or ICI, site on the Leeds road in Huddersfield.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/3">There has been a dreadful decline in manufacturing employment in the years since I was first elected to Parliament. It has been a dreadful decline not because manufacturing jobs are not there-manufacturing has become leaner, meaner, more effective and more efficient. Yes, every time we had a global takeover of a company in west Yorkshire, the rest of Yorkshire and, I suspect, the whole country, we were told that it would lead to no real change in jobs and would not really affect the economic climate of our country, but time and again-I fear it will happen again with today's Cadbury takeover-we in west Yorkshire found that every time there was a major takeover of a company by a global company, it meant fewer jobs, relocation of the manufacturing capacity to other parts of the world, and sometimes only a small design and marketing presence left in the town where the company was originally sited.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/4">We were very dependent on manufacturing jobs in west Yorkshire and in Huddersfield. Over the past 30 years, we have become dependent on what is now the largest employer in my constituency: Huddersfield university. It has 24,000 students and employs a large number of staff-the average figure for jobs at the university in 2008-09 was 1,820. The estimated value of its impact on the local economy is &#163;300 million. The university is also a major supplier of teachers, health workers and other graduates to the Leeds city region. Miss Begg, I am sure that you will be impressed to hear that, six months after graduation, 72 per cent. of our graduates from Huddersfield university are still working in Yorkshire and the Humber area; I am also sure that there is a similar statistic for your part of the world. We retain our graduates, who work in the locality and the region. Those new graduates earn &#163;54 million in total in west Yorkshire in their first year of employment. Huddersfield university is the very heart of my constituency and of Kirklees council, the local authority that covers four and a half constituencies, including my own.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/5">I wanted to talk about the power of universities to regenerate towns and cities because, as we all know, as a result of the international financial meltdown and the various problems that we have all faced in the world as a result, including recession and new levels of public debt, there will be cuts across a large number of Departments. As Lord Mandelson mentioned in his statement to the House of Lords and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Higher Education and Intellectual Property repeated in the House of Commons, those cuts will include quite profound cuts to university budgets in the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/6">Let me sum up the essence of my argument. We all realise that we will have to find ways to cut back public expenditure in the coming years-most reasonable people realise that. As Chairman of the Children, Schools and Families Committee, I suspect that, even in that sector, although we have certain guarantees that there will not be cuts, cuts will eventually be made. However, some cuts would be so deleterious to other aspects of our life that I ask the Minister to reassure us today that the cuts made will not harm the power of our universities, which extends beyond regeneration. Miss Begg, I think you know that the Royal Society of Arts, under the stewardship of Matthew Taylor and partly under the influence of Lord Giddens, who was the director of the London School of Economics for a substantial period, has been talking about how we regenerate local democracy. Today's debate is not just about university expenditure, university employment or wealth creation by universities, nor is it just about having large numbers of students, paying members of staff well and creating that atmosphere of competition and success that we know university towns and cities have. It is also about that greater reach that universities have in what the vice-chancellor of Newcastle university, writing in a very impressive recent article, called the re-establishment of the civic university. The civic university reaches out.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/7">Some years ago, the RSA published a report called &quot;Tomorrow's Company&quot;. It had a simple message that if a company wanted to be a company of the future-a forward-looking company-it had to look at five of its stakeholders. It had to look not only at the shareholder, the customer, the supplier and the supply chain, but at the community in which it was situated; that community mattered to the future success of that company. &quot;Community&quot; could be interpreted locally, regionally and nationally. So there were broader aspirations for companies, and that is how I want people to see the role of universities.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/8">Some universities play that role exceptionally well. My constituents and I have been lucky that, although Huddersfield university briefly went through a series of problems, Sir William Taylor took hold of its governance and turned it around. Then, John Tarrant did good work for 11 years to make Huddersfield university one of the fastest growing universities in the country. By the time he retired, he had tripled the size of the student body, which, as I have said, is now 24,000 students. He also increased the number of staff. Bob Cryan, our current vice-chancellor, is carrying on that excellent work.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/9">We know that a university should reach out to the community and involve that community, not only so that it is seen to have good public relations but so that it puts its tentacles out, as it were, and reaches out to help the future of our towns and cities. In Huddersfield, the university reaches out to new enterprises, including small start-ups, however small they are. Its business department does that, as do other departments, including those dealing with social enterprise. They ensure that that partnership with the community really helps to make small and medium-sized enterprises to grow.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/10">I do not want to be too parochial, but let me return to the impact of the possible funding cuts. I understand that trade associations have a role. My use of the term &quot;trade associations&quot; will upset some universities, but there are a lot of trade associations in the university world. They seem to be breeding very quickly. It used to be mainly the Higher Education Funding Council. Now HEFC writes to five different trade associations within the university sector. However, the recent HEFC grant letter setting out its spending priorities for the next year, increased the proposed cuts set out in the pre-Budget report to &#163;915 million. It is estimated that those cuts, which are only the ones that have been announced so far, will have an increased effect upon the north of England, given that 42 per cent. of the region's research and development spending is channelled through universities. That R and D spending is crucial to the north of England and to Yorkshire in particular. I suggest that those cuts will have a devastating effect not only on students and staff, but on our international competitiveness and our regional and local economies, as well as the national economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.57.2/2">Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in my constituency, the Ambleside campus of the university of Cumbria is threatened with effective closure from this July, despite having exceeded its recruitment targets for the past three years? Ambleside is a community with just 2,000 houses, 600 students and 150 staff, and the university contributes &#163;6 million to the economy every year. Does he agree that, given the devastating effect on the community if that closure proceeds, everything should be done to avoid it?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.57.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1645" speakername="Barry Sheerman" colnum="57"  time="012:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0009.htm#10011948000570">
	<p pid="b.57.3/1">I am sure that if I studied the Ambleside situation, about which I know little, I would find similarities, albeit on a micro scale, to what we face at the university of Huddersfield. I take it seriously. The hon. Gentleman will remember that when he was a member of the Select Committee on Education and Skills, we spent a lot of time covering higher education. I see my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> nodding from behind the Minister; she was also a member of that Committee. We covered higher education, so we knew quite a bit about it. You might see a plot here, Miss Begg, and think that it was out of frustration at the fact that my Committee no longer covers higher education that I asked for this debate. That is partly the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/2">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Universities play a crucial part in regional and urban economic regeneration. Directly, universities provide approximately 1.2 per cent. of UK employment and generate nearly &#163;60 billion in output. That is a lot of money, and cutbacks will hurt.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/3">Let us talk about fairness. As Chairman of the Select Committee, every year I examine the finances of our education spend. I am proud that this Government have spent so much money at every level of education. I am particularly pleased by how much we have invested in pre-school and early education. I am proud of Building Schools for the Future and how much money we have put into schools. The fact is that when the Labour Government came to power in 1997, they said, rightly, &quot;All the research shows that early intervention is absolutely the highest priority if we are to give children from deprived backgrounds a chance in life that they wouldn't otherwise get.&quot; For that reason, they spent a high percentage of resources on it. However, when we look across the piece, going back 10 years, we find that overall spend on the early years sector has increased by 57 per cent. since 1999, compared with only 39 per cent. for HE. Higher education has done well, but it has not had the same priority as other parts of the education system.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/4">It might be said that higher education has done well, so what is the problem? I was one of the Members who campaigned vigorously for what we call variable fees and others call top-up fees. An investigation conducted by the Education and Skills Committee concluded in favour of variable fees, largely because we did not think that, because early years and school years were spending priorities, we would have enough in the kitty to invest sufficiently in higher education. On reflection, looking back at what has happened in the years since we introduced variable fees, I am proud that when the University and College Union came before my Committee just before it changed its focus to children, schools and families, the leader of UCU admitted that almost exactly the amount of money raised from variable fees had gone into university salaries, which have undergone a healthy increase. I looked at university salary levels recently: they have increased, so we can now retain some of the best talent of our country in teaching and research.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/5">University funding has improved, but I think we should invest more, not less, in our higher education system because, increasingly, universities are deeply involved in communities, regeneration and new employment and enterprise initiatives. That is different, and it must be prioritised. If the Minister, in a frank moment, asked me to choose between increasing the budget for Building Schools for the Future or putting more money into universities, I would not be against spreading out the years over which we deliver BSF and giving some of the money to universities, especially if it is for specific purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/6">I have gone on long enough, but I will say two things on the Government's side. Extremely good improvements have been made in universities. What would happen if the university were removed from your nearest city, Miss Begg? If the universities were removed from Manchester-there used to be five, but there are now four, due to amalgamation-it would be devastating. Removing the 34 London universities would be devastating. Almost every town and city with a healthy university or cluster of universities would be devastated by their loss. Yes, there is high employment in local authorities and the health service, but university employment is critical to our success as a nation and our future.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/7">We expect universities to maintain their high standards. Yes, some people say-I am sympathetic to their view-that we want towns that do not have a university. If possible, it is sometimes better to have a satellite campus rather than a new fully independent university, which just repeats the costs of administration, such as vice-chancellor's salaries and so on. We must guard against that. I favour satellite universities and campuses. However, I also believe that we must maintain high standards. My Committee's recent inquiry on the training of social workers and teachers discovered that students in our country can get into university with deplorably low levels of qualification. We must maintain standards in university admissions and in the quality of degrees delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/8">We also need the highest quality of governance in universities. I have recently seen worrying figures about the range of salaries for vice-chancellors. Everybody in the sector knows that we are not breeding enough men and women who are good material for vice-chancellors. There is a dearth of vice-chancellors. I heard of a recent scandal in which a university was so desperate for a vice-chancellor that it appointed one without even taking up his references. The story of what happened to him is a sad one. On the other hand, I heard recently of a metropolitan university that suggested advertising for a head of business studies-one department in the university-at a salary of &#163;250,000. We must have good governance at the very top. I do not mean professors. I looked at the average pay rates for professors and lecturers recently; they are perfectly modest. I have a vested interest, as I have a son-in-law and a daughter in the academic world. Researchers should be paid a decent salary-not the exorbitant bonuses of the City, but salaries that are commensurate with their qualifications and talent.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/9">Lastly, I believe that we must be very careful about the overall governance of our universities-how they are managed and directed. We should look seriously at how they are structured, how staff are included in the governance structure and at the sanctions and precautions for universities that are running into trouble. I mention only the recent problems at London Metropolitan university, although that is not the only one that has had problems, as the Minister knows. We must have better governance and we can have it without too much bureaucracy and without sacrificing the principle that universities are independent. They should value their independence and so should we.</p>

	<p pid="b.59.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1645" name="Barry Sheerman">the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman)</phrase> on securing the debate. As all hon. Members know, he is probably the greatest champion of universities in the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/2">My hon. Friend is not new to subject of the contribution that universities make to their civic communities and the wider economy; he has returned to it over many years. He considered the issue as Chairman of the Education and Skills Committee. Indeed, last week he questioned me in the House on the subject. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this important debate and to put it on the record that the Government take substantially the same view as he does. We believe that universities have an important role to play at the heart of their communities. He made the point well that if we took universities out of the places where they exist, it would be devastating. He will recognise that many hon. Members would love to have a university in their constituency. There are still parts of the country where access to higher education is not what we would like, largely because there are no universities there. He was right to put his comments in the way that he did.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/3">A couple of years ago, research commissioned by Universities UK showed that universities directly employed about a third of a million people and that they indirectly supported the employment of a similar number. The report estimated the economic impact of higher education in the UK to be &#163;45 billion a year. These days, most universities support business growth, standing shoulder to shoulder with other agencies such as local authorities, regional development agencies and regeneration vehicles in local communities in supporting businesses. I recommend to all hon. Members the document &quot;Standing together&quot;, published as long ago as November 2008, in which universities moved swiftly to demonstrate to employers and local authorities what they could do to support economic growth in the downturn, many months before others caught up. I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that universities have to work in partnership. There are Opposition proposals to abolish RDAs, which make an important impact in keeping local and regional connections intact.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/4">It is important to put on the record the intrinsic value of universities. In our democracy, we value learning for learning's sake. Universities play an important part in the cultural and democratic life of our country. They are autonomous of Government and we celebrate their role. We also celebrate the contribution of many students and the National Union of Students to voluntary work on campus and in surrounding communities. We celebrate the employment that universities bring and their sporting life. Universities bring a raft of contributions.</p>

	<p pid="b.60.0/1">I apologise for missing the start of the debate, Miss Begg, but I had a constituency visit.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.0/2">The Minister is making a lot of sense. Does he agree that it is important that universities provide specialist, niche skills so that industry and the economy can thrive? I am thinking specifically of nuclear engineering skills, which are provided by Manchester university. I received correspondence from it only yesterday asking me to draw the Minister's attention to the need for the Government to continue to support and facilitate it in providing nuclear skills for our future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.60.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1882" speakername="David Lammy" colnum="60"  time="013:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0010.htm#10011948000573">
	<p pid="b.60.1/1">Of course, Manchester is one of our great universities. I am sure the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the Government set out in &quot;New Industry, New Jobs&quot; the importance of key sectors of our economy that are integral to our growth. Universities pipe into those industries, of which the nuclear industry is one. I have not seen the letter, but I will look at it closely and liaise with the Minister for Science and Innovation if there is anything I can do. Of course, it is hugely important that we support the future economy of this country, and universities are key to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/2">Huddersfield university has as one of its mission statements, &quot;Inspiring tomorrow's professionals&quot;. It runs programmes ranging from foundation degrees for public service professionals to postgraduate masters degrees in entrepreneurship and research programmes involving close working with businesses, not just in Huddersfield, but across the west Yorkshire region. It has one of the youngest vice-chancellors in the country, and in 2009 he was named business person of the year by <i>T</i><i>he</i><i>Huddersfield Daily Examiner</i> for the contribution the university is making in the area. I recognise the importance of Huddersfield university to regeneration. There is no better advocate in this place than my hon. Friend for universities of that type.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/3">It is important to recognise that these are tough times. Like all areas of the economy, we are asking universities to make efficiencies. That must be considered against the backdrop of the Government increasing university funding by 25 per cent. since 1997. Our overall spend in higher education is now more than &#163;12 billion. We must recognise that universities are able to lever in to their sector substantially more money as a result of that investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/4">We have asked the sector to make savings, but I hope that my hon. Friend recognises that those savings are relatively small. Indeed, the recent grant letter that the Secretary of State sent to the sector amounted to an additional 1 per cent. on the teaching grant. We have indicated that there will be further savings up to 2013. However, I hope that my hon. Friend will recognise that that will be spread across the entirety of higher education, science and beyond. We do not yet know what the outcome of the spending review will be.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.1/5">I stand behind all that my hon. Friend said and reassure him that the Government are with him in this endeavour. We are committed to higher education, as we are to further education, early years and secondary education. They all needed improvement in 1997. We are now in a position in which HE can be the guiding light as we move forward in this difficult time for our economy. I recognise how important the university will be for the people of Huddersfield.</p>

	Hatchfield Farm Development
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.62.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1854" speakername="Richard Spring" colnum="62"  time="013:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0010.htm#10011948000574">
	<p pid="b.62.1/1">It is a pleasure to have you chairing our proceedings, Miss Begg, and I am grateful to the Minister for being here to respond.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/2">We are here to discuss the proposed Hatchfield Farm development in Newmarket. The proposal is to build 1,640 houses in Newmarket overall-enough to house 5,000 people in a rural town with a population of around 15,000. It is proposed that 1,200 houses will be built on the Hatchfield Farm site itself. Newmarket is a rural town with a unique and colourful history, and it is one of the few places in the country that can genuinely boast of being an international hub for a high-value industry. The proposal would effectively increase the town's population by a third, which would be the equivalent of adding a development for 3 million people on to London. The proposal would damage an industry that provides a large share of all the jobs in the town.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/3">Newmarket is home to two of the country's most famous race courses, almost 70 miles of gallops, 2,800 acres of fully maintained training grounds, 62 stud farms and 79 licensed trainers. At the peak of the season, more than 2,500 racehorses are in training there, and all are stabled in and around the town. Hundreds of horses need to be exercised on a daily basis, which is one of the compelling sights to be observed every day on the streets of Newmarket.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/4">However, there is already a large and growing traffic problem-indeed, that is the very nub of the issue at hand. The more traffic with which trainers and racehorse owners have to deal, the less likely they are to make the commitment to Newmarket that the industry needs to survive in the town. Newmarket can have a more severe traffic problem, or it can have a horse training industry, but it simply cannot have both. To put it simply, under the proposals for the Hatchfield development, Newmarket will have a traffic problem that is potentially destructive.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/5">It should be noted that Hatchfield Farm is not the only place where houses may be built, and that the council's proposals have been for a general urban extension to the north-east of Newmarket. However, Hatchfield Farm is considered the only realistic sizeable site for the extension. The proposal submitted to the council by the landowner of Hatchfield Farm is for 1,200 dwellings to be phased over 15 years, as well as retail outlets, restaurants, community facilities, sport and recreation facilities, a primary school and a park-and-ride facility. We should bear it in mind that the council's proposed plans also include 240 homes to be built on brownfield sites by 2020, as well as 200 more on greenfield sites by 2031. That would take the number of houses to be built in Newmarket to 1,640.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/6">Why would the building of so many houses have such an impact on the all-important horse racing industry in Newmarket? First, the raising and training of young thoroughbreds requires a quiet and tranquil environment. The disturbance that will inevitably be associated with the construction and occupancy of so many houses and the noise of so much extra traffic will destroy that tranquillity. That is what has led Richard Fletcher, the chairman of the Newmarket town council development and planning committee, in his role as a spokesman for the town council, to assert that:</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/7" class="indent">&quot;if this proposal goes ahead, it would cause untold damage to the equine industry in the town and possibly its total demise.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/8">He goes on to say that:</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/9" class="indent">&quot;there is insufficient employment in Newmarket to cater for the needs of the proposed new urban extension, indeed, jobs in the equine industries would be lost, and it is fanciful to argue that sufficient employment opportunities would be created. Newmarket would lose its unique character and become a lifeless dormitory town for Cambridge, Bury St Edmonds and beyond on the already too busy A14. The town council totally rejects this future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/10">Barton Willmore's evidence to the public examination in respect of the draft Forest Heath core strategy that was commissioned by Tattersalls, which is the leading bloodstock auctioneer, states:</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The horseracing industry consider that Forest Heath district council has seriously misunderstood the importance of the horseracing industry to Newmarket and its future and the detrimental impact that 1,200 houses, the largest single increment of growth in the history of the town, will affect adjacent horseracing yards and studs, the tranquil environment of Newmarket and the movement of horses on adjacent roads. An already fragile balance will be upset.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/12">Barton Willmore goes on to point out that:</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/13" class="indent">&quot;in terms of both the scale and location of development, the proposed allocation of 1,200 houses on a peripheral greenfield site in North East Newmarket/Hatchfield Farm represents a fundamental change in planning policy for housing in Newmarket. On its own, this proposed greenfield extension is significant in that it represents an increase of over 13 per cent. in the total housing provision in Newmarket. Such a significant change in policy in a uniquely sensitive town demands a sound evidence base...The horse racing industry are concerned that the identification of North East Newmarket/Hatchfield Farm to accommodate 1,200 houses has not been subject to detailed studies or the provision of an adequate evidence base.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/14">In the document planning policy statement 3, which was released by the Department for Communities and Local Government on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-29">29 November 2006</phrase>, criteria were set out. That document states that local authorities</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/15" class="indent">&quot;should identify sufficient specific deliverable sites to deliver housing in the first five years. To be considered deliverable, sites should, at the point of adoption of the relevant Local Development Document:</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/16" class="indent">- Be Available - the site is available now.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/17" class="indent">- Be Suitable - the site offers a suitable location for development now and would contribute to the creation of sustainable, mixed communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/18" class="indent">- Be Achievable - there is a reasonable prospect that housing will be delivered on the site within five years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/19">Will the community that such a development creates help to destroy the predominant local industry and employer?</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/20">Beyond those essential considerations, it has been suggested in the Barton Willmore evidence that</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/21" class="indent">&quot;in the preparation of the core strategy, the horseracing industry also considers that the council has not engaged properly with the industry nor understood its concerns. In particular, the horseracing industry point to the resolution of the LDF working group not to discuss their concerns until after the submission of the draft core strategy to the Secretary of State. It is also the case that the council only now seem to be putting in place the evidence base in support of the core strategy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/22">Peter Grimm, the strategic traffic manager of Suffolk county council, has said about the nearby junction between the A14 and the A142-a key arterial junction into Newmarket-that</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/23" class="indent">&quot;the Highways Agency have identified this one of the top 10 worst traffic junctions in the region. And there is no short term traffic solution to accommodate this development.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/24">That is significant, given that the proposed developments would increase the size of the population using the junction quite dramatically. However, as it stands, nobody seems to be willing to pay for the upgrade.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/25">At best, there is a widespread perception in the horse racing industry that Forest Heath district council has failed to consult and communicate effectively with it. That is particularly regrettable because Forest Heath has defended and promoted the industry in an exemplary way. For example, in my lifetime as the local MP, a one-time slump in racing meant that a number of local training yards were up for sale and their owners approached me-and, indeed, the council-aggressively to get permission for change of use into residential housing. The council admirably rejected those pleas, and the essential character of much of Newmarket was retained.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/26">The overriding question is why the proposal is still moving forward. Two key issues need to be addressed: why are the houses potentially being built, and why are they being built on this site in Newmarket, when there is no demand and space is available in the nearby village of Red Lodge? The answer to both those questions can be found in the regional spatial strategy, which has been imposed by the East of England Development Agency. That strategy has in turn been imposed on Forest Heath district council and requires it to build 6,400 homes between 2001 and 2021. The requirement for 2021 to 2031 is 3,700 dwellings. That adds up to 10,100 houses by the year 2031. In the seven years between 2001 and 2008, 1,625 homes were built, which leaves 8,475 still to go. We are, of course, talking about one of the smallest local authorities in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/27">To put it simply, no local authority can avoid the targets set out for it in the regional spatial strategy, as the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 strengthened the powers of the Secretary of State over local planning authorities. The local development framework, which the local district council produces, must be in general conformity with the regional spatial strategy and must go before an examination in public by a planning inspector before approval. That planning inspector can recommend changes, and if the planning authority refuses to carry them out, there is a default power for the Secretary of State to impose changes in the LDF.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/28">As well as strengthening the powers of the Secretary of State, the 2004 Act abolished the next level down from regional planning bodies-the county structure plan. The Act therefore strengthened central powers and the powers to override the concerns of local councils and local people to move planning strategies forward, while at the same time detaching the setting of quotas further from local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/29">The regional spatial strategy is the driving force behind the proposed development at Hatchfield Farm. The councillors at Forest Heath have been left with no option but to plan for the overall construction of 8,475 houses between 2008 and 2031 in their area of jurisdiction and responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/30">The reason more houses are being considered on the scale of the Hatchfield site is that Forest Heath district council is being required by law to do so by the regional planning authority. If the council had not submitted its core strategy, as part of its local development framework, it would have left the district with the risk of a policy vacuum, meaning that it would lose control over many planning applications because it would no longer have a five-year housing land supply. That is the draconian reality of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/31">A letter from the Government office for the east of England dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-14">14 September 2007</phrase>-the time of a campaign on saving local planning policies-stated that the local planning authorities</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/32" class="indent">&quot;should make good progress with Local Development Frameworks according to the timetables in their Local Development Strategies. The policies have been saved in the expectation that they will be replaced promptly&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/33">The risk of a policy vacuum would also jeopardise the ongoing application of the existing saved policies that protect the training and breeding industry, which is a key and difficult point in the context of Newmarket.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/34">Newmarket is one of only three towns in the district covered by Forest Health district council. It has, in practice, restrictions placed on it for expansion purposes by the fact that it has training grounds around it for horses and many training yards in the middle of the town. That highlights more than anything else the total inflexibility of the regional spatial strategy. Instead of allowing the housing stock in the area to grow organically, it requires an amount of housing to be built without regard to the local constraints faced. That is what leads us to the position we find ourselves in today, hence the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/35">Newmarket is not the only place where houses are being built. For example, the nearby smaller town of Mildenhall, which has a population of 10,000 and has certain restrictions placed on it because of existing flood plains and the presence of the US air force, has a target of 1,330 houses to be built by 2031.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/36">Residents of Newmarket, to their great credit, have shown that activism is not dead in the 21st century. The group Save Historic Newmarket has shown a remarkable ability to galvanise people to action and organise them. I would like in particular to acknowledge the campaign led by Rachel Hood, Fiona Unwin, Jacko Fanshawe and many others for effectively raising civic awareness and attempting to preserve the built heritage of the town and its unique character, which stretches back over several hundred years.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/37">That is why the shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase>, has said that, if the Conservatives are elected, she will abolish the bureaucratic and undemocratic tier of local planning. That will include the abolition of the regional spatial strategies, the regional planning boards and national and regional targets. She has said that she anticipates primary legislation in the first year of any new Conservative Government and that, prior to introducing such legislation, she would consider whether to use the executive powers of the Secretary of State to revoke the regional spatial strategies in whole or in part.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/38">The core of the issue is this: if the current framework for planning applications remains in place, not only will the people of Newmarket be left with the Hatchfield Farm development, but similar developments will be imposed on other communities with little or no regard to the feelings of the local people who have to live there or to their livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/39">Towns and villages all over the country are being considered for expansion to meet the quotas for housing that are set down in the various regional spatial strategies. The central targets are laid out before the regional planning bodies, which then impose targets on district councils such as Forest Heath. Those councils are then forced to propose developments such as the one that I have described. The people who live in the places affected then have to organise themselves and expend huge amounts of time and energy defending their interests and those of their town for sense to prevail. It is time for the Government-I hope we will get some comment from the Minister on the matter-to recognise all the difficulties they have created for so many people due to the implications of their draconian policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/40">Housing must reflect the real needs of real people, which is why developments such as those proposed for Hatchfield Farm must be prevented before they are begun. I hope that the Minister will now understand why I have introduced the debate. It is clear that there appears to be insufficient flexibility in existing legislation to deal with the problem that has arisen in Newmarket, which I dare say is replicated in other parts of the country. As a result, the local council has found itself at the receiving end of a huge tide of local anger, and the situation has been compounded by communication and consultation issues. I cannot believe that such absurd inflexibility, which in this case will damage the quality of life and the main industry of the town, was in the minds of the Government when the 2004 Act was drawn up.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/41">Newmarket is a precious jewel in the life of England, with its extraordinary character and history. Frankly, however, the proposed development, which is obscene, has the capacity to destroy it.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Miss Begg, and to respond to the debate. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1854" name="Richard Spring">the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring)</phrase> on securing it. He is clearly a champion for his constituency and for the racing industry that has made it famous. He has set out a passionate and fascinating case for the industry and its contribution to the local economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/2">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that, because a planning application has been submitted to Forest Heath district council that could come before the Department for consideration, I am unable to comment on the details of the proposal. As he said, the local authority is at an advanced stage with its core strategy for Forest Heath, and that plan is being tested by the Planning Inspectorate through an examination in public, so I hope that he will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the merits or otherwise of that plan. However, I can discuss some of the more general points he has set out and try to respond to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/3">It is through the core strategy that Forest Heath district council is planning for the future development of the district in the years up to 2021. Its aspiration is to achieve a suitable balance between protecting the area's local distinctiveness and enhancing the district's high-value business and tourism economy, which the hon. Gentleman so eloquently described.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/4">The recently published comprehensive area assessment for Suffolk highlighted the fact that although people in the county generally enjoy a good quality of life, the economy is not as well developed as it could be. I am told that high wage opportunities are relatively limited, especially in the more rural parts, that modern businesses are not being attracted into the county in sufficient numbers and that there is a lack of housing to meet the needs of local people.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/5">The east of England plan, as the hon. Gentleman said, puts in place a framework to deal with some of those issues. It promotes sustainable development, especially in respect of housing shortages, supports the continued growth of the economy and enables all areas to share in prosperity in the future. It has identified a need to deliver 6,400 homes in Forest Heath by 2021.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/6">Housing targets have been determined using a strategic, evidence-based approach that takes into account current and future need and demand. Forest Heath's target of 380 homes per annum was delivered last year, but more housing will need to be delivered to make up for under-provision in the past, when only 50 per cent. of the target was achieved between 2001 and 2004, and to meet growing local needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/7">There remains a significant unmet need for housing, especially affordable housing, right across the county, and that is no different in Forest Heath. Only 23 per cent. of homes built in the district in 2008-09 were designated as affordable homes against the target of 35 per cent. in the east of England plan. It is therefore important that authorities across Suffolk continue to work to deliver much-needed homes and to provide for the local community's needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/8">As we know, it is Government policy to ensure that everybody should have the opportunity to rent or buy a decent home at a price that they can afford in a place where they want to live and work. Indeed, this Government invested more than &#163;11 million between 2005 and 2009 in the form of grants to registered social landlords to support delivery of low-cost home ownership and social rented housing in Forest Heath.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/9">We continue to support authorities in delivering more affordable homes through the housing pledge, in particular the national affordable housing pot. Two developments in the area have also been shortlisted for Kickstart funding. The district of Forest Heath lies in the Cambridgeshire housing sub-region, which was allocated &#163;112.3 million for 2008-11 to help to ensure that more affordable homes can continue to be developed locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/10">Newmarket, as the largest town in Forest Heath and the international home of horse racing, as we have heard, plays a key role in driving forward the area's future prosperity, and that is recognised in the council's draft core strategy. The plan-it was not drawn up by me, and I am not a spokesman for the council-identifies the need to develop and promote Newmarket's role as the living heart of British horse racing while at the same time seeking to increase the town's potential for business and economic growth, and for better fulfilling its role in the Cambridgeshire sub-region. The plan proposes 1,640 homes to be delivered in Newmarket by 2021 to help to meet the needs of local people and businesses. It also identifies the need to develop and promote the area's economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/11">The core strategy sets out the vision and policies that have been formulated in consultation with the local community. As I said earlier, it is being tested through the examination-in-public process, which is an important forum for considering the area's future. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and others who are interested in the area's future and who have a passion for the area, as he set out this afternoon, will follow it closely. I hope that once it is complete, a strong vision for the future will be in place that everyone with an interest in Newmarket can get behind.</p>

	<p pid="b.68.0/1">I am most grateful to the Minister for replying so courteously and comprehensively. I want to understand the procedure if there is a situation in which, for whatever good intent, a housing development is likely to have an extremely corrosive impact on the life of a community, employment or the environment. I would like to understand what the role of the Government might be in considering how to take the matter forward if a proposal does not correspond with what is set out in the local development framework.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-19b.68.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1553" speakername="Ian Austin" colnum="68"  time="013:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100119/halltext/100119h0011.htm#10011948000577">
	<p pid="b.68.1/1">An application for a proposed development at Hatchfield Farm has been lodged with the district council. In the first instance, it is for the local authority to consider it. However, the scheme could come before Communities and Local Government Ministers for determination, which is why, as I said earlier, it is not possible for me to comment on the proposals at this point.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/2">It is the policy of the Secretary of State to be selective about calling in planning applications. In general, he will take such a step only if planning issues of more than local importance are involved. Such cases could include those that may, for example, conflict with national policies on important matters, have significant effects beyond their immediate locality, give rise to substantial regional or national controversy, raise significant architectural or urban design issues or involve the interests of national security or foreign Governments. There is a range of factors on which applications could be called in, and each one is considered on its individual merits. I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman will be making representations as the issue develops to the local authority and to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/3">In conclusion, I wish to make one more point. The hon. Gentleman said that it is his party's policy to abolish regional spatial strategies, targets for housing development and all the rest of it if it were elected. The challenge that he and his colleagues face is to demonstrate to their constituents and, indeed, families across the country how they will ensure that they can provide the homes that this country needs and that families are desperate to buy-there are young people in his constituency, like everywhere else, who are desperate to own a home of their own-without some kind of national, regional and local planning framework that ensures that such homes are, in fact, developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/4">The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues need to demonstrate how we could rely on local authorities across the country-on their own, without any form of co-ordination at a local, regional or national level-to ensure that homes were developed. It is simply not true to suggest, as his party does, that regional spatial strategies are some kind of new and terrible invention, when we in England have had regional planning functions for decades. Even in the past, the county structure plans were drafted within a strategic planning context set by regional planning guidance. In one form or another, it has always been the position that we need co-ordination at a national, regional and local level if we are to ensure that the homes that people need to live in are developed, and that jobs in the construction industry are protected. I apologise again to the hon. Gentleman for not being able to comment in detail on the development about which he is concerned, and I thank him again for securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/5" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/6" class="italic">Sitting adjourned.</p>
