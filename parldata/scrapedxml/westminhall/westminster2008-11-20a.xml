<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-20a.138.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="138"  time="014:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081120/halltext/81120h0001.htm#08112070000205">
	<p pid="a.138.1/1">I declare, hopefully alongside all my hon. Friends and other colleagues in the House, that I am on the organ donation register and I have held my organ donor card since 1986. For 10 years before that, I think that it was known as the kidney donor card, before it was expanded to become the broader organ donor card. Interestingly, I was comparing donor cards with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> in the Members Tea Room earlier this week, and he informed me that, when he was first elected to the House in 1979, his very first debate was about taking forward the whole donor campaign. He had had his card since 1979 and it still had that date on it, which was pretty impressive.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/2">To discuss organ donation is literally to discuss the questions of life and death. The House must recognise that, and I am sure that the whole House will join me in paying tribute to all those people who are donors, whether of blood, plasma or bone marrow, and all those people who are on the organ donation register. The number of people on that register is increasing; 15.8 million people was the last publicly recorded figure, according to NHS transplant data. In particular, we must pay tribute not only to all those people who have given up their organs in death so that others might live but to their friends and families who, in their moment of grief, were prepared to support organ donation. Although all hon. Members will doubtless hold strong opinions on this issue and will seek, quite rightly, to call the Government to account, I have no doubt that this debate will be underpinned in all our minds by the awareness of these selfless acts by hundreds of people across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/3">Many of us will remember the first transplant; indeed, the Minister herself referred to it earlier. It was performed by Dr. Christiaan Barnard in South Africa in 1967. It is one of the very first memories that I have of news on television, along with Churchill's funeral and the first man to step on the moon, events that all took place during those pioneering days of the 1960s. As of today, 7,981 people in Britain are waiting for transplants, but only about 3,000 transplants are carried out each year, tragically leading to the situation in which more than 1,000 people die each year for want of a transplant. The chief medical officer has stated that other people are &quot;dying silently&quot;, because doctors know that there is no hope of them receiving treatment, so they are not putting them on the transplant waiting lists. In Britain, we have about 13 donors per million in our population, whereas Spain&mdash;the best in the world&mdash;has 35 per million.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/4">This issue was last raised in legislative terms during the passage of the Human Tissue Bill in 2004, when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> pushed for a system of presumed consent. I dare say that we will hear more from him in a moment. This is an issue of conscience and is therefore free vote territory, certainly for the Opposition. Although I am the Conservative spokesman on health, on this issue, my words today do not constitute a party line on presumed consent. When we voted on introducing presumed consent in 2004, I voted against it, as did the current Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/5">I welcome the debate, which comes after Monday's publication of the expert taskforce's report on presumed consent. The taskforce was commissioned to look into the issue by the Prime Minister in January, following his apparent conversion. In his homiletic article to <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-13">13 January</phrase>, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/6" class="indent">&quot;I want to start a genuine debate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/7">He also suggested that a move to presumed consent would make us &quot;a more compassionate Britain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/8">Irrespective of the change of mind that anyone might have had, it was right to refer the matter to an expert panel, which was the better for focusing on evidence rather than other judgments&mdash;moral or otherwise. I pay tribute to Elizabeth Buggins and her team for the thorough and thoughtful process that they have undertaken. It is refreshing to see a progression of thinking in the report, from the group having disparate views on the matter to its members reaching broad consensus. Not only were the group's views disparate, but, according to the journalist Michael White's article in <i>The Guardian</i> this week:</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Ministers had been assured that a majority of its members favoured 'presumed consent'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/10">In paragraph 2.7 of the report, the taskforce crystallised its task as seeking to check &quot;whether the intuitive answer&quot;&mdash;presumed consent&mdash;&quot;is, in fact, correct.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/11">We cannot escape the fact that this subject touches on people's notions of what is appropriate in death. It also touches on the sanctity and ownership of our bodies, in terms of any form of living will before death, and on the wishes and interests of the next of kin after death. However, the primary hurdle is the evidence as to whether a change in the law would lead to an increase in organ transplants and to universal access to them across the country. The Minister has sought to address that issue. There seems to be no evidence to suggest that that hurdle can be cleared, but the taskforce did not completely write off presumed consent. It noted that it &quot;may deliver real benefits&quot;, but the stronger concern, which outweighed that possibility, was that it</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/12" class="indent">&quot;carries a significant risk of making the current situation worse.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/13">The taskforce ultimately opposed a move to presumed consent at this stage. Its important, objective report is a good basis on which to build policies and decide our direction for the future. It will be interesting to note whether those who do not agree with the report's outcome go to the usual refuge of those who do not like a report&mdash;disputing it and asking whether its process was flawed. I shall look forward to that debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-20a.141.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="141"  time="014:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081120/halltext/81120h0001.htm#08112070000209">
	<p pid="a.141.0/1">I do not for one second suggest that I have knowledge at the same level as the hon. Gentleman, whom I know has studied this matter in great detail. That said, where we can get evidence, we must try hard to base many of our judgments on the evidence that can be relied on. Different countries will be configured differently and will have different practices and cultural contexts, but we must try to root ourselves in the available evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/2">It is worth noting from the report that clinicians from intensive care, where the majority of deaths leading to donation occur, were at the forefront of opposing presumed consent. According to the Intensive Care Society, they are pretty evenly split on the question, but those who oppose it do so vehemently. In the words of the report,</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/3" class="indent">&quot;the strength of feeling among those who are opposed is considerable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/4">That comment contrasts with the cry of doctors' leaders, such as the British Medical Association, who continue to push the presumed-consent model in the face of evidence from their members. Any movement on the presumed-consent question will have to be predicated on the satisfaction of front-line intensive care professionals regarding their patients' protection and their work. A particular concern is the preservation of patient trust when there are fears about the temptation to harvest organs. I absolutely support the Minister's comments about such suggestions being an affront to doctors. Looking at the issue from the other end of the telescope, we must deal with the fears of those whose ability to feel well-served by medical and health care professionals is based on that element of trust. That is why this issue is so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/5">I think that we all want the amount of transplant surgery in the UK to rise to European levels, particularly those in Spain, or to those in America. What is needed is an expansion in the capacity of transplant surgery across the country, which means having trained surgeons and properly equipped support units, keeping organs from degenerating, and having universal coverage by donor transplant co-ordinators, or advocates&mdash;that word has been used. Where we do it, we do it well, but it is all too patchy in the UK. Although Spain is prayed in aid, transplant surgery is so widespread there, in so many categories, that the prior consent of the individual or next of kin is established without needing to rely on the presumption of consent. The question then becomes whether presumed consent is the best way of educating a populace about organ donation and convincing them that it is the right thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/6">The architect of the Spanish system, Professor Rafael Matesanz, has explicitly rejected the argument that legislation provides a solution. He has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/7" class="indent">&quot;There is no country in the world where there has been sustained improvement after changing the law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/8">To some degree, that supports the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1411" name="Gisela Stuart">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)</phrase> made in her intervention. He argues that it is the comprehensive transplant programme that accounts for Spain's success. I find that argument very convincing.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/9">Spain changed the law to introduce its opt-out scheme in 1979&mdash;so there has been plenty of time&mdash;but it had no impact until 1989, when the Spanish government invested in specific training for health care professionals and appointed donor transplant co-ordinators in every intensive care unit. Another opt-out country, Sweden, has fewer organs available for donation than we have in Britain. Equally, the USA has achieved an impressive increase in donor numbers while rejecting any legislative move towards presumed consent. If experts cannot produce evidence that a system of presumed consent would increase the number of transplants, there is no case for changing the law, and we should focus on increasing education and capacity. The report made it clear that a number of other avenues need to be pursued before a move to presumed consent can be entertained.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/10">I hope that my next comments will be taken as being constructive. The Government have performed very poorly on organ donation. Answers to parliamentary questions have revealed that between April 2007 and March 2008, of the 444 hearts that were offered for transplantation, 317 were not accepted because they were damaged or had poor function, or for a reason unrelated to the condition of the heart. Of the 127 hearts retrieved, only three were found to be unsuitable on arrival at the transplant centre. That means that of 444 hearts&mdash;that is 444 donor patients, of course, and 444 often very difficult conversations with families in the first throes of grief&mdash;only 124 were made use of. That suggests that there is a prior question to consider in trying to increase the number available.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/11">A parliamentary answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-10">10 July</phrase> stated that the Government have no idea how often</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/12" class="indent">&quot;a donor organ or donor tissue has been available but an intended transplant procedure has not taken place as a result of insufficient intensive care facilities in NHS hospitals in the last three years.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-07-10.1800"><i>Official Report</i>, 10 July 2008; Vol. 478, c. 1800W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/13">Furthermore, the number of viable organs not used for transplant has risen significantly from two in 1997 to 16 last year. That information was in an answer in May. Will the Minister therefore tell the House what has come of the organ care system, which I understand has been piloted at Papworth? Instead of the organs being kept on ice, where they degenerate, they can be kept operating, oxygenated and enriched until they are needed. That has to be a better option, and we know that it works well elsewhere. Why do the Government appear to be dragging their feet on that issue?</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/14">More than ever, the January recommendations of the organ donation taskforce need to be progressed so that we can see whether the promised 50 per cent. increase in five years can be delivered. The Government accepted the recommendations in full, although at this stage they have funded only the first year. What commitment can the Minister make to the continued funding of the changes recommended in the first report?</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/15">That first report noted:</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Only a UK-wide service can identify and allocate suitable organs to meet the needs of these patients.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/17">The creation of such a body was its first recommendation. Will the Minister tell the House what changes have been made to the organ donation and transplantation directorate of NHS Blood and Transplant to fulfil that recommendation? The report also advocated the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/18" class="indent">&quot;Local policies, constructed around national guidelines&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/19">As the Minister well knows, I am loth to suggest any addition to the mass of paperwork foisted on to our NHS by this or any other Government. Has she taken forward the point about local policies constructed around national guidelines? The taskforce also recommended the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/20" class="indent">&quot;Each Trust should have an identified clinical donation champion and a Trust donation committee&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/21">How many trusts now have that?</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/22">The taskforce's recommendation 6 was that donation activity should be reported to the trust board, be part of the regulator's assessment and be available to other trusts as benchmark data. Those data are currently collected through UK Transplant's potential donor audit, although it should focus on conversion rates&mdash;getting a new organ in a person&mdash;rather than donation rates. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to tell us what progress has been made on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/23">I turn to costs. Recommendation 8 was about the costs of donation, which are currently borne by the donating hospital and therefore provide a financial disincentive to donation. The taskforce recommended the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/24" class="indent">&quot;Measures for realistic reimbursement for the costs of donation should be developed&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/25">Again, does the Minister have an answer about whether that has been done? One of the most effective changes that could be made is round-the-clock cover by donor transplant co-ordinators. Recommendation 9 was as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/26" class="indent">&quot;Additional co-ordinators, embedded within critical care areas, should be employed to ensure a comprehensive, highly skilled, specialised and robust service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/27">What progress has been made on that?</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/28">There were two recommendations on education. The first was education aimed at clinicians and teams involved in donation, and the second was education for the general public, and specifically the black and minority ethnic population, to raise awareness of donation. Has the Department commissioned research on how best to do that, and when will it report? As with so many areas of health, the need for donor organs is three to four times higher among black and minority ethnic citizens than among the white population, due to higher rates of diabetes and kidney problems. What measure do the Government propose to encourage higher rates of organ donation among those racial groups?</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/29">Having looked at the full cycle of organ donation and transplantation, is the Minister aware of a series of errors in the prescribing and dispensing of immunosuppressants used to prevent organ rejection? Those errors have resulted in serious long-term medical consequences for patients. There are currently two immunosuppressant products used post-transplant that have the same active ingredient, but due to their narrow therapeutic indices, they are not freely interchangeable. As with many drugs, they are often prescribed on the basis of the active ingredient. That can lead to inadvertent switching between the two products, which could lead to organ rejection. There are two known cases of that, and a further 36 reports of such inadvertent prescribing or dispensing errors that have, thankfully, had less serious consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/30">The cost of such errors to patients' quality of life is significant, as are the financial costs to the NHS if the immunosuppressant regime is not accurate. A successful kidney transplant allows for a near-normal quality of life, with the cost of immunosuppressant therapy being approximately &pound;5,000 a year. A rejected kidney has a severe impact on the quality of a patient's life, requiring hospitalisation, the loss of an organ and a return to dialysis, at a cost of about &pound;30,000 per annum and the need for retransplantation. Does the Minister agree that urgent attention and guidance is required to ensure that all prescribing and dispensing health care professionals are made clearly aware of the difference between the two products and the need to clarify which they intend a patient to receive, so that those errors are prevented and successful organ transplantations are not put at risk?</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/31">The Minister will be aware of the operation reported yesterday to give Claudia Castillo a new trachea using a donated windpipe, stripped and then covered with stem cells from her hip. Although the operation was undertaken in Barcelona, it was scientists at Bristol university who transformed the windpipe, so I am sure that the Minister will be more than familiar with the case. The advantage is that Miss Castillo does not need to use immunosuppressant drugs, because of the presence of her own genetic material in the windpipe. What action can the Government take to progress that technology? Will the Minister continue to urge the research councils and others to maintain and expand their support for it?</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/32">It is clear from the taskforce's report that it does not believe at this stage that presumed consent is the best way of achieving the desired outcome&mdash;more successful transplants. It is clear also that there is much for the Government to do to raise transplantation rates, and questions about their performance to date. The outcome of the report is possibly a touch embarrassing for the Prime Minister, and it is disappointing that he has not seen fit to acknowledge it as the taskforce's evidence-based conclusion. <i>The Guardian</i> quotes him as being &quot;dismayed and frustrated&quot;. Given that this is a free-vote issue, like every other Member he is of course entitled to his view. But as the expert taskforce that he himself set up has raised serious concerns about adopting a presumed consent regime at this stage, and ahead of trying other avenues, it must be hoped that he will not use his position or the machinery of government to promote his view, and certainly not to save face.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/33">I am a little confused by the disjunction between the Prime Minister's position, which seems to be that he is keen on pushing ahead with presumed consent, and that of the Minister's immediate boss, the Secretary of State for Health. He said the other day that he accepted the taskforce's recommendation</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/34" class="indent">&quot;that we should aim to raise donation rates without the added complications associated with a change in legislation&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2008-11-17.6"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 November 2008; Vol. 483, c. 6WS</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/35">I agree wholeheartedly.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/36">Finally, our bodies are our own. They do not belong to the state. The then Health Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase> said during the 2004 debate that</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/37" class="indent">&quot;the decision about one's own body should be for the conscience of individual citizens. It is not for this Parliament...to impose on individuals a requisition of their bodies after death for the use of the state.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-06-28.76"><i>Official Report</i>, 28 June 2004; Vol. 423, c. 76</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/38">Donation is and should remain a philanthropic act. It is in that act of shared responsibility that our co-existence as humans is confirmed and our society strengthened. That is not something that should or can be imposed by the state.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.1/1">I did not understand why the House of Lords Bill was restricted to kidneys. I looked into the matter but could not understand it. It was something to do with one kidney but it did not make sense ethically or practically.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/2">Obviously, we are talking about cadaveric donation, but there is the opportunity for live donation for a series of solid organs, most commonly kidneys. I believe that there is broad consensus about the efforts that need to be made to increase such donation. Indeed, there have been changes in the past few years that enabled live donation&mdash;for example, of a kidney&mdash;to go ahead, and we have seen the advent of things such as domino donation and altruistic donation. They are not as straightforward&mdash;these things are never completely straightforward&mdash;as a donation from a family member, but it is now at least possible for people who are unrelated and do not know the recipient to donate organs, although the numbers of those who do so are small.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/3">I have always thought it peculiar that it was more difficult for someone who could not be coerced by the family to give their organs. It was more difficult, if not impossible, for someone who was doing it purely altruistically to donate. In fact, there were greater restrictions on people who were not related than there were on people who were related, yet coercion can occur in families on all kinds of issues. I am sure that we can all think of how arms have been twisted in our own families on more trivial matters, but on such serious things, there is a feeling that one has to help.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/4">Changes were put in place, and there has been an improvement in the number of live donations. Clearly, that is within the remit of this debate. I welcome those changes, but I do not think that anyone is arguing that that in itself will solve the problem&mdash;for hearts, for which it is not possible, for lungs and livers, for which it is extremely difficult, or, indeed, for kidneys&mdash;even if the maximum number of donations were obtained. There is active debate on the subject in the Kidney Alliance and the renal community.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/5">I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to Chris Rudge, the Department's transplants tsar, who may be listening to this debate. He has done an enormous amount in his current job and in previous jobs to promote all the issues, even though he recognises, I am sure, that there is not full agreement, and that good people can have different views on opt-out. I had not realised that I would have so much time in this debate. I reassure hon. Members that I will not seek to fill out the available time, although it is tempting and I could. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I accept those sedentary comments. However, I do have an opportunity, with the permission of the House, to go into some detail on the taskforce report on opt-out. I hope that I will not overdo it.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/6">Several things need to be said about opt-out. I am now of the view that &quot;presumed consent&quot; is the wrong terminology, from whichever direction one comes. It is the wrong terminology for several reasons, which I shall not go into&mdash;indeed, they are set out in an important part of the report. Although I do not speak for the BMA on this matter, it will probably seek to engage with the Government on changing the wording. We are not talking about a consented thing. There is not consent under the current system. It is an authorisation, and that is why Scotland&mdash;as I always say, &quot;as so often&quot;&mdash;has it right. This is an authorisation process; it is not consent. It is not possible for relatives to give consent, let alone informed consent, for someone who is dead. They do not have ownership or the right to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/7">What they can do under the current system is authorise&mdash;they are invited to authorise. An opt-out system would have default authorisation. It is much healthier to get away from the use of &quot;consent&quot;, popular though it was when the Human Tissue Act 2004 was going through Parliament, because we were talking about events in Bristol and Alder Hey in which consent was the issue and consenting processes had not been adequate. However, I never argued, and other people should not have argued during the passage of that Bill, that we were talking about an issue of consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/8">It is important to stress that the current system is not one of informed consent. Therefore, no one is proposing to move from a system of informed consent to one of non-informed consent or presumed consent. Under the current system, even if someone puts their name on the organ donor register, there is no record of the basis on which they do so. When people sign a consent form for an operation, under best medical practice there are clear professional guidelines and doctors have a duty to ensure that the consent is valid and appropriate. We do not know on the basis of what information people choose to have a donor card or put themselves on the organ donor register. Putting their name on the register is an indication of their preference. It is wrong to imply that that is informed consent, when we do not even require informed consent in the American sense in normal medical practice. We require appropriate consent. Consent is a process, and the amount of information that patients want will vary from case to case. For that reason, it is wrong to call the process of registering on the organ donor register &quot;informed consent&quot;. If it is informed consent, it is hard to understand why relatives are invited to veto that, as they are, for practical reasons.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-20a.150.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" speakername="Evan Harris" colnum="150"  time="015:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081120/halltext/81120h0003.htm#08112070000215">
	<p pid="a.150.1/1">Indeed. I hope that there is broad consensus in the House&mdash;or at least among right hon. and hon. Members in the Chamber today&mdash;that we can change the terms. There is clearly a difference between an authorisation being an opt-in or an opt-out. I am not seeking to change the terms of the debate. There is clearly a difference. The issue is what the default position should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/2">Why should one support an opt-out system, and what factors are necessary in order to do so? It has been suggested that it would have to work for it to be the right thing to do. I do not think that that is the case. I happen to think that it would work. However, we would never know; we would have to look at what the evidence suggested. There is good evidence that it would work, and I will say later why I do not agree with all the conclusions of the taskforce report. But that is not the only issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/3">What is the right thing to do? There is an argument in principle, which I accept must be countered by practical arguments, because even if an opt-out system was ethically right in principle, if there were risks in pursuing that and we did not have the evidence that it would work, those would be good arguments for not going with the principle. However, I feel strongly that the default position should be to save lives. I am not happy with a system in which the default position is not to use organs that could be used because someone has not specified that they do not want them used. It is wrong to allow so many organs to be buried or cremated with their owners when those people would not have objected to the saving of lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/4">The default situation at the moment means that people die while waiting. With an opt-out, whatever the other arguments, it has to be recognised that the default&mdash;the do-nothing position&mdash;is saving lives. Then one gives people an opportunity to express their autonomy by withdrawing that authorisation and opting out. The moral arguments for moving to that position are strong and, if they were the only arguments I would say that they were irresistible. I was disappointed not to see that discussion in the summary report, although it may be in one of the 447 pages of annexes, of which I have only read a couple of hundred so far. They are not available in print, so I had to print them off or read them online. I regret that that issue was not raised in the summary report.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/5">The other question is, does an opt-out system work? I was surprised by the conclusions in the summary report, which said that it did not work, because I remember seeing good evidence that it did. So I went to the systematic review, which is a process that I strongly commend. There is nothing methodologically wrong in seeking a systematic review of the methodology of published peer-reviewed papers on the subject. Opinion can be safely excluded. There are plenty of opinions published in review articles on both sides of the argument, including a number by Dr. Matesanz, who is cited many times in the summary report. But opinions do not pass muster in a systematic review of the evidence. So his opinion that it does not work is, like my opinion, discounted when looking at the evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/6">The summary set out clearly the inclusion criteria for the studies that were considered. It explains what are good methodologies and what it is hoped that studies would comply with and then it analyses which studies do comply. It lists the studies that are excluded and included. Some of the studies are between-country studies, trying to control for all the factors that vary between them, including road traffic accident rates, to see if there is a difference that can be aligned with an opt-out system, compared to countries with an opt-in system.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/7">Then there are in-country studies, where the rates of organ donation are looked at before and after a change in the system. The summary says this, on page 33 of annex N, paragraph 3.3.3, in respect of the between-country trials:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Of the eight studies that investigated the impact of presumed consent law on donation rates by comparing data from different countries, four had no major methodological flaws and a sufficiently robust analysis to provide reliable results. However these are not experimental studies&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/9">clearly&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/10" class="indent">&quot;and any relationship between organ donation rates and presumed consent (or other factors) is one of association only and not cause and effect.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/11">In other words, such studies are a clue, but one cannot say that something is definitely so, although if one has tried to adjust for confounding factors, they are informative. The summary continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/12" class="indent">&quot;All four studies use regression analysis on national data from between 17 and 34 mainly European countries. Three of these studies found that presumed consent was statistically significantly associated with increased rates of organ donation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/13">Three out of four found that association after a regression analysis and found that it was significant. It continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/14" class="indent">&quot;One study reported that a presumed consent regime provided additional donors, but this result was not statistically significant.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/15">So it does not go the other way. It was not three versus one; it was three versus nought and one with no comment. The summary said:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The estimates of the magnitude of the effect of presumed consent varied. Two studies reported an approximately 20-30% increase in organ donors, and the other studies reported increases of 2.7 and 6.1 donors&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/17">per million population. The summary concludes, without saying much else in between, I have to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/18" class="indent">&quot;Thus, although overall the evidence suggests that presumed consent law is associated with increased organ donation rates; there are also other important factors that are associated with the variation in organ donation rates between countries.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/19">I do not disagree with that. I have never argued that it would close the gap. I looked at all the papers that the review looked at before it looked at them&mdash;I have them here in a fat file&mdash;and came to the same conclusion. I find it curious that the summary report does not seem to reflect that conclusion on the between-country studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/20">It is important to look at the between-country studies&mdash;the before and after studies. The overall conclusions say:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/21" class="indent">&quot;Taking the limitations of the included studies into consideration, the summarised findings are...The between country comparison studies overall point to presumed consent law being associated with increased organ donation rates (even when other factors are accounted for) though it cannot be inferred from this that the introduction of presumed consent legislation per se leads to an increase in donation rates. The before and after studies&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/22">I cannot find the details at the moment&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/23" class="indent">&quot;suggest an increase in donation rates following the introduction of presumed consent legislation, however it is not possible to rule out the influence of other factors on donation rates.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/24">Even the before and after studies show exactly the same conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/25">Those are the two sorts of study that the evidence group examined, and that is all that anyone will ever get from such studies. A prospective controlled study cannot be carried out experimentally; any study must be observational with a control for confounding factors. I cannot understand how that was translated into the summary report in the way that it was, and I should be grateful if the Minister commented on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/26">The between-country studies are interesting. Belgium is the key country, because it introduced a soft system of opt-out, which is what is being proposed for this country. What Austria does is not as directly relevant to the debate in this country. Two studies in Belgium found a significant increase in organ donation, and they show that that was sustained. I do not understand why Dr. Mantesanz&mdash;I understand why the hon. Member for Eddisbury quoted him&mdash;said that he did not know of any country where increased organ donation rates were sustained after the change of law to an opt-out system, when it is clear from the taskforce's figures and the studies that it reports that Belgium is one such country.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/27">I am not saying that that is clear evidence or proof that that resulted from presumed consent or opt-out, but Dr. Mantesanz made a different point, and it cannot be sustained. That is why opinion should not be given the same weight as published studies. Time and again in the report, the opinion of one person from Spain is cited over and above the summary of the evidence from the systematic review. Given what I have just said about sustained rates of donation, one problem with opinions&mdash;I say the same about my opinion&mdash;is that they are not as valuable as studies. I am sure that if Dr. Matesanz went through what I have said, he would be able to pick holes in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/28">The studies conclude that the system works in Belgium, although cause and effect cannot be proved. However, we must consider something that was not studied. Antwerp did not introduce the soft opt-out system, even though the rest of the country did so, and Belgium changed the law. The hospital in Antwerp found that there was no increase in organ donation, which suggests that it was the change in the law and the operation of that change that made the difference, not simply a national publicity campaign that was associated with the change. If presumed consent is introduced, the donation rate may increase because of all the fuss, public debate and information, and that would be welcome. But Antwerp was not cut off from the national media, or from the parliamentary and media debate, or from information campaigns. It just did not operate the system, and it did not get the change. That is powerful evidence, but it was not included because it was observed and was not part of a study. There is therefore even more evidence for what I am saying.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/29">Turning to the taskforce's report, I should like to make a few comments on its approach. This is not a criticism of any individual&mdash;and I regret that because we are having this debate so soon after publication, I have not had a chance to write to the taskforce, but I intend to do so&mdash;as I admire and know many of those who serve on the taskforce, but some of the things they say are strange. Paragraph 1.15 says:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/30" class="indent">&quot;The systematic review of research evidence commissioned by the Taskforce revealed an apparent correlation between high donation rates and opt out systems in countries around the world.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/31">That was the least it could say, because that is what the study showed. The systematic review could have shown something else, and it if had shown, or suggested, that the system did not work, it would have made that clear. It continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/32" class="indent">&quot;However, the reviewers found that presumed consent alone does not explain the variation in organ donation rates between the different countries&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/33">that is a statement of the obvious&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/34" class="indent">&quot;Many other factors affect donation rates.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/35">That, too, is a statement of the obvious. However, it is not a rebuttal of the main finding, but it reads as if it is. We know that all sorts of factors are involved, but the systematic review suggests that opt-out works.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/36">Paragraph 1.9 of the report&mdash;and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston raised this&mdash;says that</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/37" class="indent">&quot;some intensive care staff in particular fear that a move to an opt out system would make critical care more difficult and could lead to some intensive care practitioners themselves opting out of participation in donation programmes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/38">Some people may have said that, but I do not think that there is a shred of hard evidence that doctors would stop doing their job on the basis of their personal views. Plenty of intensivists think that giving relatives the chance to veto a donor card or registration is outrageous, but nevertheless they go along with their duty as a doctor. I cannot believe that doctors would stop doing their job. No one is suggesting that under the soft system of opt-out, relatives would not be approached if there was an unregistered opt-out. I am surprised that that was thought to be such an important assertion that it was included in the summary report without the opposite view that some intensivists are less enthusiastic about the system that they operate at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/39">Paragraph 1.10 says:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/40" class="indent">&quot;The working group considering clinical implications also heard powerful evidence&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/41">I emphasise those words, as the systematic review was not called powerful evidence&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/42" class="indent">&quot;from recipients of organs who stressed their need to know that organs had been freely given by donors and their families, and from donor families who often find great comfort in being an active part of the decision to donate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/43">I pay tribute to the families who have given permission, and I have the utmost respect for patients who have received an organ: I wish them well. During my clinical years, I worked to improve their welfare, and I have devoted a considerable amount of parliamentary time to that, too. However, if we ask someone who has successfully received an organ under the current system whether they believe that that system works, and they say yes, that is not surprising. Canvassing an unbiased sample of people for their opinion would make any conclusions truly powerful, but that would mean asking the relatives of people who did not receive an organ and who died as a result. Obviously, one cannot ask dead people what they think about the fact that they died for want of an organ that a donor would them to have&mdash;the donor's relatives, however, refused to give consent&mdash;because, I would argue, we have an opt-in system, and not an opt-out system, so the organs were lost because they were buried or cremated. However, it does not appear from the summary report that the relatives of such people were sought out. I allege that those people are the losers&mdash;and they would claim the same&mdash;under the current system, because we do not have the increased donation rate that the systematic review suggested might result from opt-out. I do not understand why the taskforce did not do that, unless it sought to gather evidence solely to back a certain opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/44">The taskforce asked relatives who had said yes what they thought about having a chance to do so. They naturally said that they valued that opportunity, and the fact that the time of their bereavement they could make a decision to give life to someone else. That can be comforting&mdash;I do not deny that ,and there is research evidence to suggest that that is the truth. However, I cannot find any evidence in the summary report to suggest that people who said no were approached. We know that 40 per cent. of relatives consistently say no despite the fact that&mdash;as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston and others have said&mdash;only 10 to 15 per cent. of people would want their relatives to say no. I do not believe that every time that 40 per cent. see a newspaper, television or soap opera storyline about the fact that the lives of three people per patient can be saved and transformed by an organ donation, they do not regret saying no for understandable reasons at a time of grief. Were those people sought out and asked whether the current system left them in a bad position? I cannot find evidence from the summary report that they were. Will the Minister reflect on whether that was done and, if it was not, whether the report and evidence base is appropriately balanced?</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/45">Paragraph 1.12 of the report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/46" class="indent">&quot;We heard support from members of the public and patients' groups for the principle of informed consent&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/47">The ethics committee clearly specifies that it is not informed consent. Unfortunately, in chapter 1 of the report, the taskforce does not point out that that is the wrong question to ask people. I support informed consent when it is appropriate, but I do not support relatives guessing what authorisation they should give at the cost of other people's lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/48">Paragraph 1.13 of the report refers to faith leaders:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/49" class="indent">&quot;some faith leaders we spoke to warned of the potential for provoking anti-donation feelings and even active anti-donation campaigning.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/50">There is no evidence&mdash;most faiths support organ donation&mdash;that any faith would overturn its principles and say from the pulpit that because saving lives is now the default position everyone should opt out. The report does not suggest that faith leaders said such a thing; it is just a remark. In fact, we know from campaigns against animal research that having an active campaign provides the opportunity to put the merits of the issue&mdash;it raises the profile of the cause and is educative.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/51">Finally, in my critique of the report, I want to draw attention to a bias. The report states that the taskforce is concerned&mdash;and I recognise this concern&mdash;that, under an opt-out system, some people may not want to donate, but would be too apathetic or disorganised to opt out. I do not think that the taskforce means that in a judgmental way, but those are the terms that it uses. Such people might suffer a loss of autonomy if their organs were used because they had not registered an opt out or informed their families&mdash;under a soft system the families would be asked if there was an unregistered opt out&mdash;of their decision. There would be a risk of a loss of autonomy, and if there were a small number of such people, that would be a negative thing. I accept that.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/52">That is not the only question. There is no mention in the summary report of a second loss of autonomy which is even greater and costs lives. The first loss of autonomy that I mentioned saves lives: on the one hand, there is a loss of autonomy but, on the other, lives are saved. I would like to put on the record the fact that that may well be a price worth paying under an opt-out system. What about the people who, like me, under the current system, like me, value the opportunity for our organs to be used after death and do not like the fact that someone could be asked, &quot;What do you think?&quot; In addition, what about the all people who, unlike me, are too apathetic or disorganised to get themselves on the organ donor register&mdash;I exclude the hon. Member for Eddisbury from that, because he has brandished his donor card&mdash;but who would want their organs to be used? Up to 40 per cent. of people&mdash;not just a handful&mdash;would find, looking down on us, that their organs were not used. That is a loss of autonomy far greater than the one feared under the opt-out system, and it costs lives. That is not mentioned in the summary report.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/53">I cannot understand why the report does not take a balanced view of all three of the issues I have mentioned. I feel strongly about this issue, because so many people die while waiting for organs that one expects the taskforce in the summary report at least&mdash;the matter may be mentioned in the annexes&mdash;to ensure that its sample and consideration is not biased. I do not think that any of the individuals on the taskforce were biased, but I think that there was a loss of overview on those points. As I have not had a chance to talk to the taskforce, if it writes to me and says that I am wrong on some of those points, I would put it on the record, that I would regret that I misrepresented the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/54">We have heard that the Government's plan is to wait and see if their existing proposals work, and I wish them well. Despite the drawbacks of the report, it is difficult for me to argue while on drug classification and other things, the Government should take the advice of their expert advisers, they should not heed the advice of their expert advisers in this case. However, as I have said, I caveat that with some questions about their methods. It is understandable that the Government are going to wait and see. I cannot speak for other organisations and I do not necessarily speak for my party, but, personally, I accept that we will now have to wait for an opportunity to debate the matter again and have a free vote on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/55">I wish the Government well in their efforts, but, sadly, I do not think that we can be optimistic about getting the 50 per cent. increase in donor rates. Some 10 years ago, I introduced a private Member's Bill on the matter and was told, &quot;There are a number of things happening, so just wait and see. We're going to do our best.&quot; The Government did do their best, but there has been no change. After the Human Tissue Act 2004, we were told, &quot;Just wait and see; a significant improvement will occur by these means.&quot; So far, that significant improvement has not been made, although there have been improvements in some areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/56">The National Kidney Federation and the all-party kidney group produced a transplant manifesto, which the Government welcomed. Short of opt-out, the manifesto requested a number of things that are being implemented as, indeed, are the recommendations from the taskforce's first report. I am not confident that even if those proposals were implemented, they would significantly increase the number of organs available. The limiting factor is not capacity in the system at the moment; it is the relative refusal rate of 40 per cent. No matter how many organ donor retrieval teams there are or how many transplant surgeons there are, there will not be an increase in cadaveric organs while there is a relative refusal rate of 40 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/57">In Spain, they do both. They have an opt-out system, and then they layer on all the other things we are planning to implement. I hope I am wrong and that layering on these things without an opt-out system will bring down the relative refusal rate because there will be transplant co-ordinators who will do it better. However, I think intensivists are doing a good job already. The prospective donor audit has shown the 40 per cent. threshold to be stubborn&mdash;a little bit of progress has been made&mdash;because the question is different. Under an opt-out system, people would say to relatives, &quot;From the register, there's no reason to believe that your loved one did not want to save lives with their organs. Do you know of any unregistered opt-out, otherwise we plan to save lives with these organs?&quot; Under the current system, people have to say to relatives who are at the height of their grief, &quot;Can we have permission to take organs from this body? We don't know what they would have wanted.&quot; Relatives naturally go with the status quo. Studies show that relatives cite views such as, &quot;Surely he's suffered enough. We don't really want the body interfered with.&quot; That is entirely understandable. However, it is cruel to put the question to relatives in those terms. Those who speak to the relatives do not want to put pressure on them or put them under duress by mentioning that there are other grieving relatives who are watching someone who needs that organ die. I understand that view, but while we have these systems, we will have a problem. Elizabeth Ward, who invented the kidney donor card, has long supported an opt-out, even though it would sideline her creation. We ought to bear that in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/58">I mentioned another concern in an intervention: strangely enough, getting more people on the organ donor register, has not made any difference in the past. One would think that if relatives were told that their loved one is on the organ donor register, it would have an impact. However, it does not seem to done so, unless it has maintained the donation rate, which would otherwise drop. Although I hope that people will sign the organ donor register and discuss it with their families, I remain concerned that that will not resolve the problem. People have asked me whether the 15 million names on the register are really 15 million different people. What is the quality of that data? Efforts have been made to &quot;clean&quot; the data, and perhaps that will show a drop in numbers if it truly works. However, I cannot believe that a quarter of the relevant population is on the register. Relatives hardly ever refuse to give consent when they know of a registration or a donor card, but yet the number is still 40 per cent. It just does not add up, and I have never understood why that is the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/59">In conclusion, I welcome the debate, but I regret the fact that so few hon. Members have attended it&mdash;there are all sorts of priorities on their time at this point in the year. However, at least we have had the debate, and I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which she introduced it. I have enormous respect for the way in which the Prime Minister and the former chief medical officer were prepared to say that, on the basis of the evidence, their previously held view was not the right one. We should have more of that in politics and we should not criticise as a U-turn something that we have called for. I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Member for Eddisbury put his side of the argument. I know that he takes a different view, but I hope that he will agree that when this returns to the House, it must be given a free vote. This is not something that can be easily included in party manifestos to justify a Whip, nor is it something that will persuade those of us with strong views either way to obey a party position.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-20a.157.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="157"  time="016:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081120/halltext/81120h0004.htm#08112070000216">
	<p pid="a.157.0/1">I would like to respond to the points raised and I thank my hon. Friends for their measured and thoughtful contributions to what we all find a challenging and finely balanced debate. I start by reminding colleagues that the number of possible donors each year is between 2,000 to 3,000 people. That number is getting smaller because, thankfully, we continue to see a reduction in deaths from accidents&mdash;especially road accidents&mdash;and strokes. Increasingly, there is better care for patients with major brain injuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/2">We have looked at various issues addressed by the taskforce. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> asked about balance and posed the question of what should come first&mdash;opt-out and then reforms, reforms and then opt-out, or a combination of both. It is worth noting that Spain had an opt-out system for 10 years from 1979 without any significant effect on the rate of donations. Significant changes in Spanish donation rates occurred only after the introduction of infrastructural and other changes in 1989&mdash;changes on which the taskforce based its recommendations in the first report.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/3">I will come to the question about the point of the kidney card, the donor card and the register, but first I want to comment on that figure of 40 per cent. for families who refuse consent, which was also mentioned by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. When families are aware that their relative wanted to be a donor and had registered on the system, 90 per cent. agree with donation. That takes us back to the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1411" name="Gisela Stuart">the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)</phrase> about the importance of focusing on the bereaved families and trying to be understanding of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/4">I tried to clarify this issue during the debate. Yes, there was the old donor card, but as hon. Members have mentioned, under the Human Tissue Act 2004 that requires lawful consent. Where that lawful consent exists&mdash;the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred to a figure of 40 per cent.&mdash;there can be an override, not in law but in practice. Because the support of the family is needed to get the appropriate medical and social history, in practice, clinicians will not proceed. That is not a matter of law; they will not proceed in the face of strong family opposition. Therefore, it is not as simple as stating the case one way or the other. Like other hon. Members in the Chamber, I have held various donor cards. I am on the register and, should a tragic event ever occur, I have taken the precaution of making my wishes absolutely clear&mdash;as has my husband, who is also registered&mdash;and those wishes are to be adhered to.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/5">There are ways of proceeding but it is not a straightforward issue. From international evidence, we know that two crucial things are needed for delivering consent. As well as making the donor's intentions known, we must have a fully trained professional work force to ask the relatives for consent, and we must ensure that the family have as much time as they require. The taskforce made those recommendations and both are being delivered on. That is crucial.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-20a.159.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="159"  time="016:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081120/halltext/81120h0004.htm#08112070000222">
	<p pid="a.159.2/1">I can say to the hon. Gentleman that the situation is improving and I am happy to write to him to give him an explanation with regard to the figures that he is using, the timeframe, 1992 and the arrangements in that respect. We are seeing progress, but let us be clear; let us not understate the challenge that we face. In particular, the public debate needs to continue on why people should be on the register and why they should make it clear that they are on the register. There needs to be greater understanding generally of the importance of that for individuals and their families, should they find themselves in this position.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/2">The taskforce set out clear recommendations. I thought that I had covered them, but I am happy to repeat them briefly for the record. The hon. Member for Eddisbury wanted to know exactly what we had done. There were clear recommendations, first, on identifying all potential donors and increasing the number on the register; secondly, on how to develop stronger local systems to optimise donations from both living and deceased patients; and thirdly, on how we can strengthen the organ retrieval arrangements throughout the country to ensure that we maximise every possible opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/3">I said in my opening remarks that new funding was available. That is &pound;11 million in 2008-09 to support the implementation of the taskforce recommendations. Many of the financial disincentives that were in the system have been removed&mdash;I referred to that in my speech&mdash;and we are continuing that process. That includes reimbursement of costs associated with organ donation. I also referred to the efficiency of having electronic donor registration and an online system, which would speed up allocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/4">I said that we were expanding the organ donation work force, that the Department of Health had a national clinical director for transplantation to drive forward the recommendations, that recruitment was under way to increase the number of national transplant co-ordinators by 146 per cent. and that 29 new appointments had already been made. I pointed out that we were arranging for there to be clinical donation champions and that they would have leave to bring forward changes at local level. I also talked about extra funding of &pound;4.5 million for publicity aimed at getting more donors and more awareness of organ donation. We are making progress in relation to all the recommendations and our commitment is underlined by finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/5">The hon. Member for Eddisbury also asked about the black and minority ethnic community and said that we needed to do more in that area. I agree. The national health service blood and transplant service is funding a two-year study now to examine the reasons why individuals make gifts and donations generally and how those findings can be used to increase the rates among the BME communities. There is no obvious barrier in terms of beliefs or ethics, but that study will enable us to make progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/6">The national blood and transplant service has undergone a major restructuring in line with recommendations 1 and 2. As we have said, an executive director was in post as of <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-01">1 September</phrase>. Currently, there is capacity within all transplant units to ensure that donated organs are not wasted. In the next five years, the Department will be working actively with national and local commissioners to expand the services. That is a great challenge, particularly in heart and lung transplant services. All the new donor co-ordinators and clinical champions are receiving training. That training includes major workshops that are already in place and making progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/7">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister did not seek to intervene on, influence or steer the taskforce recommendations. All of us keep revisiting the subject of organ donation, for the obvious reasons stated today. The Prime Minister made it clear that he wished to see the debate start and he took great care not to prejudice the question. He has always made it clear that he recognises, as we all do, that this is a sensitive and complex issue, on which people have a wide range of views. Having set up the taskforce and asked it to address the issue and, like the rest of us, accepted that an expert opinion was necessary, he has willingly supported the way forward that has been outlined for us.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/8">I might point out that there were significant amounts of Government funding for stem cell research and the excellent work in my home city of Bristol by a brilliant university. The hon. Member for Eddisbury will know this. The Department will award &pound;1.4 billion to &pound;1.7 billion over the next three years for research and development. That relates particularly to the transformational agenda and translating science into activity. I am delighted, having just seen Royal Assent given to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, that stem cell research is proving its great relevance.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston referred to the very important question of the bereaved relatives and how crucial that is to the success of donations. I do not disagree with her at all. There are very good signs in the health service that work is proceeding on that issue. I do not know whether she is aware, for instance, of the success achieved by a team in Bolton, who have increased donor rates sixfold in a year by embedding the discussion about being a donor in the end-of-life care pathway. They received a <i>Nursing Times </i>award for the &quot;incredible service&quot; that they provided. Their work shows that supporting families in such difficult times can help them with the decision. My hon. Friend also made points about brain stem death testing being normal practice. That is a key role for the clinical champions, and we intend to have one in every intensive care unit by 2009-10 for precisely those reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/10">With regard to any future votes, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon&mdash;he always asks me about this and always gets the same answer&mdash;knows that that is above my pay grade, and should any discussion take place in the future, I am sure that his representations will be noted, but I am not in a position to predict what will happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/11">In conclusion, we all recognise that we have a duty on behalf of the thousands facing an anxious wait and uncertain future on the transplant lists, and that means we have to keep all our options open, so the Department will monitor progress carefully. As I said at the beginning of the debate, if we do not achieve the outcomes that we and all Members participating in the debate are clearly looking for, we will all need to reconsider our approach, and that will have to include the possibility of legislation. For the moment, it is right that we place our trust in the experts, and focus all our attention on implementing their recommendations in full and closing the gap so that those waiting for the donation of organs or tissue receive them.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/12" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/13" class="italic">Adjourned according at twenty-two minutes past Four o'clock.</p>
