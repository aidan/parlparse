	<p pid="b.181.4/1">I am delighted to have this opportunity to talk about forensic science and the sciences. Much of the information that I have gleaned on the subject comes from the Science and Technology Committee report, &quot;Forensic Science on Trial&quot;, of the previous Parliament. The Committee made a thorough study, which has helped, as has the support given by two externals, David Blakey, once Her Majesty's chief inspector of constabulary, and Professor David Barclay, formerly head of physical evidence at the National Crime and Operations Faculty, who know the score on forensic sciences from the inside.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/2">People know about forensic science: there is a magic about it; it has become well known, locally and internationally; and it is applied in the legal environment. For example, we have read in today's papers about events in Australia, where a backpacker was killed and the authorities are trying to fix someone for it. DNA technology is playing a significant part in trying to tie up the legal situation there.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/3">Natural and man-made disasters are familiar to us&mdash;the tsunami, the Pakistan earthquake, Bali, the World Trade Centre, the London bombing, the investigation of mass graves and genocide. All forensic science techniques have been used to try to identify the victims, methods or perpetrators of such violence. Indeed, forensic science is sometimes used to find out whether there has been any crime at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/4">The United Kingdom is, thank goodness, well up there with other countries and plays an international role in dealing with such events. We sent international experts, who were trained here, to help after the tsunami as part of an international effort by the international community. We remember the Harrods bomb, the King's Cross fire, the Mill Hill barracks bomb, the Clapham train crash, and the sinking of the Marchioness&mdash;the list goes on and on, and there is no likelihood that such events will cease. Forensic science will play an integral part in the work done after such events. It can help with investigations into crime, terrorism, drugs, firearms, paedophilia, sexual abuse, fraud and road crashes&mdash;the list goes on and on.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/5">We must never forget that the most important events for many of our constituents are burglaries and car crimes, which are the events to which people are exposed. I remember the fingerprints being identified on a bottle of House of Commons whisky that was nabbed from my house. During a machete fight outside a local pub, four guys were grabbed, and some of the fingerprints on the bottle corresponded to those of the young men responsible. However, the courts could not pin the theft on them, because it was not certain who had taken the bottle&mdash;all four of them had had their hands on it at some time, so the theft could not be pinned on one of them, which led to a legal situation in which some smart lawyer got them all off. However, I know who they are, and I will be looking for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/6">The UK has been at the forefront of developments, and the Forensic Science Service, which is an executive agency of the Home Office, is a major player. However, other forces are coming into play: forensic alliances involving the former Laboratory of the Government Chemist are being created; large scientific businesses with an interest in forensic science are being set up; and police forces are beginning to contract out their scientific needs. Universities can see the commercial possibilities and are offering forensic science training to police officers and others, which has led to some criticism.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/7">We often see people on television in white decontamination coats who arrive at the scene of a crime within hours of its occurring or on the following day. They come from different organisations and collect information by using toxicology, analysing DNA from hairs and fibres and examining footwear, firearms, drugs and explosive materials. A huge number of techniques are involved in the service, and we must recognise that it provides information that guarantees that police policies are based on intelligence-led information, which is extremely important. There have been many cases&mdash; I shall talk about them later&mdash;in which information has had to be revoked as new technology comes to light, so the service provides essential information.</p>
	<p pid="b.181.4/8">The report also goes into some detail about the future of the service, which was discussed in this very place a couple of years ago. Is there any intention to privatise the service, to develop a public-private partnership and to set up a Gov-co?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.182.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="182"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h01.htm#51018h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.182.0/1">At the start of the campaign about two years ago, my hon. Friend, like me and many other MPs, refused to be a silent witness to the privatisation of the service, which would have left it as the only privatised forensic science service in the world. We are relieved that the Government have given the service two years in which to demonstrate its success as a Gov-co. Is my hon. Friend concerned, as I am, that the Government are acting as both judge and jury in setting the criteria and assessing success before deciding whether to tramp further down the privatisation path?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.182.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="182"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h01.htm#51018h01_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.182.1/1">I would be concerned if that were the only input into the debate, but the debate is being expanded, and we shall hear more about that from the Minister. Other forensic services across the world and other institutions in this country are now taking that issue seriously. Partly because of the report and partly because of the parliamentary debates, forensic sciences have received a huge lift, but many of the bright people involved with the technologies are concerned, given what might happen to their service in future. The debate must be wide-ranging, and I hope that it will involve the public, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/2">There is the &quot;Silent Witness&quot; programme and the Amanda Burton factor, and we cannot turn on our televisions these days without seeing a body being dragged from a river and people working out how that person was killed. It amazes me that people love such viewing&mdash;there is a fascination about what causes death. Forensic science makes great TV viewing and, indeed, great books&mdash;in the States, Patricia Cornwell has made a mint out of writing about pathology and looking at dead bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/3">There are great opportunities to interact with other countries in providing that service, given that many of the issues that I have discussed are international, that people move about and that such information needs to follow them about. Although that sounds good and interesting, there are also problems that have to be faced.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/4">There is no doubt that DNA technology has been a tremendous boon for the service. Sir Alec Jeffreys, whom I know, gave evidence to the Committee. One day, he was doing a bit of basic research on DNA and found a variation between the DNA of different individuals. Suddenly, he discovered that each individual has a different pattern of DNA when it is broken up and run on particular gels. That serendipitous discovery shows us the value of basic research, and we never know what value such basic research might have in the applied sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/5">The national DNA database has been set up, and it is undoubtedly the best in the world. There are plans to expand it and to interact it with databases in other parts of the world, but its success raises many ethical problems and its discriminatory functions have been attacked. Who keeps the DNA? Why do they keep it in relation to innocent people or those against whom charges have been dropped? DNA may be kept for certain reasons, and I am sure that the Minister will mention cases in which it has been valuable to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/6">Many people worry about samples being kept in cases involving the innocent. In fact, Sir Alec Jeffreys, the man who made the discovery, has argued that samples should be taken from the whole population, which would cut out the argument about discrimination. That matter must be fully debated, and the public must be involved. What do they think about their DNA being held for future interest? Who has access to the data? What is the role of the police and how do they get hold of the data? Such issues will be raised later today in the ID cards debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/7">Many of the ethical problems are serious and require a full debate. For example, someone might want to obtain DNA information on the health potential of an individual concerning the age at which they will develop a serious illness. If that individual is innocent and their DNA has been kept, who would want to know such information? An insurance company would certainly like to know, and an employer might want to know, too, so dangers exist.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/8">The other issue that has emerged in the debate on holding all the DNA information on our national database is that the correlation between DNA and a person may not be straightforward. Familial similarities may occur, and I am sure that the Minister will mention cases in which a crime was committed not by the suspect, but by somebody with similar DNA, such as a brother or sister. There are arguments for holding on to information for familial reasons, but many people find them disturbing, so the matter must be debated and limits must be set.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/9">DNA technology is developing all the time. For example, Sir Alec Jeffreys told the Committee that 16 markers are required to set up an individual's profile. Years ago, when things started off, six markers were used. Now 10 markers are used, but Sir Alec Jeffreys thinks that 16 markers provide a better correlation and ensure that people are not identified by accident. If there are 16 markers rather than 10, misidentification is less likely&mdash;for example, British people involved in identifying tsunami victims have confirmed that 16 markers were used in that work.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/10">The other question is whether we should revisit cases in which people have already been convicted. The Birmingham Six were associated with the events in Birmingham not through DNA, but through chemicals, which could have come from a playing card. They got off after 16 years in prison, and the feeling was that that conviction was wrongful and unsafe. If using 16 markers is better than using 10, should we re-examine such cases to ensure that we have got things right or should we stick with what we have got? Such examples suggest that we should re-examine cases, if we feel that the technology has improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/11">I will mention the training of people who enter the service. The courses at universities and colleges are popular&mdash;there are 400 degree courses at 57 universities. People can do football technology and forensic computing, which fascinates me, although I do not know what a graduate could do with it&mdash;they might end up as England manager, if they do not watch out. Many of the courses have not been accredited and the question whether some of them are of value has been raised. The courses are certainly extremely popular thanks to books, Amanda Burton, &quot;Silent Witness&quot; and other programmes, and there is a great fascination with the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/12">We have not really examined how many jobs there are and how many people will be employed in the profession after completing courses. I am talking about the usefulness of the courses from the employment point of view, although that is not to say that they are not valuable for other activities in society. On direct employment, however, various people told the Committee that there are not that many jobs for the hundreds of students on the courses.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/13">The Committee was also told something extremely interesting: what is really wanted is people who can do basic chemistry, physics and mathematics&mdash;later, I shall explain why understanding statistics is extremely important when giving evidence to the courts. A lot of the courses require basic chemistry, physics and maths, and we should not allow our young people and those working part-time to escape the rigorous training that is necessary to enable the service to be used properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/14">The irony is that one day we were told that the chemistry department was closing at Exeter and that physics departments were closing elsewhere, and the next day the police told us that they want people to do such courses. There is a lack of interaction, and a serious discussion must take place between the Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills to see whether they can marry the courses with existing interests and future employment prospects.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/15">New technologies relating to DNA at the molecular level will be developed, and lab-on-chip technology will also be introduced. Lab-on-chip technology will mean that a scientist does not have to take a sample at the scene of the crime and return to the lab to work on it, which raises all sorts of problems associated with contamination. Instead, scientists will be able to experiment at the scene of the crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/16">Scientists will be able to get answers on where a crime happened with particular types of computer programmes. For example, Beagle&mdash;we have not seen it for a while; it ended up somewhere last Christmas&mdash;had that kind of technology. The technology exists and, with resources and help, it might be taken into the forensic science arena.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/17">I want to consider the real problem that exists when forensic science evidence is used in the courts. There have been some high-publicity cases recently, such as those of Sally Clark and Angela Cannings, who were accused of murdering their children. Members will know that an eminent expert gave evidence in the Cannings case and talked about statistics, which were later overruled. There is a question about the word &quot;expert&quot;. Yes, he was an expert in his particular field, but he did not get the statistics right. Another expert exposed that and, of course, the original statistics were overruled. That raises the questions how we use information and how we use the experts who come into court to provide it.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/18">At the Angela Cannings hearing, the judge said:</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/19" class="indent">&quot;If the outcome of the trial depends exclusively, or almost exclusively, on a serious disagreement between distinguished and reputable experts, it will often be unwise, and . . . unsafe, to proceed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/20">How the evidence is presented and how the experts are chosen are important, and a serious list must be drawn up. The matter involves more than looking for the cheapest person, the most expensive person, the biggest name, somebody with a Nobel prize or somebody with a knighthood. A bias in our legal system means that those prosecuting see the tyre marks on the road and do the tests, which means that the defence legal team come in on the back foot and must assume that the data are okay. The defence must argue about the interpretation of the data, which often concerns how the data were collected.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/21">We must get away from people with a certain charisma fascinating juries through their knowledge and excellence, which usually appertains to their qualifications&mdash;such situations must be seen to be believed. The Committee said that the best solution is, where possible, to have a pre-legal court hearing where the experts and the judge can establish where they agree and disagree and consider how important certain information is to the prosecution case. Sometimes, such information is key, and, as I have said in relation to the Cannings case, it is unsafe when a disagreement occurs. There are plenty of examples of scientific evidence creating problems, and we must find a better and fairer way to make the process work.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/22">Juries, too, are very interesting. To my knowledge, no jury has ever been consulted about how it found the scientific evidence&mdash;baffling, I imagine. Even experts sometimes cannot agree because they are expert in certain areas and not in others, so how can we expect a neutral jury to make a judgment? Before a case involving two experts comes before a jury, there should be a joint statement or an identification of the different views of the two experts. The matter should not come down to the charismatic effect of one expert over another in court.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/23">Because we have an adversarial system, we expect lawyers to find the most charismatic character, if they want to win. Lawyers are not like scientists&mdash;they just want to win. Scientists also have a bias, but they think, &quot;We know we're not 100 per cent. sure about things, but gosh, we're probably 99.9 per cent. sure.&quot; No one will ever get a lawyer to admit that. Lawyers are never wrong because they cannot appear to be wrong in the presentation of their evidence. They select the expert and the sort of evidence that is put forward, but a pre-trial meeting would ensure that that does not happen. We could try to eliminate such practices&mdash;nothing is perfect, but such a move would make it much more likely that crass mistakes will not be repeated.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/24">As for lawyers and judges, we spoke to a judge who admitted that he knew nothing about DNA technology. He did not quite say that he believed someone because he liked the colour of their eyes, but it almost got that far. We cannot allow a system that lawyers and judges do not understand to continue. That does not mean that lawyers and judges cannot understand DNA technology, but we need an educational programme. I corresponded with someone the other day who told me that they had begun a course in Glamorgan to educate lawyers about the new technologies appearing in court, so such courses exist. We must get good evidence into the legal system to ensure that it is fair, which will help to ensure that we do not experience any more sad cases that the media pick up on so avidly in this country and abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/25">More and more technology will be used, and more and more evidence will be needed in considering crimes such as terrorism. Having visited the States, the Select Committee published a report about the sort of detection technology that should be used in our underground stations, and I do not just mean CCTV cameras. Obviously, there was resistance to CCTV cameras, but they were very useful during the investigation into recent events in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.1/26">We have reached a watershed with the service, because we do not know how it will be structured or funded or how it will interact with the international situation, so perhaps the Minister will tell us a little more about those issues. We do not know how we can change the education system in universities and colleges to ensure that they are up for it and that people have the right sort of skills and information. We have a big opportunity to make the legal process appear a lot fairer to not only lawyers and judges&mdash;if they are honest about it&mdash;but the general public.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.186.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" speakername="Brian Iddon" colnum="186"  time="09:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h01.htm#51018h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.186.0/1">I am a member of the Science and Technology Committee, as I was in the previous Parliament, and it has considered forensic science in depth. Our investigation was prompted by the proposal that followed the McFarland review of the Forensic Science Service published in July 2003. The problem with the service can be summed up in one word: investment. The service needs a lot of investment to continue as it is and, more particularly, to fund new procedures and research&mdash;specifically blue sky research.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/2">There has been a considerable delay while the Government have been making up their mind about what to do about the FSS. The original intention of the McFarland review was to proceed to a Gov-co, the stage at which we shall arrive in December, and then to proceed to a full public-private partnership. Some of us are concerned about that for various reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/3">Blue sky research, which takes place in the current FSS, would suffer badly if we moved further in the direction of what some of us regard as privatisation. Once we embark on that route, there must be a profit-making service not only to reinvest some of the profits, but, if there are eventually shareholders, to satisfy shareholders' demands.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/4">I am concerned about access to the FSS&mdash;which, after all, is one of the best services in the world&mdash;for the 43 police forces throughout Great Britain. I have spent some time in forensic science laboratories across Lambeth bridge, at the FSS in Euxton, near Chorley, and at Bradford Park, Greater Manchester. Some police forces have their own forensic services&mdash;the Greater Manchester police force has one at Bradford Park&mdash;which might develop if the police find it more expensive to use the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/5">I accept that there is a global demand for forensic science, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> mentioned some reasons for that&mdash;in particular, the identification of bodies in the tsunami and other recent disasters. He mentioned also the letter that we received recently from the Laboratory of the Government Chemist Group Holdings plc and the Forensic Alliance, which are two separate providers of forensic science services. I accept that they act as providers in different ways, but they shall come together as one body.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/6">I am concerned that although the Government's requirement seems to be to drive down prices through more competitive forensic science services, such amalgamations will work in the opposite direction. A large number of providers must compete against one another to create competition in a service, and I do not think that that situation exists. I am concerned also by the step that we have taken towards privatising the FSS.</p>
	<p pid="b.186.0/7">Police access to the service is important. The police told me, and I think they told the Science and Technology Committee in written evidence, that if costs rise, they shall be more selective about the number of cases and procedures they submit to forensic science for examination. If there is to be a satisfactory conclusion to a criminal case, the more forensic science evidence the better. One certainly cannot rely on one piece of forensic evidence. Such cases often come unstuck either in court or later, when a review of evidence leads to the release of the convicted person.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.188.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="188"  time="09:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h01.htm#51018h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.188.0/1">My hon. Friend suggests that police services would be deterred from using the FSS if costs were to increase significantly. The Minister's predecessor suggested that &pound;180 million would be needed to upgrade DNA investment. Does my hon. Friend agree that the private sector would charge higher rates for access to that capital and incorporate within that a profit element, and also that it is inevitable that the police and other bodies would have to pay significantly higher charges, which would deter them from using the services in this important area?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.188.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" speakername="Brian Iddon" colnum="188"  time="09:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h01.htm#51018h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.188.1/1">That is precisely the concern that I am trying to express: costs for forensic science services will probably be driven up, which will deter the police from accessing certain aspects of those services.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/2">I am a chemist by background, and I have trained a considerable number of scientists who have gone into the FSS. One finding of our investigation was that the service preferred specialist scientists to enter it&mdash;chemists, physicists, biologists or zoologists&mdash;rather than people from all the forensic science courses that are proliferating at present.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/3">The Science, Engineering, Manufacturing Technologies Alliance conducted a good investigation of higher education and forensic science, and published a report in 2004. I advise any young person who is considering enrolling on a forensic science course to take a look at that report because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North has intimated, there is a great number of such courses and some seem absurd.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/4">For example, Canterbury Christ Church university college has scores of courses; think of a language and it is possible to study forensic science with it. It is also possible to study forensic science with theology. I have in front of me sheets full of possible courses, and it makes me wonder whether all of them are necessary and what the demand is at the end of such courses for the students who graduate from them. Students enrolling on forensic science courses must think very carefully about the courses they are entering. We are concerned about the employability of people who graduate with degrees of the kind listed in the SEMTA report.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/5">I have had some discussions with the head of the department that deals in forensic science at the university of Central Lancashire at Preston. He was so concerned about our concerns that he wrote to me. Those courses are fairly new, of course, and that the first graduates are only now beginning to come on to the job market. If I remember the figure correctly, his university recently produced 86 graduates from its first output of students. I was sceptical initially, but I was pleased that most of that first output had gone on to do something else, although not necessarily forensic science. However, it is important to bear it in mind that that is one of the best forensic science courses.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/6">Gratifyingly, many students from that university's first output went into the police force. It is good that policemen and women have an intimate knowledge of forensic science, and many more courses should be made available for police officers who do not have such knowledge, so that they can understand what the scene of crime officers have to do when they attend a crime scene.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/7">I have been to crime scenes, and I have discussed the contamination of evidence with the police and with forensic science officers. It is easy to contaminate evidence at the scene of crime, and that is often done by police officers themselves, who do not really understand the requirements of the forensic scientist. Therefore, I am very pleased that the university of Central Lancashire&mdash;if not some other universities and colleges&mdash;is producing forensic science graduates who then enter the police force. That is a good and genuine advantage.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/8">The university of Central Lancashire has also told me that the television representation of forensic science appeals to young people and motivates them to enrol on these courses. There is nothing wrong with that; those programmes are exciting them and encouraging them to study science, although I would not say in most cases that it is real science.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/9">Interestingly, the SEMTA report analyses the balance between what I call real science&mdash;subjects such as chemistry, mathematics and statistics&mdash;and forensic science. The amount of and balance between forensic and real science in these courses differs, which is why I recommend that young people read the report before embarking on such courses.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/10">Another advantage is that, when young people have been hooked by such a course and realise that they have a fascination for studying chemistry, physics or statistics, they often want to study one of the hard sciences further. The university of Central Lancashire told me that such courses have accelerated people on to chemistry courses, for example. Having attended one of those courses, people with a forensic science background with a BSc&mdash;or invariably an MSc or a PhD&mdash;in chemistry, physics, mathematics or statistics are entering the police force and becoming investigating officers, which is just unbelievable, as few people with such knowledge are members of the police force.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/11">We identified the fact that a much closer liaison is necessary between universities and the Home Office. A lot of research is taking place at the universities that might ultimately be applicable in forensic science. When the Jeffreys laboratory at the university of Leicester was playing with DNA, I am sure that it did not see initially the forensic application. So, one of our report's recommendations was that it is important for our people at the Home Office to scan the horizon, talk closely to the universities throughout the year and keep in contact with them to see whether any new technologies and experimental techniques being developed there might be applicable in the FSS. Recent events in the world of terrorism have shown how much more critical such matters are becoming.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/12">My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North referred to the courts. We are worried about the judicial process, and our adversarial system of justice might not be the best in the world. Indeed, there has been some criticism of it. There is no doubt that, if the defence or the prosecution can afford to hire a well-experienced and extremely charismatic barrister, they will probably be at an advantage over the opposition if they cannot do the same. That is worrying.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/13">The lack of knowledge throughout the judicial process about forensic science is also worrying. Juries have to consider an immense amount of forensic science during a court case, which might be one step too far. In serious fraud cases, the jury might often be held in court for months on end&mdash;sometimes years. Some such cases collapse, sometimes because members of the jury have to leave for one reason or another and sometimes, tragically, because a member of the jury has died. We are heading towards the point at which the amount of forensic science evidence might also cause cases to crack, either because they go on too long or because juries cannot reach a verdict because they do not understand the evidence. We have asked the Government to consider setting up judge-only trials in cases of complicated forensic evidence. Perhaps we have not yet reached that stage, but I am sure that we will within 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/14">We also suggested that the Home Office set up a forum for science and the law, so that lawyers on the one side and scientists on the other, with the Home Office acting as the catalyst, can discuss matters of mutual interest. That would benefit the judicial process. Training for solicitors and lawyers at all levels, especially barristers, is essential. DNA evidence can be complicated in itself, and not many lawyers fully understand the complex DNA evidence that is submitted in some forensic science cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/15">A company in my constituency, Zentek Forensics, has entered the area of forensic digital evidence. The digital world is complicated and many criminals are entering it, but this aspect goes further in that many schools are allowing information to be downloaded illegally and many teachers, even head teachers, might not be aware of it. Forensic investigation of what students are doing digitally in schools puts those schools at risk of being sued, but illegal downloading of music on to MP3s and of more seedy information from the internet is an increasing problem that we must consider.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/16">Some expert witnesses go into court for the first time with no training in court procedures. A skilled barrister, despite the honesty and straightforwardness of the expert witness, can often taint such a witness's evidence because that person lacks understanding of court procedures. That worries me. We should offer courses in court procedures and the presentation of evidence in court to all new expert witnesses who might be called upon to give evidence in an important hearing.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.1/17">Forensic science is important. It attracts the public, particularly young people, to study it at university and I am pleased that the Science and Technology Committee has presented its report to the Government, although we are not happy about some of the Government's replies and we may call the Minister to talk to us further about forensic science. I ask her to tread carefully and ensure that we preserve what is one of the best forensic science services in the world. It must remain just that.</p>

	<p pid="b.190.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> on securing this debate and on the way in which he introduced the subject. He was Chairman of the Science and Technology Committee on which I served and I recall asking repeatedly for a study on forensic science, which took place only after I left the Committee, to my great sadness. Nevertheless, with the exception of one recommendation, the report is extremely good. I shall come to the exception later because it is an issue with which I fundamentally disagree. I am also grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase> for his comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/2">Forensic science is extremely important. Its importance is increasingly relevant, not just because of its coverage on television, which the hon. Member for Norwich, North mentioned, but because it is becoming crucial to the prevention, detection and prosecution of crime. All three elements are fundamental.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/3">Our previous debates on the subject have tended to concentrate on the structure of the FSS. I shall not repeat the arguments other than to say that I am extremely dubious about the wisdom of anything approaching privatisation of probably the best forensic science service in the world and that the Government's halfway house is perhaps more satisfactory than the total privatisation that was envisaged at one stage. However, I fear that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the point made by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> that the Government are effectively acting as judge and jury in assessing the success or otherwise of the structures that they have put in place as major shareholders and major customers of the service could affect the financial performance of the FSS and thereby manipulate the outcome of that assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/4">The hon. Member for Norwich, North spoke about a number of different areas and I want to mirror his presentation in some ways. He referred to database issues, including the DNA database. He struck exactly the right chord in recognising the fundamental ethical problem with the current practice of retaining DNA samples from those who are acquitted or, indeed, not even charged with a crime, but merely investigated. A partial database leads to one group of the population who do not have a criminal record and for whom there is no reason for further investigation being available for a DNA match, while the rest of the population is not.</p>
	<p pid="b.190.0/5">Although we accept that DNA matching is largely reliable, false matches are possible. Therefore, it seems that the only ethical position is for everybody in the population to contribute to the DNA database, or for no one to contribute to it&mdash;certainly no one who has not been found guilty of an offence. It would be much more satisfactory if we had that debate openly with the public and decided on the best way to proceed. I do not believe that the present position is sustainable.</p>

	<p pid="b.191.0/1">What is the hon. Gentleman's view about a situation in which a person gets off a first charge but the DNA is kept and subsequently matches in another crime? Does that justify retention?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.191.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="191"  time="10:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h01.htm#51018h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="b.191.1/1">It does not justify the current system. It justifies holding DNA samples for the whole population, if that is how we want to operate our judicial system. That is the debate that we must have. Either we can match anybody, or we can match nobody, but to select a sample on the basis that they were once investigated and found not to be guilty of a crime, whether through the court system or later stages of the investigation, is unsatisfactory.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.191.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" speakername="Brian Iddon" colnum="191"  time="10:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h01.htm#51018h01_spnew10">
	<p pid="b.191.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is another problem with databases? If we were to move to the Gov-co and particularly the PPP position, the security of access to and ownership of databases would become a real problem. We must consider ownership. My preferred option would be for ownership to stay in the state system.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.192.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="192"  time="10:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h01.htm#51018h01_spnew11">
	<p pid="b.192.0/1">That is absolutely critical. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He makes a point that I have made in previous debates on the subject. Such a problem would arise, and it would be wrong for commercial interests to be able to buy in to the national DNA database, whether it is partial or complete.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/2">On education, I suppose that one can welcome the proliferation of university courses, to the extent that they are increasing the number of people who study sciences at university empirically, but to a large extent they have replaced the pure sciences&mdash;the hard sciences&mdash;as the preferred option for many students. I am not convinced that that is necessarily a good thing. We need far more people studying chemistry, physics and mathematics as pure sciences. Also, I worry that people may be entering courses on a false prospect of jobs that simply are not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/3">Having said that, I entirely agree and strongly support the Committee's view that such courses should be more readily available, perhaps on a part-time or sandwich course basis, to people in the police service who need to understand and to use the technologies that are available through forensic science&mdash;they are now meat and drink to every detective&mdash;and also to scene of crime officers, who need to know what they should not disturb and what they should look for on arrival at the scene of a crime. Otherwise, they are in grave risk of contaminating material that may be of crucial value later.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/4">Legal practitioners also need such expertise, which they have not yet evinced. In the commercial courts, there is a high level of technological awareness. Those who practice in such courts often find that they have to get their head around complex science or technology issues by virtue of the work that they do. The criminal Bar has not yet addressed this matter in the same way. Access to appropriate courses to bring people up to date with the latest developments in technology and to make them aware at least of the vocabulary used by experts in the sector is important. Such access would also be important for the judiciary.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/5">We are extremely good at research and development in this country, but we also have a lot to learn, particularly on crime prevention. I remember the visit, as will the hon. Members for Bolton, South-East and for Norwich, North, to the Lawrence Livermore laboratories and the amount of money that the Americans throw at crime prevention techniques. There is an association with the prevention of terrorism. That suggests that we lag far behind.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/6">I do not suggest that we can match the Americans, or that we need to replicate American research. However, I hope that technology transfer between the United States, laboratories in other countries and our services is at a high level, so that we can profit from advances and share what we have developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/7">I must add a word of caution. This is a fast-advancing area of work. Technologies are being brought on to the market for which Governments are principal customers. There is a risk of some of the dangers that there have been in defence procurement coming into Home Office procurement. We must carefully examine movements of personnel between Government in its widest sense, including the police service, and the companies involved in the research. For example, it would not be appropriate for a former Home Secretary to join a company that was a principal supplier of forensic science technology within months of leaving office and perhaps return to Government at a later stage in an associated Department. We must be extremely careful about that sort of thing. We must have a transparent system.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/8">Finally, I will deal with the area of expert witnesses, which is an important one and which the Select Committee has brought up. In some areas, we still have a dearth of properly qualified expert witnesses. That has a knock-on effect on court procedure, because a limited pool to draw from is vulnerable to the fashion that afflicts some areas of technology on occasions. That means that all the witnesses are drawing the same conclusions, which might be false, on the basis of a commonly held theory, rather than looking at things ab origine in order to make a proper assessment of the value of the evidence. For instance, there is particular lack in the area of paediatric pathologists. We should actively seek to train people in that specialty.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/9">Where I disagree with the Select Committee and with the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East is on complex trials and the removal of trial by jury. I cannot believe that colleagues are encouraging the Home Office to take another area of the courts system away from trial by jury. It does not normally need much encouragement to follow that line. I will make it plain: if courts do not understand the evidence that is before them, that is a failure of the lawyers in the room and not a failure of the jury system. It is clear that we must have lawyers who are capable of presenting complex evidence in a form that can be understood by the jury.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/10">Let us consider complex fraud. I do not want to rehearse the arguments, but it is not the jury that has caused the difficulties in the management of such cases but the fact that the judge and the lawyers have not got their act together to present the case appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/11">I was pleased with the Government's response to the Select Committee about the removal of trial by jury:</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The Government has no plans to seek to extend the ambit of this provision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/13">I have heard about there being &quot;no plans&quot; to change policies before; it is like the Ministry of Defence investing in a facility and the next day it is gone. It worries me that the Home Office may still have designs on this area, and I am sad to hear colleagues supporting that. However, I agree with them that we need much more pre-trial assessment before the judge of conflicting professional evidence, and a clear assessment of what is agreed ground that can be put before the court in the appropriate way. I also agree that, where the judge needs it, he should have readily available an expert assessor of his own in the form of an amicus curiae, who can sift the evidence and assess the relative strengths of the arguments presented by expert witnesses on either side of the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/14">I also support the suggestion that a scientific review committee should be set up within the Criminal Cases Review Commission. It is sensible and I hope that in due course it will commend itself to the Department for Constitutional Affairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/15">One final area of court procedure that was not mentioned in the report is the coroners' courts, and the increasing need not only for complex forensic science support for those courts but for that to be timely&mdash;and sometimes in large quantities&mdash;when dealing with disasters, both natural and man-made. I hope that forensic science will not be forgotten in the review and restructuring of coroners' courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.192.0/16">This is a fast-developing and important sector, and one thing it is lacking is any understanding from those who are not scientists of the complexity of what things such as probabilities and the structures of science mean. If the legal profession and the police did a better job of making themselves aware both of what is available and how it can be used, and of what such things mean in terms of their probative value, we would have a service of which we can be justly proud.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.194.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1726" speakername="Patrick Mercer" colnum="194"  time="10:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h01.htm#51018h01_spnew12">
	<p pid="b.194.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak from the Opposition Benches on t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">his subject. The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>, who is extremely well educated and learned, told me I would find the debate boring, but not a bit of it. I suspect that I am the only person present without a single science qualification to my name, but, on the other hand, I have some practical experience of forensic science in the field, which I might touch on if time permits me to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/2">I congratulate the hon. Member for Norwich, North on securing the debate, although I feel slightly out of place among three former or serving members of the Science and Technology Committee. I have looked at the report, although perhaps not in as much depth as I should. It is interesting and important. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> made the point that this is a fast-developing field, and the ignorance among people such as me is truly worrying.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/3">The hon. Member for Norwich, North talked similarly about evolving technology. That, too, is worrying, given the debates that will take place this afternoon on the DNA database and the identity card issue. That fills me with horror, although I agree that if we are to have any sort of DNA database&mdash;partial or whole&mdash;its security is crucial. Both <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase> made some clear and prescient points about the need for education at all levels, providing university places to correctly qualified people in the first place, police recruitment programmes to move people from such courses into the police, and training for judges, juries and expert witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/4">I find this matter hugely interesting, particularly because I have seen the difficulties that well-qualified and extremely experienced scene of crime officers face when millions of ignorant Army boots have stamped over scenes of crime&mdash;allegedly in the pursuit of terrorists, but probably in pursuit of souvenirs if truth be told&mdash;thereby ruining scientific follow-up and any ability of the police to do their job properly. Most importantly, the ability to prosecute terrorists is also ruined. I suggest that education should extend not only to police officers and the like, but, due to their increasing involvement, to the officers and soldiers of the armed forces. They need to understand the implications of such matters, and I shall touch on that in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/5">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome made some excellent points, particularly about judge-only trials. I absolutely accept the point put by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East&mdash;as this field evolves, so it will become much more difficult for a Joe Ordinary such as me to understand what is going on&mdash;but I would find it extraordinarily difficult to support any further restriction of jury trial in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/6">Speaking as someone who has stood in front of a court and been tried without a jury present, I found the process deeply distasteful and worrying, and I see no reason why it should be extended. I bow with all due humility to the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East when he says that that process may evolve, but I hope it will not. I hope that the Government will resist it. I make the point clearly to the Minister that the official Opposition would argue against that tooth and nail.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/7">I shall conclude, if I may, with a little homily. The largest bomb ever to be exploded in Northern Ireland, to the best of my knowledge, consisted of 3,500 lbs of mixed commercial and home-made explosive. It was packed into a white Hiace van and exploded during the middle of 1991 with deafening and highly damaging consequences. It caused no casualties&mdash;one or two people might have been injured, but no one was killed&mdash;and the target was the Northern Ireland forensic science laboratory.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/8">Why is that important? NIFSL, which was the precursor to Forensic Science Northern Ireland, was making huge inroads in the investigation of terrorist paramilitaries on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland. I watched that service develop during a couple of decades serving in Northern Ireland. It started as a series of huts at police headquarters at Knock and in the late 1980s it moved into a custom-built area, which, in theory at least, was secure from terrorism and was nicely compacted&mdash;later on, in more ways than one&mdash;so that people from different departments could have access to evidence as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/9">We saw evidence disappear into the black maw of NIFSL, where who knows what happened to it, only for it to reappear years later to become crucial in nailing a terrorist and sending him down for a very long time. That is why NIFSL was attacked.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/10">That attack was extremely successful and it destroyed a huge amount of evidence, making the legal process incredibly difficult. Most importantly, the intelligence used in making that attack came from inside the laboratory itself. It had been infiltrated&mdash;I do not know how&mdash;and detailed reconnaissance was carried out by the terrorists before they struck. They did so extremely successfully.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/11">Why am I going on about this at length? This is a developing field and terrorism will be a huge scourge upon this country. We saw evidence of that on 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase>, and it is my view that there is plenty more where that came from. I have seen societies come close to being ruined by terrorism. We need to ensure that any means we have of combating it are protected from the word go and properly funded, and due security must be borne in mind throughout.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/12">Although there may be aspects of the Forensic Science Service that could be considered for a public-private partnership, the Minister should bear in mind the experiences of NIFSL. She must understand that due to the deeply sensitive material with which these laboratories will have to deal&mdash;whether it is related to terrorism, organised crime or other crimes&mdash;above and beyond everything else, security must be the priority. Without that, we stand the chance of exactly the same happening in this country as happened in Ulster.</p>
	<p pid="b.194.0/13">This has been an extraordinarily useful debate and I am so sorry that more hon. Members were not present to hear what has been said about this interesting field. I must tell the Minister that I admire the work that the Forensic Science Service has done. It is hugely useful, but it must be properly funded and protected.</p>

	<p pid="b.196.0/1">I do not know whether having a GCSE in biology puts me ahead or behind <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1726" name="Patrick Mercer">the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase>, but I am certainly among the least qualified speakers in this debate. I am from the substitutes' bench, too: the Under-Secretary of State for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" name="Andy Burnham">the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase>, is the Minister with responsibility for this subject, but he is tied up with the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill at the moment, and with the identity cards debate later today, so I am stepping up.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/2">I am privileged to be in t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">his company. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> has championed science throughout his time in this House. I have often admired his contributions, which demonstrate the importance of ensuring that the scientific illiteracy to which the hon. Member for Newark and I have confessed is not an excuse for a lack of thoughtful, careful policy making and legislation that includes science and draws on the insights of the scientific community. If the Government were to fail to do that, then we would fail in our intention of making the best policy. Furthermore, my hon. Friend makes that point more clearly than any other hon. Member, although he is run a close second by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase>. However, I am more familiar with their contributions than those of other hon. Members, because they are on the same Benches as me.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/3">What I have found most interesting about this debate is that we have focused on that message, rather than on the administrative issues associated with the future of the Forensic Science Service, which have been at the centre of the controversies. We have focused on the specific way in which the Forensic Science Service can contribute to our police and our criminal justice system, and how it can be excellent. I am new to this discipline and the complex issues surrounding it, but the understanding and commitment demonstrated in this debate are good signs that the Government will be held effectively to account on how we deliver our planned changes to the FSS. We have an ongoing commitment to high-quality provision of forensic science. However, we will also make sure that there is continuity of service and ever-improving performance, which requires the collective effort of all criminal justice stakeholders, both now and in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East said that his Committee might again call Ministers to give evidence. The Under-Secretary will give evidence to the Science and Technology Committee when it meets on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-23">23 November</phrase>, and I will ensure that this debate is drawn to his attention, because it is important that he is aware of the issues raised today. I think that those issues will inform how he addresses that hearing and ensure that he does so as well as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/5">The Government welcomed the Committee's report as helpful and constructive, and recognised the important contribution of forensic science in detecting crime. However, we must make sure that the FSS is at the cutting edge and that it has the best investment. The independent McFarland review concluded that the trading fund model would not allow the FSS to compete effectively in an increasingly dynamic forensic science market, to deliver its full potential or to remain at the leading edge of forensic science in the UK and internationally&mdash;this debate has made it clear that that is our shared ambition. It therefore recommended that, as a first step, the FSS should be transformed into a Government-owned company with the aim of evolution into a public-private partnership, which is our current position.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/6">December 2005 has been identified as the target date for vesting as a Gov-co, and work is under way to make sure that the new organisation is set up with the appropriate powers, freedom, structures and resources to enable it to operate on a robust and sustainable basis at arm's length from the Home Office and to ensure that it completes the necessary business planning to enable success. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, who has now left, referred to how the Home Office will evaluate that process and asked whether it would act as judge and jury. Our view is that, for a number of reasons, the Home Office is best placed to determine what is best for the Forensic Science Service.</p>

	<p pid="b.197.1/1">I cannot, without notice, name companies or individuals, but I shall ensure that the Under-Secretary can answer that question when he appears before the Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.1/2">What I was saying connects with the contribution by the hon. Member for Newark, which concerned the centrality of the Forensic Science Service to Government efforts to prevent terrorism and to deter and detect crime. The best placed bodies to assess how successful we have been and what is best for the service are the police, the wider criminal justice system and the Home Office, and we will need to work with the private sector to take account of current performance, technological developments and the impact of market forces. We are best placed to decide on the wider security issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.1/3">It is critical that the Government should be as open as possible about the process. When I spoke to the Under-Secretary, what emerged was the most important message for me to communicate in this debate. He expected the debate to focus more on the structural issues, but he said that he is absolutely committed to being as open as possible about the criteria used to conduct the assessment of how we go forward, although obviously without revealing information that might be detrimental to the commercial operation of the Forensic Science Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.1/4">Specific measures to assess the performance of the Gov-co are being developed as part of the ongoing business planning process. We have developed conditions precedent to any future move to PPP as part of ongoing planning for transformation. There is no intention to conceal any performance-related information, but it would not be reasonable to disclose commercially sensitive information that could undermine the ability of the organisation to operate effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.1/5">In line with the Committee's request and in the interests of transparency, careful consideration will be given to what information would be appropriate for the public domain, and I hope that that deals with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.1/6">There was another question about police access to the service, which is critical because, following the Gershon review, the police are already under pressure. We estimate that the changes we propose to the Forensic Science Service and the procurement issues being addressed by the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities and the Home Office, will deliver reform that will give the police a strong first line of reference and better-standard tendering arrangements to allow them to ensure that they get what they need, which is the critical point, in a cost-effective way with high-quality standards. We are in a position to improve access, but we must consider what we are improving access to.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.1/7">One issue under consideration is the national DNA database, which will not be transferred to the Gov-co and the public-private partnership and which will, rightly, be retained under strong central control. It is a national criminal justice asset, a world leader and one of the UK's key intelligence databases, and it is available to the police in their fight against crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.1/8">Retaining samples is a practice that has been tested in the courts in Regina <i>v.</i> Chief Constable of South Yorkshire ex parte LS and Marper, which later made it possible to indict people whose samples were retained. The courts agreed with the present arrangements, by which the samples from people who have given consent in one investigation can be tested in another case. Why should we not move straight to universal testing? First, there is the issue of consent. Secondly, there is the question of the most cost-effective way in which to make the best progress on the database. The present arrangements, which are relatively cost-effective, provide a database that can be used to investigate later crimes.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.1/9">The retention of the profiles of people who have been involved in a previous investigation creates a reasonable balance between requiring every citizen to provide DNA evidence and the previous arrangements in which people who turned out to have been involved in other crimes were detected through DNA samples retained following a previous investigation. The present arrangements work better than an arrangement by which all samples are destroyed after a particular investigation. Frankly, a person who does not commit a crime in the future has nothing to fear from the fact that their samples are retained.</p>

	<p pid="b.199.1/1">I cannot offer my hon. Friend percentages, but because of retained DNA, there have been a significant number of successful prosecutions, including prosecutions for incidents that have resulted in death. Retention has played a significant role in the detection of crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.1/2">The Home Office has been working with the major stakeholders, including the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Police Authorities, the Human Genetics Commission and the custodian of the database to ensure that changes are carried out to improve the strength and transparency of oversight. The management of the national DNA database will be carried out by a dedicated unit initially in the Home Office, overseen by a tripartite board composed of the Home Office, ACPO and APA, with representatives permanently invited from the Human Genetics Commission. A dedicated ethics group is being developed to further strengthen independent oversight.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.1/3">The operational delivery of database services&mdash;the loading of DNA profiles and the reporting of subsequent matches&mdash;will continue to be provided by the FSS in the first instance to ensure continuity of service to the police. The separation of operational delivery from the establishment and maintenance of standards will enable value for money to be maximised, while the control of oversight within the public sector will clearly be retained. Wider consultation will take place about the most effective long-term oversight of the national DNA database and other national forensic databases, which should enhance public confidence in the safeguards and ethical controls, which are being developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.1/4">Education and training have formed one of the themes in the debate, and I recognise their importance in the forensic sciences. Higher education is not a Home Office responsibility, but the Forensic Science Society's accreditation scheme is seen as a positive step. Although the society's accreditation scheme remains to be established as the accepted industry standard, students attending such accredited courses are likely to be far better prepared to apply to forensic science employers and to attend a subsequent interview.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.1/5">I was pleased to learn from my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East that graduates of some forensic science courses are going into the police service, and I share his confidence that that will turn out to be a positive development. Some of us were a little anxious about Mickey Mouse courses&mdash;perhaps that is not a ministerial expression, so let us say that anxieties were expressed&mdash;yet the courses provide a flow of graduates to the police service. I always look forward to more graduate recruitment to the police service so that we can get the high-quality police officers that we require.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.1/6">The Home Office has close links with the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council on this subject and has held meetings with other research councils to improve links to the research community. Such initiatives will enable some blue sky horizon scanning, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North has pointed out, is important. The Home Office chief scientific adviser agreed to raise with his equivalent in the Department for Education and Skills some of the issues relating to course standards, and that conversation will continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.199.1/7">We accept that blue sky research is extremely limited at present. Only 2 per cent. of FSS turnover goes to research and development, and blue sky work is only a small part of that. In a commercial market, the commercial imperative will create pressure to increase blue sky research, and we look forward to that.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.200.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1822" speakername="Fiona Mactaggart" colnum="200"  time="10:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h01.htm#51018h01_spnew18">
	<p pid="b.200.1/1">I wish to deal with forensic evidence in courts. I know that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about it, but, if he interrupts me, he risks not hearing that part of my contribution. As he is not persisting, I shall continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.1/2">The report made several key recommendations that are aimed at improving the handling of expert evidence in court and maximising the contribution of forensic science to criminal justice. I understand that there is particular concern about requiring expert witnesses to clarify areas of agreement and disagreement before a trial takes place. I assure hon. Members that good news is on the horizon. The Criminal Procedure Rule Committee yesterday sent out for consultation some draft rules that would address that concern, and there are other ways&mdash;apart from the draft rules which, of course, will take some time to bring into effect&mdash;to deal with some of the issues about using expert forensic witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.1/3">Several other reforms that are already in place are relevant. The criminal procedure rules that were introduced in April already require parties to identify the issues as early as possible in a case, and certainly before a trial. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 lays new disclosure obligations on the defence&mdash;notably, to disclose the nature of the defence and the points on which the defence will take issue with the prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.1/4">Robust judicial management of such new tools together with the roll-out of the effective trial management programme should already be helping with the refinement of expert evidence before trial, and, in some ways, we are seeing the results in fewer cracked trials. Although I am not responsible for the FSS, I am responsible for matters of criminal justice. There are many reasons why the number of cracked trials has decreased, and they relate to not only forensic science, but the effective trial management programme, which has become more powerful and which allows more judicial activism. I am confident that the anxieties raised by the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East about jury trials, which created a great flutter with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, will not need to be brought to the fore.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.1/5">The proposal under the 2003 Act to allow, with the consent of the Lord Chief Justice, long and complex fraud cases to proceed to trial without a jury has exercised judicial concern and independent investigation of our legal system for decades. Independent reports that were absolutely committed to the jury system&mdash;for example, the Auld report&mdash;suggested that in such narrow circumstances there is an overwhelming case for considering proceeding to trial without a jury. That is what the Government intend to do, but this is not the first step. Our efforts to enable juries to understand some of the issues in complex fraud trials have not worked, but we intend to help juries with forensic science through better trial management procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.1/6">At present, I am not keen to take up the invitation offered by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East, and I hope that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is reassured. He should be reassured and, frankly, I believe that he was intentionally making mischief. However, he did not do so during the rest of the debate, and nor did any other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.1/7">We have properly focused on the important issues: the need to ensure that forensic science is given due prominence in the fight against crime and the need to ensure that we continue to be a world leader in the development and delivery of forensic science.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.1/8">I have not dealt with one point raised by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East about the planned merger of the two existing independent companies and whether that will substantially reduce competition. I think that it will increase the cost of entry to the market, which is an important issue, but having a sizeable competitor might improve the quality of service in the new independent Gov-co. One problem in any market with one whale and two or three minnows is that the whale dictates the market, which has happened in other areas. Creating an alternative with more substantial clout can create more competitive pressure. It is not certain that that is the case, but we should not assume that the merger will automatically reduce competition, because in some ways it might increase it.</p>
	<p pid="b.200.1/9">We are fully committed to ensuring that forensic science is given due prominence in the fight against crime, and our actions to establish a Gov-co will ensure that the Forensic Science Service continues to compete successfully in a dynamic market while protecting the public interest and delivering major benefits to the criminal justice system. Our forensic science services are among the best in the world and we depend on them to keep us safe and to detect crime. I look forward to that continuing.</p>

	G8 Agenda for Africa
</major-heading>

	<p pid="b.202.1/1">It is with great pleasure that I introduce this important debate. I was about to say that I look forward to contributions from other hon. Members, but not many of them are here, so instead I shall look forward with great anticipation to the Under-Secretary's response to the debate. It is surprising that few hon. Members are present because this is the first opportunity that we have had to discuss the G8 agenda, how it applies to Africa, how it is being implemented and whether the proposals go far enough to deal with the serious and intractable problems of the continent.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/2">It might be helpful if I put the debate into context. Let me take hon. Members back a few months to those heady pre-summit days, when the whole world seemed to be mobilised in the cause of making poverty history&mdash;the days of the impressive Live 8 concerts throughout the world at which celebrities and artists spoke so passionately about the cause of Africa. At the time we really believed that there was a once-in-a-generation opportunity for eight men in a room to get to grips with a serious problem. One of my overriding memories of the period is that of fingers clicking, signifying how every three seconds a child dies of poverty in Africa. At the time, however, what most impressed me was the massive demonstration in Edinburgh, when a quarter of a million people marched through the streets. They were like a human white band, united in optimism. That mass outpouring was as unprecedented as it was impressive; we had seen nothing quite like it before. Prior to the summit there was a genuine belief that the mass mobilisation would make a difference&mdash;that it would be enough to encourage world leaders and Governments to make the political commitment and commit the resources necessary to end the scandal in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/3">Here in the United Kingdom, we took the Government's commitment to lead the cause at face value. We were impressed by the way in which they placed Africa and world poverty at the centre of the G8 agenda. We watched the Chancellor look at the problems of the continent and speak to African leaders. We listened with awe as he rattled off massive, impenetrable figures in his usual manner, committing the Government to the continent. I think that we were all seduced by what was happening. I certainly was. As I marched with those people in Edinburgh, I really felt that something would happen. I was lucky enough to get tickets to the Live 8 concert at Murrayfield. I heard Bob and Bono say that they were going to Gleneagles the next day to secure a history-making deal. I was particularly delighted that beautiful Perthshire had been chosen as the location for the G8 summit. Everyone in Perthshire was excited about the event. I was looking forward to the days after the summit and to introducing &quot;the Perthshire accord&quot; as the significant moment when we turned the corner in dealing with the issues of the continent.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/4">Then, of course, summit was over. Suddenly, reality kicked in and we all sobered up pretty damn quickly. Yes, we had seen the beaming faces of world leaders and heads of Governments and heard them trumpet the summit as a great success and say what a great deal it was for Africa. Even Bob and Bono gave it 10 out of 10 and practically demobbed us from the cause, just as we had started to get the whole thing going. However, it did not seem like an historic and significant agreement. It did not read like an historic and significant agreement. It read like what it was: a welcome, but modest, set of proposals that will help Africa, of course, but do little to deal with the fundamental problems of the continent.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/5">The G8 summit just fizzled out. I accept that the London bombings happened and, quite rightly, the attention of the press focused on that. As a result, however, much of the energy that had been generated by the G8 summit was lost; it just evaporated in a most unsatisfactory way. Since Gleneagles, the familiar, more depressing images of Africa have come back to haunt our television screens, such as reports of the famine in Niger. We now know that there are great difficulties throughout southern Africa, from Uganda to Zambia and from Mozambique to Zimbabwe, where there is now a real threat of drought and further famine. Africa does not look or feel like a continent that is getting better; it looks like a continent that is continuing to get sicker. That is why we need the deal to be implemented fast.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/6">During the summer, the non-governmental organisations and the aid agencies had an opportunity to assess the G8 proposals for Africa properly. Their examination has been forensic, so now is the time to ask questions. What has been done since Gleneagles? How far have we got in implementing the commitments? Will we get measures in place quickly enough to deal with the problems that are emerging in southern Africa? Are the commitments enough even to start to deal with the crippling concoction of issues that Africa has to deal with every day? What real difference will they make on the ground? Most important, what more must we now do to secure real justice for Africa?</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/7">Before we examine all those things, it might be useful to review what was agreed at the Gleneagles summit. There was a commitment to double aid by 2010: we were told that there would be an extra $50 billion worldwide and an extra $25 billion for Africa. The debts of 18 of the world's poorest countries, most of which are in Africa, would be written off: we were told that that was worth $40 billion, and will be worth in excess of $50 billion as more countries qualify. In a welcome move, Nigeria's debt&mdash;worth $17 billion&mdash;to the Paris Club was written off. There was a commitment to end all export subsidies, although the detail of how that was to be achieved was vague. The G8 also committed to reducing domestic subsidies, although how that was to be delivered was even more vague. Almost laughably now, it was agreed that developing countries will</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/8" class="indent">&quot;decide, plan and sequence their economic policies to fit with their own development strategies, for which they should be accountable to their people&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/9">That commitment needs to be examined forensically, especially given all the stringent conditionalities that have emerged during the summer. There were other welcome commitments about tackling HIV/AIDS and improving health care generally, as well as good news about increasing access to free education. It was all good stuff and to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/10">I have reeled off the issues briefly, but the main headline was the news about debt relief and increased aid. Not even the most enthusiastic champion of the Gleneagles settlement would say that it was a great deal for trade justice. Looking at the final communiqu&eacute; from the G8, one could argue that trade justice is going backwards, given all the references to increased liberalisation, privatisation and reciprocal market access. Let us be charitable, however, and leave trade justice to the side and focus on what was said about aid and debt relief. Let us unravel those measures a little to see whether they do what they say on the tin and whether we are close to having them delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/11">I welcome immensely what was delivered at Gleneagles. It was great&mdash;anything extra to Africa has to be welcomed and everybody present should welcome it. However, there is a big difference between welcoming what was agreed and agreeing that it is enough to deal with some of the intractable issues in Africa. I appreciate that this is only the start of the process&mdash;we have taken a long time to get started&mdash;and that further commitments will be rolled out in the near future. In return, I expect honesty in terms of acknowledging the limitations of the agreement. We should examine the problems of its implementation and continue to press for the increased resources that we as a very rich nation can deliver. We could deliver so much more than we do.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/12">I know that it is in the instincts of Governments to spin&mdash;to make modest achievements look like great successes&mdash;but that is singularly unhelpful when dealing with issues such as the problems of Africa, which we must all unite to deal with. We have to be realistic and accept the limitations and deficiencies of some of the proposals. Government should also be big enough to accept the helpful criticism offered by aid agencies and NGOs. They are trying, not to embarrass the Government or trip them up, but to get the best deal for the world's poor.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/13">Let us consider the extra money and debt cancellation. During the summer NGOs and aid agencies examined the commitment and discovered that it is more fragile than we thought. Make Poverty History says that of the $50 billion of &quot;new money&quot;, only &pound;7 billion is new money; the rest has already been committed through other programmes. The amount talked about ranges from &pound;7 billion and &pound;20 billion, so I should like the Under-Secretary to say clearly how much of the package involves new money and how much of the money has been recycled from pledges already made to the continent.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.1/14">Let us look at how far the agreement extends. Only 18 countries&mdash;those that have reached the completion point of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative&mdash;will qualify for the debt relief package decided by the G8. There are about 53 countries in Africa and most of the poorest nations are excluded from the proposals. I know and accept that there is a commitment to include other nations, but will the Minister say when other countries will be included, how quickly that will happen and what conditions they will have to meet?</p>

	<p pid="b.204.0/1">I acknowledge the strength of what the hon. Gentleman is saying. However, he is not arguing, is he, that debt relief should be given, for example, to countries that are still engaged in civil war, which are likely to spend the money made available on armaments, or to countries in which corruption is so great that we could not be sure that the money would be used wisely?</p>

	<p pid="b.205.0/1">Absolutely not. We have to clearly define what we mean by conditionalities. Nobody would argue that money should be given to corrupt regimes that would waste it in their own fantasy worlds, but insisting on economic policies such as further privatisations makes a big difference and concerns the aid agencies and the NGOs. Why do we insist on those conditions being met before money is given?</p>

	<p pid="b.205.1/1">Let me deal with that now. We are not interested in further privatisations. Given the hon.

	<p pid="b.205.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I hope that the Minister will also address the UK Government's complicity in water privatisation arrangements that have failed catastrophically in Tanzania and Sierra Leone, which have clearly embarrassed the UK companies involved.</p>

	<p pid="b.205.4/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The conditionalities are a real concern for aid agencies and international organisations. The issue will be the subject of much campaigning, especially by Jubilee 2000, during the next few months. I hope that hon. Members will look carefully at the case made by the aid agencies and NGOs and support their efforts. It is important that we do that, given that the World Trade Organisation is to meet in a few months' time. Those conditionalities will be the focus of international aid, debt relief and further contributions to Africa in the next few months. I hope that we will engage seriously in that debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/2">Returning to the agreement, issues remain even for those 18 countries that are fortunate enough to be part of the process. The small print is crucial. To qualify for HIPC completion, the 18 nations have to jump through all sorts of hoops and it seems from the IMF communiqu&eacute; that more hoops will have to be jumped through in future. The IMF could not be clearer when it says that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/3" class="indent">&quot;sound policies and high standards of governance&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/4">have to be adopted by the 18 countries. That suggests that further conditions will have to be met before the debt relief is written off. I should like those statements to be clarified. Will eligibility for the programme depend on the adoption of the economic policies prescribed by the IMF and the World Bank? Many in the NGO community and among the general public think that it will be.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/5">There is also a general assumption that, on the conclusion of the agreement, the money will immediately be available for African Governments and nations to use to embark on new development programmes and to try to achieve economic growth. Governments have encouraged that attitude. However, although it is true that the 18 eligible countries will qualify for 100 per cent. debt cancellation, that deal seems to be funded by a redistribution of all the available aid for those nations. That is particularly true of the assistance being offered by the International Development Association. That is an important point, because it seems likely that, as debt is written off, the assistance given through further aid will be reduced. That is giving with one hand and taking away with the other. Some NGOs believe that the package that we are discussing will account for only 10 per cent. of the debt owed by such countries. I would like the Minister to clarify that point. Will countries receiving debt relief be subject to a commensurate reduction in the resources that they receive from the IDA? That is a crucial point.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/6">The deal also proposes that the World Bank be compensated for the extra expenditure through an increase in contributions to the IDA from the G8 and other donor nations, thus restoring its funding to previous levels. The new money is to be distributed to all 81 countries that receive money from the IDA. It will be given out in proportion to how well they conform with World Bank-approved economic and social policy. Does the Minister believe that money should be taken away when countries are given a debt relief package? Surely new money pledged should not be taken away through other sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/7">Everywhere we go in this process, our old friends the conditionalities raise their heads. That will be the subject of a campaign in the next few months, and I hope that hon. Members will participate in it. The conditionalities are actually contrary to the part of the G8 agreement that states that developing countries should</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/8" class="indent">&quot;decide, plan and sequence their economic policies&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/9">I want to find out how conditionalities match up with that clear commitment in the G8 accord.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/10">The biggest concern is whether the proposals are enough to deal with the intractable problems in Africa. I suggest that they are not. We have to get back to the clear programme set out for trying to achieve the millennium development goals. I am glad that there is now a target to reach&mdash;an historic commitment to give 0.7 per cent. of gross national income as overseas aid&mdash;but that commitment was made 35 years ago. Every year that we renege on that commitment, we short-change the world's poor.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/11">There seems to be a misunderstanding of where the figure of 0.7 per cent comes from and what it represents. The most common misunderstanding is that the 0.7 per cent. is somehow charity or a gift from the rich nations to the poor nations, but as Kumi Naidoo consistently points out, it has nothing to do with charity; it is about justice. It is reparation for what we as colonising powers did to African nations. It is about redressing the debt owed after impoverishing a continent through subjugation, slavery and brutal extraction. Once those developing countries secured their independence and started their fledgling democracies, we kicked them around like footballs during the cold war.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/12">Debt cancellation has nothing to do with charity; it is about historical redress. We knew what we were doing when we gave massive loans to corrupt, tin-pot dictators and their crazy programmes, because they were our tin-pot dictators. Let us therefore accept that the 0.7 per cent. figure has nothing to do with charity and everything to do with doing the right thing. Every year that we delay the payment, we postpone repaying our historical debt. We know that the money can be found. We need only look at Iraq: some &pound;500 million has already been spent in that war and some &pound;30 billion of debt was written off under the debt package for oil-rich Iraq. As I said at the outset, Africa must be seen to become the people's international priority. If we were to ask people on what they would like such sums to be spent, I believe that Africa would rank pretty high on the list, and a war on Iraq would probably rank pretty low, if not come right at the bottom.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/13">We face the depressing conclusion that compliance commitments to Africa made by the G8 and the international community in general have been less than robust. The Toronto-based group that considers such issues concluded that the G8 is notoriously bad at keeping its promises to Africa. That is why I have consistently called for some sort of compliance facility to monitor the roll-out of not just the Gleneagles commitment, but other commitments made to Africa over the past few decades. I have helpfully suggested that that should be based in Perthshire, close to where the Gleneagles summit took place. Is the Minister happy with the record of compliance with previous G8 commitments? Does he perceive a role for a UK-based agency that could bring together the national Governments, the NGOs and the African nations to ensure that there is proper compliance with what is agreed?</p>
	<p pid="b.205.4/14">I reiterate that I welcome what was agreed at the G8. However, I do not think that it will make poverty history. I think that poverty will be a depressing ever-present reality until we get close to getting the millennium development goals back on track and to meeting our 0.7 per cent. of GNI commitment. Kumi Naidoo said of the G8 summit that the people roared and the G8 whispered; that is the best quote I have heard on that event. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response, hopefully at full volume.</p>

	<p pid="b.207.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> on securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/2">Issues to do with international development have risen to the top of the media agenda in recent years, in large part due to this Government's prioritisation of the subject. Such political and media attention has created for those of us who care passionately about the subject a unique opportunity to effect the change that those who need development aid so desperately need.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/3">I will not rehearse the long list of policy accomplishments for which this Government can rightly take credit, other than to note with satisfaction that a great number of the world's most pressing poverty issues have been addressed seriously for the first time. As a result, aid agencies have benefited from the greatest increase in developmental spending by any British Government. That is what I want to talk about today, because it is clear that the growing role of non-governmental organisations in aid delivery gives rise not only to great possibilities but to challenges, and some of those challenges have yet to be met by the organisations that serve the world's poorest and most vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/4">In order to make the most of the time allowed to me today, I will focus on two aspects of aid implementation which I believe should be addressed as a matter of urgency: the need for greater accountability and co-operation by NGOs, particularly in emergency situations; and the need to improve the quality of facilitation and implementation in the field, where long-term development assistance is being offered.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/5">In times of emergencies, such as those on Boxing day last year in south-east Asia and more recently in the United States and Pakistan, the generosity of the Government and individuals is often swift and bountiful. The combination of saturation news coverage, plentiful funding and genuine human suffering places great pressure on aid organisations to take immediate action, or, as is sometimes the case, to be seen to take action. The era of intense competition has reached the aid community, so the need for agencies to satisfy donors, supporters and the public with regular appearances on the television and the nation's media in general should not be surprising.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/6">Many journalists and aid workers who have worked amid catastrophe often return home with stories of confusion, duplication and territorialisation among the aid community. Such anecdotal reports are no longer the preserve of hard-pressed or cynical reporters and field workers. The 2005 Red Cross disasters report confirms what many have suspected for some time. The section of the report that refers to the tsunami relief in Aceh states:</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/7" class="indent">&quot;As dramatic stories of suffering hit the headlines, more agencies poured in, expecting the worst. But aid workers arriving at . . . 'ground zero' of the western coast, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-04">4 January</phrase> were surprised to find survivors being well cared for by the Indonesian army and authorities. A scramble for beneficiaries began. Some agencies jealously guarded their information to ensure their 'niche'. Within weeks, the 'humanitarian space' had become too small for all these actors. Coordination became difficult. Out of 200 agencies present in late January, only 46 submitted reports to UN coordinators. Joint needs assessments were rare. Language proved problematic, with UN meetings held in English and government meetings in Indonesian. Without knowing who was doing what and where, some communities were overwhelmed with aid while others were neglected.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/8" class="indent">At the root of coordination problems was one key factor: too much money. Nearly everyone could hire a helicopter or boat, make their own needs assessments and distributions, and 'fly the flag'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/9">I commend and fully support the Red Cross for taking the bold decision to publish such a forthright account of the aid situation. As policy makers, we must rise to the challenge set by the report and act with impunity against aid agencies that operate without the interests of the suffering as their only priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/10">There is often a political vacuum in areas of conflict or humanitarian crisis. The United Nations commands deep respect and a degree of legitimacy, but it is not legally mandated to co-ordinate and control such situations. If a UN representative witnesses non-co-operation or bad practice within the aid community, what can they do? The answer all too often is nothing. That is unacceptable and must be remedied to ensure best practice at all times and in all places.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/11">The second aspect of aid implementation is the delivery of long-term assistance. Spending on aid to Africa has historically been low. The Government have been redressing that in recent years, and soon they will be spending &pound;1.25 billion on aid to Africa each year. That should be celebrated as a welcome step, not a modest one, towards enabling African recovery.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/12">Success with local economic development initiatives in Africa has often proved stubbornly elusive. However, that should never be used as an excuse to avoid investment in such initiatives; it should inspire us to gain a deeper understanding of the areas of greatest weakness in poverty-alleviation schemes. Often the weakest links in the chain from donor to recipient are those who are charged with implementing and facilitating development on the ground. We often talk about the lack of capacity in communities receiving assistance, but we also need to focus on the lack of capacity in the agencies charged with implementing aid. Such agencies include governmental as well as non-governmental organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/13">Aid work relies heavily on those charged with implementation of assistance, and the vast expansion in community-based development initiatives of recent years has placed a strain on agencies' capacity to recruit staff of adequate abilities and experience who are willing to work in remote and isolated places. As a major donor, this country must consider that factor. In addition to spending on projects, investment in human resources and in education systems that provide training on aid implementation would be a great asset to African development.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.0/14">Thanks to this Government, the aid community is better resourced than at any other time. Now is the time to rise to the challenge set by the people of this country who have been so generous and who have such high expectations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.209.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" speakername="Greg Mulholland" colnum="209"  time="11:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h02.htm#51018h02_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.209.0/1">I, too, welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">the debate secured by the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase>. Although I am speaking from the Back Benches, I am proud to be making my first parliamentary contribution as my party's junior spokesperson on international development. I have had an interesting journey. Probably like many of us, I was one of those campaigners who sent those now very annoying postcards that we receive in our inboxes all the time. At least I know that they work and that hon. Members and the Government sit up and take notice. I am not sure whether my staff share my passion for the postcards, as they are the ones who have to deal with them.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.0/2">I have another passion, which I share with the hon. Gentleman: music. I have also contributed in a small way to popular music. My musical career in no way emulated his successful one, and I have accepted that my career is now in this place rather than on the stage. Nevertheless, there is an interesting parallel. In this House and elsewhere, there is cross-party approval of certain types of music and certain bands, and a real passion. My only regret is that we have no representation in MP4&mdash;perhaps that may change.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.0/3">On issues of such importance to Members on both sides of the House, we must as far as possible, to continue with the musical metaphor, sing from the same hymn sheet. What did the G8 summit at Gleneagles really achieve? I strongly disagree with some of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">the comments of the hon. Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase>. This is not a time to look at the Government's proud record, or at the fact that Bob Geldof gave the summit 10 out of 10. The Secretary of State for International Development said that 2005 is an extraordinary year for development, but not a single NGO would agree with that statement in any way, shape or form. I am afraid that we have seen a little too much back-slapping, and we have gone from that to back-pedalling. That is why I welcome today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.0/4">I want to focus on what the G8 did not implement but should have implemented in order to respond in any meaningful to the extraordinary Make Poverty History campaign. I was pleased to see the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire at the MPs' event in Edinburgh, as I was to see hon. Members from all parties in the Chamber. That was important. At the G8, not enough was done about aid, not a lot was done about debt, and trade was not even on the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.0/5">Of the $50 billion of new aid promised, only $20 billion is new money and has been delayed until 2010. Debt relief of $1 billion has been promised, but leading NGOs acknowledge that $10 billion of relief is needed. Even the $1 billion of debt relief is largely conditional and the hon. Gentleman touched on that. On trade, not only did we not get an answer, the question was not even posed. There has been much discussion in the House about the importance of targets, and every member would sign up to the millennium development goals, yet world leaders are sitting and watching them go by.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.0/6">To give some stark examples, research from the leading NGOs, CAFOD and Oxfam, has suggested that we will achieve the millennium development goal of universal primary education in sub-Saharan Africa not by the target of 2015, but by 2133. Will the number of people living on less than $1 a day be reduced by half by 2015? No, the goal is set to be achieved by 2150. Will the goal of reducing the mortality of infants under five by two thirds be achieved by 2015? No, it will be 2165. That is 150 years too late. Between 2003 and 2015, there will be 42 million infant deaths in developing countries worldwide. That is the price of inaction during the next few years. It has been said that $50 billion is needed every year to achieve the millennium development goals, not just a total of $50 billion, of which $20 billion is not new money, and only then by 2010. Who said that? Was it Oxfam, Save the Children or CAFOD? No; it was the United Nations and the World Bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.0/7">I return to the Make Poverty History campaign, because I have been a campaigner for much longer than I have been a Member of the House. We must all respond positively to that extraordinary coalition of hope, but there is a danger that it may become a coalition of disillusionment. I spoke at a recent event in Yorkshire and told campaigners not to give up, because we are listening and if they do their job and keep on our backs, we will do our job and keep on the Government's back. The Government can do their job by keeping on the backs of world leaders and the G8 to ensure that they deliver on the limited promises that were made and continue to push for those things that were not promised.</p>
	<p pid="b.209.0/8">By any stretch of the imagination, 2005 has not been an extraordinary year for development. We have had a limited start, but I hope that through debates such as this we will do our bit to keep the subject on the agenda. It is then up to the Government to push for more and better, so that we can see some results. Perhaps then the millennium development goals can be achieved within 50 years, if not by 2015.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> on securing this important debate. We do not have enough opportunities to debate such important issues and to ensure that we keep Ministers on their toes, to scrutinise promises made in various international forums, and to maintain the pressure not only on our Government, but on Governments throughout the world, and particularly in the G8. The hon. Gentleman, who for good geographical and constituency reasons had cause to follow closely what happened at the G8 in July, has a strong and established passion for the issue, which came across clearly in his opening comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">The hon. Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> made some strong comments in support of the Government's commitment to Africa. I do not question the sincerity of Ministers or of the commitments that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">they have made. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> mentioned that the Secretary of State said that 2005 is an &quot;extraordinary year for development&quot;. Perhaps he meant extraordinary from the point of view of our opportunities to progress the development agenda. In those terms, this year has been fantastic. We have had the G8 summit. The Government have shown their passion for moving the agenda forward during their EU presidency. The UN summit last month and the important world trade talks in December mean that this is a year of great opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/3">However, I am worried by the issues that are at the core of this debate. We have to separate spin from substance. My hon. Friend described the back-slapping euphoria of Gleneagles. One can understand why Ministers from our Government and Ministers and leaders from the other countries involved wanted to respond to the passions of the millions of people involved in the Make Poverty History and Live 8 campaigns by saying, &quot;We have gone a long way. On each headline issue of debt, aid and trade, significant progress has been made.&quot; Part of the difficulty is that when responding to that level of euphoria, passion and concern, politicians are tempted to overstate the case. As time has passed since the conclusion of the G8 summit, some of the euphoria has evaporated and some of the reassurances given have unravelled. As my hon. Friend said, we have woken up to find that not only are we at least a century away from meeting the millennium development goals, but a lot of the commitments made at the G8 summit are not quite what we thought they were. They certainly fall a long way short of where a lot of people think the development agenda should be. The impression was given that campaigners had forced world leaders to push the boulder to the top of the slope, and that because, following the world summit, poverty had been made history, it was just a question of pushing it down the slope.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/4">I do not put aid at the top of the agenda for international development. I have always considered trade the most important element in making poverty history in developing countries in a sustainable way. The headline target for aid to developing countries during the last 30 years has been 0.7 per cent. of gross domestic product. Until this year, there was a commitment globally to contribute 0.3 per cent. in aid to developing countries by 2006, but we have not even reached that yet. The promises made this year&mdash;the year of Africa, following the Commission for Africa and the G8 summit&mdash;will push that global figure from 0.3 per cent. in 2006 to 0.36 per cent. by 2010. Although several countries' contributions may be increasing faster than others', the outcome of the process&mdash;of the euphoria, the efforts and the commitments made&mdash;is an increase of 0.06 of a percentage point over a four-year period. That is a realistic measure of the impact of that process.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/5">On the basis that Africa generally receives about half of the aid that is budgeted for, the result of the efforts of the G8 summit in relation to aid can be summed up by saying that Africa will receive an increase in aid of 0.03 of a percentage point by 2010. Putting the matter in those terms, rather than quoting large figures in billions of pounds or dollars that are given over a particular period of time, puts it into context and helps to bring home to people that a great deal more work needs to be done than was apparent from the impression given in the press conferences following the G8 summit.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/6">Many people followed the debate on the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria that took place in early September in London, which I am sure was very ably chaired. The result of that debate was that we fell well short of the replenishment targets. A figure of $3.5 billion was agreed on for the global fund, rather than the $7 billion target that was the aim.</p>

	<p pid="b.212.0/1">I am sorry to have arrived late, but I am fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's remarks. Does he remember that right at the end of the G8 summit, the focus was very much on governance? After the bombings in London that day, the issue seemed to disappear off the agenda. However, the last question at the last press conference was from a journalist who asked, &quot;What are you going to do about the governance question?&quot; Will the hon. Gentleman be good enough to elaborate a little on his thoughts on that subject? It is an area that seems to have been overshadowed.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.213.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="213"  time="11:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h02.htm#51018h02_spnew10">
	<p pid="b.213.0/1">The hon. Gentleman raises a reasonable point. There is a cross-party consensus that one cannot overlook the serious questions relating to governance. One can throw aid, debt relief and favourable trade arrangements at some countries, but the poor in those countries will not necessarily see any benefit unless the poor governance and corruption is sorted out.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/2">I will move on to the claims made by the international community about governance and aid and the impact of some of the conditions attached by international organisations such as the IMF when aid budgets are delivered. I visited Kenya in early September, where attempts at delivering AIDS, HIV, tuberculosis and malaria programmes are severely constrained by the lack of trained nurses on the ground. There is clearly a capacity issue. However, in the agreement between the IMF and the Kenyan Government, a cap is clearly set on the appointment of civil servants by the Kenyan Government. Civil servants include health workers, teachers and others. When I asked health and government officials about appointing more nurses&mdash;there are trained nurses in the country who are unemployed&mdash;they explained that the problem was not capacity or potential; nor did they believe that there was a limitation in the longer term in terms of the aid that they could potentially draw down. The difficulty was that they were simply unable to appoint the number of nurses that they felt were required to deliver the programmes. We must be careful that, when offering assistance, we do not place artificial limits on countries' ability to deliver aid programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/3">I certainly do not deny the importance of ensuring that, at every stage of a programme, careful consideration is given to whether it is more effective to deliver the aid by bypassing the Government and using aid agencies&mdash;because of known corruption and the lack of capacity in the Government to manage those programmes&mdash;or whether it is better to go through the Government. That is a matter of judgment. I doubt whether the situation is helped by the cutting of desk officers at the Department and the withdrawal of commissions from Africa. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/4">The promotion and protection of an open, independent media across Africa&mdash;an element that, despite efforts to include it, was omitted from the Commission for Africa report&mdash;could make a significant contribution to governance. If anything can ensure that, after parliamentary delegations have come and gone, there is a sustained campaign to hold Governments to account, it is a strong, effective, independent, robust and open media. The media do not necessarily have to be based in the states that need the changes the most, provided that they have the capacity to communicate across those countries. We should address that a great deal more.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/5">The Minister might want to reflect on the opportunities offered by the trade talks to be held in Hong Kong in December. If we are going to make significant progress on making poverty history and meeting the millennium development goals in Africa, my party believes that one of the greatest opportunities will be provided by ensuring that there is an adequate trading relationship between the west and African countries. We should not insist on the economic partnership agreements pushed by the European Union, but instead ensure that we have more tailor-made approaches that allow for more pro-poor and pro-development trading arrangements. I think that the Government are sympathetic to that view. We need to make sure that such options are protected in the trade talks in December.</p>
	<p pid="b.213.0/6">We also need to ensure that we can communicate with the millions of people who attended Live 8 concerts and Make Poverty History marches&mdash;I joined the one in Edinburgh. There needs to be more transparency in the trading relationships between multinational companies and developing countries in Africa, so that when people walk into their supermarket or sports shop they can be reassured by the chief executive of those companies that their purchases do not contribute to the denigration of the very people whose poverty they have just been marching in order to make history. There are great challenges ahead, and a large number of questions have been raised. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in response.</p>

	<p pid="b.214.0/1">I add my congratulations to those of o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">ther Members to the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> on securing this important debate at this vital time. He spoke with great passion and knowledge of the subject. However, I must confess that I do not agree with everything he said, and I certainly do not subscribe to his view that the main moral driving force behind aid budgets is some sort of reparation for colonial wrongs. There is a much more up to date moral force behind them.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/2">I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">the hon. Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> for making an interesting speech. Her analysis of the pros and cons of NGO movement deserves further consideration, and I hope that she will continue to contribute to debates on this important issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> delivered an extremely informative and knowledgeable speech, particularly on the millennium development goals and the clear failure of the international community to have even a vague semblance of a chance of meeting them by 2015, as was programmed. Indeed, it is apparent that in 70 countries to date, the millennium development goal targets for 2005 are not going to be met.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/4">I am keen to put on the record that my party shares the aspirations of the Government as set out at the G8 meeting. We want the commitments made in Gleneagles to be implemented. We support the Government's target of 0.7 per cent. of GDP being spent on aid by 2013. We agree with the millennium development goals. We also support the Government in the HIPC initiative, as that has the potential to relieve the burden of debt on many African nations, as well as on countries elsewhere in the world, and not just on those 18 that have currently met the criteria. We also recognise that fundamental reform of the global trade rules is essential if Africa is to trade itself out of poverty, and we agree in principle with the initial international finance facility, with its specific focus on immunisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/5">However, it is worth reminding the House of what was actually agreed at Gleneagles, as the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire did. In addition to the doubling of aid and the aspirations for trade and debt, the G8 countries pledged to provide extra resources for conflict resolution; to enhance support for democracy and effective governance, as was highlighted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase>; to stimulate growth and build trade capacity, and not only in the context of the WTO; and to boost investment in education and health, particularly in relation to HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. We must not lose sight of those other important issues as we focus on aid, debt and trade.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/6">No previous summit has promised so much for the world's poor, and it is vital that the momentum be maintained. The Conservatives agree with the aspirations expressed, but it must be remembered that the key to success is in delivery. This debate gives us the opportunity to ensure that the countries of the G8 and the wider world fulfil their commitments to Africa. That is essential if we are to see a change to the continent's fortunes. The starting point is to ensure that the agenda agreed at Gleneagles is continued under the next G8 presidency. Can the Minister assure the House of Russia's commitment when it takes over the presidency to continue with the goals for Africa that were set out at Gleneagles?</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/7">Alongside the Government, we are committed to working towards the UN target of spending 0.7 per cent. of our national income on aid. It is essential, however, that that aid be used to its maximum potential. There is some evidence to suggest that UK bilateral aid has the potential to be more effective than much of the multilateral aid that is provided. Currently, a quarter of DFID's aid budget is allocated through the EU, which is widely recognised as one of the least effective channels: only 52 per cent. of the aid that goes through the EU goes to low-income countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/8">Although we are aware of the additional aid announced at G8, we believe that quality of aid is just as important as quantity. The time scale over which that money is delivered and allocated is vital. If all the extra aid pledged were delivered now, it could lift 300 million people out of poverty in the next five years. However, as the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West rightly pointed out, the time scale for the delivery of that additional aid is slipping, and much of the money will not be received until the end of the decade. Will the Minster provide a clarification of the time scale for providing the aid money pledged at Gleneagles? Will he also outline the channels through which the extra aid will be spent and how much of it is proposed to be channelled through direct budgetary support?</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/9">The last Conservative Government led the world in providing debt relief for developing countries and I am pleased that the current Labour Government are continuing on that course. Before the HIPC initiative, heavily indebted poor countries were spending more on debt servicing than on health and education combined. Eighteen countries have benefited from the HIPC initiative so far, and up to 38 could receive debt relief in future. However, that debt relief applies only to debt owed to the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. What progress is being made to make sure that the countries that would benefit from debt relief get 100 per cent. relief, regardless of to whom the debt is owed? Furthermore, will the Minister clarify whether debt relief will be taken from existing overseas development aid budgets, despite previous commitments to cease double counting?</p>
	<p pid="b.214.0/10">Debt relief is vital if African Governments are to have more money to spend on health care, education and infrastructure. However, the G8 debt deal will provide less than $1 billion extra this year for those vital facilities. Furthermore, questions have been raised about whether some African Governments are using this money for those vital services. Will the Minister assure the House that sufficient transparency and accountability mechanisms are in place to ensure that the money from debt relief is used specifically to alleviate poverty? Will the Minister also confirm that money from debt relief will be used in tandem to pursue meeting the millennium development goals?</p>

	<p pid="b.216.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that for those of us who feel passionately about the African problem and the alleviation of poverty, the question of how much aid is given has to be paralleled by the extent to which there is a proper audit of how it is spent and where it goes? Is he aware of my International Development (Anti-corruption Audit) Bill, which would have requirements for external audits when there was any uncertainty within the mechanisms of the public accounts committees of the countries concerned about where money was going and whether it was being properly deployed? It does not matter how much money is provided if it is going to the wrong place and not being properly audited. I know that the Under-Secretary is interested in such matters and I should be grateful to know through my hon. Friend whether he is willing to make his views known.</p>

	<p pid="b.216.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention. I am aware of my hon. Friend's Bill. It is extremely interesting and deserves further consideration. It is fair to say that there is worry not only among Opposition Members, but at DFID, about the budgetary support mechanism. Furthermore, there is concern at DFID offices in Africa that the structures are not in place to ensure the degree of transparency and accountability needed to assure us that British taxpayers' money is being spent properly and effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.216.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is making an important point about accountability and transparency. Does he agree that we do not want to put in place in those countries complex systems that make it impossible for them to start running the aid programmes? When I was in Kenya, I saw that several aid programmes could not proceed because of the inability to appoint accountants to administer the required accounting arrangements. However, simple bookkeeping followed up by robust auditing would have been adequate to at least start the aid programmes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.217.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" speakername="Mark Simmonds" colnum="217"  time="11:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h02.htm#51018h02_spnew15">
	<p pid="b.217.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fair and reasonable point. A balance must be struck between ensuring that British taxpayers' money is spent wisely and properly for the purposes for which it was intended and trying to encourage African Governments in particular to be responsible and accountable to their people. The balance between those two often contradictory facets is exactly what DFID needs to focus on in the coming period.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.0/2">The G8 communiqu&eacute; made a commitment to provide rapid and flexible multilateral and bilateral debt relief for post-conflict countries. Will the Minister explain exactly what that means, to which countries it applies and how it fits in with the HIPC initiative? Is it linked or is it separate? I welcome the progress of the G8 countries on debt relief, which promised $48 billion per year by 2010. However, according to Oxfam's figures, approximately $30 billion of that sum will be spent on debt relief specifically for Iraq, a point made by the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire. Can the Minister confirm whether such a large proportion of the money pledged is, in fact, for Iraq? Are Oxfam's figures accurate?</p>
	<p pid="b.217.0/3">If the Government are serious about implementing the G8 agenda for Africa, trade reform is fundamental. While aid and debt relief are essential, economic development, wealth creation and pan-African, as well as international, trade offer the best hope for long-term sustainable solutions to poverty and suffering in Africa. History is littered with protectionist folly. Further protectionism is not the answer, as is evidenced by foreign inward investment, export-driven economic growth in China and elsewhere in south-east Asia where, in the past 20 years, 500 million people have been lifted out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.0/4">Conservative Members believe in removing export subsidies and import tariffs. We are committed to a timetable for the dismantling of all trade-distorting agricultural policies by 2013. We recognise that the current policies of the United States and the European Union are damaging and immoral, and that they cause widespread suffering, particularly&mdash;although not exclusively&mdash;in Africa, as farmers cannot obtain a fair price for their crops. It is widely acknowledged that African cotton farmers are competing with the US Treasury, not US farmers, and that the EU spends billions of euros subsidising farmers. We welcome President Bush's recent pledge to cut farm subsidies by 60 per cent. over five years and to reduce import tariffs by between 65 and 90 per cent. Unfortunately, the G8 leaders failed to set a conclusive end date for those harmful export subsidies. Will the Minister make a statement today on what progress is made, especially within the European Union, as only this morning the international press published reports of intransigence in some European Union countries, which are insistent that extensive agricultural subsidies be retained? What progress does the Government realistically believe can be achieved at the WTO meeting in Hong Kong in December?</p>
	<p pid="b.217.0/5">If Africa is to lift itself out of poverty, it is crucial that economic partnership arrangements are reassessed, the rules of origin are redrafted and tariff escalations by the developed world are minimised. International trading agreements are immensely complex, but it is essential that we have an international framework. If the WTO meeting fails, there is a danger that the whole international framework could start to unravel. Current trade restrictions are the biggest impediment to economic development and poverty reduction in the developing world.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.0/6">There is no doubt that increased aid, reduced debt, and freer and fairer trade were the most high profile parts of the G8 communiqu&eacute;, however, the countries made further commitments which also must be implemented if African countries are to graduate from aid dependency to being fully functioning democracies with successful economies.</p>
	<p pid="b.217.0/7">It is accepted that the millennium development goals will not be reached. In May, the Minister admitted in this Chamber that at the current rate of progress, the goal of free primary education for all will not be achieved until 2130&mdash;115 years late. I do not blame him personally for that target being missed&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.218.1/1">The UN estimates that an extra $6 billion is needed to meet the target of free universal primary education alone. The world has already failed to meet the sole millennium development goal for 2005. Despite that, the G8 did not pledge any extra money to help the world to reach the targets. There needs to be a significant attempt to ensure additional aid, debt relief and increasing trade are used to make greater progress towards meeting the millennium development goals. During the G8 meeting, the nations made a commitment</p>
	<p pid="b.218.1/2" class="indent">&quot;to provide extra resources for Africa's peacekeeping forces so that they can better . . . resolve conflicts in Africa&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.1/3">Efforts such as these are crucial if Africans are to become safer. On a recent visit to Gulu in northern Uganda, I witnessed the night-commuters&mdash;20,000 children walking up to 17 km each way from their homes to sleep in the town of Gulu, so they are not abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army. The G8 countries promised to train 75,000 troops by 2010, to prevent such atrocities. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what progress is being made on that important front.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.1/4">The Government will find Her Majesty's Opposition supportive of the G8 aspirations, but robust in ensuring delivery and holding the Government to account. We hope that they deliver on the promises that they and the other G8 members made at Gleneagles. There is still much work to be done, particularly in Hong Kong in December, if the G8 agenda is to be delivered and implemented.</p>

	<p pid="b.218.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> on securing the debate and on giving us the opportunity to explore the G8 commitments and the progress that we have made so far.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.2/2">Like other hon. Members, I saw the extraordinary outpouring of support for development expressed through the Live 8 concerts, the march that took place in Edinburgh, which my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for International Development and the Chancellor attended, and the Make Poverty History campaign. That helped to put development at the centre stage of 2005 in a way that we have not seen in this country since the Birmingham G8 summit, when the Jubilee 2000 campaign was very active. We are seeing progress, albeit considerable progress remains to be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> rightly reminded us about the scale of the challenge and how off track we are with many of the millennium development goals. More than 300 million people in Africa live on less than $1 a day, up from 227 million in 1990. Lack of employment opportunities and the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS are the causes of that rise in poverty. Those figures alone are a powerful reminder of the need to continue to focus on development and not to allow the momentum that has begun to be rebuilt in 2005 to fade away.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.2/4">The Government remain determined to use the various opportunities available to us from 2006 onwards to ensure that the momentum of 2005 is not lost. We must remember that it was the Government's decision to put Africa at the heart of our G8 and EU presidencies that provided a focal point for the development of that momentum and the attention that it rightly received this year. Our commitment has also been demonstrated through hard cash. For the first time, we as a country have a target date to achieve the UN objective of spending 0.7 per cent. of our national income on development assistance. We spend nearly &pound;1.25 billion of our development budget on Africa, and money for development and assistance has trebled. The fact that the Secretary of State for International Development has a seat in the Cabinet for the first time is a sign of the Government's continuing commitment to the development agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.2/5">I do not accept the point made by the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire that momentum has somehow fizzled out since the G8 summit. The media may have moved on to other issues, but I have not felt any less busy since then or that the agenda is any less important, and neither have my colleagues in the Government. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the important UN millennium review summit, which provided an opportunity to capture the commitment of G8 leaders and the international community to the development agenda and to achieving the millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.2/6">There is support for a peace-building commission and an international humanitarian fund&mdash;two visible signs of the continuing momentum. We hosted the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria replenishment conference, at which further resources for the fund were generated. That is an encouraging sign of continuing progress and momentum&mdash;although more resources are needed&mdash;as is the fact that the European Union is, under the auspices of our presidency, debating its relationship with Africa and how we can continue to support Africa, not only with hard cash, but on issues of governance and economic development.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.2/7">I also disagree with the lament of the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West that no trade deal was done at the G8 summit. It was never going to be done at the G8 summit, because that is what the December World Trade Organisation talks are for. There was considerable debate among the G8 leaders on trade, especially about export subsidies. The hon. Gentleman will, I am sure, welcome being reminded that in our manifesto for the last general election, Labour made a commitment to push for the elimination of export subsidies by 2010; we continue to make that case. In addition to the WTO talks, and to keep the momentum going, there is the fast-track initiative conference in China in early December, which will provide another opportunity to galvanise international support and further resources for the provision of free primary education. Although, the media, sadly, moves on to other things, the momentum is anything but lost. Hopefully, there will be other opportunities for the media to return to these issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.220.0/1">I have no wish to diminish the progress made this year, of which the Minister has just reminded us. He pointed out that the Secretary of State for International Development has a seat in the Cabinet, but is the sense of priority and proportion right? We give tens of millions of pounds to help those displaced by the conflict in Darfur&mdash;indeed, we may have given as much as &pound;100 million over the past few years&mdash;but compare that to the &pound;5 billion spent on the military operation in Iraq over the past three years, and the $10 billion internationally that goes into the humanitarian reconstruction in Iraq?

	<p pid="b.220.1/1">The Prime Minister's commitment to the development agenda is spot on. He has made it clear that he wants us to use the EU presidency to make a continued effort to secure the outcome that I expect we all want to see: a development round and progress in Hong Kong that helps to give the poorest countries of the world genuinely fair access to the world's trading markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> alluded to the fact that there is considerable debate in the European Union about how we achieve an outcome that is in the interests of developing countries and the rest of the world. Part of the reason for the Prime Minister's commitment to the EU presidency is that at the end of it, we must represent the EU at those trade talks. Several hon. Members have said that we need development and debt relief; however, we must have fairer trading rules if we want long-term, sustainable routes out of poverty.</p>

	<p pid="b.220.2/1">I pay personal tribute to the Prime Minister and to the Secretary of State for International Development for focusing, as the Minister said, on that fundamental question, but I return to the issue that I raised when I spoke at the Jubilee 2000 campaign meeting in Birmingham and on other occasions with my good friend Bob Geldof: whether we can turn the issues into practical applications along the lines of the Bill that I proposed, and of which the Minister is aware. Without external audit, I am afraid that putting money into the system will not get it to where it needs to go, because of the corruption throughout some of those countries. Will the Minister be kind enough to concentrate for one moment on that question about governance? Will he support my proposals or not?</p>

	<p pid="b.221.0/1">The hon. Gentleman will learn about the Government's response to his Bill later this week. I do not accept his premise that governance in Africa is uniformly bad and that corruption is endemic in every country. There are issues about governance, however, and at the heart of the Commission for Africa is the notion of partnership: developed countries have a responsibility to provide more aid; equally, developing countries, particularly in Africa, have a responsibility to ensure that the money is used well to reduce poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/2">Linked to the point made by the hon. Gentleman, I also do not agree with the tone&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;of the review of Africa by the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire. The sense that Africa continues to be a basket case and continues not to make progress came across in his remarks. I accept his point that the international community needs to provide support in the cases of Niger and the southern African food crisis, and he knows about the considerable amount of money that we have put in.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/3">We are seeing substantial progress throughout Africa already&mdash;not least the exciting sight in Burundi of a Government having taken a decision to abolish user fees, and hundreds and thousands of new children turning up to school wanting to learn, now that the barrier of being charged for education has been taken away. The international community has begun to provide support to increase the number of classrooms to train more teachers. In sub-Saharan Africa, women's parliamentary representation&mdash;this relates to governance&mdash;has doubled since 2000, which shows that further progress has been made. An extra 1 million children have been enrolled in schools in Kenya since the Government there took the decision in 2000 to abolish school fees. There is progress throughout Africa, and we must celebrate it, while recognising that considerably more must be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/4">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire asked me several specific questions about debt. Some 18 countries have qualified for the debt deal, and its implementation will begin in 2006. The deal is for 100 per cent. relief of the multilateral debt. Up to 38 countries could qualify, and that brings the potential total benefit to those countries to $55 billion. There is no new aid conditionality attached to the relief. Countries are simply required to reach the completion point under the HIPC initiative, which requires assurances that the money that is saved by no longer paying debt servicing is spent on poverty reduction. Additional resources will be provided to the World Bank and the African Development Bank to compensate them for the debt relief funds that will be needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/5">The hon. Gentleman asked about conditionality more generally. As I said in my intervention on him, the Government have made it clear since March that our aid is not conditional on particular policies being followed by Governments. They must decide for themselves whether they want to privatise or use co-operative models or NGOs. It is for them to make the decision. However, we do attach several safeguards in respect of how the aid money will be used. We expect the countries to have robust financial systems&mdash;that links to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the point that the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> made about the need to have confidence that money is well spent. By way of slight deviation, the spending of money is already audited and monitored in many ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.0/6">The second safeguard is that the money must genuinely be used to tackle poverty. It must be invested in improving health or education, or on other priorities of the country. Thirdly, there must be respect for human rights in those countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.222.0/1">I am sorry that the Minister characterised my summing up of the state of Africa in such a way. I was in the Democratic Republic of Congo this past summer and saw real progress towards securing democracy in that country. I recognise some of the great achievements that have been made on that continent.</p>
	<p pid="b.222.0/2">I would like the Minister to address my point about IDA funding and resources for some of the HIPC initiative countries. Will there be an impact on the IDA funding for all the countries whose debt will be cancelled? If so, can he confirm that the amount that has been pledged for debt relief will be seriously diminished?</p>

	<p pid="b.222.1/1">IDA funding is a concessional arm of the World Bank. We are waiting for figures from the World Bank on the total cost of the debt relief package. We have a responsibility to make up the shortfall&mdash;we pledged to do that&mdash;and it will be one of the things for which we will be held to account.</p>
	<p pid="b.222.1/2">The hon. Gentleman asked about conditionality employed by the World Bank. He may be familiar with the fact that, at our request, the World Bank reviewed its conditionality and agreed to a set of good practice principles on country ownership and allowing a developing country to make its own decisions. That is a good step forward. We will have to see how those guidelines work in practice, but we welcome the World Bank's move in that direction. I hope that the hon. Gentleman also welcomes it.</p>
	<p pid="b.222.1/3">The concern of the hon. Member for Stone about good governance and corruption and the need to continue to address such issues was picked up by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness. As I indicated, Africa is already making good progress on good governance and corruption, albeit there are one or two high-profile exceptions to that trend. By the end of 2005, Kenya, Mauritius, Ghana and Rwanda will have completed the Africa peer review mechanism, which is an opportunity for African countries to review how their peers are making progress on the issues. By the end of 2006, Uganda, Nigeria, Algeria, Mali, Mozambique, Lesotho, Sierra Leone and South Africa will also have been reviewed by their peers&mdash;12 countries in all. We shall continue to work with national Governments to enhance transparency in the management of public resources and accountability in those countries. Domestically, we are hoping that by the end of the year Parliament will have ratified the UN convention on anti-corruption. Obviously, it is crucial that we play our part in further efforts to tackle corruption.</p>
	<p pid="b.222.1/4">Let me come to the point that the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire made about the opportunity to hold G8 leaders to account, and his interesting idea of a centre for G8 monitoring in Perthshire. The Africa Partnership Forum should, in our view, be the key body for monitoring the commitments of the G8, as it brings together key leaders from Africa and key players from the UK and elsewhere. Earlier this month, we hosted the fifth meeting of that forum. It was agreed that we should focus on G8 monitoring through a joint action plan. I hope that that will help to lay the foundations for an effective monitoring process. However, we welcome the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. As he will be aware, it is one of a number of proposals to bring in a wider audience to monitor implementation of G8 commitments. A series of civil society groups wants to get involved in that process. He may be familiar with the Archbishop of Cape Town's proposal for an African monitor arrangement, and might want to discuss with the Archbishop their proposals sit together. The last thing that we need is duplication of monitoring arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.223.0/1">The Minister knows that the centre of gravity of my thoughts is whether the audit will be</p>

	<p pid="b.223.1/1">The debate on monitoring that the hon. Gentleman has kicked off is not unhelpful, but he needs to recognise that there is already considerable external audit, carried out, for example, by the National Audit Office. The International Development Committee monitors carefully how my Department spends its money.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> was absolutely right to highlight co-ordination. In March, the development assistance committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development convened a meeting of all major donors to seek improvements in how donors operate within a country, so that duplication and the number of monitoring missions that donors inevitably institute in developing countries are reduced. For example, we know that there are huge numbers of monitoring missions on HIV and AIDS in developing countries. They inevitably use up valuable civil service and ministerial time and often ask very similar questions. If the international community can be persuaded to work together more effectively, we should be able to release time for civil servants and Ministers in developing countries, to get on with the business of improving health, tackling HIV/AIDS, improving education, and so on. At the same time, however, we should make sure that the right questions are asked about how the money is being used.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/3">My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to how non-governmental organisations operate on the ground, both in relation to the tsunami and with regard to long-term development. A number of NGOs work extremely effectively and in a very responsible way&mdash;one thinks of the Disasters Emergency Committee. It was clear from the tsunami and from long-term development work that some NGOs are not so responsible and could improve the way in which they operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.1/4">I congratulate the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire on convening this first formal opportunity for the House to consider progress since the G8, but I gently remind him that we are not at the end of 2005. We have always regarded the G8 summit as a key point on a journey to increase momentum towards the millennium development goals. We will not solve all of Africa's problems this year, but I hope and believe that we will make progress. We continue to be optimistic that we will secure a good deal for developing countries in the WTO talks. As he and others rightly say, we need to translate the commitment to more aid and debt relief into practical progress on the ground, through such things as universal access to antiretroviral drugs. We have continued to see progress, but we know that there is more to do. We look forward to playing a continued part in that process.</p>

	Oil Transfers (Firth of Forth)
</major-heading>

	<p pid="b.225.1/1">East Lothian has one of the finest coastlines in the United Kingdom and attracts 2.5 million visitors every year, with all the obvious advantages for local communities, including the employment of approximately 3,500 people in the tourist industry. The coastline stretches for 69 km from Cockburnspath north to Musselburgh; its beauty is valued by local and visitor alike.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.1/2">The East Lothian coastline is of outstanding natural heritage; 90 per cent. of it is classified as being of biological, ornithological and geological interest, forming part of the Forth special protection area. The coastline also has nine designated bathing waters, from Seton Sands down to Thornton loch. There are designated shellfish harvesting areas around the Forth estuary, including the coastline from Dunbar to north Berwick. Anyone travelling on the east coast main line will see its breathtaking beauty at first hand. Over the summer recess, I was extremely busy in surgeries and correspondence with constituents determined to protect the beautiful coastline on their doorstep.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.1/3">The issue that has caused consternation and alarm among local communities in East Lothian is the proposal to transfer oil from ship to ship in the firth of Forth. Melbourne Marine Services, a Sunderland-based company, wants to transfer 7.8 million tonnes of crude oil from Russia off the coastline of East Lothian, with no benefit whatever for the area and its communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.225.2/1">My hon. Friend may know that there is a transfer facility at Hounds Point on the River Forth, which lies in my constituency. During the tenure of Tam Dalyell, the former Member of Parliament for the area, there were a number of spillages because the equipment was insufficient. I support my hon. Friend: there should not be another terminal in the firth of Forth given that, at last, the one at Hounds Point is working correctly.</p>

	<p pid="b.225.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, which I hope the Minister heard. It is an example of the point I want to illustrate; I want to move on to those who are totally against the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.3/2">Three local authorities have voiced very strong doubts. Fife county council deputy leader Alex Thompson has suggested that ship-to-ship transfer represents the biggest single threat to Fife in the history of the council. That is how seriously Fife council takes the matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.225.4/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate, which will be very helpful to my constituents in central Fife, who are clearly affected by the proposals. I am sure that she is aware that the council unanimously opposed the proposals, and a unanimous decision in any form of politics these days is unique. We must take careful consideration of that, and I hope that the Minister takes cognisance of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.4/2">Following this debate, I have a meeting on this very subject with my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department for Transport, and concerned people from my constituency. A number of issues have not been made clear. Does <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase> accept that investment along the River Forth, which, as she rightly points out, affects many constituencies, has been tremendous? The benefits of the investment in jobs and the tourist industry have been tremendous, and there is no indication of the benefits to our constituents of the proposals. There are health and safety issues that have yet to be clarified. Those issues must be considered seriously before a definite commitment is made to go ahead with any proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.226.0/1">I am glad that that intervention was made, too. It is great that Fife council and East Lothian council can come together with the appropriate MPs and MSPs&mdash;that is also happening in the case of Edinburgh.</p>

	<p pid="b.226.1/1">To complete the picture of the constituencies and the authorities along the Forth, I should say that, as my hon. Friend knows, Edinburgh city council has expressed its objections to the proposal. Considerable concern has also been expressed by local community organisations, including Newhaven community council and Leith harbour community council in particular. Does my hon. Friend agree that what is significant about the proposal is that concern about it has been expressed not just by the local authorities and experts but by communities and individuals in her constituency and right along the tidal stretch of the Forth, on both sides of the firth?</p>

	<p pid="b.226.2/1">Of course I agree. That was another helpful intervention. It is great that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet. I hope that the Minister takes on board how strongly we, collectively, feel about this issue. I am glad that Edinburgh city council is firmly against the proposal and is on board. My local authority has said that there is nothing to gain from ship-to-ship oil transfer and that all that we would gain is</p>
	<p pid="b.226.2/2" class="indent">&quot;the inherent risk of a huge crude oil spill.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.226.2/3">At the outset, East Lothian council, to its credit, decided to oppose the proposal. I congratulate the chief executive, the provost, the deputy leader, the leader and all the councillors on their stance on this issue. Since then, others have followed suit, including Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. More importantly&mdash;this is crucial&mdash;the people of East Lothian, in their thousands, have opposed the proposal. They are up in arms about it and are writing to the press and to me. My mailbag is full. It is one issue that everyone feels strongly about.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.2/4">All the organisations and individuals have clearly identified the economic, as well as the environmental, threat that would exist if the scheme went ahead in the firth of Forth. In recent years, millions of pounds of public money has delivered major improvements to the coastline and beaches of East Lothian. That investment should never be put at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.2/5">Hon. Members may ask whether there is a genuine risk from the proposal for the ship-to-ship transfer of oil. The answer is yes. The transfer of 7.8 million tonnes of crude oil, involving hundreds of ships, is an accident waiting to happen. The hazards include oil spills, vessel collision, fire and explosion, environmental emissions, damage to coastal and sea-bed habitats, financial implications, damage to tourism and damage to fishing. I am sure that most of us remember the 1993 Braer disaster off Shetland and the devastation that the oil spill caused. We need to stop this proposal in its tracks. When there were ship-to-ship heavy oil transfers in Lyme bay in Dorset in 2003&ndash;04, Devon and Cornwall councils got together to oppose that and the transfers were stopped. I do not want them to start. As recently as March 2004, the Swedish company Brostrom Tankers AB was fined &pound;20,000 and ordered to pay costs of &pound;11,000 after oil leaked into the firth of Forth.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.2/6">I have had many conversations about where I was born and brought up and the constituency that I represent. I was born in Fife and I represent East Lothian, so I have seen the firth of Forth from both sides and it is a sight to behold. I have written to the Secretary of State for Transport to ask him to listen to opponents of the proposal. Edinburgh has been mentioned. We are also talking about East Lothian council, Fife council, East Lothian civic organisations and most importantly, as I said earlier&mdash;I cannot emphasise this enough&mdash;the East Lothian people. None of them wants the coastline to be put at risk as a result of ships transferring 3,000 tonnes of crude oil every hour. That is a real danger, and my constituents with my help will oppose the proposal. I hope that the Minister has listened carefully to what has been said and that he will agree to meet a small delegation from the affected areas around the firth of Forth with a view to resolving this environmental and political hot potato as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.227.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1977" name="Anne Moffat">my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Anne Moffat)</phrase> on securing this debate. I listened carefully to what she and other hon. Friends said about the issue and the concerns that they expressed. Members of Parliament will be meeting the Minister of State, Department for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, this afternoon. I heard what my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian said a few moments ago about meeting a delegation of residents and other organisations from the area. We will give that consideration and write to her as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/2">Ship-to-ship transfer is an internationally recognised practice, which takes place worldwide. Voluntary industry guidelines were issued under the aegis of the International Chamber of Shipping and the Oil Companies International Marine Forum and set out the procedures to be followed when carrying out ship-to-ship transfers. A new and updated edition of those guidelines was issued earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/3">Ship-to-ship transfer operations have been undertaken globally for many years and have a very good safety record. In UK waters particularly, ship-to-ship transfer operations have an excellent record on both safety and the environment. Ship-to-ship transfer operations at Scapa Flow in Orkney, Sullom Voe in Shetland and the Nigg oil terminal in the Cromarty firth have not given rise to any spills that caused damage to the environment. It is worth noting that Scapa Flow recently saw the 25th anniversary of such operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/4">Ship-to-ship transfer operations can provide substantial economic benefit to the locality in which they are carried out, the most prominent example in the UK being Scapa Flow. Consequently, the UK would certainly not wish to undermine the practice of ship-to-ship transfers. Instead, our concern is to ensure that such operations are regulated and managed appropriately so that they are carried out safely and with minimum risk to the environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/5">The ship-to-ship transfers that we now see are predominantly transfers of persistent oils. There must be adequate safeguards in place, otherwise any spill may result in environmental damage. We must ensure that ship-to-ship transfers take place only when there is a fully worked-up oil spill contingency plan with trained personnel and the necessary equipment for responding to a spill close at hand. That means managing the practice of ship-to-ship transfers so that they take place only in areas where the harbour authorities have suitable oil spill contingency plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/6">Turning to the proposal to carry out ship-to-ship transfers of oil in the firth of Forth, I can tell the Chamber that at an early stage my Department's Maritime and Coastguard Agency determined that the Forth Ports current approved oil spill contingency plan does not address the specific risks associated with ship-to-ship transfers of persistent oil in the Forth Ports harbour authority area. The agency determined that a revision of the contingency plan was necessary to take those risks into account and to incorporate the necessary safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/7">The legislation governing that process is the Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention) Regulations 1998. It is a normal requirement for ports throughout the UK to have an oil spill contingency plan, and detailed oversight of those plans is a matter for the agency as expressed in the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/8">It is the function of the oil spill contingency plan to address the risk of an oil spill, resulting damage to the environment and harm to human health from the full range of activities carried out in the port. Consequently, for ship-to-ship transfers to be carried out within a harbour authority area, the authority must first have an approved oil spill contingency plan which addresses the specific risk presented by such activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/9">Guidance issued by the agency&mdash;Contingency Planning for Marine Pollution Preparedness and Response: Guidelines for Ports&mdash;required that the Forth Ports proposed revision of its oil spill contingency plan be put out to consultation before being formally submitted to the agency for the Government's approval. The list of consultees included the local authorities for the area concerned, the Scottish Executive's Environment and Rural Affairs Department, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Scottish Natural Heritage.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/10">I am aware of the important seminar that Fife council hosted on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-10">10 June</phrase> to discuss ship-to-ship transfers, with particular reference to whether such activities should take place in the firth of Forth. I also want to mention the stakeholder meeting that the agency hosted in Grangemouth on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-25">25 July</phrase> for the purposes of mediation in which East Lothian council, Fife council, Forth Ports, Melbourne Marine Services, the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Scottish Natural Heritage all participated.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/11">The current position is that Forth Ports has submitted its revised oil pollution contingency plan to the Government and a decision will be taken in the near future. Part of that decision-making consideration relates to the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 1994, commonly known as the habitats regulations, and whether the revision of the Forth Ports oil spill contingency plan is a plan for the purposes of regulation 48(1) of the habitats regulations. If it is, it is mandatory for the competent authority, in this case the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, before deciding to undertake or give consent, permission or other authorisation to the plan, to make an appropriate assessment relating to the implications of the plan for certain categories of designated nature conservation sites that are listed under regulation 10 and which are thereafter referred to as European sites. Such sites exist in the firth of Forth and that consideration is therefore relevant.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/12">We have sought views and assistance from other parts of the Government. That has inevitably taken some time, but it has proved to be beneficial. Our consideration will be aided further by the outcome of a case that is currently before the European Court of Justice and which, although it does not relate directly to shipping matters and oil pollution contingency plans, does relate to the interpretation of the plan for the purposes of regulation 48(1). I understand that the European Court of Justice is expected to present its judgment on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-20">Thursday 20 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/13">It would be prudent to wait until we have had sight of the judgment before deciding whether regulation 48(1) of the habitats regulations applies in the matter. When we have had sight of the judgment it should be possible to make progress swiftly. Whether or not the habitats regulations apply, Scottish Natural Heritage and other interested parties will continue to be consulted as the decision-making process continues, either under the MCA's contingency planning guidelines or the statutory procedures that are set out in the habitats regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/14">In the last analysis, it is for the Government to make a decision about the revised Forth Ports oil spill contingency plan. The Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention) Regulations 1998 define tightly the considerations that the Government may take into account when making their decision. The Government must consider whether the Forth Ports revised plan is compatible with the United Kingdom's national contingency plan for marine pollution and shipping and offshore installations. They must also consider whether the plan is appropriate for dealing with oil pollution incidents in the area for which the harbour authority is responsible.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/15">In strict terms, there is no provision in law for the Government to reject an oil pollution emergency plan that is submitted to them. They must either approve the plan or, if the plan is not compatible with the national contingency plan or is not appropriate for dealing with pollution incidents that might occur, they may direct the plan to be altered. It is the duty of the harbour authority to alter the plan if directed to do so. Failure to comply with that direction is a criminal offence. Failure to implement an oil pollution emergency plan is also an offence on the part of the harbour authority or the operator. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian and other hon. Friends that the Government are wholly committed to making the right decision in accordance with the law. I have listened carefully to what has been said in the debate and I shall write to my hon. Friend about her request for a further meeting.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.231.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" speakername="David Howarth" colnum="231"  time="13:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h04.htm#51018h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.231.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to bring to the attention of the House and the Government what is happening to funding for mental health services in Cambridge. The situation is grave: cuts of 14 per cent. are proposed. Patients, their relatives and friends and others in the wider community are extremely distressed. The cuts threaten the whole of the service&mdash;acute hospital treatment, rehabilitation, day centres, the young people's service and even the treatment of those with dementia.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/2">As Lord Layard recently said, mental illness is the equal of poverty as a source of misery in our society. Half the people on incapacity benefit are suffering from mental illnesses. Of the 5 per cent. of the population who are the least happy with their lives, 41 per cent. are mentally ill. More than one in six adults in this country suffer from a recognised mental illness of some kind. About one in 10 suffers from depression, some 4 per cent. from more serious personality disorders, and about 0.5 per cent. from the most serious illnesses&mdash;psychotic disorders.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/3">Mental illness can be literally a matter of life and death. Between 70 and 90 per cent. of those who commit suicide are suffering mental illnesses. Major depressive illness massively increases the risk of suicide. However, as Richard Layard also points out, mental illness is avoidable. Drug treatments and various forms of therapy are becoming more and more effective. The time when mental illness was thought to be incurable has long gone, but there is still vast unmet need. Only about a quarter of those suffering from neurotic conditions&mdash;depression and anxiety&mdash;receive treatment and only 16 per cent. access community care services. It is even the case that 15 per cent. of people suffering from psychotic illness receive no treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/4">That is why what is happening to mental health services in Cambridge is so serious. Cambridge City and South Cambridgeshire primary care trusts are in deep financial trouble. They face a deficit of about &pound;40 million. They have so far proposed &pound;17 million of reductions. Of those cuts, &pound;9 million will be in hospital services, &pound;3 million in prescribing, &pound;1 million in primary care and &pound;4 million in mental health. That &pound;4 million represents a 14 per cent. cut, of which &pound;3 million is to be cut from the &pound;23 million that Cambridgeshire mental health trust spends and the other &pound;1 million from the voluntary sector and other mental health trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/5">An important point is that &pound;2 million of the cuts have to be found before the end of the current financial year. That is an almost impossible task. The PCTs are consulting on how to achieve the savings. The main proposal is to close two long-term rehabilitation wards. Some of the patients would be transferred to another long-term rehabilitation ward, but that in turn would close in 2007. The PCTs expect those patients to be cared for in the community, and some investment is being made to try to make that approach work, as it can in the right conditions. However, my discussions with staff and experts in the field lead me to believe that about a third of the patients will certainly not be able to function in the community. Another third of them will have great difficulty in doing so and might well need readmission.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/6">The PCTs also propose to close 22 acute beds and a whole ward for older people. They hope that a reconfigured community outreach service will reduce demand for acute beds, but there is no way of knowing that such a reduction will occur. In some places where assertive outreach has been implemented, the demand for in-patient beds has risen, because previously undiscovered unmet demand has been revealed. In any case, Cambridge already has a precursor of the crisis-resolution home treatment service in the shape of the weekend service, and the PCTs propose to close even that.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/7">The strain on community services will be increased by the PCTs' other proposals. One is to close a day centre in Cambridge. Another is to reduce the coverage of the young persons service so that it no longer helps 20 to 25-year-olds, even though, as I was told when I visited the service, 20 to 25-year-olds can often be more vulnerable than young people who are still at home. Finally, in a move that will appal Members who have been campaigning on the issue, the PCTs say that from January they will cease to fund a specialist service for patients with dementia. They are assuming that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence will confirm its initial opinions about drugs that slow the onset of Alzheimer's disease, and the PCTs propose to cease to fund such drugs as soon as NICE confirms its view.</p>
	<p pid="b.231.1/8">It is difficult to describe the pain and distress that these cuts will cause. All the professionals in the area will do their utmost to try to prevent adverse effects, but cuts of such magnitude must have a deleterious effect on all the services, not to mention the additional strains that will be placed on other local services and on neighbourhoods.</p>

	<p pid="b.232.0/1">Is my hon. Friend aware of the British Medical Association's recent report that shows that of 530 health trusts in England, 385 were in deficit, and that those deficits amounted to &pound;2.4 billion? In my constituency, the PCT is forced to propose cuts that involve the closure of two of the mental health wards at the Westmorland general hospital in Kendal: ward 2, which is for elderly mental health patients, and ward 4 for adult patients with mental health difficulties. That will mean that those people and their families will have to travel to Lancaster and Barrow-in-Furness to get treatment, which will further distress them and will undermine mental health services.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.0/2">Perhaps my hon. Friend would care to reflect that if two thirds of the health trusts in England are in deficit, they cannot all be guilty of management incompetence, and that the Government should take responsibility for the crisis.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-18b.232.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" speakername="David Howarth" colnum="232"  time="13:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051018/halltext/51018h04.htm#51018h04_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.232.1/1">My hon. Friend makes the important point that what is going on is not just confined to one part of the country; it seems to be a more general problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/2">Doctors already face the dilemma of whether they can start a new patient on a course of treatment that might lose funding before it ends. The stigma that still wrongly attaches to mental illness makes it difficult for those who need help now, or those who have been helped in the past, to campaign in the way that sufferers from other illnesses can. That means that it is more incumbent on Members of this House and others to take mental illness seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/3">Why is this happening? My hon. Friend alluded to that question. Cambridge City PCT points out that the funding regime has consistently worked against areas that are experiencing population growth. The funding formula has lagged behind reality, delivering resources to areas that have lost population rather than to areas that have gained population, as it should have done. I understand that, from next year, there will at least be a boost for areas such as Cambridge that form part of the ODPM's optimistically named sustainable communities growth areas. That is welcome, but it does not deal with the legacy of years of underfunding that has led to an historic deficit being shifted from year to year.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/4">The PCT also points out that its finances are very badly affected by the presence of Addenbrooke's hospital, which is a large foundation hospital. Under the new funding arrangements in the NHS, foundation hospitals are, in effect, handed PCT chequebooks. They are entitled to be paid at fixed and non-negotiable rates whenever patients for whom the PCT is responsible cross the hospital's threshold and undergo treatment. The PCT, which previously negotiated a lower charge for the treatment, will now pay more for the same number of treatments. That system is the basis of the idea of patient choice, which will soon be implemented throughout the NHS. If our experience in Cambridge is anything to go by, patient choice will lead to a funding crisis in every service in the NHS, apart from in hospitals. Primary care, prescribing budgets, public health and mental health will have to bear the brunt of the new system.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/5">More directly relevant to the crisis in mental health funding in Cambridge, however, is the way in which central Government calculate mental health need. The relative share of mental health in overall funding has fallen, and the Government's index of mental health need discriminates unfairly against Cambridge. It looks as if the index follows what is known about the subject; research shows that mental health problems are associated with low levels of education, low income and low housing tenure. The mental health index does indeed include measures of education, income and housing, but examination of the detail reveals serious problems and distortions.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/6">The research shows that poor mental health is associated with being a tenant as opposed to being an owner-occupier. Some researchers speculate that the real driving factor is wealth, rather than housing, but the housing measure used by the mental health index is about the condition of housing rather than tenure. It is the wrong measure for mental health purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/7">The research also shows that housing tenure is a more powerful factor than education. A study on suicide rates across Europe, which was published in <i>The British Journal of Psychiatry</i> earlier this year, points out that in most countries, a well-educated tenant has a higher risk of suicide than a less well-educated home owner. The current mental health needs index, however, makes education a more important factor than housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/8">The situation is similar in relation to income levels. The measures of income used in the index are based on benefit take-up in the late 1990s. That is not the same as income now. An obvious example that affects Cambridge is the overwhelming majority of students who are on low, even negative, incomes, but who will count as rich people in the mental health index because they are disqualified from claiming benefits. Moreover, some factors, such as lack of social support, which research suggests are important for predicting mental illness, do not appear in the index. Areas in which the population is transient will usually have lower levels of mutual social support&mdash;a factor that should be in the index. At the same time, the index uses some factors, such as the serious illness ratio and the comparative mortality ratio, which do not figure strongly in the academic research as risk factors for mental illness.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/9">A final point that affects Cambridge in particular is that the index counts proximity to a mental health hospital as a factor that reduces the cost of delivering the service, whereas experience in Cambridge is that the existence of a well-regarded local facility tends to produce migration to the area of people who need that facility. The cost of providing care might be lower if there is a facility nearby, but there are also far more people who need that care.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.1/10">I plead with the Minister to take action to prevent the cuts in mental health services that Cambridge faces. The PCTs' funding is inadequate, and the mental health needs index is inaccurate and unfair. The time scale for the cuts is utterly unreasonable. There is still time to prevent the suffering that those policies will cause.</p>

	<p pid="b.234.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> on securing this debate on the funding of mental health services. I understand that his predecessor, Anne Campbell, a former colleague of mine, is to become chair of Cambridge's Mental Health Trust.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/2">I very much appreciate the interest that the hon. Gentleman takes in mental health because mental health is not often mentioned when we ask the public to name their priorities for NHS spending. That is why the Government took a different approach to mental health services when we were elected in 1997. Mental health was identified as a key clinical priority in &quot;Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation&quot;, published in 1998. The first ever national service framework was produced for mental health in 1999; and in 2000 the NHS plan set a comprehensive range of targets for the modernisation of mental health services. That is very important in relation to today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/3">As a constituency MP, I know that for many years generations have tried to hide those with mental health problems behind institutional walls and away from the public gaze. In the last decade or so, however, there has been a change of view, partly resulting from the fact that the range of issues associated with mental health is vast. The issues cover all age groups, and some are more prevalent in certain groups&mdash;among men or women, among various ethnic groups and so on. We therefore need to take a flexible approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/4">We want a system that allows residential provision and hospital treatment when necessary. However, in many circumstances, crisis episodes that have resulted in people being placed in hospital or seeking hospital services could have been resolved if we had had more outreach services in the community. We have considered how to modernise the service, seeing mental problems not only as a health issue but as an education issue and even a local authority issue. Just as important, it is a matter of social inclusion. For instance, further education colleges and other community facilities should be available for all; just because someone has a mental illness should not mean that, if appropriate, they cannot gain access to those services, like everyone else in the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/5">We have had to consider how to improve access to effective treatment and care, reduce unfair variation, raise standards and provide better and more convenient services more quickly. The report of Louis Appleby, the national director for mental health, on the implementation of the national service framework for mental health illustrates the progress that has been made since the publication of the framework in 1999. The report shows increasing investment, which has resulted in improvements in the provision of mental health services, particularly those in community settings.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/6">At the end of March 2005, there were 343 crisis resolution teams, against our target of 335. I know that the development of more crisis resolution teams is a priority in Cambridge. That will prevent people having to be placed in hospital; if it can be done, it is better to resolve problems in the community, for the individuals and their families. It is also better for the various agencies that may have a part to play. There were also 109 early intervention teams, more than double our target of 50; there were 1,520 community gateway staff, three times our target of 500; and 262 outreach teams&mdash;again, significantly more than our target of 220 in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/7">Although some targets are yet to be achieved, it is clear that services have made real progress in improving the provision of services, particularly in the community. I was looking at how the PCTs, the partnership trusts and Cambridgeshire county council have dealt with some of the issues on housing. For example, they have opened an innovative supported living scheme with eight one-bedroomed flats in Cambridge city for older people with functional mental health problems; they have worked with the district council to gain planning permission for a 14-place supported living scheme in south Cambridgeshire for people with mental health problems; and they have developed a mental health accommodation forum, linking with mental health housing providers and many other partners to tackle one of the problematic areas for those who seek treatment. People living rough on the streets find it difficult to get effective treatment. Some of those matters are important and are part and parcel of having effective services for those who need them.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/8">Funding is allocated to primary care trusts on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. It is always difficult to come up with the right formula that fits many different situations. However, a weighted capitation formula is used to determine each PCT's target share of available resources, to enable similar levels of health services for populations in similar need to be commissioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/9">Over the current three-year period, the total allocated to PCTs will increase by &pound;12.7 billion or 30.8 per cent. Cambridge City PCT's allocation will grow by 29.1 per cent.&mdash;&pound;27.8 million&mdash;to &pound;123.4 million for 2005&ndash;06. Those are pretty substantial increases for PCTs to decide how to allocate. It does not stop there: this particular PCT will receive allocations of &pound;148 million in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;160 million in 2007&ndash;08. That represents a cash increase of 17 per cent. over the next two years. That is a significant level of investment and it should deliver real benefits and results.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/10">It is for PCTs, in partnership with strategic health authorities and other local stakeholders, to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services. We are often accused of being a centralising Government, but we recognise that we cannot micro-manage the health service from the centre. We can ensure that we have given increased resources&mdash;which we have&mdash;and that we offer advice and support on best practice, drawing the attention of local communities and PCTs to good practice elsewhere. Where possible, they should take all of that to develop local services that are fit for purpose. We are now pursuing a way to strengthen patient involvement in the development of services and working to avoid unnecessary admissions to hospital by improving community health services. Members would understand why, as Public Health Minister, I approve of that policy direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/11">I understand that the trust is currently developing crisis intervention and home treatment services, assertive outreach services and more appropriate long-term accommodation for those who need it. That will mean that the trust will be able to reduce the need for adult in-patient beds. I am also assured that continuing hospital care will be available where it is most appropriate. Clinicians will be working with all affected patients and families to ensure that the most appropriate care packages are in place to meet their needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/12">The development of new sheltered accommodation in Huntingdon and Peterborough will lead to a reduction in the need for rehabilitation beds in Cambridge. Patients will be able to be housed in accommodation nearer to their homes. The trust has also been developing other services within the community, including support services, services to carers and an increase in psychological therapy services through the employment of primary care graduate workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/13">NHS bodies must live within their means, and sometimes that will lead to NHS organisations being faced with difficult decisions. As I said, it is right that decisions about the local configuration of services should be taken locally, where the health needs of the local population are best understood and local representatives and the public can make their voices heard.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/14">The trust is currently forecasting a deficit of about &pound;2 million, out of a total budget in excess of &pound;83 million, for the current financial year, if nothing is done to address the issue. I understand that the mental health trust has been engaged in a financial recovery plan since July 2005; the PCT has been implementing a recovery plan for 18 months. The major part of the trust's current financial pressure comes from the deficit inherited from its predecessor organisations. That is being addressed through its financial recovery plan, and the trust's November board meeting will consider whether any further measures are required.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/15">The financial situation that the local PCTs are dealing with is clearly putting pressure on services. I should reiterate that we are increasing funding to the NHS to record levels, and we believe that it is distributed fairly.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/16">There are 15 proposals being consulted on and I am aware that the consultation process was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-10">10 October</phrase>. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will take an active role in that both as an individual MP and by galvanising his constituents and groups to participate. Of course, it would not be appropriate for me to say too much about the actual proposals, but I have had a look through the consultation document to see the range of different ways in which service provision is being considered. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will at least agree that there is much food for thought in the proposals both for in the hospital and out of it and which specialist day services are necessary, as opposed to, for example, making sure that the other mainstream providers of education, leisure and so on are open and accessible to those with mental health problems and issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/17">The consultation document published by Cambridge City and South Cambridgeshire PCTs outlines a range of proposals for the future of mental health services in Cambridge. The proposals are in line with the PCTs' and the trust's shared vision to continue to modernise services in accordance with national guidance, including the national service frameworks. The proposals have been developed through a mental health project board, which includes representatives of the local PCTs and the trust. It is not, dare I say, just administrators applying their thoughts to the scheme, but it involves the people who work with those for whom mental health is part of their lives, and listens to what they have to say.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/18">I am reassured that the consultation is and will continue to be handled in an open and inclusive way. A number of public meetings have been arranged to enable proper discussion of the proposals with stakeholders and local people. The local health community has recognised that the development of new services, in line with the national service framework for mental health, will mean that some traditional services could be&mdash;should be&mdash;reduced or closed. That debate has to be held locally. The experience is in keeping with that of other mental health services across the country. Although I understand local concerns about mental health services, and what people have got used to, we need to develop an efficient, affordable and effective modern service for the future. I am reassured that the proposed changes are being properly consulted on, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the decisions following the outcome of the consultation must be made locally. It is not just about cuts in spending, but about making sure that we have services that are fit to purpose. More than ever before, there should be wider link up with local authorities and others who can play a role in determining those services in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/19">In conclusion, the consultation is under way. I hope that as many people as possible will take part. It is important that people's views are fed into the consultation; it is also important that they have the opportunity to have matters explained, as in such situations people often do not understand why things are happening. That is important for public understanding. I have seen in Cambridge and the surrounding area that the PCTs are very responsive to the needs of mental health service users and to the services provided. That said, there is also an understanding that in certain areas there has to be more community development, and the consultation gives a chance for all involved to have their say and to help to construct and be the architects of a better service in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.239.1/1">I am grateful to have secured this debate, as it provides me with the opportunity to address an important issue: the regulation of consumer credit business. The issue was recently brought to my attention by my constituents, Robert and Irene Masterton, who sought my help in rectifying an ongoing problem with HBOS, formerly the Bank of Scotland. It is a complicated case and you will be relieved to know, Sir John, that I do not have time to go into every single detail, although I will try to highlight the main points.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/2">In 1991, Mr. Masterton secured a &pound;30,000 overdraft facility from the Bank of Scotland to help fund his new business venture as sole Scottish agent for Ginetta and Scimitar cars. The bank sought a bond and floating charge and guarantee over the business. Unfortunately, in 1993, following Black Wednesday, Ginetta and Scimitar went into receivership, which made Mr. Masterton's company redundant, so to speak. In different circumstances, the solution would have been for Mr. Masterton's company to go into receivership. However, at this stage he was made aware that the impact of the personal guarantees attached to the bonding and floating charge would have meant bankruptcy for him and for his wife, a company director, in the event of the company failing. Shortly after that, his overdraft was increased to &pound;35,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/3">In January 1994, Mr. Masterton met his bank manager to request a five-year term loan to pay off the outstanding overdraft. His request was turned down, as the bank claimed that he had no security to offer. Obviously, Mr. Masterton was disappointed by that response, as three years earlier, in 1991, the bank, knowing that he had put all his assets into the business, had accepted that he was good for the money. However, that seemingly was not the case in 1994.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/4">In 1996, a new manager took over Mr. and Mrs. Masterton's account. Mr. Masterton approached the new manager and again requested a term loan, which would allow him to pay off both capital and interest. Again, his request was refused, trapping Mr. Masterton into paying back interest only on the sum outstanding. It would be difficult to overstate the distress that the situation caused my constituents. Their lives have been utterly blighted by the stress resulting from those circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/5">In 1999, Mr. Masterton went to see his bank manager in desperation, and virtually begged him for a term loan to pay off the borrowings and release him and his wife from the pressure placed on them. A 10-year loan was agreed, but a fixed interest rate was refused. Instead, the loan arrangement was so structured that Mr. Masterton would have to pay for any subsequent rises in interest rates. However, it was hardly a fair deal as he would not benefit from any drop in interest rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/6">In 2003, it became clear that the level of debt was escalating, despite the fact that the couple had paid off in excess of &pound;70,000 in interest, penalties and charges. Even then, the original debt of &pound;35,000 was undiminished. Following a meeting at the bank between Mr. Masterton and the then customer services manager and regional director, the bank conceded that as the rate on the term loan could not fall, the terms initially agreed were harsh. The bank removed that clause and refunded Mr. Masterton &pound;1000 in interest. The bank also confirmed that it would not look to Mrs. Masterton for settlement of borrowings.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/7">In February 2003, the Mastertons decided to move their mortgage away from HBOS following receipt of a letter warning them of a probable shortfall on their endowment policy. When the settlement paperwork was sent to their solicitor, they discovered that the bank had decided to combine the outstanding balance of the term loan with the outstanding balance on the mortgage. That was news to them. They were aghast, as their home had not been put up as security against the borrowings. Additionally, the bank was going back on its assurance that it would not pursue Mrs. Masterton for any part of the loan settlement. The bank eventually backed off, but made no apology.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/8">In March that year, Mr. Masterton wrote to Colin Matthew, divisional chief executive of banking at the Bank of Scotland, to express his concern that their case had not been properly considered. A brief reply was received, stating that no further action could be taken on their complaint, as in his view they had &quot;no legal redress&quot;. They were told that they should write to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which they did in August that year. In September 2004, they received the ombudsman's final decision. The FOS felt that there was no evidence to move against the bank, but stated that it had no supervisory or regulatory function and did not set the rules regarding how banks profits were attained.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/9">I stress that HBOS has not broken the law, or even bent it&mdash;I suggest that it is far too clever and experienced for that. The question is: has it behaved fairly? To summarise, an initial bond and floating charge and personal guarantee for &pound;30,000 will result in Mr. Masterton having to pay back a minimum of &pound;150,000, and perhaps as much as &pound;170,000. There are five years left to run on this debt. By the end of that period alone, Mr. Masterton will have paid off &pound;37,000 more than the original debt.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/10">In June, after Mr. and Mrs. Masterton visited me at my advice surgery, I wrote to James Crosby, chief executive of the Bank of Scotland, to ask him for his comments on the actions of the bank in this case, and specifically whether he felt that it is ethical to expect one's customers to have to pay back more than &pound;150,000 on an original loan of &pound;30,000. I shall read Mr. Crosby's letter of reply in full. He states:</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Thank you for your letter dated 13th June.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/12">If the letter had ended at that point, it would have been just as informative. However, Mr. Crosby continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/13" class="indent">&quot;The issues raised by your constituent were the subject of a complaint first made by him to the Bank in July 2002. As we were unable to resolve matters to his satisfaction a final response was sent to he and his wife&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/14">Mr Crosby's grammar, not mine&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/15" class="indent">&quot;referring them to the Financial Ombudsman Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/16" class="indent">The Bank was contacted by FOS in August 2003 when they had been asked by Mr Masterton to consider the complaint.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/17" class="indent">FOS issued an assessment on 29th March 2004 which did not uphold the complaint brought by Mr Masterton. He did not agree with the findings of their assessment and asked for a review of the complaint to be carried out by an Ombudsman. The final decision by the Ombudsman was issued on 1st September 2004 and again did not uphold his complaint. A copy of the assessment and final review is enclosed for your information.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/18" class="indent">In the circumstances the Bank has no further comment to make.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/19">Mr Crosby was careful and did not even attempt to answer my question about whether it is ethical for a customer to pay back at least &pound;150,000 on an original loan of &pound;30,000. No comment was made about the impact of the bank's actions on the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Masterton.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/20">Such breathtaking arrogance by HBOS is truly discouraging, particularly from one of the UK's biggest companies. In an age of corporate social responsibility should we not expect more from companies such as HBOS? I fully acknowledge that their primary purpose is to make money and to keep their shareholders happy; however, they also have a responsibility to respect their customers and to treat them fairly.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/21">Although we expect moneylenders to act responsibly and fairly, we have little ability legally to compel them to do so. That problem is caused not only by the rogue lenders we hear so much about, but, as Mr. and Mrs. Masterton's case highlights, by high street banks. Such behaviour might be expected of some of the more disreputable firms, but I was genuinely shocked to learn of HBOS's behaviour. The bank may wish to consider what sort of reputation it wants to nurture among the wider business community and the general public.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/22">Such problems occur primarily because consumer credit law, which dates back to 1974, is outdated and unable effectively to protect consumers from unfair lending practices. It is important to note that Mr. and Mrs. Masterton are not alone. Last year, Citizen's Advice Scotland handled cases of debt totalling &pound;130 million, and citizens advice bureaux in England and Wales handled more than 1.1 million debt cases. They have seen an increase of 74 per cent. in the number of consumer credit debt problems that they have dealt with during the past seven years.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/23">Citizen's Advice highlights the case of a Warwickshire man who took out a &pound;7,000 secured loan in 1990 to pay for a new kitchen at an interest rate of 33 per cent., which would take him 18 years to repay. Although he missed a few payments, he was able to catch up with them. When he contacted the loan company in September 2004 about re-mortgaging, he was astounded to learn that with four years left on the loan, the amount he owed was still &pound;62,000. That was the first time he had been made aware of the default interest charges accruing on the loan as a result of the missed payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/24">However, for the Mastertons and others in similar situations there is hope that things may soon radically improve. Following the publication of the Government's White Paper, &quot;Fair, Clear and Competitive: The Consumer Credit Market in the 21st Century&quot;&mdash;a snappy title&mdash;the Government introduced the Consumer Credit Bill in the last Parliament. Unfortunately, the Bill fell due to a lack of parliamentary time when the general election was called; however, it was re-introduced in this Parliament. It has progressed through the Commons and is awaiting Second Reading in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/25">The Bill will reform the Consumer Credit Act 1974, and it will specifically enhance consumer rights and redress by replacing the extortionate credit test with a wider &quot;unfair credit relationship&quot; test. It will also introduce an alternative dispute resolution scheme, which will be run by the Financial Ombudsman Service. It aims to strengthen the credit licensing system and to equip the Office of Fair Trading with new powers to take action against rogue lenders. Finally, it will extend regulation to all consumer credit and hire transactions, with a few limited exceptions.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/26">The changes are vital, and have been welcomed by a consortium of key charities and consumer groups, including the National Consumer Council, <i>Which?</i>, the Money Advice Association, and Centrepoint. In the context of Mr. and Mrs. Masterton's case, I particularly welcome the introduction of a new unfairness test, which will have a retrospective effect and will extend protection to all consumer credit by abolishing the financial limit that caps protection at loans of &pound;25,000. These developments have the potential to affect Mr. and Mrs. Masterton's lives positively and to bring to a close a hugely stressful and costly affair. For that to happen, however, the Government need to ensure that the Bill is enacted and implemented as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/27">People have suffered enough. Any further delays to the implementation of the Bill will continue the unnecessary suffering of many honest and hard-working families. Consumer credit businesses, including HBOS, have had long enough to set their house in order. If they are not willing to operate fairly and responsibly, it is the duty of Government to force them to do so. I hope that HBOS will re-evaluate its treatment of Mr. and Mrs. Masterton.</p>
	<p pid="b.239.1/28">Surely it is self-evident that banks have a moral duty to their customers as well as a financial obligation to their shareholders. It is simply not good enough for banks to seek to operate within the letter of the law when that law currently allows them to impose extortionate terms on their customers. They have had more than their pound of flesh from Robert and Irene Masterton. It is time to say that enough is enough.</p>

	<p pid="b.242.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on a powerful and passionate, if understated, exposition of the experience of his constituents, Mr. and Mrs. Masterton. He rightly pulls no punches on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/2">All MPs deal with constituents' cases in which we share their sense of injustice and their frustration that the system has somehow failed them. We also have cases in which we share the sense that they do not want anyone else to go through the experience through which they have been. That was clear from the way in which my hon. Friend put his case this afternoon. Rather than simply highlighting what he believes to be flaws in the system, given the experience of Mr. and Mrs. Masterton, he also pointed out the further changes in consumer protection planned by the Government, especially in the Consumer Credit Bill. He knows the Bill well, because he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the former Secretary of State responsible for that piece of legislation in the previous Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/3">I should also add that I share my hon. Friend's sympathy for the financial and emotional pressures that the Masterton family have been under, particularly given the special circumstances that have added to their difficulties. I personally assure him that the official record of this debate will be brought to the attention of the HBOS chief executive, James Crosby. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury is due to meet Mr. Crosby next month, and I shall also ensure that I speak to the Economic Secretary before that meeting.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/4">I should point out to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South, however, that HBOS is regulated by the Financial Services Authority and subject to the banking code, and that it is not for the Financial Ombudsman Service to play the role of regulator. The service has been set up, as he would recognise, to do a rather different job. The Mastertons' complaint has been through the bank's internal procedures and has been considered by the adjudicator as part of the Financial Ombudsman Service process. It has also been considered by the ombudsman, and that happens in a relatively small number of cases; last year, the ombudsman took a look at about one in 14 of the 110,000 or so cases referred to the FOS. So the case has been thoroughly considered, but not, as my hon. Friend recognises, upheld.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/5">My hon. Friend touched on our recent provisions and the more general question of the Government's approach to regulating financial services. That approach is premised principally on the conviction that consumers should be able to secure a fair deal. Since 1997, the Government have made reforms on that principle and the new provisions posed to Parliament through the Consumer Credit Bill are based on it. The setting up of the Financial Services Authority was an important stage in that process and in the creation of a single Financial Ombudsman Service and the compensation scheme. Those reforms&mdash;radical in their nature and resisted by some at the time&mdash;have clarified the landscape for the consumer. They have certainly made it much easier for consumers to negotiate what can be complicated decisions about complex products, and consumers know that if something goes wrong, they have a right to seek to have the matter put right.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/6">The Financial Ombudsman Service replaced eight separate schemes that previously covered financial services disputes. Those schemes differed in a number of substantive ways. Some were compulsory and set up under statute by the regulators and others were voluntary and set up by the industry. There were significant differences in the eligibility criteria, the limits on awards, the availability of compensation for distress and inconvenience, the time limits, the terms of reference, the basis for awards, the procedures, the funding and the governance arrangements. Some described that system as a patchwork quilt and argued that it was confusing for consumers&mdash;that was a huge understatement. The one-stop shop that the Financial Ombudsman Service now provides for consumers with disputes about financial services is independent and informal, and as an alternative to the courts it is a huge step forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/7">In each case, the ombudsman considers what would be fair and reasonable by taking account of all the circumstances of a case. Just as an asymmetry of information between provider and consumer is the main rationale for regulation, an asymmetry of resources is a major reason for having an ombudsman and the Financial Ombudsman Service. First, the system is simpler for the consumer. Secondly, the banks and other financial institutions carry the costs of the cases and investigations. Thirdly, the procedure is binding on the banks but not the consumer. The consumer can, if they choose, take their case to the courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/8">Having said that, I should stress something that my hon. Friend would recognise: the Financial Ombudsman Service is not a consumer champion. Its role is more that of an arbiter; its task is to find what is fair and reasonable and take into account any advice issued by the regulator and the likely decision a court would make. In some instances&mdash;my hon. Friend might argue that the case of Mr. and Mrs. Masterton is one&mdash;the ombudsman might, by following the clear principles laid down by law, make decisions that some consumers and commentators feel from their perspective is neither fair nor reasonable. If consumers are dissatisfied with the process, they remain free to take their cases to the courts at any time.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/9">The Financial Ombudsman Service plays a valuable role in providing consumers with a swift and effective means of resolving any disputes that they have with FSA-authorised persons and providers. The alternative of going through the courts is more complex, more costly and more drawn-out, to the extent that many consumers may be discouraged and not pursue the redress that should be their right.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/10">At the start of the debate, my hon. Friend dwelt on the new Consumer Credit Bill. That extends the scope of the Financial Ombudsman Service and its alternative dispute resolution to consumer credit complaints that are not at present within the FOS's mandate. It also makes a number of other important changes. Before the general election, the Consumer Credit Bill had passed all its Commons stages and was awaiting the scrutiny of the House of Lords. That is where the new Bill is now, and I can confirm that it is due for its Second Reading in the House of Lords next week. We hope that it will complete all its stages by the spring, and that implementation will follow in consultation with the industry, principally through regulations. I hope, as do my colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry, that that will happen without undue delay.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/11">My hon. Friend rightly argues that changes arising from the Bill might in future help to deal with circumstances such as those that Mr. and Mrs. Masterton faced. The alternative dispute resolution procedure that the Bill extends will be wider in scope, but will remain free for consumers. All consumers will have access to redress, not just those who can afford to pay for it, and the system will be run, as at present, by the Financial Ombudsman Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/12">The FOS provides the alternative dispute resolution service for financial services disputes and for some consumer credit disputes with consumer credit licensees. The Bill widens the FOS's mandate, so that over time all standard consumer credit licensees will be subject to alternative dispute resolution. All individual consumers will have access to consumer credit ADR. In addition, sole traders, partnerships of three or fewer partners and unincorporated associations will be eligible, but larger businesses and companies will not.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/13">My hon. Friend rightly said that the Consumer Credit Bill updates the Consumer Credit Act 1974, which is outdated and unable to protect consumers effectively. He was also right, given the experience of his constituents, to home in on the proposals and provisions for the unfair relationships test. That will replace an out-of-date and extortionate credit test. The old test set the bar of what is extortionate far too high to be of much use to consumers&mdash;it was confined to the cost of credit, or the terms of the agreement at the time when it was made. As a consequence, examples of consumers successfully pursuing cases under the extortionate credit test are relatively rare. The new test will be based on the principle of unfairness. Consumers will be entitled to apply to court to challenge agreements where there is an unfair credit relationship. In future, therefore, courts will be able to consider all aspects of the transaction, including the lender's conduct before and after making the agreement, the administration of the loan and the overall terms and conditions of the agreement. The new unfair relationships test ensures that the courts will have wide discretion to assist those who face unfairness from lenders.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/14">Importantly, the new unfair relationships provisions will apply to all consumer credit agreements, including those that are not otherwise regulated under the Act, except for exempt land mortgages, which are regulated by the FSA. The scope of the extortionate credit test is therefore retained. So, for example, the new test will apply to business lending, including that over &pound;25,000, which would otherwise be exempt from regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/15">The rationale for that wide scope is that lenders should not enter into unfair credit relationships in any circumstances. That is precisely the principle that I mentioned earlier. My hon. Friend may want to ensure that Mr. and Mrs. Masterton are aware that it will be possible for the provisions to be used for lending agreements that are already in place when the Bill comes into force, although there will be a transitional period to allow businesses time to adjust. As long as the loan relationship has not been completed when the measure comes into force, the new provisions will cover lending of that kind.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/16">Another important aspect of the Consumer Credit Bill, which my hon. Friend did not mention, but which I know he is aware of, is the principle of transparency&mdash;the principle that keeping consumers informed is an essential part of being a responsible lender. Secondary legislation has already required lenders clearly to provide at the outset key information on the product, and has made early-settlement charges fairer and more transparent to consumers. Building on that, the Consumer Credit Bill will ensure that lenders give consumers regular information about the state of their credit account, including whether they are in arrears, whether they have incurred default sums, and whether they are incurring interest on judgment debts.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.0/17">I know that my hon. Friend, like me, would argue that protection for people who have disputes or complaints about their lenders has been significantly strengthened since the 1990s. He, like me, also believes that there is still more to do to ensure that consumers have rights of redress when credit providers' actions are not fair and reasonable. He has eloquently made that case today. He made a cogent case for ensuring that implementation of the relevant provisions of the Consumer Credit Bill is not subject to undue delay. Like me, and like our hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations, Consumers and Fair Markets, he will not want any delay in the implementation of the new protections. We do not want undue delay in establishing the final part of the consumer protection that is so important to people such as the constituents whose case my hon. Friend has raised so powerfully today.</p>
