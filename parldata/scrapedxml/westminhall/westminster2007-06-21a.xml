	<p pid="a.509.2/1">I am pleased that we have been able to secure time this afternoon to debate the findings of the Shipman inquiry, which dealt with a matter of huge significance that has far-reaching ramifications for several Government Departments and which raised matters of great horror for the families who were affected and for the communities that still, to this day, remember the consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.2/2">To begin, let us remind ourselves of the facts. In January 2000, Harold Shipman, a sole-practice general practitioner in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was convicted at Preston Crown court of murdering 15 of his patients. He committed those murders by injecting his patients with lethal doses of diamorphine, a strong painkiller that is related to heroin. It has legitimate and widespread use in the treatment of the terminal stages of cancer and of other medical conditions. As further information came out during and after the trial, including the results of an audit of Shipman's mortality data that was commissioned by the Department of Health, it became apparent that those crimes were not isolated but were merely a small sample of a horrific series of murders committed over a period as long as 25 years and spanning virtually the whole of Shipman's professional life.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.2/3">The Shipman inquiry was set up in January 2001 and was tasked with investigating the extent of Shipman's unlawful activities, inquiring into the activities of the statutory authorities and other organisations that were involved, and making recommendations on the steps needed to protect patients in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.2/4">The inquiry published a total of six reports. The first report addressed the extent of Shipman's criminal activities as a GP. The second report covered the 1998 investigation by the Greater Manchester police. The third report covered the system of death certification and the coroners system. The fourth report covered the systems for ensuring the safe and appropriate use of controlled drugs. The fifth report covered the arrangements for monitoring and disciplining GPs, including arrangements for the handling of complaints in the national health service, and the sixth report addressed the extent of Shipman's criminal activities in the early part of his career as a junior hospital doctor. I wish to put on record the conclusion of Dame Janet Smith, now Lady Justice Smith, in paragraph 28 of the summary to the sixth report. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.509.2/5" class="indent">&quot;My overall conclusion, therefore, is that Shipman killed about 250 patients between 1971 and 1998, of whom I have been able positively to identify 218.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.509.2/6">That is the scale of the crimes. We are debating the ramifications as they affect not just the Department of Health but several Government Departments, and we continue to build a system that will reduce significantly the likelihood of any crimes on that scale ever being repeated.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.2/7">I welcome this opportunity to debate the findings of the Shipman inquiry and the action programme that the Government have set in place to ensure, as far as we can, that a similar tragedy never happens again. I begin with an obvious but vital point. The overwhelming majority of health professionals and staff working in the NHS are dedicated to providing the best possible care that they can for their patients. They bring to their work skills, professionalism, commitment and empathy for their patients, and we in turn entrust them with crucial aspects of our health and the health of our families. In the vast majority of cases, that trust is well placed. Opinion polls repeatedly tell us that, of all occupations, health professionals such as doctors and nurses are the most trusted.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.2/8">It is therefore all the more bewildering, as was expressed in the Shipman inquiry's first report, when that trust is betrayed. Tragically, that is exactly what happened in the case of Harold Shipman. To outward appearances, he was a devoted, caring doctor. In some respects, he was at the leading edge of his profession&mdash;for instance, in his approach to clinical audit. It was that outward appearance that enabled him to conceal the evidence of his crimes for so many years and to pull the wool over the eyes of many people who should have been more alert to what was happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.2/9">I believe that I speak for colleagues on both sides of the House when I say that we owe an immense debt of gratitude to the Shipman inquiry, in particular to its chairman, Lady Justice Smith, for the meticulous work that was done in unravelling the story of Shipman's crimes and the failure of the systems in place at the time to protect patients. Anybody who has reviewed the reports, as I have in preparation for this debate, will be impressed by the extremely detailed analysis of every aspect of the Shipman story. A mere glance at the title pages of the inquiry's six reports gives an indication of the breadth of the work.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.2/10">I pay tribute to the skill with which the inquiry sought in its recommendations to balance the need to safeguard the normal processes of patient care with the need to protect the public from the rare cases of professional abuse. It is important to acknowledge at the outset that it is incredibly difficult to get that balance right. It is vital to recognise that the vast majority of health professionals are dedicated to the care of patients and go about their work in an exemplary fashion, doing nothing but good for the communities that they serve.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-21a.511.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="511"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070621/halltext/70621h0001.htm#07062155000222">
	<p pid="a.511.2/1">Yes, I agree. The package of reform that we introduced in February does retain the system of independent self-regulation and suggests a parity between lay and professional representation within the main regulatory bodies and that those appointees should be independently appointed. It is important to ensure that the public have confidence that the regulatory system balances the public interest alongside professional standards. The system that we have proposed would achieve that aim, but there are different views on that and I will continue to discuss the matter with the medical profession. It is not in the interests of any profession for a closed discussion to take place on an issue of such import. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> rightly said, we are discussing matters of patient and public safety and it is important that there is and is seen to be openness, transparency and balance in the way we do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/2">I do not want to mention any particular regulator, but I have to be honest and say that I have seen evidence that some professions can become too inward in the discussions that they have about regulatory matters among themselves. At times, they are not sufficiently outward facing in the way in which they consider public safety. I do not want to go into detail, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase> may know to what I am referring. It is important that the professionals' role in self-regulation is balanced with the voice of the lay representative, but we can discuss those matters further as the debate progresses.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/3">Today's debate is about the Shipman inquiry, but I will mention in passing the work of three other inquiries&mdash;the Ayling, Neale, and Kerr/Haslam inquiries&mdash;that also deal with the abuse of trust by doctors. The details differ, but the underlying issues are similar: the failure of those in authority in the NHS to take repeated expressions of concern seriously about the actions of trusted health professionals, and to take effective action to protect patients. In responding to the fifth report of the Shipman inquiry, we found it sensible to consider at the same time the related recommendations of the three other inquiries, and I propose to do the same today.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/4">I know that the colleague of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1617" name="Phil Willis">the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis)</phrase>, who is Chairman of the Select Committee on Science and Technology, has a constituency interest in these matters. Indeed, he wrote to me a few weeks ago and asked whether we could have time for a Government debate on the issue. Unfortunately, it has fallen on a day when I believe he is out of the country, but I put my appreciation of his suggestion of a debate on the record.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-21a.512.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="512"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070621/halltext/70621h0001.htm#07062155000224">
	<p pid="a.512.1/1">I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman has put that on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.1/2">As the Shipman inquiry recognised, the NHS is in many ways very different from the NHS in which Shipman practised. In particular, since the publication of the Government's quality strategy in 1998, &quot;A first class service&quot;, new structures have been put in place to ensure the quality of care, to focus health care organisations on continuous quality improvement, and to identify and deal with poor professional performance. In the new climate it seems unlikely that abuses such as those perpetrated by Shipman, Kerr and Haslam would have continued for so long without coming to the relevant authorities' attention. Nevertheless, the list of the weaknesses in earlier systems that were revealed in the four inquiry reports leaves us no room for complacency. We need to learn from the past to ensure that future safeguards are as robust as we can possibly make them.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.1/3">Let me turn to the inquiry recommendations that we are dealing with today, which fall into the following broad areas: arrangements for death certification and for critical overview of the information on death certificates; the coroners system; safeguards over the use of controlled drugs; the handling of complaints and concerns in the NHS; routine monitoring of professional performance and conduct;<i></i>arrangements for professional appraisal and revalidation;<i></i>and<i></i>disciplinary processes, including the fitness- to-practise processes of the national professional regulators.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.1/4">In the time available, I cannot hope to do justice to the wealth of detail in the recommendations in those areas. Instead, I propose to, first, set out some general principles, and, second, to mention selectively the most important changes that we will introduce. Our action programme is summarised in the paper that we published in February, &quot;Learning from tragedy, keeping patients safe&quot;,<i></i>and in a series of more detailed papers, all of which have been laid before Parliament. The paper that we published in February provides an overview of all Government activity in response to the Shipman inquiry and will, I believe, provide a document of historical importance and use to people who research these matters as it brings together a vast programme of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.1/5">The Minister for Pensions Reform, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1836" name="James Purnell">my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell)</phrase> originally asked the Prime Minister whether the Government would produce such a document. I am pleased to have put the document together at his request and that he has joined us today to hear the proceedings. I pay tribute to him for the assiduous and respectful way in which he has pursued the interests of his constituents in this matter. It will be some time yet until those interests are fully resolved and until we can genuinely say that all of the issues that arose from the Shipman inquiry have been properly dealt with. I am also pleased that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1471" name="Chris McCafferty">my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Chris McCafferty)</phrase> is here. Shipman mainly practised in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde, but he also practised in her constituency. It is pleasing that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1531" name="Andrew Gwynne">they and my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase> are here. I believe that he also knows people in his local area who were affected. I thank all three of my hon. Friends for their work on the issue, but I particularly thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde for the measured way in which he has pursued the interests of his constituents. On the record, I give an assurance that we will continue to work through the issues until they are resolved to the satisfaction of him and his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.1/6">Let me turn to the general principles of the matter. First, our overriding priority has to be the protection of patients and the general public. Secondly, that should be done in a way that minimises any potential impact on the delivery of normal patient care and that affirms and supports health professionals<i>&mdash;</i>the overwhelming majority of whom, as I have already noted, aspire to do their best for their patients. Thirdly, any additional safeguards should build on existing processes,<i></i>in particular on the processes in the NHS for ensuring clinical quality and safety, which are collectively known as clinical governance. Finally, those additional safeguards should apply consistently across all sectors of health care<i></i>and on a proportionate basis to all health professions, not just to doctors. Shipman was, of course, a doctor in general practice, but it would be deeply irresponsible for us not to consider the further implications for secondary care and for other health professions.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.1/7">On the detail of the coroners' system and, in the particular, the proposed changes to that system, generally coroners and coroners' officers do a good job in often difficult circumstances, but the inquiry exposed a range of limitations. Proposals for reform of the coroners' system were set out in February last year and a draft Bill was published in June. A substantive Bill will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows. There was a Westminster Hall debate on the proposals in March this year, so I do not propose to go into great detail, but some of the main proposals are: to allow bereaved people a greater opportunity to contribute to coroners' investigations and to appeal if they are unhappy about decisions taken; to reduce variability in service and spread best practice by introducing national leadership for the service through a new chief coroner's post and inspection programme; to make investigations more effective by removing some archaic, restrictive legislation and giving coroners additional powers; and to make coroner's posts whole-time appointments, and to provide them with better medical support and advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.1/8">Death certification is, of course, the basis of the system on which the coroners' service operates. It is important to go into that in detail.</p>

	<p pid="a.514.0/1">I am sorry to interrupt the Minister's flow, and I do not know if he is coming back to the coroners' system, but can he give some idea of the timetable for those reforms, because, as he knows, the Government's initial draft Bill, although well motivated&mdash;a great deal of work went into it&mdash;did not meet with wholesale approval, so to speak, when it was scrutinised? It is not clear when that Bill is coming back into what is, I accept, a crowded Government legislative programme. If he can provide some information about Government thinking, it would be useful.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-21a.514.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="514"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070621/halltext/70621h0001.htm#07062155000228">
	<p pid="a.514.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.3/2">The Committee talked about the importance of the system of death certification, and, because of the interrelationship between the coroners' system and that for death certification, to which recommendations 5 and 6 of the report apply, asked the Government to come back to it. Again&mdash;I hope that this shows to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon that the Government have listened to those concerns&mdash;I have taken a personal interest, partly owing to the promptings of my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde, but more generally because the system is incomplete, in my view, without reform in the system for death certification. I hope that when any Bill for reforming the coroners' service is introduced, the hon. Gentleman will look at it in tandem with proposals soon to be published for arrangements to improve death certification.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.3/3">The Shipman inquiry found that existing arrangements for scrutinising death certificates were confusing and inadequate. The main problems are that arrangements are different for burials and cremations, with very little oversight at all for burials; scrutiny in cremation cases is not always sufficiently independent and is not subject to effective quality assurance; and there is no systematic analysis for local clinical governance purposes of the information on death certificates. As Lady Justice Dame Janet Smith pointed out, the system relies heavily on the honesty of the certifying doctor and she felt, partly for that reason, that the system was inadequate. She pointed out also that the doctors involved do not get full access to the medical records so that they can make a careful and detailed judgment, and that it must be integrated with clinical governance arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.3/4">As I said, I have looked in detail at that whole area on the prompting of my hon. Friend and others. Parliamentary colleagues will know that this issue has a history, in recent times and before. I refer hon. Members to chapter three of Dame Janet's third report where she talks in detail about the origins of the existing cremation certification system. In particular, however, she focuses on the more recent attempts to reform that system, beginning essentially with the report of the Brodrick committee in September 1971, which was a major change. It was set up in March 1965 following the British Medical Association paper &quot;Deaths in the Community&quot;, which was published in 1964. In particular, the committee dealt with the suggestion that homicides were passing undetected through the existing certification system. That suggestion was based on the book &quot;The Detection of Secret Homicide&quot; by Dr. John Havard, who was, at that time, assistant secretary of the BMA, and played a prominent part in its dealings with the Home Office over a period of several decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.3/5">It is important for us to remember the history. Dame Janet's report deals with that history from the publication of the Brodrick committee report, which recommended a fairly detailed overhaul of the system. In paragraph 3.82 of her report, she states:</p>
	<p pid="a.514.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Progress towards implementation may depend upon a willingness to take a definite policy decision, regardless of objection from some quarters.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.514.3/7">She says that because she details at length in the following paragraphs the extraordinary exchanges of views between and within Departments, and how eventually they came to a halt in the 1980s. It is a salutary lesson on how, in considering the detail, we sometimes lose the bigger picture. Since the Brodrick committee's recommendations in 1971, the system has gone unchanged and still dates from the origins of the cremation system in the early 1900s.</p>
	<p pid="a.514.3/8">In the final paragraph of the third report, Dame Janet concludes:</p>
	<p pid="a.514.3/9" class="indent">&quot;As it happens, I do not think that implementation would have prevented the Shipman tragedy. But, in many respects, the systems would have been improved. Today, the systems do not meet the needs of society. There is a groundswell of opinion in favour of change. It is to be hoped that the proposals of the Coroners Review and of this Inquiry do not, as did those of Brodrick, end in stalemate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.514.3/10">That is a salutary lesson to all of us. Dare I say it, in our recent deliberations on those issues, we have begun to see the mirroring of some of what happened in the 1970s and 1980s. It is difficult to cut through the different perspectives held by different Departments and interests. However, it requires a very definite political decision to reform the system, which I believe is what we now have, following the promptings of my hon. Friend.</p>

	<p pid="a.516.3/1">It would be the Bill or the two Bills that deal with these matters. I hope that they would be dealt with either in one Bill or in more than one concurrently, so that we could consider them in the round, deal with them from a parliamentary point of view and achieve parliamentary consensus on them. There are different timetables on how quickly that consensus can be gained. The package of proposals that we introduced on professional regulation achieved a measure of consensus earlier this year. I am sure that there are different views on elements of the package, which I may touch on. We are now working through a detailed package relating to death certification.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.3/2">To give the hon. Gentleman some reassurance, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, at my request, made a definite decision in the early part of this year that we should reform death certification and that there should be a unified system covering both burials and cremations, with scrutiny by an independent medical examiner linked to the local clinical governance team in the PCT. That was a definite decision of the Government and, for as long as I hold this job&mdash;which, who knows, may be only a few days&mdash;I will work to ensure that progress is made on that. However, I believe that progress will now be made, because there is growing consensus about how we can take the proposals forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.516.3/3">A detailed discussion paper will be introduced soon in a consultation paper. That is at a fairly advanced stage of preparation. I hope that it could lead to legislation&mdash;if there is broad agreement about the proposals&mdash;at the same time as measures dealing with professional regulation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-21a.517.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="517"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070621/halltext/70621h0002.htm#07062155000236">
	<p pid="a.517.3/1">I take the point made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. It was, perhaps, inadvisable of me to suggest that that label could be applied to the Bill. I was seeking to make a point about the breadth and depth of the reports from Dame Janet Smith's inquiry and that we are also dealing with the recommendations of other inquiries relating to very serious professional misconduct. I simply wanted to say that it is desirable, in my view, to introduce a package of legislation at the same time, so that the matters could be considered in the round, because that would be helpful for all concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/2">The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire mentioned the private grief of Departments. That may be the case, but he should read the third chapter of Dame Janet Smith's third report, to which I referred, because colleagues of his who are still in this place were engaged very deeply in the relevant matters. I am not making a party political point, by the way. It is simply that there is a salutary lesson in that chapter for Governments generally about how such matters can be resolved. They ran aground in the 1980s for precisely the reasons that are set out. I hope that when we finally put the proposals before the House, we do not allow that to happen again.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/3">The Government's action programme for strengthening the safeguards on controlled drugs was published in December 2004, and action is nearing completion. The fourth report of the Shipman inquiry considered how Shipman could have amassed such a lethal armoury of diamorphine, and the recommendations are intended to deal with that very point. I shall set out the key elements of the programme which have been introduced. First, the new governance arrangements introduced in the Health Act 2006 build on existing NHS clinical governance processes by requiring all health organisations to appoint an &quot;accountable officer&quot; with specific responsibility for controlled drugs to share information and to collaborate in action needed to protect the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/4">The second key element is restrictions on prescribing controlled drugs, placing on all health care professionals a clear requirement to prescribe only within their professional competence. The third element is strengthening the audit trail for controlled drugs, for instance by capturing information on the private prescribing of controlled drugs and developing and implementing an audit trail for controlled drugs requisitioned for internal use by GP practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/5">The fourth element is improving information for patients on the therapeutic uses and special status of controlled drugs. Fifthly, we are working closely with professional bodies to improve the education of health professionals in the appropriate use of controlled drugs and in the special precautions needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/6">On the issues raised by the Shipman inquiry's fifth report and the reports of the Ayling, Neale and Kerr and Haslam inquiries, the crucial first step is the initial identification of causes for concern. In Shipman's case, despite the ingenuity with which he attempted to cover his tracks, potential clues were missed. In the case of Clifford Ayling, that was compounded by the failure of different NHS organisations to combine the information that each held.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/7">Health care organisations need to work with information of two types. The first is routine indicators of clinical processes and outcomes, which, taken together, give a broad view of the clinical performance of clinical teams and individual clinicians. The second is information derived from complaints from patients and carers and from concerns raised by other professionals or organisations. Clearly, information of that type needs to be used sensitively and with appropriate safeguards to ensure that the reputations of health care professionals are not unfairly impugned. The Government will work with professional, NHS and patient organisations to develop further the use of routine quality indicators and to agree guidance on the appropriate use of softer forms of intelligence, in particular on the safeguards that should apply to the sharing of such information between organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/8">Complaints and concerns are potentially a vital source of information that may indicate poor professional performance or abuse. However, patients, carers and professional colleagues need clear signposting so that they know where to register their concerns. They may need support and help in articulating concerns, and reassurance that they will be taken seriously. In particular, they will want reassurance from those responsible, including senior managers, that action will be taken to ensure that there will be no recurrence of the incidents that caused concerns and that organisations take on board the concerns as part of their ongoing service improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/9">This week, the Government launched a consultation proposing comprehensive reform of the complaints system for health and social care. Key features relevant to the debate are proposals for a right for patients with complaints against a GP to go directly to the PCT, rather than to the practice itself; closer collaboration between organisations receiving complaints to ensure that complaints are speedily routed, where necessary, to the most appropriate body; developing good practice on keeping complainants informed about the progress of their complaint; placing a responsibility on PCTs to maintain an overview of complaints against GPs; and working with the NHS to build capacity and skills for investigating more serious allegations.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/10">I have always believed that the NHS needs to adopt a more open culture in handling complaints from the public. Too often in the past, the tendency has been to allow the shutters to come down and to push complainants towards the legal process. There needs to be a learning culture at the very bottom of the NHS so that complaints are received and acted on. In the vast majority of cases, patients' motivation in bringing complaints, including to Members of Parliament, is to prevent what happened to them from happening to somebody else; it is not to seek financial redress or to take the NHS to the cleaners. It is important that the NHS understands that and works with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/11">Where local information indicates a potential issue over professional performance, health organisations have a responsibility to take whatever action is needed to protect patients and, where possible, support and help the professional to get their career back on track. Experience shows that intervening early&mdash;before problems have become ingrained&mdash;is far more likely to be effective, and that is a major theme of the White Paper on professional regulation, &quot;Trust, Assurance and Safety&quot;, which we published in February.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/12">In recent years, the Department has agreed new arrangements with the professions to clarify and strengthen such processes in primary and secondary care. The new arrangements incorporate important safeguards, including the separation of the investigation of concerns from the formal decision-making process. Despite those reforms, the Shipman inquiry considered that primary care trusts did not have adequate powers to protect patients in the case of poor performance by GPs. The Government agree and will this year carry out a review of the operation of the performers list system, relating it to the proposals for reform of professional regulation, to which I will now turn.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/13">The Shipman inquiry's fifth report was critical of many aspects of the regulation of the medical profession, particularly the lack of clear standards for judging fitness to practise, the lack of demonstrable independence in the adjudication of the most serious fitness-to-practise cases and the way in which earlier proposals for the revalidation of doctors had been implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/14">Given the radical and, in places, controversial nature of the inquiry's recommendations on those points, the Government decided in early 2005 to set up a review of medical regulation under the chief medical officer and a separate review of non-medical regulation under the then NHS director of human resources, Andrew Foster. Those reviews reported in July 2006, and, following a period of consultation, our final proposals were published in the White Paper on professional regulation, which I mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/15">Our proposals include inviting the professional regulatory bodies and specialist organisations such as the royal medical colleges to develop clear standards to determine whether health professionals remain fit to practise. We also propose improving co-ordination between local NHS employers and national regulators&mdash;in the case of doctors, through a network of General Medical Council affiliates. That system was proposed by the chief medical officer to close what he termed the regulatory gap&mdash;a situation in which a professional's behaviour may be causing local people concern, but there is insufficient evidence to take a complaint all the way to the national regulator.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-21a.520.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="520"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070621/halltext/70621h0002.htm#07062155000238">
	<p pid="a.520.1/1">I agree entirely that that is what we need to create. The systems that we are describing should transcend all organisational boundaries and apply right across the piece. Different organisations will seek to achieve the same ends in different ways, but the principles should transcend organisational boundaries and apply equally to the private sector and the NHS. In that respect, the GMC affiliates could play quite an interesting role. Originally, it was proposed that that should happen at trust or local community level, but following discussion with various stakeholders, the regional or sub-regional level would seem to be the right one. We therefore want to take the proposals forward carefully to ensure that they do what we hope they will, and I hope that they will achieve some of the aims that the hon. Gentleman has alluded to.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.1/2">The Government's proposals also include setting up an independent body to adjudicate the final stages of the fitness-to-practise process. That will initially apply to doctors, but the other regulatory bodies will be invited to establish a similar separation between their adjudication and other functions. In addition, we propose to strengthen the current system of appraisal for doctors so that it can become an adequate basis on which to carry out the periodic revalidation of their generic fitness to practise, with separate arrangements for specialist recertification overseen by the appropriate royal medical colleges. Finally, for other professions, we propose that revalidation should be carried out by employers or other appropriate means.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.1/3">When we leave this issue, as I told the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, we need to put in place a system that will stand the test of time and which constitutes a generational settlement on these issues. In this day and age, it is not enough to tell the public that we have done the job; the system that we put in place must be seen to be transparent and to uphold the public interest. That is why there should be parity between the professional and lay appointees to each of the regulators.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.1/4">We can, however, deal with that issue in the parliamentary debate that follows our proposals. Although it is important that we hear all the views on the issue, it would surprise me if parliamentarians of all parties did not agree that upholding, and being seen to uphold, the public interest was crucial; indeed, it is in the interests of professional self-regulation, because it will strengthen the image of self-regulation in the mind of the public. Indeed, we should remember that we are not talking about Government regulation, because those appointed to the regulatory bodies would all be independent.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.1/5">I have spoken for a considerable time, but I appreciate that I have given only a superficial summary of the action programme that the Government have set in hand to address the many thoughtful recommendations of the Shipman, Ayling, Neale and Kerr/Haslam inquiries. Some of those actions are already in hand, and we are working closely with regulatory bodies and patient, NHS and professional groups to implement the remainder.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.1/6">Unfortunately, we can never give an absolute assurance regarding criminal behaviour of the kind perpetrated by a Shipman. However, the action that we are setting in hand will make it highly unlikely that any future criminal could go on for as long without being detected. We can achieve that without disrupting the excellent care that the vast majority of our health professionals give their patients day in, day out.</p>
	<p pid="a.520.1/7">Let me conclude by thanking those hon. Members who are here for the debate for their interest in the issue. I cannot stress enough how important the determination of those hon. Members who represent constituencies in which Harold Shipman practised for so many years has been in ensuring that these matters are adequately concluded. The Government will eventually bring the issue to the right conclusion so that my hon. Friends' constituents can&mdash;this is very important&mdash;draw this awful chapter in the history of their towns to a close, and that applies particularly to Hyde. We have some way to go yet, but we are making clear progress towards our goal.</p>

	<p pid="a.521.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on behalf of my constituents in Calder Valley and those of the Minister for Pensions Reform, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1836" name="James Purnell">my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell)</phrase>, who, as you pointed out, Mr. Hancock, is in the Chamber but may not speak because of his ministerial responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/2">I thank the Minister for outlining the proposals which, I stress, are historic and wide ranging. He is correct that we would not have reached the stage that we are now at without huge political will. The proposals will set out for the first time a national framework for the work of coroners, who will become full-time professionals, with a chief coroner heading the service. The proposals will empower bereaved families by giving them, for the first time, a proper legal standing. They will have the right to a second opinion, and the ability to challenge coroners' rulings. Those changes will be welcomed by families who have had a relative die a violent or sudden death, but especially by families who were patients of Harold Shipman, such as my constituents in Todmorden in the Calder Valley and, of course, many constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde. We should never forget the extent of the tragedy, especially for the hundreds of families in Hyde and Tameside who lost loved ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/3">The extent and magnitude of Harold Shipman's crimes were such that they were hard to encompass, unless one was personally involved and touched by the tragedy. Of course, by killing himself and going to his grave, Harold Shipman robbed all those families of the one thing that he could have given them: the truth&mdash;the right to know what happened and perhaps to help to put an end to what for most of the people concerned is a continuing horror story. The Government can help by making sure that the lessons of what happened in the Harold Shipman case are learned. That case gives rise to today's debate and is probably the case of the greatest magnitude, but there are other instances in which GPs and medical and health professionals have not only gone beyond the bounds of their duty, but have behaved in a wholly inappropriate way, in relation to the life and death of their patients. The reforms are definitely necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/4">I hope that the reforms will ensure that a tragedy like the Shipman case can never happen again. My hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde has had regular contact with the bereaved families in his constituency, and he has told me that he never ceases to be impressed by their resilience and their commitment to ensuring that reforms are made. They have met Ministers several times and have helped to develop the new proposals. My own constituents in Todmorden believe that Dame Janet Smith has done a remarkable job in very difficult circumstances. Of course, in the case of my constituents the events happened at the beginning of Harold Shipman's time in practice. It was very difficult for those families when the bodies were exhumed, because the deaths were so long ago that there was little if any medical evidence to be assessed. That did not make things any easier. Families in Hyde have always made their respect for Dame Janet and her team, and their commitment to the implementation of her findings, very clear. I want to express my own gratitude for the dedication that all Ministers concerned have shown to introducing good and relevant legislation, for the spirit in which the Government have approached all the reforms, and for today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/5">My biggest concern, which is central to the debate, is the proposed reform of the coroners system by the draft Coroners Bill, and the reform of the regulation of the medical profession initiated by the chief medical officer. It is widely known that Dame Janet has concerns about some of the proposals in the Bill, particularly the way in which death certificates are to be checked. I know that the Minister has examined the proposals carefully and that, as has already been said, it is intended that there will now be a single process for both cremation and burial certificates, operated through local primary care trusts. That is a very welcome development.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/6">There has always been widespread concern among patients&mdash;certainly among my constituents in Todmorden&mdash;about the fact that Shipman could write any name he fancied on medical certificates and it would not make a scrap of difference; they would still be accepted, and not detected as fraudulent. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend assured me that the new system will deal with those concerns. In addition&mdash;I know that other hon. Members have already asked about this&mdash;will he try to clarify the time scale for the introduction of the reforms? I am particularly interested to know whether the reforms will be extraterritorial. Will the family of someone who has died abroad, perhaps in suspicious circumstances, be able to contribute to the coroner's investigation or challenge the verdict? Will the Government implement the suggestion that a simple information leaflet should be provided to bereaved families, setting out their rights? When does my hon. Friend expect the draft Bill to be presented to Parliament?</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/7">Another key question, which I think all the families have asked, particularly in Todmorden, given that Harold Shipman practised there for a period before going to Hyde, is why the medical system could not identify him earlier. When he practised in Todmorden he was found to be abusing drugs. That was brought to light by an eagle-eyed medical practitioner who was his colleague. Shipman was subsequently investigated and suspended from the Todmorden medical practice, and convicted in the Halifax court of misuse of drugs and prescription fraud. However, he was then able to go down the road and carry on practising in Hyde, with no monitoring at all. In both Todmorden and Hyde, his prescription and death rates were off the Richter scale, but he was never detected.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/8">How does the Minister think the new system will ensure that that cannot happen again? Does he have confidence that we are now reforming the system overall? Are all the pieces of the jigsaw falling into place? Joined-up thinking and the interconnectedness of the reforms are important considerations, which, as the Minister pointed out, have caused some delays in implementation&mdash;and he is right that the reforms need to stand the test of time. I expect he understands the frustration of Members of Parliament whose constituents have been affected by Harold Shipman, and of the general public, who feel great anxiety about whether they will be protected in the future. Only a very small minority of medical practitioners abuse their powers, and the vast majority of GPs and health professionals are in that business because they want to help people, but the affair has left a very bad taste in many people's mouths, as well as a lot of fear. The general public are anxious for the reforms to be implemented. Given all that I have said, and given our understanding of the need for interconnectedness, joined-up thinking and transparency, and the fact that it is important to get the reforms right for the 21st century, perhaps the Minister will tell us when he expects the reforms to be fully and finally implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.527.0/1">It is important that I say that I do not agree with the point that Government regulation is being proposed. We are proposing to maintain the system of professional self-regulation. It is as a result of the counsel of the regulators that we are proposing parity between the professional and lay interests. The hon. Gentleman will know that that is very different from the panels that hear fitness to practice inquiries. The GMC proposed bringing forward the parity proposal, which is as good as we can get in terms of a system of independent self-regulation where we enshrine and are clear about the public interest.</p>

	<p pid="a.533.0/1">I join others in thanking the Minister for securing us this opportunity to debate the issues, not least because the way in which he introduced the debate has, apart from anything else, allowed us all to raise some of the issues in interventions, which has been helpful in exposing some of the issues for future resolution, and saved me from having to explain many of the things that I otherwise might have.</p>
	<p pid="a.533.0/2">I also share the Minister's appreciation of the contributions that the hon. Members for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell), for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne) and for Calder Valley (Chris McCafferty) have made in representing their constituents. As constituency Members of Parliament, we can barely comprehend the scale of the distress and grief that Harold Shipman's evil caused. However, it must be of comfort to the families and the communities that those hon. Members represent that their Members of Parliament have been active in representing them and are here today, ensuring that the issue does not become unfinished business. I entirely accept the point that the Minister made. We must all learn from the past and ensure that they we do not allow the deficiencies of reform in the past to prevent us from taking the necessary steps today.</p>
	<p pid="a.533.0/3">I am therefore all the more grateful that Ministers tackled the question of controlled drugs in the Health Act 2006, in part 3, which we generally welcomed. There will be the question of what the role of the inspectorate of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain may be in helping to buttress accountable officers and how the two might interact with one another. We do not want any duplication between the two, so it will be helpful to consider that as time goes on, particularly as the RPSGB will, for professional regulatory reasons, be separated from the proposed general pharmaceutical council. That gives even greater confidence that the RPSGB will be a proper vehicle for exercising greater professional scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.533.0/4">We debated the timetable for coroners reform, so it was a surprise, given the availability of draft legislation, that Ministers did not introduce legislation in this parliamentary Session. That was only a matter of surprise, however. It would be a matter of disappointment, which would be shared throughout the House, were Ministers not able to bring anything forward in the next Session. It is not that every issue is resolved, but with the consensus that exists, I cannot but feel that the coroners system is ready for reform. The basis of that reform must be a greater assurance that investigation of suspicious deaths will take place to uncover wrongdoing. Perhaps most important, we must ensure that the system is not so rigid, for reasons to do with historic legal structures, that it fails to be as sensitive and supportive as it should be to the relatives of those who have died. They must be assured that the issues will be fully investigated.</p>
	<p pid="a.533.0/5">I do not represent that part of our Front Bench that will be responsible for the structure of coroners reform, so now is not the moment for me to address it. However, I am sure that we shall want to consider carefully the relationship between medical examiners, in the context of the NHS, medical assessors&mdash;a recommendation of the Luce review&mdash;and coroners, and whether, if we do not take up that recommendation, medical examiners will in practice be able to give coroners the necessary support. I hope that they can.</p>
	<p pid="a.533.0/6">It must be right that consideration of the process of death certification and coroners reform should proceed alongside one another. I have seen that Ministers wish to embed medical examiners in primary care trusts. I think that that is the right thing to do, as it will put medical examiners in a position where they can link their role into performance management of primary care providers and commissioners. Although the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs was worried about the risk of a conflict of interest, we do not need to go down the policy line too far with the Minister to recognise that, in terms of corporate and clinical governance, primary care trusts will at the very least separate their commissioning and provider functions. The role of a medical examiner in those circumstances forms part of that core PCT commissioning responsibility, so that whether providers are community-based providers or hospital-based providers, a medical examiner could clearly be independent and have no conflict of interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.533.0/7">I should like to talk for a few moments about the regulation of the medical profession. Let me put the matter in context. The Minister quite rightly said that the medical profession continued to command a very high level of confidence among the public. The system of regulation of the medical profession also continues to command confidence. However, when one considers the issues that we are dealing with and the responsibilities of the medical profession, the system of regulation and the level of confidence enjoyed must be exemplary. For example, if one says, as is true, that three quarters of the public are fairly or very confident in the system of regulation of the medical profession, we submit that that is good, but not good enough. If one in four patients do not feel confident that their complaint or their belief that something has been done wrong will be properly investigated, that is too many people. We need to minimise any lack of confidence in regulation of the medical profession.</p>
	<p pid="a.533.0/8">Although it is sometimes tempting to say that the enormity of what Harold Shipman did was so exceptional that one could not extrapolate from that lessons about regulation of the medical profession as a whole, the principle that we are dealing with is a risk-based system of regulation. One calculates risk by calculating the probability of an event and looking at the severity of its consequences. One has to contemplate only for a moment the enormity of what Harold Shipman did to understand that even a tiny probability of such an event occurring mean that one must, taking a risk-based view of proportionate regulation, have a very robust system of regulation in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.533.0/9">I subscribe to the view that we should have a risk-based system. Dame Janet Smith seemed, on my reading, to set out in a very competent and comprehensive way to examine what had happened and to expose how, if people had acted on the information that was available to the respective parts of the system in place, it would have been possible, in a better system, to identify wrongdoing and risk, and to deal with it. However, because Dame Janet considered many aspects of the regulation of the medical profession and identified deficiencies in it, she has made wide-ranging recommendations geared to the reform of the system as a whole. On any reading, those recommendations go beyond what is necessary to identify and deal with&mdash;I hope far more effectively&mdash;someone who is behaving even remotely in the way Harold Shipman behaved.</p>
	<p pid="a.533.0/10">To bring that back to specifics, she recommended that revalidation should be conducted not on the basis of concerns about somebody's fitness to practise but on the basis of a positive effort to secure revalidation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-21a.537.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" speakername="Andrew Lansley" colnum="537"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070621/halltext/70621h0005.htm#07062155000258">
	<p pid="a.537.1/1">I understand; the hon. Gentleman slightly tempts me, but I shall not go too far along that line. The moment that the hon. Gentleman mentions Government targets, one has to embrace the thought that the medical profession will be able to deliver the kind of professional self-regulation that we are discussing in circumstances in which responsibility for the care of patients is exercised by clinicians on the basis of their professional judgment. The chief medical officer said in his conclusions to his document &quot;Good doctors, safer patients&quot;, which was published last year:</p>
	<p pid="a.537.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The quality and safety of the care received by patients is not yet central to the goals, culture and day-to-day activities of every organisation and every clinical team delivering care to NHS patients. Financial and activity targets often have a higher priority.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.537.1/3">That comes back to the point made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. If we are looking for professional regulation, it has to be in a structure within which professionals understand that the structural framework and the organisational framework are entirely consistent with the care and priority that they give to the care of patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.1/4">The next sentence in the report from Sir Liam Donaldson stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.537.1/5" class="indent">&quot;It is misguided to think that these considerations are mutually exclusive. In the best healthcare organisations in the world, the 'business plan' and the 'quality plan' are one and the same.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.537.1/6">To be fair to the chief medical officer, we know exactly what he is aiming at, and I hope that we would see it in policy terms. Professionals would not find a conflict between Government targets or the objectives of an organisation and their professional responsibility, because they all point in the same direction. That is what we are aiming for.</p>
	<p pid="a.537.1/7">I managed to raise most of the points that I wanted to make in my interventions. One was about the standard of proof in particular. It is right to proceed on the basis of a civil standard of proof, flexibly applied. The point that I made in my intervention was that flexibility must be carefully applied in determining the severity of penalties that might ensue from accusations. I hope that that will be understood in the medical profession. As the Minister rightly said, most doctors are worried about the standard of proof that would be applied to deprive them of their livelihood and bring them in to public disrepute. That sanction would be applied only where there was evidence to support the accusation beyond reasonable doubt. A range of penalties are available that do not have quite the same impact and do not require a &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; standard of proof. That seems logical to me, but everything that I read suggests that we have not yet got that message across to the medical profession. We need to have that debate, even if it is in the few months before we discuss the legislation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-21a.539.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="539"  time="016:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070621/halltext/70621h0005.htm#07062155000263">
	<p pid="a.539.0/1">I echo <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">the last remark of the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>. If we can create such a culture, we will have done something truly valuable for the country for many years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/2">I am grateful for the way in which all hon. Members contributed to the debate. If we can continue our deliberations on these matters in the same vein, we will do politics, our parties and Parliament a service in trying to get the right settlement for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/3">When <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1531" name="Andrew Gwynne">my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase> spoke about the effect on the borough of Tameside, it got me thinking. The borough does not want to be remembered for those terrible events&mdash;nor should it, because it is a fantastic part of Greater Manchester, which I represent, too. In some ways, I hope that my hon. Friend's constituents and those of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1836" name="James Purnell">my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (James Purnell)</phrase> will see some of the positive legacy of the improvements to Tameside general hospital that we hope to implement quite soon through the substantial redevelopment scheme under the private finance initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/4">It is a matter of some coincidence that tomorrow I shall open a new practice in the fine borough of Tameside, near the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member of Stalybridge and Hyde&mdash;Dr. Kailash Chand's practice at the Stamford House surgery. In many ways, what matters is not raking over the coals but bringing forward positive progress to the borough of Tameside that shows that the health service can take a stride forward and do something significantly better than before. That is the challenge that faces us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/5">I shall answer the questions that colleagues have asked, although I do not intend to speak for a long time, as we have had a full debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1471" name="Chris McCafferty">My hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Chris McCafferty)</phrase> eloquently asked how it was possible for Shipman to continue his criminal activities for so long without being detected and how the system could not have been adequate to pick up the clues and warnings and protect patients. That is the key question that I have asked myself in considering the right response to the matter, and it was why I re-examined the issue of death certification when I was asked to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/6">The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that the matter should sit within the clinical governance function of PCTs, so that information is used for commissioning and public health purposes, for general good governance in a locality and to detect any patterns of disease or illness. That would make it part of an integrated system, working with a reformed coroners system and system of professional medical regulation to do precisely what my hon. Friend said. That is a crucial piece in the jigsaw of creating systems that give us the satisfaction that we want.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/7">My hon. Friend asked whether we could create systems to ensure that such a thing never happens again. I am not sure whether we can ever be so arrogant as to say that any piece of legislation could do that, but we can work to close the cracks and limit as much as we can the weaknesses and the likelihood of it happening again. That is my objective in bringing forward our package of proposals. If the system is to work it is crucial that PCTs examine the whole range of indicators of clinical quality, including death rates, analyse information from death certificates and have an overview of complaints. They must use all that information to inform the strengthened system of scrutiny and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/8">My hon. Friend and others asked about the timetable for the implementation of the system. We propose to publish a consultation document on death certification shortly&mdash;that is not Department of Health-speak &quot;shortly&quot;; it does mean shortly. The timetable for implementation is still to be determined, because it will be subject to legislation. One of the problems, and the reason why I referred to Dame Janet's third chapter of the third report, is that there is legislation controlled by and relating to different bodies such as the Ministry of Justice and the Office for National Statistics, and the Home Office has a considerable interest in some of the issues that we are debating. The matter is complicated and subject to legislation, but it makes sense to consider a timetable for putting the reforms together.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/9">The earliest that we can hope for the coroner reforms to be fully implemented&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> asked me about that&mdash;is 2010. That is not unreasonable at this stage. I recognise the frustration that some people feel about the pace of progress, but I cannot make decisions on future legislative programmes. We need to ensure that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire's frustration does not turn to disappointment, and we do not want momentum to be lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley asked me about deaths abroad. When a death takes place overseas, the body is brought back to England and Wales and the coroner investigates the circumstances, as he would if the death took place in this country. That will remain the same. Families in those circumstances will get the same powers as others under the new Bill to challenge coroners' decisions, although the death certification process is not the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/11">My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish raised important points about medical regulation and GMC affiliates. It is important to say how we envisage those affiliates working. I agree with the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire that the system being developed is, in many ways, not punitive. As the chief medical officer made clear in his document, &quot;Good doctors, safer patients&quot;, the idea is to create a supportive system whereby doctors exhibiting signs of difficulty, perhaps through alcohol or drug misuse, are supported, referred to bodies such as the National Clinical Assessment Service and offered help and support to get their careers back on track.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/12">The revalidation process will contribute to that. GMC affiliates will have a key role in placing recorded concerns on file so that there is a record of things brought to their attention. Even if they are not felt worthy of being taken to the GMC, they should nevertheless be recorded as concerns. That will build the more detailed system that my hon. Friend was looking for. We will close the regulatory gap between the GMC, which is at the end of a long process in many cases, and examples of practice that give rise to concern at a local level. I hope that he appreciates that.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/13">I wish briefly to touch on an issue that we have not mentioned. As well as the reform of the death certification system, the Government are considering adding to the draft Coroners Bill a provision recommended by the Constitutional Affairs Committee to place a statutory duty on doctors to report to coroners particular types of deaths, such as those that are in unnatural circumstances or are violent and fit certain characteristics. We will set out our proposals on that in a consultation paper, which is currently being considered in draft form. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred to that and I hope that he will be reassured.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/14">On death certification, I was pleased to hear the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire say that having the medical examiner within the PCT was the right thing to do and that he did not feel it should give rise to concerns about conflicts of interest. However, that is a legitimate point to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/15">It is important to say that if we create a unified system of death certification it will apply to burials as well as cremations. At the moment the charging structure falls heavily on people whose relatives are cremated, and any new system will have to create a unified charging structure. It is important that that is done carefully and sensitively when the details are considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/16">The role of the medical examiner receives a lot of criticism, but it will be hugely strengthened by Connecting for Health and the national programme for IT. An examiner sitting at a PCT will be able to call up the necessary documentation, have immediate access to records and speak to family members if it is deemed necessary. It will be an easy, streamlined process. The system has the potential to be neither costly nor bureaucratic and will do the job that Dame Janet envisaged for the coroners service.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/17">The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon spoke about doctors' lower tolerance towards poor practice and the importance of their not being hounded. They are important points and the two need to be balanced. He often talks about Government targets as though they were inherently antithetical to good patient care. I hope he understands that our targets are about the generality of the population getting access to basic standards of care. It is not enough for the system just to deal with the patient before it. Obviously, any health care system must consider how it is meeting the needs of everybody, not just those who come into the system because it is their turn in the queue. I wish sometimes that he would temper his description of targets. They are designed to improve the system for everybody, not to work against the interests of patient care. I believe that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire made that very point. I would not want doctors to be hounded as a result of the new system. It is crucial that professionals who express concerns about a colleague are protected, and I assure hon. Members that that is very much part of our thinking.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/18">We had a useful debate on the standard of proof, and I suspect that we will return to the subject another time. Again, I was pleased to have the support of the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire. Perhaps there is a need for better communication with the medical profession so that people fully understand what is being proposed and so that liberties are not taken with the serious issue of people's livelihoods, but Lady Justice Smith and the chief medical officer both firmly concluded that what has been proposed is the right thing to do. In my view, too, it is the right thing to do, and the Bill will include the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/19">On the composition of the General Medical Council, I believe that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said that he supported the proposal for parity between lay and professional representation. He is nodding, so I am pleased. Personally, I preferred a lay majority&mdash;I will be open about that. I felt that that would be right, but, in discussion with the medical profession and the GMC, I accepted that parity was a fair compromise and that it enshrined the two interests that have to be balanced. In many ways, it perfectly embodies the balance that has to be struck between the public interest on the one hand and the professional interest on the other. That is what we are seeking to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.0/20">The hon. Gentleman also raised concerns about people being elected to bodies and asked why the Government were moving away from that. There is a clear conflict between representation and regulation in the public interest. The responsibility of anyone serving on a regulatory body in the health care sector is to uphold the public interest and to improve patient safety. I do not doubt for a moment that that is not uppermost in the mind of the vast majority of people&mdash;in fact, all the people&mdash;who are elected to serve on regulatory bodies. Nevertheless, the impression is created that the first priority is to the constituency of people who put the person on to the regulatory body. Indeed, in many ways it is why we are asking the Royal Pharmaceutical Society to make changes to its structure, too. That body in itself combines a representational role on behalf of the industry as well as a regulatory role, and my view is that the roles are not compatible if we want a transparent and fair system.</p>

	<p pid="a.543.1/1">I know that the hon. Gentleman has stuck to his view. I do not seek to inject a party political note into the proceedings, but it is legitimate for me, on behalf of the Government, to say that waiting lists would be longer today than they are, waiting times in accident and emergency would not be four hours for everybody, and cases of MRSA would not be falling if we had not introduced national targets in the NHS. Experts in the Department tell me that in 2005&mdash;the very point at which the national target was introduced&mdash;cases of MRSA fell for the first time since 1991, which is when incidents of MRSA began to appear in any significant number. The hon. Gentleman has a view, but I find it impossible to accept that targets are entirely contradictory to the interests of the public or to good patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/2">I believe that I have covered most of the issues that colleagues raised. The hon. Gentleman mentioned metrics and whether trusts would be measured on the number of complaints. That would not be sensible. He may know that the Department has launched a new website this week called NHS Choices. It is not just a website; it is a comprehensive information service for the public, who can find information on the NHS that previously might have been difficult to find or that was in the hands of the professionals.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/3">There are things that the public need to know and should be encouraged to know about their local hospital, such as the number of complaints it receives&mdash;I do not understand why that should not be in the public domain&mdash;readmission rates, the incidence of MRSA and patient satisfaction rates, but that is very different from saying that anyone is using a performance management regime to make an overall judgment on the organisation. I agree that that would not foster an open learning culture like the airline industry culture that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire rightly referred to, in which complaints are encouraged.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/4">It is absolutely correct that a goodly number of complaints is indicative of an open and learning organisation&mdash;it is important to say that. Indeed, in making his recommendations, the chief medical officer carefully considered the parallels between the airline industry and the medical profession. We can learn something from the principle that to err is human, but to cover up the mistake does not serve the public interest. We have to go further in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/5">Issues were probably raised that I have not fully covered, but we shall return to them in the House before long. The Government will continue to listen on these important matters, to make changes if we need to, and to make proposals in a spirit of collaboration and consultation so that this country gets the generational settlement that it needs. As I said, I am grateful for the tone of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/6">The Department's officials have provided enormous support in taking forward the proposals. The team has performed exceptionally well. It is invidious not to name everyone, but I mention Gavin Larner, Charles Dobson, Nick Clarke and, in particular, Gina Radford, who encouraged me to address the subject of death certification. I want to put on the record my personal thanks to them for their professional work on the proposals. There are many more people across the Government who I could mention, but I wanted personally to thank those people for their excellent work on the package of measures. I am sure that they take huge personal satisfaction from the excellent service that they have given to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/7">No system of safeguards can ever provide us with an absolute guarantee against abuse from a criminal as devious and subtle as Harold Shipman. Nevertheless, we are confident that the wide range of measures that we are putting in place, which build on the invaluable recommendations of the Shipman and other inquiries, will deter any future wrongdoing and make it difficult for it to remain undetected.</p>
	<p pid="a.543.1/8">I thank you, Mr. Hancock, for the way in which you chaired our proceedings, and I thank all hon. Members for attending the debate.</p>
