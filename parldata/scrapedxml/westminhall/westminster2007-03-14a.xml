<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-14a.79.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" speakername="Jim Devine" colnum="79"  time="010:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070314/halltext/70314h0002.htm#07031470000493">
	<p pid="a.79.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> on selecting this subject for debate in the week of the Cheltenham festival, where the public face of racing is at its best. We know that jockeys are trying and that horses are trying. The crowd, the atmosphere and the craic are a great advert for racing. I would love to be able to report that I managed to pick the 40-1, the 50-1 and the 16-1 winners from yesterday, but sadly I did not, although I do have a fancy for a horse called Finger On The Pulse in the 4 o'clock, which might be worth an each-way bet today. I recognise that that statement could come back to haunt me, as this debate is being recorded.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/2">The horse racing and gambling industry is at a crossroads. Allegations of fixed races, jockeys being charged and horses being doped do not present a positive image of the racing and gambling industry. My comments will concentrate on Betfair. Gambling is big business in the UK, generating &pound;50 billion every year. Betfair takes up to 5 million bets a day&mdash;an astonishing number&mdash;and it takes those bets on the premise that every punter has a fair and fighting chance of winning, but how many people realise that they might be placing bets after the result is known, the race has been won, or the goal has been scored? That, to be frank, is where Betfair comes into disrepute.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/3">Punters can be in a bookmakers or at home watching a so-called live transmission, not realising that the pictures are subject to a delay of six or even seven seconds. That is a long time in a horse race and even longer in a dog race, where the dog from trap 1 can be past the winning post when the rest of the dogs are not even at the final bend. I pay tribute to the <i>News of the World </i>campaign, which has highlighted the problem in recent months. It recently showed two pictures: one from terrestrial television and one from SIS&mdash;Satellite Information Services. On both the televisions, the time was exactly the same. On one of the televisions, the favourite and its market rival were coming to the last jump; that was on the delayed screen. On the real screen, which was showing the actual time of the race, the favourite had fallen at the last. People were betting in running on the favourite losing. People who knew that the favourite had fallen were betting on that. Many punters who were betting on the favourite did not realise that it had fallen at the last hurdle.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/4">Clearly, someone who is betting in running and watching the race on a delayed screen is at a major disadvantage to someone who is at the track or someone watching on a different monitor. As I said, the problem is more pronounced in dog racing, where we are talking about one length per second&mdash;people can imagine the consequence of a six or seven second delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/5">Horse race betting is about studying form. It is about watching the horses in the paddock and being aware of the breeding. It is about the punter versus the bookie, not about a punter versus a punter, particularly when one individual has an in-built advantage. Horse race betting is about identifying the winner before the race. It is not about betting to lose. It is not about betting in running when an individual could, frankly, be cheated out of his money.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/6">A constituent of mine, Henry Spurway, was a traditional bookmaker in Scotland who with his company, Easibet, entered into partnership with Betfair in October 2002. He was not aware of these issues. He got the first licensed betting exchange in the UK and initially the concept was very successful, but problems associated with in-running betting and betting to lose lost him a substantial amount of money in a relatively short time. He has initiated a campaign, which I support, to ban in-running betting and backing to lose. Henry can be contacted at henryspurway.co.uk.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/7">The problems that I have described apply not only to horse racing and dog racing, but to all sports. Let us imagine Tiger Woods on the final green, looking to birdie to win a tournament. I am watching a screen that is showing in accurate time him making that putt. Someone else is watching a screen on which the pictures are delayed by five, six or seven seconds. If know first whether Tiger Woods has birdied that hole or missed that putt, I have an advantage over other people who are betting on the outcome. That applies to football and the taking of a penalty kick; it applies to cricket and tennis&mdash;indeed, all sports are affected and it is totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/8">Betfair claims that 400,000 punters use its system. How can that number of individuals be policed? In <i>The Times </i>a few weeks ago, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-20">20 February</phrase>, Alan Lee stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/9" class="indent">&quot;I am equally uncomfortable about Betfair patting themselves on the back for wrong-doers being brought to task. For while it is true that the name-sharing agreement between Betfair and the Horse Race Authority has aided the detection of corruption, this inconveniently ignores the fact that such corruption has first been facilitated by the betting exchanges. Peter Savill, in his time as chairman of the British Horse Racing Board, likened the scenario to a shopkeeper leaving his doors unlocked every night whilst also installing security cameras.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/10">Mark Tompkins, trainer and chair of the Newmarket Trainers Association, said on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-25">25 February</phrase> that</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/11" class="indent">&quot;if we had no betting exchanges a paper trail would not be necessary as people wouldn't be betting to lose. If someone got rid of exchanges tomorrow, he'd be doing racing a big favour.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/12">He also said in the article:</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/13" class="indent">&quot;I'd prefer to see no betting exchanges. Hong Kong, for instance, won't have them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/14">Hong Kong is one of the leading betting arenas in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/15">My predecessor as MP for Livingston, Robin Cook, said that in life he enjoyed two thumps&mdash;the thump of ballot boxes going on to a table at the end of an election night, and the thump of hooves on a race track anywhere in the UK. I share Robin's love and passion for horse racing. In-race betting and betting to lose are damaging racing's image. Those practices have been described as a cheat's paradise and I do not disagree with that description. It is time that they were banned.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-14a.80.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="80"  time="010:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070314/halltext/70314h0002.htm#07031470000494">
	<p pid="a.80.0/1">I strongly support the initiative of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase>. His constituents, a constituent of mine and others have been comparing notes, as it were, to make the case stronger.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/2">I have three points to make. First, the history of the self-employed people whom we are discussing&mdash;people who are not employed by a great state enterprise and who are trying to conduct their business, to be productive in the economy and to use their initiative&mdash;has been marred since the arrangements were changed nearly 10 years ago by the real administrative incompetence of the National Joint Pitch Council. I have records of a litany of unanswered letters and of complaints not dealt with. They were compiled by someone who kept meticulous records in an effort to do business as a successful self-employed person should. It is not satisfactory that, when the arrangements changed nearly 10 years ago, an organisation was created that was incapable of dealing fairly with day-to-day administration. That was the first cause of consistent complaint.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/3">The second was the subject of my intervention on the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green. The location of someone's pitch is a personal matter and people feel strongly about it because it can give them an advantage on a particular course. It seems to me that, if one is dissatisfied, one is entitled to an independent adjudication that is properly conducted on the basis of rules that are known in advance and of which a record is taken, so that if anything goes wrong the matter can be considered somewhere else.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/4">In my view the appeal process should be independent. Had I been aware of the proposed arrangements before the changes were made, I would always have so argued. I am the chair of the governors at a primary school. If we turn someone down for admission, the appeal goes to a group of independent people who can tell the school to accept the applicant. I think that all hon. Members would accept that that system is the right one. The lack of proper, independent systems is a fundamental flaw that the authorities in the racing world have never dealt with. It is not sufficient for the Horserace Betting Levy Board to say that it has oversight, but that appeals are none of its business.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/5">The third point is that there is a legacy, certainly of incompetence and arguably also of corruption and preferential treatment based on personal motives, which causes disadvantage to individuals, many of whom have worked in and served the industry for a long time. None of us is arguing for a system in which, for example, being born in Chingford or Bermondsey or Devon would confer an automatic advantage over someone born in Ireland, for example. We are arguing that there should be rules that are agreed to be fair with the industry, and which are known and stuck with. People could then join a queue to make their application for a pitch.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/6">Cash flow is not an easy matter for self-employed people. I have been to race meetings and I have put money on horses, and my parents were keen on racing and taught me to understand its importance. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase> said, based on his much greater experience, the reality is that finances in that type of business can be really tight in some cases. We are not talking about millionaires who have lots of money to invest and for whom the problems that we are discussing are unimportant. You can win a lot, but you can lose a lot too. Reparation is therefore an issue, and I want to add my plea for it to happen. My plea to the Minister is that, by whatever mechanism can be agreed&mdash;including on a cross-party basis in the House, and between those whom we represent&mdash;there should be an independent review of what has gone on, so that if people have clearly been disadvantaged there will be a way to give recompense.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/7">The people whom we are talking about are alive and well and have not given up battling. They have merely failed to succeed in breaking through the existing mechanism, so we need another one. We look to Government to intervene, because it must be better to act politically and in the public arena than to go through the courts. There is huge interest in the success of the racing industry in this country; it is an important industry. If our race courses are to be places where people, including tourists and visitors, want to go, they need to know that the system is fair; and if we are to produce employment in the racing industry for people from this country, it is important that they, too, know that the system is fair. People will not enter the business if they think that they will be disadvantaged or that information will be withheld from them without recourse.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/8">I hope that the Government response will be much more positive. Many people have been fighting this battle for a long time&mdash;years and years&mdash;but it is not too late to put things right. It is not too late to create a system that, when the arrangements change in the autumn, will be fair and will be seen to be so, with independent processes for dealing with complaints.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-14a.82.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="82"  time="010:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070314/halltext/70314h0002.htm#07031470000495">
	<p pid="a.82.0/1">I too shall speak briefly, because I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">the hon. Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> wishes to say a few words.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/2">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> on having procured the debate. I know from my own experience of initiating Westminster Hall debates that it is often on the second or third bite of the cherry that one sees action. He is absolutely right that the Department has a duty of care to ensure that the allegations of preferential treatment are put firmly to bed. He did not use the word &quot;corruption&quot;, but <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> did. There should certainly be a level playing field&mdash;that is essential. Many of the concerns that were brought to light in my right hon. Friend's speech would undoubtedly be open to judicial review.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/3">I suspect that outsiders who are watching the debate might think that some of the discussion has been at cross-purposes. I say with the greatest respect to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase> that he was talking about online betting. I shall do so, too. I believe that online betting is here to stay in this country. It should be encouraged and promoted to ensure that the best managed, most innovative and most ethical players can succeed, so that players who would tar the industry can be pushed away, rather than pushed underground. Remarkably, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, some 5 million bets a day are made on Betfair, and I suspect that we ain't seen nothing yet. We shall see far more online betting. However, that is not to say that the antics of the National Joint Pitch Council can be relegated to the past, because the sector of betting with which the council is connected will remain an important part of betting.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/4">I confess that I am not a great racegoer. I was offered the chance to go to Cheltenham today, but because I am not a racegoer and because of the important debates that are taking place in the House today, I turned the offer down&mdash;although, as it happens, I shall miss the vote tonight because I have to attend a state dinner with the President of Ghana at the Guildhall, which gives me an excuse on matters of conscience. None the less, I should like to say a few words about the in-running betting that is offered by the UK betting operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/5">I am close to Mark Davis, who is one of the managing directors of Betfair, and he has alerted me to some of the issues. It is only fair that some of them are put on the record, because when all is said and done I think that Betfair does a tremendous job. It is at the cutting edge of online betting, which is the way of the future. We need to embrace online betting, because it could bring tremendous tax revenues into the country. More importantly, we need to ensure that there is an acceptable regulatory framework so that those tax revenues do not go offshore, as has happened in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/6">All betting operators&mdash;including all the traditional high street UK bookmakers&mdash;offer in-running betting on most sports. Punters who bet on those sports generally watch the relevant events by means of what might be described as live TV pictures. The hon. Member for Livingston alerted us to the high-profile campaign in the <i>News of the World</i> about some of the problems that can arise in that regard. Depending on which TV channel an individual is watching, they might see the action with a few seconds' delay. That applies also to normal television, if one compares satellite transmission with terrestrial channels. By definition, that means that other punters, or traditional bookmakers offering services to those markets on a race course, might have a slight advantage if they are watching the event on a different channel with a smaller time delay. However, it has always been the case that a host of variables can give an advantage to one gambler over another. The punter who has a copy of <i>Racing Post</i> might have an advantage over one who looks only at <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>. Likewise, an online punter with access to a broadband internet connection will have an advantage over another who relies on a slower connection, such as a dial-up service.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-14a.106.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" speakername="Frank Cook" colnum="106"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070314/halltext/70314h0006.htm#07031470000551">
	<p pid="a.106.1/1">The hon. Gentleman must have read my script; I am coming to just that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/2">CCTV cameras are not fit for purpose. People brazenly throw drugs or firearms components over prison walls, safe in the knowledge that although they can be seen doing so, the cameras are not sharp enough to distinguish features. Criminals can therefore escape easily without fear of detection. The problem is compounded by a shortage of cameras and broken-down equipment that waits months for repair, the cost of which is prohibitive to the Prison Service. New CCTV operators require formal training, which, not unlike the cameras, is in short supply. When evidence of drug smuggling is gathered, prisons are unable to prosecute offenders because the evidence is not sufficiently robust to substantiate a charge and punitive action.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/3">At present, the Prison Service carries out mandatory drug tests on only 10 per cent. of the prison population, yet figures show that more than half the prison population are using drugs. That means that drug testing is four and a half times below the level required to tackle substance misuse&mdash;and that does not take into account the many addicts on our streets and in our local communities. Unsurprisingly, prisoners on drugs go to great lengths to avoid giving samples for testing. They carry non-drug users' urine in phials about their persons to obtain clean test results if they are subjected to a random test.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/4">Of course, non-drug users are quick to realise that there is money in selling samples of drug-free urine to addicted prisoners. Despite the best efforts of staff to search prisoners before they are required to provide a sample, prisoners still manage to cheat the system. Prison officers' powers are limited because they are forbidden to carry out intimate searches that would expose that illicit practice. However, even that deterrent would be unlikely to be of consequence to a determined user, who faces no retribution on failing to produce an unadulterated sample. If he is caught with drugs in his urine, nothing happens. Officers carrying out the tests are unable to conclude with any certainty which prisoners are on drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/5">The Prison Service is to be commended on its commitment to assist offenders to overcome addiction. It has invested heavily in drug treatment programmes. Prisoners who sign up to such schemes must consent to compulsory drugs testing, but that condition is proving to be no hardship, as prisoners can choose when to be tested and commonly falsify the results. If they have signed up to be tested occasionally, they can simply go to prison officers and say, &quot;I'm ready to do my test now.&quot; That takes them out of the system until their next turn around. Treatment programmes evoke sympathy, but are all too often labelled as the definitive solution in the war on drugs. They are not a panacea, or why would prisoners who enter prison without a drug problem be discharged from prison with one? The problem is growing because of our inability and the ineffective system within prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/6">Drugs are common in all prisons in England and Wales, yet it seems that methadone substitutes are the currency of choice for dealers and distributors. To feed their habits, many addicts resort to crime such as violent robberies and the targeting of the most vulnerable in society, especially the elderly, as they seek money for drugs. When addicts request help, doctors prescribe methadone substitutes, which can be purchased illegally for between &pound;1 and &pound;5 a tablet, but command anything between &pound;50 and &pound;80 in prison. A booming trade ensues, creating an unscrupulous yet profitable business. Once an addict is in possession of a prescription, it is not uncommon for him to sell it or the medication separately so that the drug finds its way once more into the local community and distribution system within the prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/7">Prison staff provide an essential and valuable service to the public. Working in an extremely challenging environment, prison officers risk their personal safety to confront&mdash;without appropriate back-up&mdash;volatile, abusive and illegal behaviour on the part of visitors and prisoners. Much greater, sustained public sector investment is needed in the Prison Service to address the steady increase in the availability of drugs in prisons, and particularly to combat drug smuggling. Extending treatment programmes to tackle the effects of drugs by preventing consumption is all very well, but that is of limited use without rigorous measures to stop their supply and distribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/8">Drugs use in prison&mdash;the scourge of substance misuse in the community&mdash;is often framed in the context of crime figures, and the trade itself is portrayed as a problem confined to and orchestrated by a limited number of dangerous criminals. Focusing our attention exclusively on achieving unrealistic targets in the fight against crime fails to acknowledge and confront the scale of the problem, leaves prisons unable to cope and consigns our communities to decay. Urgent action is required. The Prison Service needs support, resources and an unequivocal commitment to tackle the supply of drugs in addition to any efforts to treat addiction. Eliminating the passage of drugs into prisons would enable communities inside and outside to recover from a culture of criminal violence that is intolerable, insupportable and unendurable.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/9">The evidence clearly shows that the Prison Service is currently ill equipped to prevent the supply and distribution of illegal drugs in prison, which have reached epic proportions. At best, the Prison Service is merely holding back the tide of the drugs trade. At worst, it is being swallowed up by it. A problem of such magnitude and of concern to us all demands immediate action. It is recommended that the Government commission an investigation urgently and identify what resources can be made available to the Prison Service to fight the cause of the problem, and not just the symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/10">That is the end of my formal brief, and I am happy to have put it on the record. I also engaged in interviews with officials from the TUC and the Prison Officers' Association, who are all concerned about the matter. In my closing remarks, I shall mention some of the points from the minutes of our exchanges.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/11">The more hardened criminals, I was told, coerce more vulnerable inmates into allowing their families to be used as mules, as they are called, to carry in drugs, and a compliant inmate and his family can earn as much as &pound;200 to &pound;300 a visit. The problem is not only the drugs, but the cycle of violence that they cause inside and outside the prison. I am told that it is easier to obtain illegal substances inside jails than in society. Cell searches regularly turn up large quantities of drugs, not just the odd wrap. Unofficial transactions inside are based not only on drugs but on mobile phones and, of course, the threat of violence&mdash;where would we be without the threat of violence? That leads me to point out that I would like to be part of the debate upstairs this afternoon, but there we are.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/12">The cameras employed are not fit for purpose. If we can take photographs from space with the Hubble telescope, and heaven knows what else, why cannot we improve the standard of the CCTV cameras to provide a more discernable image outside? I would have thought that deploying more and better cameras would be a fairly simple and, if we engage in bulk buying, cheap exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/13">I have mentioned the national uniform testing regime under Prison Service rules, where 100 randomly selected prisoners a month are, as they say, MOT'd. Of course, once those 100 have been MOT'd and been given their clearance, they can carry on, safe in the knowledge that they are hardly likely to be tested again for some time. According to the team that I interviewed, of the last sample of 100 who were tested, 44 tested positive. Some tested positive for subutex, which is an increasing element of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/14">Responsibility for health in prisons was passed across to primary care trusts last April. I am sure that it was done for the best of reasons, although some in the service say that there are doubts about whether it is any better now than it was before. One of the serious problems that it has led to is that inmates can now more easily obtain paracetamol. One might not think that is a problem, until a prisoner overdoses on paracetamol. That, too, might not seem to be a problem, but when that inmate has to be taken to the local hospital for attention, staff have to be taken out of the prison to engage in escort duties. The complement of staff in the prison is reduced, which places increased duties on those who remain behind.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/15">I want the Minister to admit that the Prison Service has a problem, that it is getting worse and that it needs attention. It is not merely a question of throwing money at the problem: we have to examine critically and clinically the regimes that we have that disallow staff conducting searches and scrutinising prisoners' and visitors' activities in the prison. I am told that many claims are made for the Phoenix therapeutic course, which supposedly weans voluntary participants off drugs, but in many cases it has the opposite effect. Those who have signed up can go along for their test whenever they feel like it, get clearance, and then go back and continue to do what they were doing before. We must be careful about accepting statistics that are derived from such sources of information, and circumspect about the validity of the claims that are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/16">I have some direct questions for the Minister. He is a straight man and I have known him well for quite a long time. Does he agree that there is a growing problem? Does he agree that it needs more attention? The most I can ask in such a debate, in this place and at this time, is whether he will agree to investigate the subject on our behalf.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-14a.116.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" speakername="Brian Iddon" colnum="116"  time="015:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070314/halltext/70314h0008.htm#07031470000557">
	<p pid="a.116.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" name="Frank Cook">the Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook)</phrase> on securing this extremely important debate. I have just received the annual report of the independent monitoring board that inspects Forest Bank prison just outside my constituency in Salford. It is a young offenders institution as well as a prison for adults, and it is all male. The report is for December 2005 to November 2006, and I thank the chairman, Eileen Howard, and her colleagues, for all their hard work in monitoring the prison on behalf of the prisoners and staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/2">The prison opened in January 2000 with a population of about 800, although invariably it has more people than that. Fifty per cent. or more of the inmates come from Bolton, many of them from my constituency. I have visited the prison, which is run by Kalyx Ltd, so it is one of the unusual private prisons. Anne Owers, the chief inspector of prisons, was very critical of the prison in the year before the annual report that I have just received. Drugs were getting inside in staggering numbers. I saw tables full of drugs. The report contains the following figures, and this is a picture of a good year when there has been a crackdown: 9.885 kg of cannabis, 220 g of heroin, 93 g of cocaine, 43 g of amphetamines, 427 g of steroids and 62 g of Subutex. It will not surprise hon. Members to learn that they were ordered by mobile telephone, and that 355 mobile telephones were confiscated during the year in question, as well as, I dare say, many SIM cards as well. Those are all sold and bought in prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North referred to debts incurred in prison. Those debts extend beyond prison too, as does the intimidation of families. People are visited regularly, and there are no invoices for buying drugs, so those on the outside must take the recommendation of the criminal who knocks on their door collecting debts about the amount of drugs bought by their relative in prison. That leads to massive intimidation.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/4">I want to draw attention to an important fact. The prison put up a vertical net to stop drugs being fired into the exercise yard from an adjacent canal bank, whose tow path is at roughly the height of the prison wall. It is claimed that that has worked, but I have challenged that claim, because crossbows are now being used to clear the top of the net. The people involved are very clever, and will find a way around anything. However, the matter that I want to point out to the Minister relates to the reduced mandatory drug testing rate of 5.8 per cent. in this prison. According to the report&mdash;this is not my advice to the Minister but that of an independent monitoring board&mdash;the prisoners have switched to using buprenorphine or Subutex. There are two reasons for that. The first is that the prison dogs cannot detect buprenorphine, which is frankly as good as heroin&mdash;it will give that kind of buzz if enough is taken; the second is that in many prisons the mandatory drug testing does not cover buprenorphine. I advise the Minister to check that, but that is what the report says. Mandatory drug testing for buprenorphine is not happening in Forest Bank prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/5">I chaired the release of the Royal Society of Arts report the other evening in John Adam street, and the panel discussion was very exciting. We had a dinner afterwards at which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase> was also present. I think that he will agree that the discussion was extremely vigorous, and some very important people were present, including top cops from around the country. The Science and Technology Committee also recently produced a report on the ABC classification of drugs. If I had been fortunate today and Mr. Speaker had reached Question 14 at Prime Minister's Question Time, I would have asked the question that I put to my hon. Friend the Minister now: in light of the Select Committee report and the RSA report, and, indeed, many other reports going back to Runciman and beyond, is it not time that we looked again at the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971?</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/6">In many people's opinion the Act is out of date and we should include in it tobacco, alcohol and other substance abuse. One of the recommendations of the RSA report was that we should now have a misuse of substances Act. It agreed with the Select Committee that the ABC classification of drugs is useless and that we should consider the Blakemore and Nutt harm index, which I understand was published in <i>The Lancet</i> last week. We should base our drug policies on a harm index, rather than on a useless classification that we argue about all the time. It is surprising where ecstasy lies on the harm index&mdash;it is quite low down&mdash;and where alcohol lies. It is much higher up. Heroin and cocaine are at the top, of course.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/7">Finally, I want to draw attention to the integrated drug treatment system for prisons, which I understand is now handled by the primary care trusts in the regions where the prisons are. I am disappointed at the 60 per cent. cut this year from &pound;28 million to &pound;12 million. I accept the Minister's explanation that it is extra money, but it was made available in recognition of the fact that drug treatment services in prison were pretty hopeless and had to be improved. People who go to prison without a drug habit who are not lucky enough to be put on a drug-free wing are intimidated to such an extent that they start taking drugs. Non-drug takers can end up as drug addicts. Indeed, if they start to exchange needles&mdash;if they get to that state&mdash;they will get HIV, hepatitis C and other blood-borne diseases. That is a shame.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/8">A point not made so far is that 73 per cent. of male and 70 per cent. of female prison inhabitants are mentally ill. We should not treat only the drug addiction. All available therapies are needed to treat mental illness in prison, and we should allow dual diagnosis and allow people to be treated both for mental illness and for drug addiction if they are dually diagnosed.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/9">I have been told by inmates at Forest Bank prison about the easiest way to bring drugs into prison. A person who goes to court will see his relatives there. The drugs are passed from the relatives to the prisoner; the prisoner is then transferred back to the same prison&mdash;or sometimes to another&mdash;and the drugs go back with him or her. I have heard that prisoners are not searched on return from court; it is not realised how many drugs come in via that route.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/10">I am very interested in the subject, and I have a lot more to say but I want to give <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1377" name="Nick Herbert">the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> the chance to speak.</p>

Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook)</phrase> on securing the debate, which has provided us with an ideal opportunity to discuss an important and sometimes overlooked subject. I commend other hon. Members for their contributions, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> who touched on an area that I think is particularly relevant and interesting&mdash;the cycle of reoffending. People come out of prison with low numeracy and literacy, often having never done any meaningful work, and having had no fixed abode before going to prison, they have nowhere to live after their release. It would be an extremely enlightened employer who chose to take on someone in such circumstances. How people in that position can be helped to stand on their own two feet and to establish themselves in mainstream society is a huge challenge for us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/2">There is no doubt that drug use in prison has reached epidemic proportions. The majority of people going to prison are problem drug users. In 2005, a Home Office spokesman estimated that there were about 39,000 problem drug users in the prison system at any one time&mdash;that is about half of the United Kingdom's prison population. Of them, 66 per cent. of males and 55 per cent. of females sentenced had used drugs in the previous year. Drug use is not the exception in prison; it is more likely than not for those who pass through our prison system.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/3">Other hon. Members who have spoken today touched upon some of the ways in which drugs can be smuggled into prison. They include social visits, the postal system and receptions and occasionally prison staff. Sometimes they are thrown in over the perimeter wall and, as we heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase>, sometimes they are brought in through receptions after court visits. I understand that in 2005-06 400 visitors were arrested on suspicion of trying to smuggle drugs into prison. However, compared to the scale of the problem, 400 arrests seems a modest tally. The very existence of drugs-free wings tells its own story: it tells of the acceptance of the scale of the problem and of the attempt by prison authorities to manage the problem rather than tackle it. That is the scale of the problem that confronts those responsible for maintaining order and discipline in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/4">The problem is not new and it is not as if the Government have not been alerted to it. Many speakers referred to the RSA report that was published only a few days ago. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The inadequacy of drugs treatment in prisons is a serious gap in the chain of treatment for offenders envisaged by the Drugs Intervention Programme...Treatment in prison bears little relation to need but depends more on what happens to be available.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/6">In a slightly oblique analysis, the report also stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The Home Office favours centralised solutions that impede delivery of a devolved, joined-up policy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/8">The RSA report follows on from many other reports that have touched on similar themes. In 2001, a Turning Point report pointed out that</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/9" class="indent">&quot;The growth in the numbers of people identified as suitable for treatment through the criminal justice system is not matched by an increase in available provision. This needs to be addressed urgently.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/10">The Prime Minister's delivery unit said in 2005 that</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/11" class="indent">&quot;significant segments of the problem drug-using population are not in current contact with treatment services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/12">In August 2006, a Home Office report found that drug use is endemic in prisons. In 2006, the Prison Reform Trust found that no more than 10 per cent. of prisoners with drugs problems were likely to be in intensive rehabilitation in any one year. Only one in 10 prisoners who could usefully be in rehabilitation are receiving that level of assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/13">As is widely reported, we have the highest prison population per head of population in western Europe. That militates against the effective treatment of those in prison. As we heard earlier, ever since responsibility was transferred from the Home Office to the national health service, the NHS budget and the available resources have not necessarily met the expectations that some may have had. I understand that as a result, only 17 prisons are due to benefit from NHS largesse&mdash;fewer than one in eight of the major prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/14">Time is short, but before I conclude I wish to make four constructive suggestions. They are more, I confess, to do with reducing demand for drugs than trying to cut supply, which I appreciate is a problem. We all will the end, but getting there is not necessarily that simple.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/15">First, although we can discuss what constitutes drug treatment, it is the availability of drug treatment that is important. Currently, there are only 2,500 residential drug treatment places; such a place costs about &pound;6,000 less per year than a place in prison. The idea that many people find attractive is to use drug treatment centres as an alternative to custody for low-tariff offenders&mdash;not just because it saves money, although there is the potential for financial savings, but because it is more likely to have a long-term benefit, such as that mentioned by the hon. Member for Banbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/16">Secondly, there should be a presumption in most cases that could result in a very short prison sentence&mdash;perhaps of less than three months&mdash;that rigorous community punishments might be more effective. It is extremely worrying when people who are not addicted to drugs are sent to prison and leave perhaps two months later having formed an addiction. They have often also been introduced to lots of criminals and their methods, of which they had not previously been aware. That is not in anybody's long-term interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/17">Thirdly, we should try to improve drug treatment for people who suffer from mental health problems. There is a close correlation between mental illness and drug abuse, and many people with severe mental disorders are languishing in prison when they could be treated far more effectively using different mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/18">Finally, coming back to the point made by the hon. Member for Banbury, far more discipline and structure should be put into the lives of prisoners in terms of education, training, and work. We should also enable people to save money when they are in prison, as that would ease their passage back into society when they are released.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.0/19">I do not pretend that any of those measures are a solution; of course they are not. However, I hope that they will contribute to success in solving a problem with which I am sure politicians from all parties are keen to grapple.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-03-14a.129.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"  colnum="129"  time="016:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070314/halltext/70314h0010.htm#07031470000565">
	<p pid="a.129.0/1">It is a great pleasure to debate this issue&mdash;perhaps I should say discuss, given the number of hon. Members present&mdash;with my old and dear hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" name="Mark Todd">the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase>. The debate has reminded me that he tries to be constructive in all his remarks and in his often trenchant critiques of policy. He started by saying that this was not a tale of woe, although he rightly acknowledged that genuine grief exists, and that he wanted to focus on the positive. He talked about the makings of a healthy and successful industry. That is right, because, as he pointed out, the UK has many natural advantages and we must make better capital on the back of those.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/2">My hon. Friend has highlighted the key areas for debate, and I want to respond on those. He talked about economies of scale and the price of food. He identified liquid milk as a commodity and spoke of the need to add value by processing or by niche marketing. He also mentioned the ways in which the Government can and perhaps should be contributing to that. Crucially, he highlighted the need for innovation in the industry to help to add that value and he rightly identified the need to minimise bureaucratic overlap. In touching on all those issues, he has hit on the essential components of the highly successful industry that we both want.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/3">I shall try to respond in more detail on each of those areas that my hon. Friend highlighted and to discuss some issues that I did not pick up during my introductory remarks. In terms of value, dairy farming accounts for around 17 per cent. of UK agricultural production and is the single largest agricultural sector at &pound;2.5 billion. Household expenditure on dairy products in the past 12 months totalled &pound;7.3 billion. I understand that that makes dairy the second largest grocery category in the UK. The dairy sector is therefore of great importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/4">It is important to have a considered debate on the many challenges that the dairy sector undoubtedly faces. It must face up to some harsh realities. My hon. Friend correctly pointed that out, but he was also right in wanting not to talk the sector down but to look to the signs of success and growth. He acknowledged that pressure on farm-gate prices will remain. It is important for the sector to be realistic about the prospects for farm-gate prices; they are unlikely to return to the levels seen in the mid-1990s. I accept that farm-gate prices are not high enough for some to be able to sustain their businesses and that costs have increased across the supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/5">The acknowledgement of that by Sainsbury's and Tesco, and their resulting action to increase prices, is therefore welcome. The Government believe it to be in the long-term interest of buyers to establish fair and sustainable arrangements for dealing with their suppliers. It is good that there has been some acknowledgment of that, even though some might say that it is overdue. A number of retailers have initiatives to encourage closer working relationships with identified suppliers, some of which attract a price premium. We must also be aware that a considerable proportion of milk is sold through middle-ground retailers and catering establishments, or as food ingredients, as well as being internationally traded as a commodity product.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/6">The Competition Commission has found that the four largest grocery retailers account for less than25 per cent. of volume sales of raw milk processed in the UK. It is important that we are careful not to place too much emphasis on the major supermarkets, as others have their part to play. There have also been some positive developments in the contractual arrangements between processors and producers. Those relationships, which should help to develop greater transparency and trust, are to be encouraged.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/7">We hear a lot about paying a fair price for milk. If it is not the price agreed between a willing buyer and a willing seller, then what is a fair price? How would a fair price be determined without reference to the market price? Is it the average cost of production, in which case there would be handsome winners but many losers? What about those farmers who cannot match those costs of production? Should we subsidise inefficient producers at the expense of consumers? How would such an approach encourage efficiency gains? How would it help international competitiveness? All those questions go along with that line of argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/8">The industry needs to move away from the fixation on price and fix its attention on profitability. There remains a worrying disparity in the costs of production between the most and least efficient dairy farmers. In 2003, it was found that there was, on average, a 12p per litre differential between the most and least efficient dairy farmers. That is not sustainable. Given such a wide variation in costs, we return to the question of what constitutes a fair price. It is worrying and somewhat incredible that many dairy farmers are still unaware of their own production costs. We welcome moves to encourage awareness of costs of production as they may help to provide the information for producers to make timely business decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/9">Even with current farm-gate prices, there are dairy farmers who are able to make a profit. We may rarely hear of them, but they do exist. Such farmers deserve our encouragement and praise. One such example is James Hague from Daisy's Dairy, who some may have heard on &quot;Farming Today&quot; last Tuesday. He and his wife are new entrants into dairy farming and are producing, processing and marketing their own milk. They are making a very healthy profit by adding value and are providing a quality product and service, for which their customers are willing to pay a premium. Clearly, not all farmers can follow the same path, but individual producers have to continue to play their part as well by reducing costs and becoming more efficient and, above all, by innovating and adding value through processing and the use of niche markets, as my hon. Friend suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/10">The rest of the supply chain also has its part to play in cutting costs and maximising efficiency. There has been considerable investment in processing capacity and, as a result, we have some world-class processing plants. There are also some less efficient plants, just as there are efficient and less efficient producers. This is why, through the dairy supply chain forum, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is part-funding a study benchmarking processor efficiency on an international level. The Milk Development Council is also conducting a similar study benchmarking producer efficiency. We have also invested more than &pound;1.3 million through the agricultural development scheme to help the dairy sector address issues of efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/11">As my hon. Friend notes, increasing the value of dairy products is key. A 1989 report by Coopers and Lybrand for a milk marketing board concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/12" class="indent">&quot;the present pricing system and allocation arrangements for raw milk in England and Wales will hinder the development of an industry which is internationally competitive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/13">The UK processing industry is finally beginning to throw off that legacy and is now producing more value-added, innovative and branded products. To see that we need only consider the recent successes with added-value liquid milk such as Cravendale or Night Time Milk, or the plethora of branded cheeses, such as Seriously Strong or Cathedral City.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/14">While on the topic of cheese, I want briefly to discuss the debate about cheese and children's diet started by the Food Standards Agency. Cheese has a high saturated fat and salt content, but it is also an excellent source of protein, calcium and other beneficial nutrients and minerals. I hope that parents will use common sense when feeding their children and will include cheese as a key part of a balanced diet. They should not be put off by the tick-box approach of a few people in white coats.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/15">Another recurrent theme is concern about the numbers of dairy farmers leaving the sector. My hon. Friend alluded to that. It is not a new phenomenon. In 1943, there were more than 100,000 dairy farmers, but by 1994, there were 28,000&mdash;there are now about 20,000. According to the Milk Development Council's &quot;Dairy Supply Chain Margins 2005-06&quot;, the rate of farmers leaving the industry has hardly changed in the past five years and is about 6 to 6.5 per cent. The trend of declining producer numbers is not restricted to the UK. In some parts in the EU, such as Spain, the number of dairy farmers leaving the industry has been much higher than in the UK. There is a similar trend in the USA and Canada, reflecting a global trend towards fewer, larger herds in developed economies. Those economies of scale are exactly what my hon. Friend was talking about; they are the clear driver.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/16">My hon. Friend asks about an early retirement scheme. As the Curry report stated, a retirement incentive scheme is unlikely to offer value for money compared with the large costs likely to be involved. One of the report's further recommendations was that DEFRA should produce a supporting pack of advice for farmers considering retirement. At the launch of &quot;Fresh Start&quot; in December 2004, we issued two publications that responded to that recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/17">Concern has been expressed recently about the apparent decline in milk production. As my hon. Friend acknowledged, it has remained relatively stable&mdash;around the 14 billion litre mark&mdash;since quotas were introduced. Production is below quota this year, as it has been more often than not since 2000, but it must be remembered that milk quotas are a ceiling on production, not a target. Producers should produce for the market, rather than for the target.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.0/18">Recent statements that the UK will soon have to import liquid milk are overly pessimistic. We currently export more liquid milk than we import. DEFRA has commissioned a study which will be published later this year. It will assess the potential for GB-European trade in liquid milk&mdash;</p>
