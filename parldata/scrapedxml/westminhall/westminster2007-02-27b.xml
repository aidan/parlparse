<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-27b.189.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2024" speakername="Clare Short" colnum="189"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070227/halltext/70227h0001.htm#07022751000445">
	<p pid="b.189.2/1">I am pleased to have this opportunity to debate UK relations with Lebanon and Syria. I applied for the debate because in early January I was a member of the Anglo Arab Organisation's all-party delegation to Lebanon and Syria. The delegation was led by Lord David Steel and Jacques Santer, the former president of the European Commission, and organised by Mr. Nadhmi Auchi, the president of the Anglo Arab Organisation. The delegation included representatives of the Conservative and Labour parties, a Member of Parliament from Luxembourg and an Irish Senator.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/2">The purpose of the visit was to meet with representatives of the Lebanese and Syrian Governments, and to witness some of the destruction wreaked on Lebanon by the recent Israeli bombardment. Our aim was to become better informed about how the current situation looks from the perspective of people living in Lebanon and Syria. I welcome this debate because it provides an opportunity to report to Parliament on what we learned during the visit, and to press the UK Government to adopt a more balanced and constructive policy towards the middle east.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/3">In Lebanon, we met with the President, the Speaker of the Parliament and the Prime Minister. We also met with many influential thinkers, journalists and representatives of the business community. We travelled to south Beirut and saw the terrible destruction wreaked by the Israeli bombardment on the area of Beirut occupied by Shi'a people.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/4">In all our talks, leading figures were anxious that there should be a compromise in accordance with the constitution of Lebanon over the composition of the Government. Lebanon, which used to be a place of great prosperity, and which attracted visitors from all over the middle east and the world, has suffered badly from Israeli occupation and civil war. It was rebuilding and going forward but now, of course, the Israeli attacks have set it back again. People throughout the country were keen to be able to come together, to start to rebuild and to create better economic opportunities for the many who live in poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/5">A delegation of parliamentarians from Lebanon is attending this debate. They are extremely welcome, and I am sure that they have a variety of views about the situation in their country. My experience of that visit was that there is widespread criticism and resentment of US and French interference in the internal balance of Lebanese politics, and a deep anxiety that, following the withdrawal of the six-year representatives from the Government, a new Government should be formed that would prevent division and conflict from growing in Lebanon. The Prime Minister gave us a firm assurance that a compromise was likely to be reached soon, and I am sorry to note that that undertaking has not been fulfilled.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/6">I ask the Minister to spell out UK policy on that question. Will the UK continue to echo US policy in Lebanon, as it did in its failure to call for an Israeli ceasefire? The US position appeared to be to allow the Israeli bombardment to continue in the hope of weakening Hezbollah. I recognise that the Minister made some careful remarks&mdash;when giving evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee, I believe&mdash;in which he expressed regret about the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/7">My view is that the Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon was overdue and welcome. It created a great opportunity for Lebanon to move forward. Obviously, inquiries must continue into the recent assassinations and those who were responsible, but it is wrong and counter-productive for the US and its allies to back Prime Minister Siniora in such a factional and unbalanced way and thus foster further division in Lebanon. I hope that the Minister will say that the UK policy is to support all people in Lebanon in coming together, forming a new Government and rebuilding their country.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/8">From Beirut, we travelled south and saw the systematic and deliberate destruction of bridges throughout the country, and, as we got nearer to the southern border, whole villages that had been systematically targeted. On our journey south, we met with the senior representative of Hezbollah, who pointed out that in the last few days of the conflict, and even after the ceasefire had been negotiated, Israel dropped many cluster bombs which were still causing death and destruction.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/9">In answer to a question from a member of our delegation about his attitude to the existence of Israel, the Hezbollah representative said that all Arab states made it clear in the Beirut declaration of 2002 that they would recognise Israel if it in turn would accept the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders and with east Jerusalem as its capital, and if it would accept some settlement of the right of return question. He said that it was Israel and not the Arab Governments or the Palestinians who were unwilling to make peace. Of course, the Mecca agreement reinforces that possibility. He also made it clear that Hezbollah would not disarm, as its arms were required to prevent further Israeli incursions into Lebanon, but he also spelled out clearly that those arms would never be used in conflict of any kind with Lebanese people.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/10">As we reached the southern border, we saw village after village that had been destroyed, but we noted that some Christian villages had been left completely intact because of careful Israeli targeting. It was clear that there was not widespread blanket bombing but carefully targeted destruction on a large scale. The villages that we visited, where we were greeted with warm and generous hospitality, had been occupied by Israel for many years. The people generally supported and praised those who had resisted Israel's occupation and forced its withdrawal. Many pointed across the wire between Israel and Lebanon to the Golan heights, which is a Syrian territory that has been occupied by Israel since 1967, and to the land known as the Beka'a farms, which is Lebanese territory that is still occupied by Israel and a cause of grievance between the two countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/11">As I observed the wanton destruction, I again felt deeply ashamed of the refusal of the UK Government to call on Israel to cease its bombardment of Lebanon. I also reflected on the fact that Iraq is, I believe, still paying compensation for the damage that it caused during its invasion of Kuwait a long time ago. Israel has caused massive damage and destruction in Lebanon, but I have heard no one call on it to pay compensation for the destruction of properties and villages, and the infrastructure of the country. That is another example of the double standards in US and UK policy towards the middle east, and a further failure to require Israel to abide by and respect international law.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/12">From south Lebanon, we went to Syria to meet with the President, Foreign Minister, other Ministers and parliamentarians, the British ambassador and many others. The President lived for a long time in the UK. He is a charming and open man who, for a long time, was not going to be President and therefore took on the style of an ordinary western citizen. He is very popular in his country because he does not have a grandiose or fine-living style. He is keen to deliver significant reform in Syria, to open up the country and to improve the economic opportunities of the people, but he made it clear that the situation in the region made that difficult. Shortly after he took over, there was what has been called a &quot;Damascus spring&quot;&mdash;a sort of opening up. It is difficult to continue such reforms when there is such bitter division all around and organised extreme Islamist groups in the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/13">The President stressed that the Syrian regime is secular and takes a tough line against Islamist insurgents, but that it was keen to work with others to help to stabilise the situation in Iraq. He deeply regretted the fact that the UK did not have, as he put it, an independent foreign policy. He said that, before Sir Nigel Sheinwald visited Syria for talks on behalf of our Prime Minister, he had been to Washington and that his view was that the UK could play a much more useful role if it had an independent policy, but sadly it did not and it continued to be a complete echo of US foreign policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/14">We met, too, the UK ambassador, who pointed out that Syria had accepted large numbers of refugees from Iraq&mdash;nearly 1 million&mdash;including large numbers of Christians, members of an ancient Christian community that is now largely being displaced, and that refugees in Syria tended to be poorer than those who were admitted to Jordan. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees made a plea for support for displaced people in Iraq and for those who have fled to Syria and Jordan. What has been the response to that appeal and what contribution has the UK made in general and, in particular, to support Syria in hosting large numbers of refugees from Iraq?</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/15">The Syrian Foreign Minister is a veteran of long years of middle east peace negotiations and talks with great authority and clarity about that history. He was consulted by the authors of the Iraq Study Group report and was supportive of its recommendations for progress in Iraq and the wider middle east. Will the Minister spell out firmly the UK Government's attitude to the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group? It set out, in my view, a clear way forward for Iraq that would lead to responsible withdrawal, but which involves giving up the aspiration for permanent long-term bases and for the domination of the country. It set out, too, a way forward for the wider middle east, calling for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in accordance with international law. It recommended asking Syria and Iran to help to stabilise Iraq and pointed out that if Syria is to be asked to co-operate in such a way a settlement is needed on the return of the Golan heights to Syria by Israel.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.2/16">It was notable that, as reports were filtering out that the Iraq Study Group was likely to recommend that the US took part in much closer talks with Syria and Iran in order to try to help stabilise Iraq, we were told that the Prime Minister was strongly of the view that that was the right policy and that that was the policy that he advocated when he was consulted by the study group. When President Bush put the whole report to one side and failed, it seems, to accept it or to implement its recommendations, the UK voice went quiet. I would be keen to hear from the Minister the view of Her Majesty's Government on the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. I press him to explain why the UK Government continue to humiliate our country by acting as an echo of US foreign policy rather than adopting an independent and more constructive role.</p>

	<p pid="b.195.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2024" name="Clare Short">the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short)</phrase> on securing this important debate. My brief remarks will fall into two sections. I shall concentrate on the terms of an all-party early-day motion on Syria that I intend to table later today, but I shall also say a few words about Lebanon.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.0/2">One of the highlights of my parliamentary career will take place on Thursday, when a delegation from Lebanon, which is here under the auspices of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, will visit my constituency of Selby. I thought that only big metropolitan areas hosted such delegations, so I am really pleased that the delegation will be coming to the heart of middle England to speak to students in Selby, to visit various industrial sites and to meet local representatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.0/3">In my visit to Lebanon, I saw something of the country's potential. If a lasting peace could be achieved, the economic potential of Lebanon would be almost unbounded. It could once again become a prosperous area of the middle east. However, I shall concentrate first on the early-day motion on Syria that I intend to table later today. The early-day motion will call for talks at a ministerial level between the Syrian Government, the British Government and the Governments of European Union member states. I can think of no better person than my hon. Friend the Minister for the Middle East, with his robust style, to undertake such talks, because they will be challenging.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.0/4">The Syrian Government will have to confront various issues. In parliamentary answers to me and others, my hon. Friend has raised the issues of the so-called facilitation networks and of full Syrian co-operation with the investigation into various political assassinations in Lebanon, including the tragic death of its Prime Minister. There is much to challenge Syria, but there are also many opportunities. If we can hold talks and ultimately reach agreement with Libya, with which our relations were, perhaps, even more difficult, I fail to see why we cannot make an effort to normalise relations with Syria, especially because the prize is so great.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.0/5">I have been following the contributions to debates in the House by politicians who are far more eminent than me, and it is interesting to note that there has been a movement in recent weeks. My north Yorkshire neighbour, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase>, the shadow Foreign Secretary, has returned to the issue time and time again, pointing out the recommendation of the Iraq study group that an Iraq international support group should be formed, which would actively enter diplomatic dialogue with Syria.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.0/6">The Prime Minister sent his envoy to Syria last autumn, and I have noticed a change in my right hon. Friend's tone in recent weeks. He said in the House last week that there are signs that Syria is prepared to help. That is true; there are signs that Syria would be prepared to open serious talks with Israel, and that Israeli society and Israeli academics would welcome such an approach. However, the feeling is that American pressure is constraining such serious talks.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.0/7">Equally, there are signs of tremendous potential in relations between Iraq and Syria, and I note that the visit by Iraqi President Talabani to Syria was a long one. In the final declaration following that visit, the two parties stressed their determination to work jointly and to do everything to fight and uproot terror. Having spoken to our diplomatic representatives and others in Syria, the general assessment is that there had been a change in attitude in the Syrian regime and that considerable efforts were being made to secure the border and to achieve security co-operation with the Iraqi regime. Like many hon. Members, I have constituents serving in Iraq, and, as we draw down forces over the next few months, we have a responsibility to do everything possible to ensure their continuing safety. Serious talks with the Syrian regime would undoubtedly help that process.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.0/8">As the right hon. Lady has pointed out, Syria is a secular regime with a proud tradition of religious toleration, which is to be welcomed. There is a strong Christian community in Syria. The Damascus spring has been referred to, and there are big human rights issues in Syria that need to be confronted. There are also economic pressures on Syria&mdash;for example, the oil industry is in decline. Syria needs to open out once again to the world, but it needs to be encouraged to do so. That is why, later today, I will table a modest motion calling for discussions at a ministerial level to begin between the UK and Syria, perhaps under the umbrella of the European Union. There would be much support for that among American politicians from across the political divide. Such discussions will inevitably happen as the months go by, and we could lead such a process.</p>
	<p pid="b.195.0/9">Many parts of Syrian culture are rich. It has often been called the cradle of civilisation, and it has a great history. There is much economic and tourism potential in Syria. Whatever level hon. Members are at, we can only do what we can in Parliament. One of my proudest achievements is chairing the all-party beer group&mdash;one of the many things that we have in common with Syrian people is a love of beer. I will be organising an event under the auspices of the all-party beer group to highlight the rich tradition of Syrian beer. We will obviously invite the Minister to that event, which will be a small contribution to improving links between our nation and Syria. In the same way that tremendous strides have been made with Libya, I look forward, over the coming years, to similar strides being made in our relations with Syria, so that it can once again play a full part in the international community.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-27b.196.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" speakername="Andrew Love" colnum="196"  time="010:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070227/halltext/70227h0002.htm#07022751000451">
	<p pid="b.196.0/1">I join my colleagues in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2024" name="Clare Short">the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short)</phrase> on securing this debate. One of my great sadnesses is that she now sits on the Independent Benches rather than with the Government. This is a timely debate, because now and over the next few days, we have a high-level delegation from the Lebanon present in this country. I am saddened that no more hon. Members are present this morning as it is certainly an extremely important debate to have at this time.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/2">I had lunch with the delegation yesterday and we talked about the current situation in the Lebanon. The country has many great attributes, which I will not go into, but one of its great misfortunes is that it is afflicted with reflecting the wider conflicts in the middle east. When the delegation was asked what Britain and the international community could do to help resolve the conflict in Lebanon, the inevitable answer was to resolve the wider conflicts in the middle east, which play out incessantly in Lebanon itself. Undoubtedly, proxi-conflicts that have happened in Lebanon have involved one side lining up with the west and the other side lining up with Syria and Iran. It has been impossible to find a sensible and peaceful way forward to reunite the different communities in Lebanon and to ensure that it can have&mdash;as it has not had for the last 40 years&mdash;a peaceful future leading to improvements in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/3">Whenever I go to Lebanon, the people speak positively about the confessional system that they employ, but that system has a number of weaknesses in the current circumstances. On the Taif agreements, the disposition of the Lebanese Parliament was evenly split broadly between the pro-western and the pro-Arab communities. It is difficult to see a way in which that could be used to find reconciliation within the country. When I visited the country some months ago, we talked to the different players and blocs in the Parliament. During those discussions, it was clear that everyone understood the necessity to continue a national dialogue, but it has proven almost impossible for that to reap any real results and bring the two sides together. Indeed, one of the consequences of the failure of the national dialogue is conflict on the streets of Lebanon. Although, to the relief of everyone, both sides drew back from an intensification of that conflict, genuine concern was felt among the friends of Lebanon in this country and internationally. It was an extremely difficult situation that called for cool heads and rational discussion to prevent those involved finding themselves on a declining slope towards some of the difficulties that Lebanon has faced in previous years.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/4">A stand-off such as the current one in Lebanon ratchets up tension, and although representatives from both sides have stated that they want everyone to act coolly and sensibly, it has not been possible to chart a way forward. The stand-off involves the Prime Minister on one side and the President on the other, who refuse to engage in dialogue. In addition, the leader of the Parliament refuses to bring the Parliament together to discuss some of the issues that face Lebanon. I agree with the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood that by vocally and publicly supporting one side or the other, the international community does not help resolve the inherent conflicts. There have recently been incidents on the blue line between Israel and Lebanon. A number of atrocities have also recently taken place&mdash;particularly the bomb on a bus that killed a significant number of people. Such incidents raise concerns among the friends of Lebanon. We need to find and chart a way forward that will begin to find, if not a solution, at least a modus operandi between all sides in the political system to reduce current tensions in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/5">I will briefly comment on a number of related issues and ask the Minister to respond to some questions, some of which may have already been asked. The implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 is a critical issue that is currently being considered in Lebanon. The resolution provides a framework for a permanent ceasefire and would lead us towards reconciliation not just in Lebanon, but in the wider context. Bringing forces together to try and reduce tension in the wider context would help move things forward in Lebanon. Resolution 1701 is critical to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/6">Israeli planes are still overflying Lebanese airspace. That is a flagrant breach not only of resolution 1701, but of all international law. Of course, that inflames public opinion in Lebanon, and for no useful purpose, because it is well known that the information that the Israelis claim that they obtain from those overflights can be more accurately determined by other means. Therefore, the question that I ask my hon. Friend the Minister, as I did in the previous debate, is: what action are the Government taking through international channels such as the UN to try to get the Israelis to desist from that practice, which helps no one and continues to inflame the situation between Israel and Lebanon?</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/7">As I have mentioned, there was an incident on, I think, <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-08">8 February</phrase> between Lebanese and Israeli forces at the blue line. Fortunately, UNIFIL&mdash;the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon&mdash;managed to resolve some of the issues and has put into practice changes that we hope will preclude such an incident happening again, but we need to begin to resolve the existing border dispute, which leads to such incidents. The Shebaa farms is a small area that is of no consequence militarily or economically. The UN has done some work on delineating the area and whom it potentially belongs to, but we need to move that situation forward much more quickly to resolve the border issue and reduce the tensions on both sides. What efforts are the Government making to try to push forward the agenda in relation to the border and particularly Shebaa farms?</p>
	<p pid="b.196.0/8">The French President suggested recently that some UN forces may be moved to the Lebanese-Syrian border, rather than deployed in the south of country in relation to the Lebanese-Israeli border. The Syrians look on that as a provocation, and it is not, I suspect, a useful way forward at present. I ask the Minister what discussions are being held as to whether it is appropriate in the circumstances for UN troops to be deployed in that way, as it appears that that will do nothing to improve relations between the Lebanese Government and the Syrian authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.202.2/1">Thank you, Miss Begg. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2024" name="Clare Short">the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short)</phrase> for introducing this important debate, and I look forward to the Minister engaging constructively with us when he responds to the various concerns that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/2">We join the international community in calling for Hezbollah to release the soldiers whom they are still holding captive. We condemn Hezbollah on its record of launching rocket attacks on Israeli citizens from under-cover positions in areas occupied by Lebanese civilians. That action was wholly wrong, and it should be recognised as such by all the groups involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/3">The reaction of Israel in bombing Lebanon was disproportionate and devastating for the people of Lebanon. Last summer's air strikes damaged, if not destroyed, much of Lebanon's infrastructure, including roads, water and sewage treatment plants, dams, electrical plants, airports, port facilities, bridges and petrol stations. Civilian casualties were high: 1,200 Lebanese were killed and more than 4,000 were injured, with almost 1 million people&mdash;almost a quarter of Lebanon's population&mdash;displaced. Worryingly, the UNHCR reported that 60,000 homes were damaged with 15,000 destroyed and that 900 markets, farms and other commercial buildings were also damaged or destroyed. The damage to civilian infrastructure will take time and money to fix, and it is estimated that that will cost $3.6 billion dollars.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/4">According to the UN mine action co-ordination centre, 90 per cent. of the cluster bombs used by Israel in this conflict were used between the adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-11">11 August</phrase> and the cessation of hostilities on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-14">14 August</phrase>, which places another obstacle in the way of reconstruction in Lebanon. As Kofi Annan has said, it will take well over a year to clear the cluster bombs, and until they are disposed of displaced families cannot return to the daily business of agriculture and trade that is so vital to the rejuvenation of Lebanon. I condemn the use of such weapons because, as with land mines, their effect is often devastating to innocent civilians who are caught up in the conflict. Will the Minister respond specifically to those concerns?</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/5">On the Israeli front, the damage caused by the conflict has also been severe. The unacceptable loss of life is a tragic waste. The cost of repairing buildings, including 6,000 damaged homes, has been estimated at $1.1 billion. I am certainly not underestimating the consequences of the conflict for Israel, but as this is a debate on Lebanon and Syria, I will confine my remarks to those areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/6">The UK, the US and other major powers should put pressure on Syria to extricate itself from Lebanese affairs. Its involvement is a serious breach of Security Council resolution 1701, which calls for countries to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of Lebanon. We should encourage all Lebanon's neighbours to recognise the spirit of the resolution as well as its literal application. Lebanon cannot become a strong nation if its sovereignty is compromised.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/7">The UK's role in relation to both Lebanon and Syria, as well as other countries in the middle east, should be one of brokering negotiation. Events over the past month have shown Lebanon to be a country in crisis. The demonstrations calling for a national unity Government and the accusations that the Lebanese Prime Minister, Mr. Siniora, by seeking Hezbollah's disarmament is backing a pro-Israeli and pro-US agenda have caused fears of possibly violent clashes between Government and Opposition supporters.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/8">To help to solve those internal disputes, and in the light of yesterday's news that Hezbollah is rearming in security pockets in southern Lebanon, we urgently need to bring all parties to the table for renewed negotiations for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace settlement on all fronts, including Syria and Lebanon, and a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. That action was called for in the Iraq study group report, and there must be a sustained commitment by both the UK and US for it to take place. Until there are renewed negotiations to establish a peace settlement, conflicts will continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/9">The report also called for Syria to cease its aid to Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as to Hamas and other radical Palestinian groups. While Syria funds those groups, peace can never be established in the middle east. We must face down extremists on both sides, and the most effective way of achieving that is to ensure that they lose support from countries with a vested interest in the middle east. The UK Government should take a strong stand, and Syria's compliance should be a priority in any peace settlement discussions. I am sure that the Minister will want to respond to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.202.2/10">The UK's relationship with Syria needs to be one of negotiation and involvement. The report from the Iraq study group called for the US to create an Iraq international support group with Iraq and all the states bordering Iraq, including Iran and Syria, as well as other key players. At the moment, Syria could be said to be playing a counter-productive role, because its Government do nothing to stop arms and foreign fighters flowing across the border into Iraq and former Ba'athist leaders finding a safe haven in Syria.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-27b.205.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="205"  time="010:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070227/halltext/70227h0003.htm#07022751000462">
	<p pid="b.205.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2024" name="Clare Short">the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short)</phrase> on securing the debate. As she has said, the purpose of her debate on UK relations with Lebanon is to report back on her visit there and to seek a more balanced approach to the middle east, as well as urging that UK foreign policy moves away from being an echo of American foreign policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/2">First, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase> has made it clear&mdash;indeed, this was echoed in last week's debate on Iraq in the other place&mdash;that there needs to be a more holistic and perhaps slightly more sophisticated UK foreign and security policy towards the middle east.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/3">Secondly, we recognise that regional engagement will have to be reactivated. I never saw the US Iraq study group report as a policy statement; it was more like an &agrave; la carte menu, from which one could pick and mix. Although I fully support picking and choosing from it, it will not be easy to get some regional powers to engage positively; indeed, the middle east peace process is littered with attempts by all sides to get them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/4">Thirdly, as several hon. Members have said, the emphasis has been very much on the sufferings of the people of Lebanon, and rightly so. As I have said before in such debates, Lebanon looks more and more like the Weimar republic of the 1920s, whose democratic Government large numbers of armed militias, including the Nazis and the Communists, intended to overthrow. However, it would be a grave error not to recognise that direct attacks were made on Israel. No sovereign Government can allow members of their armed forces to be kidnapped without trying to get them back or face sophisticated rocket attacks without thinking of retaliating in some way. We should bear that in mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/5">Let me now turn briefly to UK relations with Syria. As the right hon. Lady has said, the Government are, in many ways, sending mixed messages about the results of their attempts to engage with Syria last year. What actually was the purpose of the visit to Damascus by the Prime Minister's envoy? What came out of it? Where are we today? Do the Government plan to continue those efforts, or have they been dropped in the face of reported US opposition or Syrian unwillingness? To take up a point made by another hon. Member, do the Government intend to raise such links to ministerial level?</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/6">The Foreign Secretary has said that Syria has</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/7" class="indent">&quot;expressed a willingness to become more constructively engaged with the Government of Iraq.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-02-20.135"><i>Official Report</i>, 20 February 2006; Vol. 457, c. 135</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/8">She pointed to the resumption of bilateral contacts between Iraq and Syria as positive progress in that direction, but has Syria expressed any comparable interest in being more constructively engaged with our Government or, indeed, the Government of the United States of America? Although one can criticise the United States for many things, Syrian engagement with the USA is perhaps even more important than Syrian engagement with us.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/9">Finally on this issue, what is the Minister's response to recent calls, including by the former United States Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, for an international conference on Iraq? Would such a conference include regional countries, such as Syria?</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/10">Let me now turn briefly to relations with Lebanon. As other hon. Members have said, it is clear that the confrontation between the Lebanese Government and Hezbollah has reached a critical point, because Hezbollah has withdrawn its Ministers from the Cabinet and is trying to paralyse the Government. Media reports suggest that it is consolidating its grip on southern Lebanon and that it is rearming. In the words of one observer, Lebanon has become</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/11" class="indent">&quot;a nervous country with a dying economy and with no solution in sight&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/12">What are the United Kingdom Government doing actively to support the Siniora Government? Does the Minister agree that the implosion of that Government would be highly destabilising for Lebanon and that it would probably initiate intervention by Israel or Syria? He himself has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Disarmament of Hizballah is likely only as part of a political process.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-12-07.663"><i>Official Report</i>, 7 December 2006; Vol. 454, c. 663W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/14">Is that tantamount to passive acceptance of the fact that UN Security Council resolution 1701 will not be implemented?</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/15">The disarmament of Hezbollah will require a strong Lebanese state. What effect is the Lebanese Government's current paralysis having on efforts to implement Lebanese responsibilities under UN Security Council resolution 1701? What impact have UK efforts to rebuild the Lebanese security forces had on their capability to keep order in the country?</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/16">Finally on this issue, the Minister said in answer to a question that I raised in Foreign Office questions last week that Hezbollah's fingerprints were all over some of the munitions used against British troops in southern Iraq. Was that statement in fact based on intelligence, or was it perhaps a slip of the Minister's tongue?</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/17">Other hon. Members have referred to Syria's long-term presence in Lebanon, and I have two questions on that issue for the Minister. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-07">7 December 2006</phrase>, the Foreign Secretary said that the Syrian President had given assurances to the United Nations Secretary-General that</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/18" class="indent">&quot;Syria will undertake all necessary measures to implement this requirement; and that Syria is willing to assist Lebanon in setting up an effective interdiction regime, and where possible to establish joint border patrols with the Lebanese authorities.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-12-07.1765"><i>Official Report</i>, 7 December 2006; Vol. 450, c.1765-66W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/19">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-18">18 December</phrase>, however, the Government said that the UK continued to be concerned about</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/20" class="indent">&quot;arms smuggling across the Lebanese/Syrian border&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-12-18.1511"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 December 2006; Vol. 454, c. 1511W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/21">Has Syria lived up to its promises to assume a positive role, or do the UK Government believe that it continues to arm Hezbollah?</p>
	<p pid="b.205.0/22">The right hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood has done Parliament a great service by raising this issue. None of us believes that there are simple answers, and more than one side is to blame. However, there is a growing consensus in Parliament that we need a more sophisticated foreign and security policy across the board towards the middle east. We want the Government to be involved in persuading regional powers to come forward, although my party certainly recognises that that will not necessarily be easy. However, we should also remember that while we debate this issue, many of our constituents are in harm's way in Iraq.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-27b.210.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" speakername="Mark Pritchard" colnum="210"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070227/halltext/70227h0004.htm#07022751000469">
	<p pid="b.210.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on what is an important and timely subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/2">When one talks to most people about their views on Iran outside the current nuclear context, one will hear about an ancient nation with proud traditions, an impressive history of innovation and commerce and a land of scientists and superior artisans in almost every discipline. One will also hear about the great intellectual capacity of the Iranian people and their desire for learning and knowledge. One needs only to look at the Iranian diaspora in the United Kingdom to see how Iranian people benefit communities throughout our country, let alone the rest of the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/3">Here in the capital, the national health service benefits every day from the expertise of Iranian doctors and consultants, and UK universities enjoy the learning and knowledge of esteemed Iranian academics. The contribution of the Iranian people not only to their own well-being, but to that of other nations, whatever their ethnic and religious background, is a contribution of which the Iranian people can be rightly proud.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/4">That is why the nuclear stand-off between the Iranian regime of President Ahmadinejad and the international community is a potential tragedy not only for all those people who might have to suffer the consequences of miscalculation, sliding to war or to precipitous action, but for the Iranian people themselves. The international community's quarrel is not with the people of Iran&mdash;the university student wanting to better themselves, the Iraq-Iran war veteran selling his merchandise in the marketplaces of downtown Tehran or even the imam calling his worshippers to Friday prayers&mdash;but with the intransigent and inflexible views of President Ahmadinejad. By seeking to pursue Iran's reprocessing uranium enrichment programme, he puts Iran on a collision course not only with countries such as the United States, but with allies of Iran such as Russia.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/5">President Ahmadinejad's apocalyptic rhetoric may excite certain elements of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, but it does not do anything to address the serious economic plight in which many ordinary Iranians find themselves. The President was elected on a popular mandate of wanting to represent ordinary Iranians and to address their economic woes and struggles. Therefore, if he is serious about his commitment, he should spend more time getting Iran's 3 million unemployed back into work, securing the border with Afghanistan and closing down the opiate trail, setting up drug rehabilitation and education centres for Iran's 1.5 million drug addicts, treating the tens of thousands of Iranians with HIV and AIDS, building new schools, roads and hospitals and preparing Iran's cities for future geological earthquakes, not military earthquakes.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/6">Iranians are right to ask why, when their economy is in such a state, President Ahmadinejad is spending billions of dollars on developing long-range ballistic missiles or on sending rockets to space. The people of Iran do not need me to tell them that there is no bread on the moon. It is also legitimate for senior army officers to question why ballistic missile programmes grow at the expense of Iran's ageing and decaying conventional forces, and why the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has a seamless flow of funds, but the army is squeezed out of updating even basic military equipment. Iranian admirals are also right to protest at the President's private IRGC navy.</p>
	<p pid="b.210.1/7">It is also right that Iranian MPs should be concerned about recent municipal elections&mdash;those MPs who got into power on the back of the President's claims about wanting to help those who suffer economically. Those Members of Parliament who follow him are right to be concerned about the recent elections.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-27b.216.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="216"  time="011:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070227/halltext/70227h0005.htm#07022751000490">
	<p pid="b.216.2/1">I will take five minutes and no more, I hope.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.2/2">When <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> spoke, he said a great deal about the history of Iran, which was interesting to a point, but highly selective. He did not say anything about the more recent record of the west's relationship with Iran, such as the coup of 1952, which was promoted by Britain and the United States and which removed an elected Government and brought the Shah into power. Eventually that gave way to the Islamic revolution of 1979. He should be very cautious about direct interference in Iranian affairs, which he appeared to call for throughout his speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.2/3">I am not here to defend the human rights record of Iran since 1979, or during the Shah's period. There are many things going on in Iran that are truly appalling, such as the treatment of religious minorities and trade unionists, and many other issues. All those points should be addressed in a spirit of solidarity with the people who are suffering such human rights abuses. The hon. Gentleman did not acknowledge, however, that there is a widespread unity of opinion among the Iranian exiled community around the world, which is large and diverse. In my constituency, there are Iranian asylum seekers who have sought asylum from every Iranian regime since the late 1950s. Nevertheless, they are, generally speaking, united in their condemnation of the overt and covert threats being made to Iran by the United States and the west, which encourage the belief that somehow or other the west can go to war in Iran and all the problems will be sorted out.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.2/4">There is no realisation of the two effects that those threats have in Iran. First, they allow Ahmadinejad and his friends to ramp up their power and their wish for strong armament for Iran, and secondly, they frighten the Iranian people very much. Surely it is time to recognise that there is a need for dialogue and peace and a need to cut down the threats against Iran.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.2/5">The question of Iranian nuclear armament and nuclear power is the kernel of the argument. I shall put my cards on the table: I am not a supporter of nuclear power in any form. It is a dangerous, polluting form of energy generation, but I recognise that it is not illegal under international law for any state to develop its own nuclear power. There is no question about it&mdash;it is a legal thing to do. If Iran wishes to develop nuclear power, it can do so in much the same way as any other country. I wish that it were not doing that, but it has a right to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.2/6">There have been allegations that Iran is also developing nuclear weapons. The evidence has been added up to suggest that it is trying to import centrifuges and enrich uranium, automatically leading to the development of plutonium and then to the development of nuclear weapons. The non-proliferation treaty, to which Iran is a signatory, requires all member states to allow inspections to take place. For the most part, those are pre-notified inspections and, under the voluntary protocol, unnotified inspections. Iran has not resigned from the NPT; it has withdrawn from the additional voluntary protocol, and we need to keep a sense of proportion about that. In its obsession with attacking Iran, the United States forced a vote for the first time ever at the UN International Atomic Energy Authority to bring about a resolution that went to the Security Council, which led to sanctions against Iran. I see that as a build-up, in exactly the same way as we were told an awful lot of nonsense about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, to create sufficient hype for an attack against Iran.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.2/7">Let us think through the consequences of an attack on Iran. If there is a war or if bombing takes place against Iran by the United States, Israel or anybody else, two things will happen. First, if nuclear establishments are bombed, be they for civil nuclear power or anything else, the danger of fallout will be enormous. Europe has still not got over the fallout of Chernobyl in 1985. Secondly, with Iran active on all fronts, the danger that a war will spread across the whole region into Afghanistan and Iraq will be enormous. I caution hon. Members to be a little more careful in their use of language and think through the consequences of the demands that they are making.</p>
	<p pid="b.216.2/8">We have been through the disasters of the war in Iraq, and we are still going through them. The war continues in Afghanistan&mdash;indeed, following yesterday's statements, Britain's involvement is likely to be much greater. Surely we need to promote peace and dialogue in the region. As if 500,000 and more Iraqi dead were not enough, goodness knows how many would die if we started a war with Iran. Perhaps we should be promoting a nuclear-free middle east, including Israel, which would involve nuclear disarmament and everybody signing up to the NPT. Going to war in Iran would be catastrophic for the entire region and for us as well. I urge caution and a real process of engagement with Iran in order both to prevent a war from taking place and to do something to support those people who quite reasonably demand human rights and justice in their society.</p>

	<p pid="b.219.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> for securing this debate and for allowing some of us to piggyback on to his initiative. Having said that, I disagree with a number of things that he said, which I shall address in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/2">I reiterate the view that was expressed by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>, who reflected the common denominator among Iranian resistance groups in exile. Whatever their differences, they do not want the contemplation of any invasion or military strike against Iran, as is being canvassed by the United States. Those exiles are proud patriots and they love their country. Not only do they not want it invaded or attacked militarily, but they share the view of the majority of hon. Members that such a course of action would be counter-productive and exacerbate a worrying situation in an enormously dangerous region, in a fragile world. If nothing else, we should acknowledge that the people in exile, who are suffering the denial of both access to their country and democracy in that land, do not want a military strike.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/3">The situation is grave. The backdrop of this morning's discussion is the export of terrorism from Tehran&mdash;that is generally acknowledged to be a fact; indeed, it is boasted of&mdash;and the growing encouragement of suicide brigades to create destruction, mayhem and death in various parts of the region. Iran has snubbed the views of the international community, particularly UNICEF, on how it handles juveniles. Furthermore, human rights abuses continue, whether in respect of a person's sexual orientation, their religious belief, as has been referred to, or, indeed, whether they are secular. Of course, anybody who wants to create a pluralistic society is clearly unacceptable to the regime. All that comes in addition to its determination to enrich uranium&mdash;for military purposes, I believe.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/4">The situation is very threatening. My concern is that the United Kingdom sends mixed messages to Tehran. I acknowledge that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase>, who went on the IPU delegation, has approached this issue in a very dilatory&mdash;diligent, I mean&mdash;manner. However, what was dilatory was our letting him go, because such visits send all the wrong signals. I invite him to consider this: we would not send an IPU delegation to Belarus. They are all pretty bad on the league table of rotters, but we would not send a delegation to Belarus, where, for example, there are no executions today, certainly not by the state. Sometimes, we genuflect to some pretty wretched regimes and we are not consistent.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/5">The biggest problem of mixed messages comes from Her Majesty's Government. The Prime Minister talked robustly two or three months ago at the lord mayor's banquet. I could read what he said into the record, but time is short. Basically, he made it clear that, as the Prime Minister, he considers that Iran is exporting terror. On other occasions, he has inferred that ordnance and weaponry from Iran, with the regime's fingerprints on it, are being used against British forces around the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/6">Those are the views of the Prime Minister&mdash;pretty strong stuff. Yet I invite this Minister to consider that Ministers&mdash;not only him, but others&mdash;send different messages. They are much more appeasing. The Leader of the House is one, as is the Home Secretary. They were singing from a different song sheet. We will probably hear more of that this morning in the 15 minutes allocated to the Minister. If nothing else emerges from this debate, there should be a consistent approach by Government spokespersons when they are dealing with Iran, because their utterances are read in Tehran.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/7">The hon. Member for The Wrekin referred to resistance around the world. He referred to the People's Mujaheddin Organisation of Iran, or PMOI, as a military wing. His view might be different from mine, but it is a matter of fact that the PMOI has not embarked on any military action since 2001. That is recognised by Her Majesty's Government. So the PMOI is no more a military or terrorist organisation than Sinn Fein or the IRA, with whom sensibly&mdash;albeit reluctantly&mdash;we have had to have dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/8">The PMOI cannot with any legitimacy be charged with being a military or terrorist organisation. It is simply not true, and the British Government acknowledge that. What is perverse is that the British Government, along with other EU countries, are still resisting taking the organisation off the terror list. They have done that cynically. It is in the public domain that the EU3, which includes the United Kingdom Government, said in November 2004, as an offer to the Tehran regime:</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/9" class="indent">&quot;If Iran complies, we would continue to regard the MEK&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/10">that is, the PMOI&mdash;&quot;as a terrorist organisation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/11">That is cynical and dishonest and diminishes our case. I should have thought that those of us who are peace loving would want to encourage peaceful resistance as a proud weapon. We know that some of the most effective resisters around the world are people who have abandoned terrorism, often in the face of serious physical attack both at home and abroad. There ought to be rewards for the PMOI and similar groups if and when they abandon their armed action. That is why I ask the British Government to reflect again. When challenged, the hon. Member for The Wrekin overlooked that unfair, unjust and imprudent terror tag. There is an old-fashioned virtue called the rule of law. In that sense, courts are above Governments. They sit in judgment, and the court that has determined the issue says that it is unlawful and unfair for the PMOI to be on the terror list.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/12">It is time that the British Government reflected. First, they should send much more consistent messages to Tehran, rather than variable ones from different Ministers&mdash;the more junior they get, the more variable they are. Secondly, they should stand by the decision of an independent court that has found them to have made a wrong judgment. We should stress that we look to the British Government to do everything that they can to resist armed conflict in that land, but also to find the distinction between appeasement, which has been the pattern so far, and sensible, prudent and robust dialogue.</p>

	<p pid="b.222.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> on his splendid speech. He was far better than I would have been at pronouncing those difficult words.</p>
	<p pid="b.222.0/2">I and others have long been concerned about the situation in Iran. The House of Commons has woken up to the facts only in the past two or three years. We made a terrible mistake in going to war with Iraq, and I am one of those responsible for it. I listened to experts when I should have followed my own judgment. I know that the Minister, who has been attacked and praised at the same time, is a fair man who is committed to justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.222.0/3">When the Leader of the House, a splendid parliamentarian, was Foreign Secretary, his approach to Iran was wrong. Perhaps, unwittingly, he gave some sort of encouragement. When my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" name="Brian Binley">the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley)</phrase> and I addressed a crowd of more than 10,000&mdash;I recommend it to all colleagues&mdash;at a rally outside the UN in New York two years ago, it was somewhat surprising that in the building were very important representatives from the United States of America and the British Government applauding the President. Now, two or three years on, the House has woken up to the fact that the President is evil and wicked.</p>
	<p pid="b.222.0/4">In conclusion, I do not want the House to fall into the same folly as it did in respect of the war with Iraq. I want peaceful regime change. I agree with the hon. Members for Stroud (Mr. Drew) and for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay), and my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South that, in the light of the recent judgment by the European Court of Justice, we should support the People's Mujaheddin Organisation of Iran. It is about time that the Government demonstrated a real commitment to peace and justice for the people of Iran.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-27b.227.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="227"  time="012:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070227/halltext/70227h0006.htm#07022751000503">
	<p pid="b.227.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> for introducing the debate, and for his demonstration of a classical education. At one stage, I thought of a variation on the old Monty Python joke: if only I had had the Persian, I too could have been a Tory Back-Bench MP. He has shown a knowledge of history, and he rightly emphasised the fact that the Iranian people are a proud and sophisticated people with a long history.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/2">All Members from all parties have addressed the core element of the debate: how we can involve Iran in the international community, recognise its right to develop nuclear energy if it wishes and make it comply with the resolutions of the United Nations, and not only those of the United States of America, Israel and the United Kingdom, that it should not develop nuclear weapons. That is not easy. For some time now, I have taken the view that the bulk of the Iranian people in Iran, and maybe even the bulk of Iranian exiles, believe that Iran has a right to develop nuclear weapons. It is not only the regime that believes that.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/3">We also need to think about what will happen if the Iranian regime manages, by dividing the members of the UN Security Council and by prevarication, to reach a stage at which one or more powers&mdash;hon. Members have fearfully pointed this out&mdash;decide that the UN's route has failed and that they will take unilateral military action, as they are entitled to do if they believe that their security is threatened. Do we have a plan B to deal with such a situation? Do we have a plan to deal with circumstances in which that had not occurred but Iran had merely obtained nuclear weapons? If that were to occur, we would have to consider a number of factors, not least the fact that if the Israeli Government decide not to use the military option, they will certainly, if they have not done so already, develop a second strike capability. We know already that many other regional powers have intimated that if Iran obtains nuclear weapons they too will go down that path, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and others. That will cause a vast escalation of the problem, and I do not think that the Iranian Government has thought that through. There are no particularly easy answers to the question. However, although I, too, do not wish to emphasise the bellicose military threat against the Iranian regime, neither should we say that it is an impossibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/4">The line that successive Labour and Conservative Governments took during the cold war&mdash;they never talked about the use of military force of any kind against the Warsaw pact, but it was always known to be an option&mdash;is a powerful diplomatic tool that must remain on the table. We should remember that however much we do not wish it to occur&mdash;and it might not do so&mdash;the United Nations, through the Security Council, can ultimately authorise military force. We should bear that in mind when it comes to the signals that we wish to send to the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/5">There is no doubt that over the past two or three years the Iranian Government have defied the UN. I am not saying that they have defied the United States of America, Israel or the United Kingdom, but they have defied the UN in such a way that countries such as Russia and China, which tended to be sympathetic to Iran's position, have been driven in anger and fury into supporting the sort of proposals put forward by other members of the UN.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/6">We should take a robust line through the United Nations, one that does not rule out the possibility that the Iranian Government would have to face a military option under the UN. It should be done in such a way that it persuades the Iranian Government that they are defying world opinion, as many hon. Members have said. Indeed, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> said, we should think of changing the behaviour rather than the regime. UN sanctions should be aimed at bringing pressure to bear upon the regime rather than on the bulk of the Iranian people.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/7">One specific area that I wish to emphasise to the Minister is that disinvestment will have an almost an immediate effect on the Iranian regime. The USA has started disinvestment in a limited way, as have we. For example, I understand that the governor of California has put pressure on international banks by threatening to withdraw Californian investments from those involved with financial support of the Iranian regime. California's withdrawing its investments is an attention grabber. I believe that, in the short term, that is the best way to grab the attention of the Iranian regime. My question to the Minister is: what specific measures are the Government taking, and what pressure are we bringing to bear on members states of the European Union? There is no doubt that certain EU countries with investments in Iran are not taking such action. If they want to prevent us from going down the more military line, they should take that very much to heart.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/8">This has been a useful debate, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</p>

	<p pid="b.228.0/1">I add my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> on securing today's debate. He could not have chosen a timelier subject. I congratulate him on the way in which he presented his case&mdash;he did so very well.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/2">As we have heard from a number of hon. Members, Iran is challenging&mdash;I use that word carefully&mdash;the United Nations Security Council over its nuclear programme. Iran is also providing destabilising support to extremists in Iraq and Lebanon, issuing dire threats to wipe Israel off the face of the map and, as we have heard, denying fundamental freedoms to its people. Addressing Iranian policies in those areas is rightly at the top of our foreign policy agenda. I shall take them in turn and deal with some of the questions that have been raised this morning.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/3">On Thursday, Dr. Mohammed el-Baradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who I met the week before last, issued another report on Iran's nuclear programme. The report makes it clear that Iran is continuing&mdash;and, indeed, expanding&mdash;its uranium enrichment activities in defiance of the Security Council. If mastered, those activities would give Iran the know-how to produce fissile material that could be used in nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.0/4">President Ahmadinejad claims that bullying western powers are trying to deny Iran its rights. He says that Iran's ambition is simply to generate electricity. For the sake of clarity, it should be put on record&mdash;I do so now, and I hope that it is marked&mdash;that we have no wish to deny Iran, or any other country, its rights under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, provided that it meets its obligations. We have not sought to stop Iran building a nuclear power station at Bushehr to generate electricity. We have even offered to help Iran develop a modern nuclear power industry, if it shows that its intentions are peaceful. I do not know whether that constitutes the appeasement of which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> accused me and others&mdash;it is great to have a new slur put against one's name. Never before have I been called an appeaser; clearly, I shall have to clean up my act.</p>

	<p pid="b.230.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to raise that question. We have raised it with the Pakistani Government on many occasions, because what the hon. Gentleman describes as luxurious house arrest is not an appropriate punishment for what the AQ Khan network did. In relation to Iran, the matter is extremely serious, and I shall add to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/2">I have taken part in two debates this morning, Mr. Martlew&mdash;this and the previous debate on Lebanon and Syria&mdash;in which I have heard Rafsanjani described as a moderate. I saw him give an interview in the run-up to the last presidential election with Gavin Essler on a BBC World interview. He declared: &quot;Yes, of course we have hidden aspects of our nuclear policy. We would not have been able to develop it otherwise.&quot; Rafsanjani was in charge of that Administration. We should be careful about dividing Iran into reformers, moderates and extremists. We have all got form, and Rafsanjani has got some too.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/3">The International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors and the UN Security Council have set out the essential steps that Iran needs to take to build confidence, which include the full suspension of enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. The measures required by the Security Council would not affect Iran's pursuit of nuclear energy. Iran does not need to enrich uranium to generate electricity. However, the suspension would<i></i>help to provide confidence that Iran is not seeking the know-how to make fissile material for weapons.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/4">There is an argument&mdash;I did not hear it this morning, although I was waiting and prepared to hear it, and have discussed it with Dr. el-Baradei, among others&mdash;that the IAEA board and the Security Council are wrong to insist on a suspension because Iran has either mastered enrichment or cannot be stopped. That is entirely misguided. Iran has enriched relatively small quantities of uranium, but it has not learned how to operate the process properly. Iranian scientists are yet to solve a range of technical problems and therefore although suspension remains crucial and pressing, there is still time for diplomacy to work. We remain committed to finding a negotiated solution and our approach has been to make it clear to Iran how it might benefit from meeting its obligations. At the same time, we have made it clear that it will face the risk of greater international isolation if it fails to take the steps required by the Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/5">In June 2006, Javier Solana&mdash;the EU's high representative&mdash;presented proposals to Iran on behalf of the so-called E3 plus three&mdash;the UK, France, Germany, China, Russia and the US. Those proposals are far-reaching and offer a way forward that would provide confidence that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. The proposals would also give Iran everything that it needs to develop a modern civil nuclear power industry, plus other political and economic benefits. Despite that, Iran has failed seriously to engage in discussions. The proposals are still on the table and, even at this stage, I hope that Iran will acknowledge the benefits of them and take the steps required by the Security Council so that talks can begin. The current sanctions will be frozen if Iran complies with the proposals and would be lifted in the event of a long-term solution. I welcome the efforts by Javier Solana in the past few weeks to urge the Iranians to take a positive path. I hope that everybody understands the significance of that and that real attempts have been made to engage with the Iranian Government. If the Iranians do not address international concerns, the Security Council will have no choice but to impose further measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/6">I was glad to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> talk about the effectiveness of financial sanctions, which are incredibly important. We know that such sanctions worry the Iranians most. An indication of that is the 400,000 Iranians who live in Dubai, where they think that they can do their business. They are living there in preparation for what they consider the inevitable imposition of sanctions as a consequence of the intransigence of the Ahmadinejad regime. Iran is not North Korea. It has a great history, as the hon. Member for The Wrekin has described, and it has a large merchant class&mdash;traders, scientists and engineers. The people of Iran want a prosperous country, but they know that that will not happen under the leadership of Ahmadinejad. The people of Iran understand that economic sanctions would be effective and therefore they are taking measures to ensure that, if necessary, they can carry on with their business outside Iran.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> asked about the straits of Hormuz. I was recently in Oman, where people are very worried that the straits of Hormuz will be blocked. This time next year, about 20 per cent. of our gas will come by ship from Qatar, where there is the biggest gas field in the world. There is always a reluctance to talk about the politics of energy in discussing this type of politics, but if we attempt to turn on the lights in our homes and nothing happens, we will be very worried about the straits of Hormuz. It is extremely important that measures are taken to ensure that the straits are kept open&mdash;all the Gulf states believe that that should be the case. We must redouble our diplomatic efforts in the Gulf to ensure that the other states in that area put pressure on the Iranians together with the E3 plus three and any other group of nations.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.0/8">On the proscription of Mojahedin-e Khalq, the Home Office rejected an application for de-proscription last year and that is, strictly speaking, a matter for the Home Office. As hon. Members know, however, the MEK is proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and its involvement in violence means that it has little support in Iran. The MEK claims to support human rights and democracy, but it is hard to square that with its authoritarian structure and claims by respected human rights non-governmental organisations of serious violations of the rights of its own members. I understand that an EU court has ruled that the EU's proscription of the MEK is illegal for procedural reasons and not because there is not a case against the MEK. The MEK remains proscribed in the UK.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-27b.241.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1964" speakername="Alex Salmond" colnum="241"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070227/halltext/70227h0008.htm#07022751000517">
	<p pid="b.241.1/1">It is a great pleasure to introduce this debate on carbon capture and storage. I apologise to the Minister in advance because I have a cold, and if I start coughing and spluttering during his response, that will have nothing to do with his answers on this hugely important subject. Indeed, I am sure that they will be so favourable that he will manage to dissipate my affliction and that I will be so enthused that my adrenaline will surge.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/2">Once in every generation, an industrial opportunity comes about whose scale and potential are so mind-blowing that it must be grabbed and realised. When something of that magnitude comes along, it is also incumbent on those in authority, who pursue the public purpose, to recognise the scale and importance of such opportunities. They must ensure that the decisions that they make and, indeed, those that they do not make, which can cause delay, do not put such projects in jeopardy. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>] </i>Perhaps I should tell the Minister that his pen is just to his right and slightly underneath the desk, if that is any help&mdash;I can see it from here. The Minister is now effecting pen capture and storage.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/3">My proposition is that, given its scale and potential, carbon capture and storage, which will give us a foothold in the hydrogen-based economy, is just such a concept. The second part of that proposition is that it is absolutely necessary that the Government and public authorities ensure that nothing that they do or do not do prevents the early realisation of that potential. Let me give a couple of quotes to indicate the extent of what we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/4">The British Geological Survey&mdash;the Minister will recognise this, because he helpfully pointed me towards it in a parliamentary answer a year or so back&mdash;estimates that potential carbon dioxide storage capacity in the UK sector of the North sea is 755 gigatonnes, which is an immense amount, given that Scottish CO2 output is only 50 million tonnes annually and that worldwide CO2 output is 8 gigatonnes annually. In other words, according to the British Geological Survey, almost a century's worth of the CO2 produced in the world could, theoretically at least, be stored in the North sea alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/5">That one concept gives us an indication of the extent and importance of what we are discussing. If the technology works and can be mastered and pursued, it could probably make the single biggest immediate contribution to addressing what the Prime Minister and many international authorities describe as the biggest question facing the planet: the inconvenient truth about global warming and the industrial processes that have spilled so much carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. We are therefore looking at something that could make the single biggest contribution to addressing that problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/6">Let me quote the United Kingdom Hydrogen Association, as well as talk specifically about the hopes that we have for the Peterhead project in my constituency. The project involves the pre-burn separation of methane into carbon dioxide and hydrogen, so we would, in effect, be building a hydrogen refinery. Another way of looking at the power station, therefore, is that it will be a refinery producing vast quantities of hydrogen. The association, which promotes the possibilities that the hydrogen economy could offer this country and others, says:</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The UK Government must support opportunities for UK organisations to participate in research projects, demonstrations, building global partnerships for deployment, which will lead to permanent scientific and industrial jobs, expertise, and business contracts that will have a positive impact on the UK economy, as well as regional economies. Conversely, failing to engage proactively may lead to UK organisations being left behind economically and environmentally.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/8">We therefore have the potential to store vast amounts of carbon dioxide safely in the North sea and elsewhere that would otherwise end up in the atmosphere. We would also have a foothold in the hydrogen economy, which could transform our transportation and industrial projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/9">I know that the Minister is familiar with the Peterhead project, but the concept is elegant as well as exciting. We will be able to take methane from St. Fergus, separate it into carbon dioxide and hydrogen through the pre-burn process and send the carbon dioxide back down the Miller pipeline into the North sea, where it will be re-injected into a largely depleted oilfield. That oilfield is to be abandoned in the next few months, but we will be able to increase its lifespan by up to 20 years and to take the equivalent of another 40 million barrels of recoverable oil out of it. We will then be able to burn the hydrogen in the power station in a virtually zero-carbon way, making 500 megawatts of continuous, rather than intermittent, power available to the grid. The project is staggering in its elegance and impact and will probably be the first feasible worldwide demonstration of such technology. It will therefore give us the most amazing opportunities to learn the lessons that will lead to the general application of that technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/10">In the jargon, the project, which is in Peterhead in my constituency in north-east Scotland, is referred to as DF1. DF2 is in California and starts from a coke process, but once the pre-burn is done, the process is essentially the same. This Christmas, the American Government, led by President George W. Bush&mdash;perhaps not the world's number one environmental pin-up&mdash;announced a $90 million tax allowance to promote the DF2 project, which is 20 months behind the Peterhead project. The Minister will also know that the Norwegian Government have announced their support packages for carbon capture technology. There is therefore a risk that any serious delay by the Government in coming up with the necessary proposals and deciding how to support this world-leading and potentially planet-saving technology will dissipate Peterhead's worldwide lead of almost two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/11">Almost 200 people from BP and companies such as PSN are working on the pre-engineering in Aberdeen and, indeed, England. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1955" name="Frank Doran">The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran)</phrase> is present, and almost 100 people are working on the project in his constituency. Towards the end of next month, when the pre-engineering design stage is finished&mdash;the scheme's sponsors, BP, General Electric and Scottish and Southern Energy, have already invested &pound;50 million in the pre-engineering phase&mdash;the teams will be stood down, awaiting the Government's decision on how to support the technology. That is another indication that we run the risk of dissipating our vital international lead on this exciting new technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/12">There is another issue, which leads to particularly pressing questions. The Miller field is not run by BP alone, and there are a number of other partners. It is due for decommissioning, and it is well known that the other partners want to advance the decommissioning plans. The clock is ticking on the Peterhead project, and it is being driven by the decommissioning of the Miller field. If the field goes into a decommissioning phase, and the engineering design work becomes a reality, with engineering work offshore, the opportunity to have the Miller field as part of the project will be lost. We will lose the opportunity to re-inject the carbon dioxide into a semi-depleted field, to have an extra 40 million barrels of oil and to use the high-specification Miller pipeline, which is there by the grace of God, because Miller was a sour gas field and therefore had a high-spec pipeline suitable for carbon dioxide. I therefore want some indication from the Minister that the Government are aware that the timetable is tight and that the need for action is pressing if this opportunity is to be grasped.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/13">I was somewhat concerned by the Prime Minister's responses at the recent meeting of the Liaison Committee, when he was asked by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North about the Peterhead project, and in particular whether he was concerned that delay might result in the opportunity being lost. The Prime Minister said that he was a great supporter of the project, which would heat 250,000 homes. It is actually double that; the early project would have heated 250,000 but the current project will heat 500,000 and it is a nearly 500 MW project. Then he said that the trouble was that the Government had to assess the eight or nine other projects. Perhaps the Minister will tell me today what state of readiness those eight or nine projects are in. My understanding is that few of them are even on the drawing board, never mind ready to come off it. If the Government's decision making involves considering those other projects, there will inevitably be delay in realising the potential of any one project.</p>
	<p pid="b.241.1/14">I suggest to the Minister that there are various ways to allow the technology to be supported. One way in particular would involve the Government in little risk, and would not, as the Prime Minister seemed to think, involve spending massive amounts of public money.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-27b.244.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1964" speakername="Alex Salmond" colnum="244"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070227/halltext/70227h0009.htm#07022751000523">
	<p pid="b.244.0/1">I hope that that was a supportive intervention and that as a Member of Parliament for a constituency in the north-east of Scotland the hon. Gentleman supports the project. If he gives me a second or two I shall explain exactly the proposal that I was going to make to the Minister. There are two ways to support a carbon capture and storage project. One is a challenge funding mechanism, by which the first project would be guaranteed, perhaps with a capital grant&mdash;even a substantial one&mdash;so that the technology could be proven. The advantages of proving such a technology would be available to industry as a whole. That would justify taking that route. That is roughly the route that the President of the United States has chosen to go down with DF2 and the $90 million tax allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/2">There is of course another way to support the project. My understanding of the economics, certainly of the Peterhead project, and hopefully of the other competitor projects coming along behind, is that they could go ahead for something of the order of 80 per cent. of the current trading price of a renewable obligation certificate in the environmental and renewable energy sector, if the Government could guarantee that to all carbon capture projects, or at least to the early ones. However, the projects would have to have the certainty from the Government that that level of support would be available when they came on stream.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/3">There would be significant advantages to the Government in taking that approach now. It would mean that they would have no capital risk, technology risk or production risk in supporting the project. They would be placing the early carbon capture projects at a level just below the trading price of current renewable energy projects. That would also allow the projects to find their place in the market. They would find their place, by definition, in terms of what was the best project. Early decision making would allow the proposals to go ahead early, instead of waiting for what might be a lengthy Government examination and review.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/4">I know that the Minister will argue that the Government have not been delaying, but a process took place in relation to the previous Budget and the pre-Budget report, when indications were given about the Norwegian agreement and the Government's approach to the matter. It was widely hoped and expected that in this year's Budget the Government would determine their intentions on how to support the technology. There has been some speculation in the press about the delay in decision making. An article in <i>The Observer</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-25">25 February</phrase> mentions a &quot;growing belief&quot; that the Chancellor of the Exchequer</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/5" class="indent">&quot;is waiting to become Prime Minister before he acts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/6">It quotes &quot;one industry insider&quot; as saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The issue is going to run into his premiership so that he can get the credit&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/8">[Hon. Members: &quot;Surely not.&quot;] I should welcome an indication from the Minister that such technology and such an opportunity is too important to get caught up in any delay because of Labour party leadership changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/9">I hope that the Minister will assure us that the issue is being dealt with as it should be: as a matter of the scale of the industrial opportunity, and Government determination not to allow delays and the dissipation of the two-year lead. I hope that something like my suggestion may be considered by the Government as a way to support this vital technology without the capital, technology or production risk that would otherwise be involved. I know that the Minister is aware that the European commissioner and many bodies, including the European Commission and the Royal Society of Chemistry, have already indicated their support. I hope that the Minister will say that an opportunity of this scale will be firmly grasped by the Government without further delay.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-27b.249.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" speakername="Ashok Kumar" colnum="249"  time="013:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070227/halltext/70227h0010.htm#07022751000531">
	<p pid="b.249.1/1">First, I thank Mr. Speaker for granting me this Adjournment debate, in which I wish to raise the current situation relating to the urgent need to upgrade rail links to and from Teesport. It is at the heart of the case for the development of the Teesport complex and for attracting much needed inward investment to the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/2">I wish to say a few words about the complex, as it is an economic driver for both Teesside and the UK. Teesport is the second largest port in volume in the United Kingdom and the 10th largest in western Europe. In 2005 the port of Tees and Hartlepool handled 55 million tonnes of cargo and goods, representing almost 10 per cent. of UK ports' foreign and domestic traffic flow. In recent years the port has handled an increasing flow of container traffic. At present about 7.8 million 20-ft equivalent units&mdash;TEUs&mdash;of containers enter and leave the UK per annum. Owing to the growth in the manufacture of finished goods in the far east and the increasing demand for such goods in the UK, that level is expected to rise by 400,000 TEUs of containers a year. The UK's port facilities are currently incapable of absorbing that growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/3">I am aware of the recent decisions to allow for port expansion at Felixstowe and Harwich and of the Minister being minded to approve the London gateway. PD Ports remains convinced that there is a strong commercial case for the expansion of Teesport, providing deep-water berthing in close proximity to major consumer markets. That would make a strong case to shippers and handling agents, particularly as it is estimated that more than 50 per cent. of all container traffic to the UK via ports in the south is destined for markets north of Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/4">The port has submitted an ambitious planning proposal to the local planning authority, Redcar and Cleveland council, and separately to the Department for Transport. The proposal is for a major expansion of the container side of the port's operations to provide new berths so that larger, more modern deep-sea container ships can call at Teesport. The development would be a big employment boost for Teesside and the north-east, bringing 500 highly skilled jobs and a further 2,000 direct and 3,000 indirect jobs. The port has had recent success in developing a riverside facility for Asda Wal-Mart, and in 2003 it invested &pound;12 million in upgrading its container terminal. This is not just a pipe dream.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/5">The key issue that I wish to raise is the concern about access to and from Teesport and the best way to improve it. There is no real argument about road access, but container traffic being transported by rail rather than on the roads is more environmentally friendly and allows for greater security of carriage. There are significant constraints that preclude full access between Teesport and the east coast main line and beyond. Those constraints must be overcome. They are not on the availability of train paths, as evidenced by the partnership between PD Ports and Corus, which set up a direct internal rail link between the steelworks complex and shipping berths, which released extra freight trains paths. The problem lies in the present gauge limitation on much of the UK rail system.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/6">The rail lines near the port that connect with the east coast main line are at W8 standard, which allows only old, 8 ft 6 in-tall containers to be carried on standard intermodal rail wagons. Global shipping lines are increasingly utilising more modern containers, known as high-cube containers because they are 1 ft taller&mdash;9 ft 6 in. That places Teesport at a disadvantage. The rest of the east coast main line is currently at W9 standard. High-cube, modern generation, 9 ft 6 in containers cannot travel on both W8 and W9 gauge tracks, but both W8 and W9 are adequate for use by freight trains with low-wheelbase well wagons and those known as low-profile pocket wagons. In its planning application details, PD Ports has assumed the use of such wagons to allow the inland transportation of modern, high-cube containers to and from the port by rail.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/7">However, the use of low-liners or well wagons is not the optimum solution. The payload, or economic viability, of freight trains is reduced by low platform-height wagons. In addition, Network Rail has identified 20 obstacles on the gauge of the Tees valley rail line, including one major obstacle in the shape of a tunnel near Yarm. Those obstacles need to be removed in order to create a rail line that is cleared to W10 standard gauge. The issue is quantifiable in scale, scope and remediation costs. The trouble is that it has been bogged down in the excessive complexities of the national rail investment programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/8">Initially, the former Strategic Rail Authority decided that the matter needed to be considered in the rail utilisation study for the entire east coast main line. That work has now been taken over by Network Rail, operating under the aegis of the Office of the Rail Regulator. The east coast main line route utilisation study and its parallel freight route utilisation study were part of a 2006 consultation process undertaken by Network Rail. I fear that the study was so wide ranging and involved so many major players that smaller improvements such as the one that I am advocating may get lost in the long grass.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/9">I am aware that the Minister has visited Teesport and recognised the strength of PD Ports' case. I was pleased when he suggested that the best way forward would be to consider the issue through the mechanism of a transport innovation fund grant. A submission was made and in July last year the Teesport rail connection was listed as one of the contenders for possible funding. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport then announced the outcome of the transport innovation fund application process to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-18">18 December</phrase> last year. On the bid for the Teesport east coast main line link improvements, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The Teesport/east coast main line rail gauge enhancement scheme fitted well with our strategic approach, but the scheme was not sufficiently developed to enable an accurate appraisal to take place. Network Rail have, however, been working with the Northern Way and other stakeholders to develop a wider Northern &quot;W10 gauge&quot; strategy for routes to markets for the major northern ports, in which Teesport would be a key element. We look forward to seeing the outcome of this work.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2006-12-18.135"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 December 2006; Vol. 454, c. 135WS</phrase>-136WS.]</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/11">I am not criticising the Secretary of State's decisions, which I have no doubt were based on intellectually sound advice from his civil servants. I am sure that the work that he described will go forward and be examined when it is ready. However, I emphasise my concern that easily identifiable improvements to relatively short stretches of the lines between Teesport and the east coast main line will be subsumed into a wider study. That study will encompass a far wider geographical area, perhaps considering ports as diverse as the Humber and Liverpool. It will also consider a wider W10 gauge approach, which will be long, complicated and costly to first understand and then hopefully implement. I am concerned that the process will make the simple improvements to the Tees valley rail programme that I have outlined much more difficult to attain.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/12">Teesport is crucial to the national economy and the implementation of the proposals and investments from PD Ports, and it can create jobs and increase competition. Some thought should therefore be given to fast-tracking these matters. For once, cash is not a problem. I am aware that transport innovation funds require contributions from proposed beneficiaries, and provided that those are geographically ring-fenced within a reasonable distance from the port, I am sure that PD Ports will play its part in possible financing schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/13">However, speed is of the essence. The west coast main line has recently been upgraded to W12 gauge at the expense of the public purse and Network Rail, but that is not the case for the east coast main line. Both lines are equally important strategic rail links. The need for extra container handling capacity in the UK both at our ports and on our railways is an issue here and now. If we only build new ports in the south, our road and rail networks in and around the south-east will be jammed for ever. We need to quickly enhance rail links to this key northern port to ensure that it can fulfil its huge potential. I am sure that the managers of PD Ports would welcome another meeting with Ministers to look at some of the points I have highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="b.249.1/14">I hope that the Minister will seriously consider making a helpful reply today and grant me a meeting to explore some of these ideas, because as I said, they are essential for the Tees valley, the north-east economy and the economy of our country.</p>
