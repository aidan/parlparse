<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-21a.137.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" speakername="Kevin Barron" colnum="137"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080221/halltext/80221h0001.htm#080221126000390">
	<p pid="a.137.2/1">I hope to make quick progress in my contribution as Chairman of the Select Committee on Health to give others, both members of the Committee&mdash;three are currently present&mdash;and other hon. Members, the opportunity to have a say on our report on the electronic patient record.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/2">The terms of reference for our inquiry were:</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/3" class="indent">&quot;What patient information will be held on the new local and national electronic record systems&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/4">including whether patients may prevent their personal data from being placed on the system. That issue has been running around in certain quarters of the media for a considerable time.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/5">We also considered who will have access to locally and nationally held information and under what circumstances, whether patient confidentiality can adequately be protected and how data held on the new system can and should be used for purposes other than the delivery of care. Clinical research is an obvious such purpose, and most hon. Members know that there are two reasons why we are successful at it as a nation. First, we have a national health service&mdash;we have had it for 59 years&mdash;which tends to bring together clinicians in both the public and private sectors, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry and other related industries. Secondly, we have conducted a wealth of research, which has led to great improvements in patient care in our health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/6">We examined progress on developing the NHS care records service and the data spine and why delivery of the new system is up to two years behind schedule. One or two hon. Members present, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1738" name="Richard Bacon">the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon)</phrase>, have become expert on that, and no doubt we will hear a few words from the hon. Gentleman later.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/7">We received 70 pieces of written evidence, which were submitted by academics, lawyers and IT companies as well as by a number of staff and patient groups. The Department of Health also provided us with an initial memorandum and sent additional submissions on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-12">12 June</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-16">16 July</phrase>. We held oral evidence sessions between April and June.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/8">We made a number of visits to different parts of the globe. Hon. Members may have seen the interesting article in <i>The Independent </i>last week, which included a record of how money has been spent by Select Committees. We came fourth in that list&mdash;we were not in a medal position. We went to Nashville, Tennessee, not because we are particular fans of country music, but to talk to the people who are implementing the system there. One of the most detailed care record systems in the both the community sector and the acute sector, as we call it in the UK, is in a children's hospital in Nashville, which is also a teaching hospital. We saw exactly how it helps the clinician and the patient in situ in what we call the secondary sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/9">We also examined the US veterans&mdash;not veterinary&mdash;administration, which has a database of some 6 million records of vets. We think that it is probably the biggest such database in the world, although it does not match the scale of ambition in the UK. It was good to talk to people who have been involved in it for many years. One thing that we learned was that, when there were the disastrous problems caused by the hurricane in New Orleans and all the local systems were shut down, the health care of the veterans who got out could continue because of that database. It worked well, and those people's needs were not lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/10">We were supported by the wealth of the Committee's secretariat&mdash;I pay tribute to them once again&mdash;because our service in the House as overseers of what happens in Government and wider health care issues is well served by our permanent advisers. We also had three advisers whom I wish to thank, Professor Ross Anderson, Dr. Jem Rashbass and Professor John Williams, who advised us on the details of the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/11">We considered matters under four headings, which I shall run through to give a flavour of what we did. The first was an overview of electronic patient record systems. As I have said, we went out to the United States, and we also went to Canada to examine what was happening there. We also went to Amiens in France to see the hospital system and to Paris. We were able to do international comparisons of what is held, where it is held and how it is used. We also went to Homerton hospital, which is here in London, to see what happens to the detailed care records there.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/12">We came out with the idea, which forms part of our recommendations, that</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/13" class="indent">&quot;The EPR is essential and is the top priority for improving health care. The installation of a comprehensive IT system is a long journey best managed by a staged and piloted development not a big bang approach.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/14">Hon. Members might give their views on that later. We believe that</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/15" class="indent">&quot;The input of end-users is vital in planning, design and implementation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/16">As my hon. Friend the Minister knows, our report states that that could be greatly improved in the UK system in some instances.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/17">We concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/18" class="indent">&quot;Local flexibility is essential to allowing continued use of effective systems already in place, as is interoperability if local systems are to communicate with one another.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/19">I have personal experience of that; years ago, my local hospital could not talk to the local general practitioner's service. They both had computer systems, but when they wanted to put out a report on discharge into the community, it was fed out on paper and sent in the post. In this day and age, that should not happen, particularly if somebody being discharged from hospital has a continuing care need. The record should be passed over as efficiently as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/20">We also found that</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/21" class="indent">&quot;EPR systems make more personal health data accessible to more people,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/22">but that</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/23" class="indent">&quot;breaches of security and confidentiality must be regarded as serious matters.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/24">I shall have more to say about that in a few minutes. Our final conclusion in our overview of EPR systems was:</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/25" class="indent">&quot;The support of the public must be obtained. The fact that EPR systems are essential for the delivery of modern health care and can improve communication between different health care staff and between staff and patients must be adequately publicised to users of the NHS. We believe this would help to convince people of the necessity and benefits of the EPR and reduce resistance where it exists.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/26">The second matter that we considered was the summary care record&mdash;the concept of having 60 million individual summary care records on one database&mdash;which has grabbed headlines for a number of years. It is likely that that record will be in several places rather than on one database, but they will be interoperable. The summary care record is still being piloted, and hon. Members will read in some detail what we have said about the pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/27">One thing on which we partly agreed with the Government, although not totally, was the use of what are called &quot;sealed envelopes&quot;. They are a way of protecting things that someone would say to their doctor but not to their partner&mdash;for example, something about their health that they would not want a member of their family to know. There is a legitimate way of making such information unavailable on first instance to anybody accessing the summary care record. We stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/28" class="indent">&quot;'Sealed envelopes' are a vital mechanism if sensitive information is to be held on the SCR.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/29">We recommended two things. The first was that:</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/30" class="indent">&quot;The right to break the seal protecting information in &quot;sealed envelopes&quot; should only be held by patients themselves, except where there is a legal requirement to override this measure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.2/31">I shall not second-guess what such a requirement might be, but matters could arise in the criminal courts.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-21a.146.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1738" speakername="Richard Bacon" colnum="146"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080221/halltext/80221h0002.htm#080221126000407">
	<p pid="a.146.1/1">I visited the Norfolk and Norwich university hospital in 2001 when it was scarcely open and saw its digital imaging equipment. They had not even pulled the polythene off the equipment, but they were proud of what it would enable them to do, just as the right hon. Gentleman has described. Will he acknowledge that that technology predates the national programme for IT in the health service, that it has nothing to do with that programme and that the picture archiving communications system was not added to NPFIT until September 2004?</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-21a.146.2" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-21b.146.2" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-21a.146.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" speakername="Kevin Barron" colnum="146"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080221/halltext/80221h0002.htm#080221126000408">
	<p pid="a.146.2/1">Yes, it was added. Any IT system anywhere, whether in the public or private sector, does not just start and evolve on one day when it is decided that this is how it will be; it evolves over many years. Beyond PACS, other things have been added. Choose and book was not massively thought of at the time, but the hon. Gentleman should talk to people who can now visit their GP and come out knowing which hospital they are going to, at what time and on what day, and which clinicians they will be seeing. Just a couple of years ago, they would have been waiting for a fortnight for a letter that would probably have given them a hospital clinician that they did not know about and a time it was impossible for them to make due to work or family commitments. Such things have moved on in leaps and bounds. We have to recognise that millions of people in this country are benefiting from some aspects of what is happening now that were not necessarily laid down and thought about when the programme was set up. At that time, I assume that people were talking about the data spine and different types of patient records, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/2">There has been a call for a review of NPFIT, to which the hon. Member for South Norfolk was probably party, although I do not want to put words into his mouth. The report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Whilst we understand the reasons for this, we do not agree that a comprehensive review is the best way forward. First, many of the questions raised by the supporters of a review would be addressed if Connecting for Health provided the additional information and independent evaluation which we recommend in this report. Secondly, the programme has already been scrutinised by the National Audit Office, the Public Accounts Committee and ourselves. We therefore recommend that...The implementation of DCR systems be addressed in the short term by increasing both the local ownership and the professional leadership of the programme; and...The ongoing review by Lord Darzi on the future of the NHS include in its remit the long-term prospects for using electronic systems to improve the quality of care, particularly for the growing number of patients with long-term conditions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/4">The Government say not only that they accept the recommendation, but that they are</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/5" class="indent">&quot;pleased that the Committee recognises that a comprehensive review of the Programme at this stage is not necessary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/6">One of the biggest critics of this programme, in its totality, was one of the Committee's special advisers, Professor Ross Anderson, who had been campaigning against it for years, yet he advised the Committee in relation to its particular inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/7">I shall move quickly to the secondary uses service. My hon. Friend the Minister knows what I said about sealed envelopes earlier, and I still believe that that is the case. The report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/8" class="indent">&quot;The Department has acknowledged the need to take advantage of the research opportunities offered by&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/9">the secondary uses service</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/10" class="indent">&quot;and has established a partnership with the UK Clinical Research Collaboration to achieve this. We welcome this, but researchers nevertheless told us that much more could be done to maximise these opportunities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/11">We made several recommendations in relation to that. One was that we should</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/12" class="indent">&quot;Mandate the use of the unique patient identifier, the NHS number, in all health service interactions in England&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/13">The Government are committed to dealing with the issue and have accepted some of our recommendations, particularly on the NHS number. They have also accepted our recommendations on developing appropriate linkages between databases, and they have established the research capability programme to investigate the effectiveness of the process, the role of safe havens and third-party brokers, and appropriate governance arrangements, which is all to the general good.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/14">In paragraph 284, we made the following recommendation:</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/15" class="indent">&quot;There is an urgent need to address these problems, especially as the amount and type of data potentially available through the SUS will proliferate rapidly in future. We recommend that the Department of Health conduct a review of both national and local procedures for controlling access to electronic health data for 'secondary' uses.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/16">We then listed the areas that the review should examine&mdash;again, the Government accepted that.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/17">We received a brief for today's debate from the Royal College of Nursing, which talks about secondary uses. People often think that this is something that is likely to interest only researchers and academics, but the RCN states&mdash;I suspect this might be earlier in the patient care record&mdash;that the secondary usage of electronic patient care records</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/18" class="indent">&quot;has the potential to enable the identification of patient outcomes and best practice but also to demonstrate the effects of staffing levels and skill mix which has a direct impact on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/19">That professional body is taking the right approach to the issue. Yes, it says that it wants more nurses, but we all want more nurses in the right places&mdash;although we have had a massive increase in the number of nurses going into the national health service in the past seven years, we can debate whether they have all gone to the right places. Asking how we can use patient information databases, however, is the right approach to take.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/20">The last issue that I want to raise relates to a spin-off. Earlier, we discussed digital imaging. One issue that has come across my radar in the past few months, although we did not look at it in this report, relates to a scheme in New Zealand. As part of that scheme, people who go into hospital are, effectively, barcoded, in the way that babies might be when they are newly born. A strap is put on someone's ankle, and it has on it a barcode that can be scanned. Every time someone is given medication, the barcode will show the right dosage and everything else. There are therefore ways and means of using information technology to prevent the medical errors that we see in hospitals and elsewhere, which are causing deaths in the national health service. The New Zealand Government started looking at the scheme in the middle of last year, and although I do not think that we will be going to New Zealand to look at it&mdash;I say that even though I do not think that there are any reporters from <i>The Independent </i>here&mdash;we will be getting information about it. There are areas, which we have still not thought about, where information technology can help patients and professionals, and that can improve the health of this nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/21">Before I finish, I must say that our inquiry was fascinating, and there was background noise about the issue in the media for a long time. For the first time since I became Chair of the Committee, the report was not unanimous, which was inevitable. Just because the report was not unanimous, however, that does not mean that it is not worth studying, particularly by the Government, so that when we set out on such ventures again, we get things right earlier than we have done in this case.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-21a.158.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="158"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080221/halltext/80221h0004.htm#080221126000419">
	<p pid="a.158.0/1">Had I known that so much time would have been available, I would have prepared a longer speech. Thank heaven for small mercies.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/2">Fundamentally, we all agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> that the national patient record is a good idea because access to patient data by the appropriate practitioner at the appropriate time should improve patient health, in the broader sense, and patient outcomes. However, she made a point about it becoming a party political matter. Given that the UK system is large and complex and a number of legitimate concerns have been raised, it is only right that Members on both sides of the House should query what is going on. Had concerns not been expressed about the system, its implementation and the delays, I am sure that the Health Committee would have found something else to occupy its time. After all, we are never short of subjects to investigate.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/3">Any good functional system needs to be reliable and secure, and it should ensure full interoperability. A number of witnesses were concerned that it was well nigh impossible to ensure all three. One could have two of the three&mdash;one could perm two of the three&mdash;but achieving all three consistently was not possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/4">Given the recent outbreak of scandals concerning the loss of data, I shall base my comments on data use and patient confidentiality. It is worth bearing in mind that one witness was fairly convinced that the system as it stands broke European Union data protection rules. Those are all matters that we should take seriously. Indeed, even the Deputy Information Commissioner has raised some concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/5">My first concern is that some people may wish to opt out of the system. I would encourage them to stay within the system, but people have a right to opt out if they wish. In many cases, however, they do not realise that they are able to do so. I was surprised, as a Hampshire Member, to be told by witnesses that a trial had taken place in Hampshire. It had completely passed most residents by. Dr. Braunold was candid about what had happened. She said,</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/6" class="indent">&quot;I can take you through how we are not happy to do it the way Hampshire did it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/7">We were criticised for not listening. Apparently, in Hampshire a leaflet was included with the free newspapers&mdash;with the junk mail&mdash;and most people threw it away, not realising that it was there. People were opted into the system without knowing whether they had the opportunity to opt in or opt out.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/8">Thankfully, the NHS has learned from those mistakes. Where the system is being rolled out in new areas, positive attempts have been made to ensure awareness by sending addressed letters to individuals; there is a greater chance of them being opened. The information is now being provided in many languages, and those who wish to opt out have the opportunity to discuss the matter with a health professional. I was pleased to see that the vast majority of people were reassured and that relatively few people opted out of the system in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/9">There is a niggling doubt about how confident citizens should be about who is able to gain access to data. The Committee learned that in many situations, often because of the slowness of the existing system, smartcards can be left in the machine all day, which means that anybody is able to gain access to the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/10">Some members of the Committee know that I am a pharmacist by profession, and I know that concerns have been raised about access to data in chemists' shops. Data in pharmacies is usually kept behind the scenes, but little concern seems to have been raised about GP practices. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1789" name="Kevin Barron">The right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron)</phrase> alluded to the problem. For instance, a card could be left in the machine all day long; even the cleaner could gain access to the data, because Dr. Smith had left the card in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/11">The Committee recommended that the sharing of smartcards between users was unacceptable. We also recommended that access times should be improved and that the potential for more sophisticated access systems should be investigated. The Government accepted the first recommendation, claiming that it was work in progress, but they rejected the second.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/12">I believe that some sort of sanction is needed against people who do not use their cards properly. We heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> about the lax procedures if cards are lost. We have learned from other system failures that it is not always the system itself that has failed but the human operators; people do not always understand confidentiality issues and there is little training in that aspect. I recall asking Richard Granger in the early days of his tenure what he would to do ensure that staff were adequately trained in the NHS IT system. His rather brusque reply was that there would not be much need for training because it would be highly intuitive. Time has knocked that one on the head.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/13">The Government rejected the Committee's second recommendation, but their reason is interesting. Their response states:</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/14" class="indent">&quot;The Government accepts the principle of the second of these recommendations. However, NHS Connecting for Health has reviewed alternative technologies to validate staff identity, such as facial, retinal and fingerprint recognition, and concluded that these are not yet sufficiently mature to operate securely in clinical settings. These technologies will be kept under review.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/15">I recommend that the Minister talks to his colleagues at the Home Office, which seems to be content to use those technologies: the Department of Health rightly points out the significant problems in their use.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/16">It is interesting to note that Connecting for Health has rejected some of the technology proposed for ID cards. However, when it comes to care records, the debate on the sharing of information between NHS departments and about who should have access to what still has not been resolved. In an intervention earlier in the debate, I mentioned the French system, in which the patient has the key. Patients have to plug in their card before the data can be accessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/17">Although there are wider concerns about patient-held records, such as what happens if the key is lost, that system gets around the inter-professional arguments and the protectionism about who should have access to what data. If the patient is happy to give a physiotherapist, a chiropractor, a pharmacist or a nurse permission to look at the information, that should be enough; it should override any professional rivalries.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/18">We need to consider also the sensitive information contained in the sealed envelopes. The Committee learned from its inquiry that the suppliers have not yet been issued a spec for local sealed envelopes. The Government response states that the spec was issued on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-03">3 April 2007</phrase>, and that</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/19" class="indent">&quot;A timetable will be set as soon as practicable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/20">I am not sure why that is so. The spec was released in April 2007. The Government responded in November 2007. I am not sure why, some seven months later, a timetable was not available. I hope that the Minister will update us on progress in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/21">The Committee was given a demonstration of the summary care record, which revealed some fairly obvious sealed-envelope concerns. For example, if a gentleman is impotent, he might not want it on the face of his medical records. However, health professionals have decided that it is very important to have a full drug history on the first page of the record, because that information can be crucial in making life-saving decisions. It would be clear to anybody who understands generic names of drugs that a gentleman who is on certain medication is impotent. The concept of sealed envelopes was destroyed at a stroke. A discussion is needed, therefore, about the information that goes into the sealed envelope, who can open it and under what circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/22">Are there other circumstances in which we might unwittingly provide information that a patient might not want to be made quite so readily available? The summary care record is a good example of a system that seems to be added to every time that somebody else gets involved in the process, and it summarises the development of the NHS IT system as a whole. Owing to the lack of initial grass-roots engagement with clinicians, there seems to be no clear idea of what is required and what needs to be delivered through the project as a whole and, in particular, through the summary care record. That variability&mdash;the changing that occurs every time the matter is looked at&mdash;is a constant feature.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/23">The final area of concern is about the wider use of data. Although the right hon. Member for Rother Valley was very supportive of the need to ensure that we optimise use for research, the Committee became aware of significant and wide-ranging concerns raised by several witnesses about whether the data was sufficiently anonymous, whether it could be tracked to a certain level and whether postcodes would be used as identifiers and so on. Happily, the Government have accepted the Committee's recommendations to review local and national procedures and has set up the National Information Governance Board. It would be helpful if the Minister, when he sums up, could update us on the work of the research capability programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/24">It is very important that we get this right. I was sent a press release today, from the NO2ID campaign. Although I accept that it has an agenda, I support much of what it says. It has taken a very close interest in the electronic patient records. The press release, which it put out to coincide with this debate, states:</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/25" class="indent">&quot;The NHS database is not just used for patient care. The so-called Secondary Uses Service (SUS) does not provide a service to patients. It is a vast hidden system that distributes the most personal (and people think private) information to a horde of bureaucrats and other third parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/26" class="indent">&quot;Pseudonymised&quot; patient information - and in some instances, identifiable patient information - is trafficked for purposes including &quot;clinical audit, performance improvement, research, clinical governance, planning, commissioning, public health and benchmarking&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/27" class="indent">Via SUS, a wide range of non-clinical agencies, organisations and even private companies will have massively greater access to personal information on everyone than clinicians. Protection of confidentiality is utterly inadequate and it is unclear how, or even if, individuals can refuse consent for their most private details to be shared among thousands of bureaucrats.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/28">We know that people can opt out, but that press release will probably be quoted time and again as factual when, in fact, its claims are rather exaggerated. However, often little is done to reassure the public when such things enter the public domain. The Government have work to do to reassure people, if that kind of thing regularly gets into the media.</p>
