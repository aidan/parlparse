<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-05a.210.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" speakername="Hugh Bayley" colnum="210"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080205/halltext/80205h0008.htm#08020535000541">
	<p pid="a.210.1/1">I shall be making some pretty blunt criticisms of how the Post Office has consulted the public and stakeholders over its proposals to close four more branches in York. The Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs cannot be here because he has been called to give evidence to a Select Committee, but I believe that he should rein in the Post Office, requiring it to rerun the consultation in York in a meaningful way and adopt a better approach when consulting in other areas. If he does so, it will show that the Government are in charge of the Post Office, but at the moment the Post Office appears to be a law unto itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/2">The Post Office has won approval from the European Commission for a further &pound;1.7 billion of public subsidy to keep branches open. I welcome that. I am glad that the Government supported that. That is a lot of money, and Post Office managers should be accountable to Parliament for how it is spent. The Post Office should be accountable through the Minister, and the Minister needs to set reasonable reporting requirements for the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/3">At the heart of the Government's case that further post offices closures are sadly inevitable, despite the public subsidy, is the claim that they currently serve 4 million fewer customers each week than they did two years ago. I presume that the Post Office has figures for customer usage now and then on which that statement was based. I therefore tabled a parliamentary question in November, shortly before the York closure consultation started, asking the Minister how many customers the Post Office had in York in each of the past five years. My hon. Friend said that he had asked Alan Cook, the managing director of Post Office Ltd, to reply. Despite many reminders to Post Office officials, he still has not done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/4">I do object to a Minister delegating the answering of parliamentary questions about operational matters to the Post Office provided that he ensures that they do what they are told to do and answer a question asked by a Member of Parliament. When the Post Office fails to reply, it appears to me and to the public to be out of control and contemptuous of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/5">The Minister with responsibility for the Post Office may think that he is on a hiding to nothing with post office closures and that closures will always be opposed whatever he does. My advice to him is to require the Post Office, as a matter of routine, to ensure that every consultation document on closure indicates how many fewer transactions in each town, city and rural area covered by the consultation there are compared with the number at the time of the last round of closures.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/6">The public are not stupid. For example, if a post office in York had lost 10 per cent. of its customers over the last three years, it would not be unreasonable for the Post Office to reduce its counter space in York by 10 per cent. However, despite being asked parliamentary questions, and being asked subsequently on many occasions to provide information about the decline of usage&mdash;if, indeed, there has been a decline&mdash;the Post Office has failed to do so. It simply has no basis for closing post office branches in York.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/7">I am sure that the Under-Secretary will have seen my submission to the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Select Committee about the Post Office's closure process, but I would like to go through the recommendations that I made in my submission. I believe that the approach to consultation currently being used by the Post Office, is deeply flawed, and that it is designed simply to enable it to jump the hurdles and to achieve closures without the appropriate public scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/8">I made nine recommendations to the Select Committee. First, local area consultation documents should state what change of usage in post office branches there has been in a particular area, and what change in post office capacity is being proposed. I also recommended that the Minister with responsibility for the Post Office should closely monitor the answers to parliamentary questions that are passed to the Post Office for reply, and that if the Post Office does not provide a reasonable and full answer to the Member, it should be told to provide more detail. It is not good enough simply to say that it is an operational matter and not something that should come before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/9">There were many factual inaccuracies and a lack of local knowledge in the consultation document that covered the York closures and closures elsewhere in north and east Yorkshire. For instance, it stated that there were 71 post office branches in York. I went through that with the Post Office, and it eventually agreed that there are currently 34.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/10">One of the branches scheduled for closure in York, Micklegate, was designated as a receiving branch for two other post office branches&mdash;the Bishopthorpe road and Albemarle road branches&mdash;that had been closed three years ago. That was not mentioned in the document. Post Office officials&mdash;I pay tribute to them for this&mdash;came to a public meeting in York to tell people about the proposals, but they were entirely unaware that a branch that was proposed for closure was designated as a branch that should receive customers from other branches that were closed three years earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/11">It was felt that the customers of one branch that was to be closed, which was almost next door to a small branch of HSBC, could use the bank for services, but officials were unaware that HSBC was about to close that branch. They were unaware of a series of major housing developments in York near other branches that were proposed for closure. No account had been taken of winter flooding. Only last week, we had massive flooding in York, and some of the pedestrian routes that the Post Offices suggested could be used by members of the public to reach other post offices if certain branches were to be closed went through areas that flood in winter. Even when they are not knee-deep in water, they are too boggy and muddy, and too dark and dangerous for people, especially older people, to use.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/12">I propose that Post Office Ltd submit its draft local area consultation documents and closure proposals to local authorities in each of the areas affected before they are published in order to avoid omissions and factual inaccuracies.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/13">I was concerned to find that the branches scheduled for closure in York ran out of the letters provided by the Post Office to inform customers of how to complain. To ensure a reasonable supply of those letters, I had to phone the Post Office. If the Post Office wants a genuine consultation, it needs to tell its customers how to express their views. The fact that it produced a wholly inadequate number of letters informing the public of how do to that is an indication that it was not serious about consulting the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/14">One of my constituents went through the list of local community bodies in York, including residents associations, tenants associations, disability groups and transport groups, that the council routinely consults when it proposes a change in facilities or policies. He checked with as many of those bodies as he could and he found that only two of them had been consulted by the Post Office as key stakeholders. Again, if the Post Office wants to know what is going on and what the impact of any change will be in a community, it has to consult in a proper and serious way.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/15">After reading the consultation document that the Post Office issued, it is not at all clear to me whether the closure plans that the Post Office is proposing will comply with the Government's minimum access requirements for post offices. That should be set out very clearly. The Government require a certain percentage of the population, 95 per cent., to be within, I think, one mile of a post office branch in an urban area or within three miles in a rural area. The Post Office needs to work out what proportion of the public are that close to a post office branch, currently and in the future. If it cannot produce those figures, it cannot be sure that it is complying with the Government's minimum access requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/16">I am sceptical about the excuse that is used by the Post Office, namely that it is unable to release information about post office branch usage because that information is commercial and confidential. The Post Office is not a private, commercial business; it is a public sector body that receives massive taxpayer subsidy and it needs to be accountable to Parliament. Even if there are commercial reasons why the Post Office does not wish to release information about the usage of a single branch, there is absolutely no reason why it cannot issue information about the usage across branches grouped together&mdash;10, 20 or 30 branches&mdash;in a particular town or city.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/17">The only argument that has been made to me about why the Post Office would not release information about the number of customers at a particular branch is that that information might affect the proprietor, the sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress, if they wanted to sell their business. Well, if a man or woman wants to sell his or her business, they would have to release to each and every potential buyer precisely that information, so it would cause no difficulty to the business if that information was in the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/18">I recommend that these Post Office consultation documents should reveal, at the very least, the average number of transactions per branch in each urban area and in each rural area, and also indicate any branch proposed for closure that carries out more than the average number of transactions. The Post Office should also have to meet a higher burden of proof to make the case for closing a branch that is busier than most of the branches in a particular town or city.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/19">One of the branches that is proposed for closure in York has almost 2,000 customers a week and is the fourth busiest post office in York, while another branch proposed for closure is the 13th busiest. However, of two other branches that are being maintained in York&mdash;with, I imagine, a huge public subsidy&mdash;one has just 13 transactions a week, or two customers a day, and the other just 26 transactions a week, or four customers a day. Would it not make more sense to use taxpayers' money to protect a branch with 400 customers a day than one with just two?</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/20">Of course, the reason that some branches with very low numbers of customers are protected is the Government's rural access criteria. The branches in York that I have just mentioned&mdash;the two that will not be closed&mdash;are not, of course, rural branches in the Yorkshire wolds or dales, far away from any market town but branches within about three miles of York city centre. Nevertheless, they are protected under the access criteria. The Government need to consider a de minimis rule that would allow the minimum access criteria for rural areas to be set aside for branches that serve a very low number of customers, say fewer than five customers a day. The point of the access criteria is to protect a service for members of the public in rural areas, but if it is a service that nobody uses, or one that only two people a day use, maintaining it cannot be a good use of public money and the access criteria need to be amended.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/21">I put a final question to the Minister. When the last round of post office closures happened in York, Postwatch made an extremely strong argument against closing one of the six branches that had been proposed for closure, the Bishopthorpe road branch, which was a branch in a secondary shopping centre in York. Postwatch asked the Post Office to think again about that closure. Nevertheless, the Post Office went ahead with it. Had the Post Office kept that busy branch open, there might have been a case for closing the busy branch near to it, Micklegate branch, which was a receiving branch and which is scheduled for closure now. However, the Post Office did not listen to Postwatch at that time and consequently it has got itself into a real mess.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/22">Of course, Postwatch is disappearing. Nevertheless, I believe that the closure criteria for post offices need to provide for a higher burden of proof for the closure of busy post offices. If the Post Office says that the fourth busiest post office in York is not commercially viable while another post office in York with only a two hundredth of the number of customers a day is considered commercially viable, there is something seriously wrong with the way that the Post Office determines commercial viability and it needs to change the criteria that it uses.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/23">I say to my hon. Friend the Minister, who is replying on behalf of the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs, that our hon. Friend's conduct as a Minister will be judged by whether he makes the Post Office deal with the public in an effective and respectful way regarding these closures. I do not believe that the Post Office has done that in York, which is entirely wrong and should change.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/24">I entirely understand that the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs was unable to attend this debate because he had to go to the Select Committee, but I hope that I may be able to take up with him some of my concerns in a face-to-face meeting at a later date.</p>
