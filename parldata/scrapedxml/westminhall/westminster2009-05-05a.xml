<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05a.4.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" speakername="Robert Wilson" colnum="4"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0001.htm#0905051000425">
	<p pid="a.4.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his support for the all-party group, and for his interest in the subject. I know that his constituents in Kettering will be pleased to hear that he has raised the matter of GP training.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/2">I also know that the Minister's heart is in the right place, and that she is anxious for the NHS to help. However, recent parliamentary questions from hon. Members throughout the House have had a less than encouraging response. In June 2008, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> asked what plans the Department of Health had to improve treatment for people with fibromyalgia. The answer came:</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/3" class="indent">&quot;There are no specific plans to improve the treatment for those living with fibromyalgia.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-06-30.655"><i>Official Report</i>, 30 June 2008; Vol. 478, c. 655W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/4">Another hon. Member asked how people were diagnosed in his constituency, the region and nationwide since 1997. The answer was:</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Information on the number of people diagnosed with fibromyalgia is not collected.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-11-21.998"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 November 2007; Vol. 467, c. 998W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/6">Among other things, I asked the Minister what steps were being taken to raise awareness of fibromyalgia, and what progress there was on diagnosis and treatment. The response was:</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/7" class="indent">&quot;We have made no assessment of the progress being made by the national health service into improving the diagnosis and treatment of fibromyalgia. We have taken no recent steps to raise the awareness of fibromyalgia among the general public and health professionals.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-10-09.516"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 October 2007; Vol. 464, c. 516W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/8">I shall not embarrass the Minister by going through all the parliamentary questions and answers on the subject, but there is a discernible pattern. There is clearly no focus on the illness in the Department, and thus no focus on it in the NHS, yet the condition acts as a significant drag on the economy. In 2006, through a parliamentary question, I ascertained that 8,400 people who were claiming incapacity benefit or severe disablement had been given a primary diagnosis of fibromyalgia. We know that that is the tip of an iceberg, as most fibromyalgia sufferers on benefits will have been diagnosed with something else. The economic cost of the failure to diagnose the problem swiftly does not affect only the Department for Work and Pensions; the cost to the NHS and local authorities, too, will be huge. Better awareness and education of health professionals would considerably reduce that financial burden.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/9">Many groups work tirelessly for the sufferers of the condition, and do their best to raise its profile. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to their ongoing work. As chair of the all-party group on fibromyalgia, I work closely with the Fibromyalgia Association UK and FibroAction, but the message regularly comes back that there is a problem in raising the profile of the condition. There is only so much that the third sector can do. Is it not time for the Department to consider a nationwide awareness campaign to highlight fibromyalgia syndrome, and the importance of fast diagnosis and the provision of treatment? Do the millions of people who suffer with the illness not deserve at least that from their NHS?</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/10">Raising the profile of the condition is difficult without the support of the relevant authorities. I draw the House's attention to an application made by FMA UK in July 2007 to the medical advisory board of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The aim of that application was to establish a set of clear guidelines on fibromyalgia. In May 2008, FMA UK had still not received a response, and asked me to intervene. Despite my intervention, still no response was received. Suddenly, and incredibly coincidentally, in the last couple days&mdash;since today's debate was arranged&mdash;FMA UK has finally been contacted by NICE. FMA UK was informed that its application had been unsuccessful.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/11">The fact that FMA UK has received an answer does not excuse the arrogance or incompetence&mdash;or both&mdash;that NICE has shown until now. Frankly, it is insulting and deeply frustrating for those who work tirelessly to raise the profile of the condition to have to wait for a debate such as today's before the relevant authorities take them seriously. A delay of two years is not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/12">Given everything that I have said this morning, it is imperative that a clear medical framework is set out for GPs. It is more than long overdue. NICE's response will be extremely disappointing to FMA UK, as well as to fibromyalgia sufferers throughout the country, and I urge NICE to consider the matter again. Will the Minister give fibromyalgia sufferers some hope this morning by saying that she will personally intervene, asking NICE to ensure a clear set of guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of the illness?</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/13">The many sufferers of fibromyalgia also look to the Department of Health for leadership and support. They were particularly gratified that the chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, recognised the impact of fibromyalgia and its prevalence in the UK as a cause of chronic pain in his annual report of 2008. Sir Liam said:</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Chronic pain reduces the quality of life more than almost any other condition. The impact of pain on people's lives is significant, bringing emotional and financial burdens to patients and loved ones. A major initiative to widen access to pain services is badly needed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/15">Sir Liam has articulated what FM sufferers require&mdash;information, and access to NHS tailored services.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/16">The voluntary organisations know that some good specialist NHS services are provided for fibromyalgia patients. Such services include those provided by the clinic at Guy's hospital. Professor John Davies has had many years' experience in treating sufferers of fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis. Russells Hall hospital in Dudley has been providing a chronic pain service for more than 25 years, but only in the last 12 years has it developed from being a single-person service to the present well-resourced and multi-disciplinary team. There are also good multi-disciplinary teams at the Royal Bolton and Poole hospitals. We have also seen some great local initiatives. For instance, an eight-week course for fibromyalgia patients is being run by south-west Essex community services in conjunction with Basildon University hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/17">I have already said that I have enormous respect for the many hard-working organisations, such as FibroAction and FMA UK; and, of course, one should not forget the work of the PolkaDotGals and their splendid calendar.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/18">Although she is not my constituent, I feel that I ought to mention Lindsey Middlemiss, who I believe is here today. Lindsey is a constituent of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">the Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase>. My hon. Friend is unable to attend the debate, but I know that he takes a keen interest in Lindsey's work and that he supports the work of the all-party group. Not only is Lindsey the chair and founder of FibroAction, but she is involved with the West Berkshire Neurological Alliance that operates in my constituency of Reading, East.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/19">Lindsey developed the illness following a whiplash injury. She deteriorated so rapidly that within nine months she had to give up her career. Her story is similar to that of many other sufferers; despite numerous visits to her GP and several tests, it took her more than two years to secure a diagnosis. Lindsey was lucky enough to obtain private treatment, but many others may not have been so fortunate. One of the common problems for fibromyalgia patients is that the lack of NHS treatment and understanding means that they need private treatment, and their families have built up large debts in their attempt to help.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/20">One of the major obstacles faced by Lindsey was that her GP was not aware of any other treatments or services that could help her. It was down to Lindsey's determination and her family's support that she met Professor Davies at the fibromyalgia clinic at Guy's hospital. With his help, Lindsey's condition proved manageable, but Lindsay would like to know why it took five years and a great deal of money for a healthy young woman to get the health care that she so desperately needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/21">Where do we go from here? In February 2005, Dr. Ernest Choy and Dr. Serena Carville from King's college London produced a nine-point recommendation for the management and treatment of fibromyalgia. It is a credible report and is worth mentioning for that reason. I shall not go into the full details of the plan today, but I would like to highlight some of the most important and thought-provoking points. Choy and Carville concluded that a full understanding of fibromyalgia requires an assessment of pain, function and the psychological impact on patients. They also believe that individually tailored exercise programmes, including aerobic exercise and strength training, can be very beneficial, as well as other therapies, such as relaxation and physiotherapy. Relaxation works very well for almost everyone affected by this condition. It reduces tension in the mind and body and calms the symptoms, especially the pain. Choy and Carville concluded that, ultimately, medical professionals need to be able to listen to, and believe in, an individual's experience of pain. Only then can a programme of treatment be established to reassure them and reduce stress and anxiety.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/22">I ask the Minister to assist fibromyalgia sufferers by helping to deliver the following: first, it is clear that we need to work towards providing greater education for general practitioners. It is unsatisfactory that many GPs are not confident or able to diagnose the illness in a timely fashion. Timely diagnosis is key to helping people with this condition. Secondly, it is not acceptable that NICE has only just acknowledged FMA UK's application to provide a clear and unequivocal set of guidelines for GPs. Those guidelines could be used in the training of the medical profession and could reduce the stressful experience currently associated with diagnosis.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05a.19.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" speakername="Gordon Marsden" colnum="19"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0004.htm#0905051000452">
	<p pid="a.19.2/1">It is a great privilege and pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I am delighted to have the opportunity to open this debate on initiative, skills and economic recovery in Lancashire. I shall draw on my experience as an MP for Blackpool and Lancashire, where, as Members will know, regeneration has been key to everything that we have been trying to do over the past six to eight years to broaden our skills base and opportunities. That regeneration has been not just of buildings but of human capital, which I shall focus on today.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/2">I shall also draw on my experience in recent months as a member of the Select Committee on Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills and as chairman of the all-party group on skills, which works with the National Skills Forum. Several reports are highly relevant to the issues that we shall discuss today. The Select Committee report, &quot;Re-skilling for recovery&quot;, was produced in the aftermath of Lord Leitch's report. It emphasised the role of bottom-up initiatives, which are particularly important to regional and sub-regional skills policy&mdash;Lord Leitch did not deal with that significantly in his final report&mdash;and how small and medium-sized enterprises respond to the Leitch agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/3">The all-party group and the National Skills Forum have produced two reports. The first, &quot;Closing the gender skills gap&quot;, was published in February. It looked specifically at more flexible working, which women need, as well as more child care support and cover, and challenging gender stereotypes. It focused on what sector skills councils could do, particularly in respect of apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/4">The most recent report from the all-party group and the National Skills Forum is &quot;Progression through apprenticeships&quot;, which looked at clearer mapping between diplomas and apprenticeships, easier access for apprentices to higher and further education, recognition of the need to reform funding for the over-19s, and good information, advice and guidance. All those issues are relevant to the situation in Lancashire in terms of skills initiatives and how we combat the downturn.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/5">The north-west has a strong and proud history of industrial development and manufacturing, but at present, skills levels in the region are below the average for England and Wales. That is not surprising, given global economic changes that have seen UK priorities shift away from manufacturing and towards the service and financial sectors. The north-west and Lancashire have made strong strides in those areas, but compared with London and the south-east there is still a gap to be plugged.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/6">Skills levels in Lancashire generally share the greatest similarity with the UK average for the region. Wealthier areas of Lancashire have benefited from the growth of Manchester as the economic hub of the north-west. Shifting populations have been a key factor in the past 20 years, with many people leaving economically challenged areas of the region for other parts of the country such as the south-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/7">The north-west matches the national average for people with low and mid-level skills but has a smaller proportion of those with skills at the highest level. The average in England and Wales is 19 per cent. with skills at level 4 and above, but it drops to 17 and 16 per cent. in areas of Lancashire and the lakes. Therefore we need to do a great deal to encourage those with higher level skills to remain in or to move to the area. That is particularly true for what, for the sake of this debate, I will call second-level towns and cities in Lancashire, although I believe that the phenomenon is country-wide.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.2/8">That view of skills and skills needs was confirmed relatively recently in statistics produced for the Lancashire Economic Partnership in a report on skills in Lancashire that came out in November 2008. It stressed the importance of improving the quality of the education offer, particularly at further and higher education level, of attracting and retaining people with higher level skills in Lancashire, and of upskilling the existing work force. It identified three sub-areas in Lancashire: the Fylde coast, which covers Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre; Pennine Lancashire, which covers Burnley, Blackburn, Rossendale and Pendle; and mid-Lancashire, which covers Lancaster, Preston, Chorley and South Ribble. The key issues for all those areas are changes in the future skills profile&mdash;the skills levels of 300,000 people in the region will probably need to be improved by 2015&mdash;and demographic changes, which mean that the majority of those people will have to be of working age.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.1/1">My hon. Friend chides me for a purpose. I saw her in the Chamber but did not know whether she wished to intervene or speak on the issue. She is absolutely right, of course. Historical problems in Merseyside have had a strong impact on that area, but as she may wish to mention later, there are some encouraging signs in that area of her constituency, not least in the construction industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/2">Big numbers need to move in terms of skills levels, and level 4 is one of them. Lancashire is well placed for that because of its proximity to large higher education institutions in Greater Manchester and Merseyside, but there are other areas such as level 2. By 2015, about a third of the demand will be from hotels, restaurants and distribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/3">It is true that small and medium-sized enterprises dominate the Lancashire economy. That means that all the problems nationally in getting small and medium-sized enterprises to train exist and may be magnified in the Lancashire area. As I have already said, and as the report points out, we need to attract new non-Lancashire graduates but also to encourage Lancashire residents who study outside the region to return when they complete their studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/4">One of the things that we have to ask ourselves in a recession or downturn is what we are training people for. A key task for the Government and business and education institutions during a recession is to refocus learning opportunities around enabling skills, and to give people credit, in both senses of the word, for training that does not necessarily lead directly to employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/5">Research has shown that people are most ready to believe that they can retrain or re-enter employment during the first few months of unemployment, so intervention should be made early during the economic downturn. The recent Government announcements in the Budget in that respect were very welcome. There will be significant consequences for Train to Gain. More flexibility needs to be built into the programme to ensure that many more unemployed people will be able to access training or ongoing education, and&mdash;this is particularly true for Lancashire&mdash;the Government or their agencies, not necessarily employers, will increasingly need to co-ordinate and sponsor ongoing education and training, at least for temporary periods. That will prevent Train to Gain being snatched away from people who are facing redundancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/6">Another report that has just appeared looks at the skills that will be needed for an upturn in the north-west. It draws on experience statistics, which are modestly encouraging for the north-west as compared with other regions. It expects a smaller contraction of the economy in the north-west than elsewhere in the UK, especially London, and a stronger recovery in 2012-13. Some of the reasons for that are resilience in the engineering and the aerospace sectors, which are very important in my part of the world; new opportunities from renewable and low-carbon technologies; and a likely increase in self-employment and micro-enterprise. I can vouch for that in Blackpool, where we have the important Get Started unit as part of the enterprise centre. It is funded from a local enterprise growth initiative and &pound;30 million that was given by the Government to Blackpool. I was told recently that, of the 300 to 400 people who came through its doors who got on to self-employment or micro-enterprises, 80 per cent. are still trading after a year. For anyone who knows the statistics for small businesses and start-ups, that is an encouraging sign.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/7">There are other initiatives in my constituency, including in Bloomfield ward, where Jobcentre Plus has been doing an interesting and positive pilot looking at a small number of people, who are nevertheless important, who have been out of the work force for a long period. It is just as well that we have taken that approach, because there is a structural weakness in, or structural challenge for, second-level cities and towns in dealing with some of the current problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/8">In January, the Centre for Cities highlighted as potential problem areas in the region&mdash;particularly in Lancashire&mdash;Blackpool and Warrington, because of leisure and distribution redundancies, with Blackpool again, and Bolton, in terms of construction. We have to recognise that although we have done fantastic things in the regeneration of our big cities over the past 10 to 12 years, regeneration has not always trickled down to second-level towns and cities; in Lancashire, for example, we are talking about Preston, Burnley and Blackpool.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/9">The phenomenon does not exist just in Lancashire. On the other side of the Pennines, the same thing can be seen when comparing Bradford with Leeds. We cannot assume that city regions, however dynamic they are, will automatically trickle down their activity to such areas. It is even more important to recognise that fact in a recession. That is why public sector jobs, which are continuing to move out of the south-east as part of the Government's strategy, need to go not just to major cities, but also to second-level areas. In Blackpool and the Fylde, for example, we have enormous experience over 50 years of public sector jobs, including in the civil service. At the moment, the town council, with the ReBlackpool scheme, is redeveloping the Talbot and Brunswick gateway, which we hope may be a recipient of the net outflow of jobs from the south-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/10">I have mentioned already the concentration of aerospace industry in Lancashire and the importance of employment in that sector. That employment is holding up, but it is all the more important to support the supply chain and smaller companies, because the ratio of direct to indirect jobs that are dependent on the sector is anything between 1:3 and 1:5. The executive director of the Northwest Aerospace Alliance, Martin Wright, said at the beginning of April that improvements are needed to the credit available to the 1,500 small firms making up the supply chain in the region if we are to maintain the support of companies such as BAE Systems, which is involved in a major way in fighter jet-building programmes; not just the Eurofighter&mdash;the Typhoon&mdash;but the Americans' F-35 jet-building programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/11">The report also highlighted the importance of educational infrastructure in raising skills levels, especially given the rising demands of employers. Importantly, it also highlighted issues to do with retirement and replacement. Industries in the north-west&mdash;in Lancashire in particular, the engineering, chemical and nuclear industries&mdash;all have significantly ageing work forces, so it is important to look not just at how to bring new young people in, but at how to retrain and reskill older workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/12">The report also identified the need to underpin skills in the so-called STEM subjects&mdash;science, technology, engineering and mathematics&mdash;and in respect of innovation. I was encouraged to see that my hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, on his recent tour of the north-west, visited a number of areas and looked at clean technologies, high value-added manufacturing and emerging technologies and, in particular, the apprenticeship centre at the Springfields nuclear fuel plant, which is one of the leading apprentice training centres in the UK. Close to 2,000 people are employed at Springfields, including a large number of my constituents. With the change and development in the economy towards nuclear power, that is a key area for development. I praise the nuclear academy at Springfields, in particular, and the sector skills council Cogent for taking those things forward and developing them. That is a bright side to what is going on.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/13">Companies looking for new staff in a recession will be overwhelmed with quality applications from people with experience and the knowledge and qualifications to match it. Recent graduates and those in entry-level jobs will thus find it more difficult than ever to push forward with their careers and may decide to stay put on a lower salary until the recovery starts. The downturn offers new opportunities not just for Government, but for businesses to consider ways in which young people may want to do some volunteering and offer them time for community courses and other activities. Those are not just things worth doing for the sake of society; they build up practical skills and experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/14">The downturn must not be an excuse for pushing young people out of the classroom and into the job market. Education and training continue to offer a strong route to success for young people and should not be seen as expendable. Promises or suggestions about slashing public spending as a knee-jerk reaction to a long-term problem&mdash;such as those made on occasions by the official Opposition&mdash;are not the answer. Now is the time to invest in young people entering the job market. We must not cut them adrift.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/15">I was pleased with several announcements in the Budget that will benefit us in Lancashire. The extra support to help people find work quickly, providing a guarantee of a job or training, is needed. The &pound;120 million for work-focused re-employment training will provide unemployed 18 to 24-year-old youngsters with real help for 12 months to find work and get into work in sectors with strong future local demand. The funding for traineeships in the care sector and the spreading of business rates over three years are both important initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/16">In April, the Government announced the results of the economic challenge investment fund, which was set up with the Higher Education Funding Council, for universities to bid for money to set up schemes to help individuals in business through the downturn. The total value of the 77 bids accepted by HEFC, a number of which come from Lancashire and the north-west, is important, because it is in addition to the &pound;148 million that HEFC is providing over three years to support universities and colleges to respond to employer demand for courses and training, and to raise work force skills to higher levels. The north-west is well placed to benefit from such initiatives. The regional focus of higher education in the north-west, as I shall mention shortly, is much stronger than in some other regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/17">I want to say a few words about the importance of apprenticeships in skills development and in tackling the downturn. I have already mentioned the changes in demography, which have been well advertised by the head of the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, Chris Humphries, and several others. We know that demography will ensure that the profile of apprenticeships will have to change significantly from 2010, which means that we will need more flexibility in delivery. Sadly, as things stand, some of the apprentices who have been tempted into SME work under Train to Gain are now finding themselves in difficulty because of the downturn and they will need to benefit from being picked up and sheltered via universities and the further education sector, as is happening already in one or two universities in the north-west and in Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/18">Skills and apprenticeships were at the heart of the policies needed before the recession and that remains even truer now. Regeneration is about reskilling people as well as being about buildings and structures. What does that mean in practical terms? Apprenticeships need to prioritise a solid skills base for service and manufacturing in Lancashire, specifically in areas of growth, such as construction and green-collar jobs, but we must also ensure that teachers and employers regard apprenticeships as viable alternatives to A-levels and for higher education entry.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/19">The signs so far are that the Government's strong, consistent investment in apprenticeships is beginning to pay off. We can certainly say that that is so in Lancashire. There is a higher number of apprenticeship starts in Lancashire than in most areas. Work-based learning grew by 30 to 35 per cent. between 2005-06 and 2006-07 &mdash;significant and important figures. We have to consider in this mix whether a greater combination of on-work and apprenticeship activity and possibly a more modular approach in some cases will increase completion rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/20">Further education college leavers are achieving their aims at a wide level under Train to Gain in Lancashire and the north-west, but I want a much more energetic and proactive examination of some of the missing or neglected areas. The National Skills Forum's recent report on women and skills suggested that the Government should ask the National Apprenticeship Service to explore ways of increasing the number of part-time apprenticeships, which would benefit women who want to take apprenticeships but are unable to commit themselves to full-time work.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/21">The expansion of manufacturing apprenticeships and the Government's new manufacturing strategy provide the opportunity to develop green-collar jobs throughout the UK, and specifically in Lancashire. Expanding apprenticeships in a low-carbon economy is a vital first step in ensuring that we are prepared to take advantage of the upturn. Lancashire can benefit from investment in green jobs during the downturn, particularly in manufacturing and wind farm projects, a number of which are posited for Lancashire and the north-west, and will create jobs for sheet metal workers, machinists and truck drivers. Increasing the energy efficiency of buildings will require roofers, insulation installers and electricians. The issue is also about reskilling people with green credentials, as Chris Humphries of the Commission for Employment and Skills highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/22">Many of the issues that I have talked about, such as older workers, soft skills and graduate output and retention in the region, can be met via further education. I shall refer to SQW Consulting's recent report to the Northwest Regional Development Agency on the impact of further education in the north-west. It emphasises that apprenticeship starts are consistently higher than in any other region, and that the proportion of 16 to 18-year-olds at sixth form and further education colleges is much higher than elsewhere, but that 37 per cent. of businesses still believe that their existing work force has skills gaps, which emphasises the need to upskill and retrain the existing work force, particularly women. Leadership and management skills are still lower than elsewhere, despite good Train to Gain figures in Lancashire and the north-west. The north-west has the highest number at 4,900 in 2007-08, while the figure for Blackpool in the same year went up from 400 to 900.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/23">The report also emphasises the point that further education colleges are key to the economy of the north-west and Lancashire. In the north-west, they employ the equivalent of 24,000 staff, their input to the north-west's economy is estimated at &pound;1,450 million, and they bring in learners who contribute &pound;277 million per annum to the region's economic activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/24">The report identifies expanding delivery of higher education into further education and improving progression from further education to higher education as key to success. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/25" class="indent">&quot;Much of the growth in level 4 will come from people already in employment and often supported through an employer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/26">That means that we must think dynamically about Train to Gain mechanisms and new initiatives such as the skills accounts, as the Select Committee said. I am pleased that the Under-Secretary and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1408" name="David Evennett">the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett)</phrase>, the shadow spokesman on education, were at the useful meeting of the all-party National Skills Forum when we discussed some of the suggestions from City and Guilds.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/27">Higher education portability is key to delivery. We must build on the recommendations in the Burgess report, and we must do so faster and more smartly. The Higher Education Funding Council made a useful contribution via the lifelong learning networks, but it must boost its regional presence in the north-west. I have recently returned from a visit with the Select Committee to the Washington region to study the role of community colleges, skills outreach, and development in higher education, and clearly we can do much in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/28">The north-west is well placed. We have an active North West Universities Association under a vigorous executive director, Keith Burnley. We do not have the same divide or educational apartheid between Russell group and non-Russell group universities. In my neck of the woods we have two leading vice-chancellor contributors to the debate in Paul Wellings at Lancaster university and Malcolm McVicar, both of whom have made their mark in intellectual capital and public sector training. My college, Blackpool and The Fylde, is an associate college of Lancaster university and has made a major contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/29">If we are to ensure a critical mass of higher education delivery where little existed previously, it is important that the investment already going into Lancashire, including Blackpool and The Fylde's higher education centre and the higher education hubs in Blackburn and Burnley, is sustained. It is also important that we use the experience of those with proven success in the area, such as the Open university. We should also recognise the role of union learning reps&mdash;union learning has been very successful in the north-west in getting older workers to reskill and to upskill&mdash;especially if we give them new roles in the environmental agenda, build on new rights to request training, and pass on some of that expertise to SME groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/30">FE colleges are strongly engaged with initiatives to get workless and unemployed people back to work, and I make no apology for citing my local FE college, Blackpool and The Fylde college, as an excellent example of carrying forward those initiatives to support the workless and unemployed back into work. I am sure that the Minister would not forgive me if I did not take this opportunity to say that work underlines the importance of the college's bid for a site in central Blackpool under the new capital funding programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/31">The initiatives to get the workless and unemployed back into work include the creation of the Fylde coast partnership; &pound;450,000 of funding from the Lancashire economic partnership to address employability and getting people back into work; &pound;1.2 million of Train to Gain money, which was spent on helping people to gain level 2 or Skills for Life qualifications; and national vocational qualifications in the work force, on which &pound;468,000 was spent in 2008-09. In the past 12 months, Blackpool and The Fylde college put 900 people through Skills for Life and employability skills programmes, and under the Government's local enterprise and growth initiative programme, the successful build-up initiative matches the skills of redundant or unemployed construction workers with public sector projects in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/32">The colleges responded to the need for bespoke provision for programmes that do not attract Government funding, and have put a lot of effort into creating multi-agency partnerships. A good example is their work with Global Renewables at ICI's former Hillhouse works where, in partnership with Wyre council, Jobcentre Plus and other agencies, they are helping to recruit and train 180 new, locally sourced staff to operate a new, state-of-the-art treatment plant.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/33">In all those areas there is a strong fit and connection between the activities of the Departments for Innovation, Universities and Skills, and for Work and Pensions. I draw the Minister's attention to an issue that Blackpool and The Fylde college has flagged up. There is not yet full integration between programmes provided by Jobcentre Plus and those available to the unwaged through the Learning and Skills Council's adult responsiveness funding. The rules on jobseeker's allowance favour people on programmes that last 13 weeks, which do not usually lead to a qualification. In contrast, FE provision usually leads to a qualification, is not time limited, and is free to the unemployed. However, during a recession, when fast re-entry to the labour market may be difficult, an attractive choice for any individual would be to embark on a programme of training to levels 2, 3 and 4, but that would take longer than 13 weeks and would be impossible because they would be called in by Jobcentre Plus and compelled to attend a 13-week programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/34">The head of my college, Pauline Waterhouse, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/35" class="indent">&quot;The economy in Lancashire requires many more Level 3 and 4 qualified people. Some interdepartmental coordination and the loosening of some long standing restrictions would provide a unique opportunity to respond to the recession and to meet the skills needs of Lancashire.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/36">Therein lies an important lesson, not just for Lancashire but for areas throughout the country. There needs to be&mdash;I know that this is developing&mdash;strong co-ordination between the DWP and DIUS in the way in which they tackle the economic downturn, as we stressed in our Select Committee report. The DWP may need to operate far more on a sub-regional basis, particularly if it is to address the agenda of worklessness hotspots effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/37">The same message of co-operation has to be carried through for the resilience of regional and sub-regional economies, such as Lancashire. It is about practical politics, as I said on Second Reading of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, whose remaining stages we shall consider later today. However, it is also about applying smart research, human capital and aspirations. Those pragmatic qualities have stood us in good stead in previous downturns in the north-west and in Lancashire, despite the rather negative reaction of the Government whose access to power 30 years ago we celebrate, if that is the word, today. We have those pragmatic qualities in abundance in the north-west, across Lancashire and, of course, in Blackpool.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/38">This debate is about the focused support of Government and the energetic activity of local regeneration agencies such as our own, ReBlackpool, under its executive, Doug Garrett, co-operating with the council and the Northwest Development Agency. I pay tribute to the agency. Whatever people's views about the role of regional development agencies, it is widely recognised as having been one of the most focused and effective agencies in respect of regeneration and skills creation under Steve Broomhead, its chief executive. Given what I have described, I believe that the blue-sky and, if I can use the expression, green-sky thinking that can come out of this period can deliver positive prospects in Lancashire, even in times as challenging as these.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05a.28.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" speakername="Stephen Williams" colnum="28"  time="011:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0005.htm#0905051000456">
	<p pid="a.28.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase> on securing the debate and speaking with great knowledge about both his constituency and the wider region. This is the fourth anniversary of the 2005 general election. He mentioned the 30th anniversary&mdash;not such a happy anniversary&mdash;of the 1979 general election. For me, today is a happy anniversary&mdash;the fourth anniversary of my gaining Bristol, West for the Liberal Democrats. In 2005, my first party conference as a Member of Parliament&mdash;as an MP, one's experience as a conference goer changes completely from what it was before&mdash;was in Blackpool, and I greatly enjoyed my four or five days in the hon. Gentleman's constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/2">The hon. Gentleman talked about the structural change that has taken place in the regional economy. He is a historian, so he will know of the great contribution that Lancashire and the north-west made to this country's becoming the world's first industrial nation. However, there has been a structural change in the industries and services from which people derive their employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/3">The hon. Gentleman hinted at the fact that the role of economic powerhouse has perhaps also undergone a geographical shift, moving from the county of Lancashire and to the Greater Manchester city region. We have seen the development of the knowledge economy in the city of Manchester, with the merger of the Victoria university of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. The forthcoming BBC media village at Salford will also contribute to the growth of that new economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/4">Half the region's value added comes from Greater Manchester, but the hon. Gentleman rightly focused on the economic needs of what he called the second-tier towns in other parts of Lancashire. I hope that that would include the area represented by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" name="Rosie Cooper">the hon. Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper)</phrase>, although I do not want to intrude on the regional rivalry between Lancastrian Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/5">Like all other regions around the country, Lancashire is being challenged by the recession, and the hon. Gentleman mentioned some of the skills that will be needed to ensure that his region emerges stronger from that recession. In particular, he mentioned the skills needs of the aerospace industry, and I empathise with what he said because the south-west, which I represent, is also a world centre for that industry, and its skills needs are very similar. In particular, there is a worrying shortage of people going into engineering at the technical and graduate levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/6">The hon. Gentleman mentioned several of the things that play an important role in ensuring that more people go into engineering, such as information, advice and guidance. The issue may well come up again this afternoon, when we debate the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill on Report, and the Minister will know that it was a hot topic in the Committee that considered the Bill. It is important that young people are encouraged to go into STEM subjects&mdash;science, technology, engineering and maths&mdash;at school and to pursue them at college and university. If they do not, the country will not have the technical and graduate engineers that it needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/7">Good information, advice and guidance should also encourage more young people to go into apprenticeships. Far too often, the advice given to young people is skewed towards the vested interests of the setting in which they receive their education, such as their school, and it does not necessarily encourage them to look at other opportunities, such as taking up an apprenticeship and forming a relationship, probably, with a further education college.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/8">The hon. Gentleman mentioned gender gaps in skills, and that is particularly relevant to engineering, because fewer than 5 per cent. of those who take up engineering apprenticeships are women. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the report on the gender skills gap by the all-party group on skills, and I was pleased to make a contribution to that report.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/9">Engineering skills are not only needed by the aerospace industry, but are essential if we are to meet our 2020 targets for green energy. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the nuclear academy in his area, but my party does not feel that nuclear is part of making Britain carbon-neutral later in this century. We need to develop green technologies, and the hon. Gentleman mentioned green-collar jobs, to use a phrase that we have taken from the other side of the Atlantic in the past few months. However, we will not be able to build wind farms and harness the wind, wave and tidal power of the west coast, which the hon. Gentleman represents, unless we have the skilled engineers to build and service the dynamos and, indeed, the more highly skilled engineers to design them in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/10">There are, of course, many national pressures on the north-west, and we are having this debate in the context of a terrible downturn in the economy. The hon. Gentleman referred several times to young people's skills needs, and I for one would be fearful of entering the current labour market on graduation or on leaving school. So far, however, the Government's response has been inadequate. The youth guarantee in the Budget offers currently unspecified training opportunities for young people, but only if they have already been unemployed for 12 months&mdash;it is obviously a relief that the measure can come into force only after the next election.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.0/11">The Government's main fiscal response to the recession is &pound;12 billion of borrowed money to fund a cut in VAT, but the Liberal Democrats believe that that money would be much better used for localised capital projects. The region's capital needs were mentioned by both the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Lady, who also talked about the construction industry and the construction academy in her constituency. Local rail schemes in my region and, I dare say, in the north-west would benefit if we used that borrowed money for capital expenditure now rather than frittering it away on small price increases.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his speech, which was typically considered, thoughtful and erudite. He has great knowledge and experience in the matter, and speaks with real authority. The general tone of the debate has been thoughtful, considered and constructive. It avoided the yah-booism to which we sometime sink. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1408" name="David Evennett">The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Evennett)</phrase>, when speaking from the Front Bench, may be obliged to indulge in a little more of that, but he too made some interesting points; if I have time, I shall deal with them later.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/3">It seems obligatory at this point to make a remark about the Thatcher anniversary. I say merely that it could hardly be a more timely reminder.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/4">I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South shares the Government's view that skills initiatives can and must play a central role in helping to bring Britain safely through the global economic downturn, creating new jobs for the future. He has said as much in the House on many occasions, and also as a member of the Select Committee on Innovation, Universities and Skills. The Government have pledged to do everything in their power to bring Britain out of the recession as soon and as strongly as possible. In responding to the debate, I want to mention some of the ways in which we are delivering on that pledge, both nationally and in Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/5">The key principles of the Government's approach are clear and, I believe, uncontroversial. First, we must encourage firms to carry on investing in the skills of their work force even though they may be under considerable and even increasing pressure. We should also continue to persuade the one third of businesses that do not train their staff to begin doing so. In its open letter of last winter, the UK Commission for Employment and Skills pointed out that companies that do not train their staff are two and a half times more likely to fail than those that do. That fact has, if anything, become still more pertinent in the months since the letter was published.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/6">I know that this territory is just as familiar to my hon. Friend as it is to me, if not more so, and that he recognises, as I do, the combined impact of initiatives such as the skills pledge, the streamlining and flexing of the Train to Gain service to employers, and the rising numbers of public and private sector employers taking on apprentices. There is an obvious link, with skills helping people to find and keep jobs and helping businesses to succeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/7">The figures tell their own story. In less than two years, 14,460 employers have signed the skills pledge, covering more than 6 million workers. Since the launch in April 2006, more than 127,000 employers have engaged with Train to Gain, with the aim of improving the skills of their work force. The latest evaluations tell us that employers are satisfied, and that Train to Gain is having a beneficial impact on their business and their staff productivity. The number of apprentices has grown, from 65,000 12 years ago to about 250,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/8">These are all things that have been discussed many times before in the House and in Select Committee, but we should make no apology for that. Even in really tough economic circumstances, the initiatives are making a tangible change in the country's attitude to skills and the employers' role.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/9">The second key principle is that we should respond vigorously to the fact that, when redundancies loom, the better a person's skills, the more likely they are to keep their job or get another. Train to Gain has supported more than 971,000 people in beginning to learn. More than 461,000 learners have achieved a qualification; more than 359,500 learners have achieved a full level 2 qualification; and more than 32,000 learners have full level 3 achievements. As many as 89 per cent. of new learners said that their training gave them skills that would help them with current and future jobs; 34 per cent. of learners completing a Train to Gain course reported getting a promotion; and 45 per cent. of new learners reported receiving a pay rise. That is good news for people who are in work, but we are also providing special support for those thousands of workers who have been made redundant or who are at risk of redundancy&mdash;those mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper) and for Blackpool, South.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/10">The new adult advancement and careers service, announced last year, will bring together advice on employment and on the skills needed to get into work or to get on in work. In addition, a new package of support, worth &pound;108 million, is now available to those who are under notice of redundancy or who have become unemployed. It will help 40,000 people over two years to improve their employability skills, with personalised support lasting between two and eight weeks; it will help people to increase their skills and to re-enter the job market. We are making &pound;83 million available for 75,000 new work-focused training opportunities for those reaching six months of unemployment, to help them significantly increase their skills so that they can enter work. The training will be relevant to the local jobs market and will allow people to progress. Individuals will be able to continue training through Train to Gain with their new employer once they get back into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/11">The third feature of our approach is to recognise that the recession will not last for ever and that what we do now will help to determine how well we emerge from it. We must ensure that we have the skills required to seize the opportunities of a new global economy. As my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South has said on many occasions, the Government have a vital role to play in enabling us to do that. Through public policies on taxation, regulation and expenditure, infrastructure, procurement and innovation, we can set the agenda. In short, we must help to ensure that we meet current and future skills needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/12">We are ensuring that we have the analytical and practical means to collect, process and deploy intelligence quickly and effectively, so that we can develop the skills that we need in order to succeed. We know broadly where the UK's future strengths need to lie: in, as hon. Members have said, high value-added, knowledge-intensive areas where the combination of a skilled work force, innovative companies and a research base that is excellent by international standards have maximum effect. I am talking about low-carbon, green technologies and high value-added manufacturing and engineering.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/13">My hon. Friend also reminded us that there must also be a strong local and regional dimension to the Government's efforts, and he is right to note that that dimension will not be helped by the official Opposition's policy of scrapping regional development agencies. The precise needs of one region differ from another. In my own region&mdash;the west midlands&mdash;we depend heavily on manufacturing industries, which have been especially badly hit by the global downturn. Manufacturing also provides many of the jobs in the north west, where firms are under the same sorts of pressures. At the last count, more than 250,000 people were unemployed in that region&mdash;almost 8 per cent. of the working-age population. The same is true at county level. Since <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-01">1 August</phrase> last year, the Lancashire office of the Learning and Skills Council has been made aware of 82 companies making staff redundant. The majority of the companies involved employed at least 20 people. I know that my hon. Friend understands the part that the learning and skills system plays in responding to such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/14">Redundancy response groups have been set up in some parts of Lancashire, such as Blackburn, Chorley and South Ribble, with a further group planned for Preston. I sympathise with the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire that her constituency not be left out, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South had no intention of slighting her constituency or sub-region. I often feel that my own constituency, as an outer-city constituency, is squeezed between, on the one hand, the particular needs and glamorous clamour of the city centre and, on the other, the rich, suburban neighbourhoods. I know how sensitive those issues can be, but I assure her that the Government have no sense that West Lancashire, just because it might sometimes be squeezed by Liverpool, Manchester and Preston, is anything other than of equal importance. However, I would be happy to write to her about that in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/15">As well as those redundancy response groups, ad hoc groups have been formed to address the needs of particular companies and their employees. Their members include the LSC, Jobcentre Plus, the Northwest Regional Development Agency, local authorities, training providers, enterprise agencies and further education colleges. For example, at the request of the employer, a group has been put in place to address the ongoing redundancies at Leyland Trucks. My hon. Friend the Member for West Lancashire mentioned the car industry, to which I, as a Member with a constituency interest in that industry, am very sympathetic. Flexible and responsive work is being undertaken in Lancashire, and across the country, to respond to the particular needs of industries such as automotive manufacturing, and the group put in place to help with Leyland Trucks has been able to identify and address some of the needs of the more than 400 people who have lost their jobs already and the 70 currently under statutory notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.2/16">Further education providers have been keen to support staff at the plant. Notable among these is Preston college, which is delivering courses in performing manufacturing operations, handling materials and elements of business improvement techniques on site. Increasingly, first-class providers will deliver flexible courses at the time needed in the place needed. The old model where a person turns up to college at 10 minutes to 9 on a Monday morning is increasingly the old model.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05a.41.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" speakername="Gary Streeter" colnum="41"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0007.htm#0905051000467">
	<p pid="a.41.2/1">It is a pleasure to sit under your wise counsel, Mr. Wilshire, and I am delighted that my colleagues, the hon. Members for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) and for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy) are able to attend the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/2">In July 2007, the Government announced the outcome of their naval base review. It stated that the three bases, Devonport, Faslane and Portsmouth, are to remain open but that each would be optimised to achieve savings for the Ministry of Defence, which is a perfectly laudable objective. More than 22 months have elapsed, but we are still waiting to find out what the announcement means for Devonport.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/3">Why does it matter? That the ships that defeated the Spanish armada in 1588 sailed from the mouth of the Plym and that Devonport has been providing support services to the Royal Navy since 1691 are important, but it is not only about history or heritage, although Plymouth is the size it is because of the dockyard and the naval base. It matters because Her Majesty's naval base at Devonport is a huge local employer&mdash;it employs about 2,500 people directly&mdash;and because one in 10 of all jobs in the city travel-to-work area have been created directly or indirectly through the dockyard and naval base. It also matters because the dockyard and naval base support 24,000 jobs and contribute &pound;850 million to the local economy, according to the university of Plymouth's business school, and especially because millions of pounds a year flow through the local economy because of the salaries and spending of the 5,000 men and women who serve on the frigates and submarines that are base-ported at Devonport, a significant proportion of whom&mdash;perhaps 40 per cent.&mdash;live locally with their families, spend locally and contribute to the local economy in many ways. For all those reasons, a severe pruning of our naval base or the shifting of the frigates to Portsmouth or the submarines to Faslane would devastate the local economy. It really matters to our city.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/4">Since July 2007, there have been many meetings between the Minister and his colleagues, local Members of Parliament, business and community leaders, trade unions and others. At all times, the Minister has treated us courteously and listened to our concerns with respect. On many occasions, he and other Ministers have said that the future of Devonport is secure, but I am afraid that that is an entirely meaningless statement. First, perhaps deliberately, it fails to distinguish between the dockyards and the naval base. I recognise that there is a promising work load for the dockyard in the next five to seven years, especially once the displaced aircraft carrier work begins, but that is not what we are talking about: we are talking about the naval base. Secondly, the expression, &quot;Devonport has a secure future&quot; says nothing about the scale of that future. What future does it have if the frigates and nuclear submarines go? How many people will it employ? We have been told that it will be the home of our amphibious fleet, but that is very small compared with the activity generated by frigates and submarines.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/5">We can no longer accept generalities from the Minister; we need specifics. I recognise that since the naval base review announcement, the whole of the defence procurement industry has been transformed. That is often given as the reason for the delay, which I understand. However, there have been 22 months of delay. Why do this Government find it so hard to take tough decisions?</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/6">Why have I chosen to introduce this debate today rather than at another time in the past two years? In the past few weeks, we have been beset by leaks, speculation and rumours and it is impossible for the city to continue under the current level of uncertainty. Even this morning in the <i>Plymouth Herald</i>, Tim Jones, the chairman of Devon and Cornwall Business Council, made it clear that investors are delaying their investment decisions until the future of the naval base is sorted out. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/7" class="indent">&quot;We are talking about millions of pounds.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-15">15 April 2009</phrase>, the BBC ran a story claiming that senior MOD sources had told it that the frigates were going to Portsmouth. A Portsmouth MP appeared on television celebrating a great success, but the MOD said simply that no decisions had been taken. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-27">27 April 2009</phrase>, Channel 4 ran a story based on reports prepared for Faslane that were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and stated that Devonport will cease to be a submarine base after 2015. That fits in with the Minister's well-received words that even if vessels are to leave us, they will not do so for five years. The MOD said that the Channel 4 story was only speculation, but that was hardly a robust denial.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/9">That brings me to an important question: when the Minister says that no decisions have been taken, does he mean that they have not been taken by Ministers, but that the Navy Board has taken them and that they have not yet been signed off, doubtless because of political sensitivities, or does he mean that the Navy retains an open mind on all such issues? If the latter is true, why is it taking so long? Having been a Minister&mdash;a thousand years ago, at least&mdash;and having some knowledge of how these things work, I put it to the Minister that the decisions that the frigates will go to Portsmouth and the submarines will go to Faslane have already been taken, and that, understandably, he is trying to find a way to break this devastating news to the local population without causing political mayhem.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/10">Rear-Admiral Mike Wood, who retired in 2003, stated recently that he suspected that MOD Ministers were holding back on revealing the real future of Devonport because the Government did not want bad news to emerge close to a general election. Can the Minister see the damage that this level of uncertainty is causing us? If the decisions have been taken&mdash;I hope they have not&mdash;it is far better for us to know the truth so that the city can plan its recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/11">I should like to mention two other things at this stage. It is not the slightest bit good for the MOD to think that taking the frigates and submarines away would be compensated, as some media reports would have it, by the contract to decommission the nuclear reactors of the submarine fleet in Devonport. That would be a highly controversial decision. It would once again confuse the naval base and the dockyard and it would require a major dialogue with city leaders and a massive public consultation exercise before it could be agreed. Will the Minister say something about the fact that it would also require substantial compensation?</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/12">It also seems to be in Ministers' minds that if our naval base shrinks significantly, the city would gain in the medium term by the release of MOD property for commercial purposes. I must tell the Minister that without substantial Government investment, any such real estate is of limited value, not least because of contamination and location. It should not be seen as any form of compensation unless it comes with significant capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/13">What do we want? We in Plymouth are very reasonable people. We want the frigates to remain at Devonport and we believe that we made a compelling case for that in the naval base review. We also want the submarines to stay. Is it really wise, when there is a Scottish National party Executive who want to break away from the United Kingdom, to base our entire nuclear fleet, including our nuclear deterrent, in Scotland? If Scotland became an independent country, which I very much hope it never does, where would our submarines go?</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/14">We accept that the MOD must make savings, but not that that must happen by ripping the heart out of Devonport. We want the frigates and submarines to stay but, above all, we want to call a halt to the endless foot-dragging and uncertainty. We know that the Minister is arranging a trip to Plymouth tomorrow, but let me warn him, in the right spirit, that simply saying that no decisions have yet been made will go down like a lead balloon. It would be better for him to reduce his carbon footprint and stay in London than to travel to the south-west to tell us that there is no news.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/15">I e-mailed the Minister's office nine questions on Friday lunchtime, and I am keen to give him plenty of time to answer them today. First, will he confirm that no hidden MOD document exists suggesting that Devonport naval base will close in 2015 or at any other time? I hope that that will be an easy one to deal with. Secondly, when will the Government be able to tell us the practical, on-the-ground implications of the naval base review? What will be the job losses, savings and changes? It has been 22 months. Thirdly, which decisions in the process fall to the Navy Board and which to Ministers? When the Minister says that no decisions have been made, does that include Navy Board decisions on base porting?</p>
	<p pid="a.41.2/16">Fourthly, has a decision been taken at any level in the MOD or the Royal Navy to transfer the frigates to Portsmouth? Fifthly, has a decision been taken at any level in the MOD or the Royal Navy to transfer the submarines to Faslane? Sixthly, if we are to lose either the frigates or the submarines base ported in Plymouth, will the Minister spell out precisely what we are to get in return? What will be the long-term operational activity in the naval base?</p>

	<p pid="a.47.0/1">The Minister has indicated that the time scale might be moving. He said he hoped that the deal with Babcock would be in place by the end of the year and that he might be able to give more information on base porting before then. However, on a visit to Plymouth in early March, the Secretary of State for Defence&mdash;the Minister's lord and master&mdash;said that the decision on the future of the naval base would be made within weeks. The <i>Plymouth</i><i> Herald</i> stated at that time:</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/2" class="indent">&quot;On a visit to Devonport yesterday, John Hutton said a decision would be made 'very soon'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.47.0/3">The Minister's comments today seem to push that decision further away than the Secretary of State's recent comments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05a.48.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" speakername="Brian Iddon" colnum="48"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0008.htm#0905051000483">
	<p pid="a.48.3/1">I shall call it a steroid, Mr. Wilshire, which is a class C drug in this country, believe it or not. Another such ingredient, which I can pronounce, is melatonin, which is categorised as a medicine here.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/2">Another aspect of the problem is that some products are marketed with illegal claims, including medicinal claims. The use of unsubstantiated medicinal claims is especially worrying because it targets vulnerable people. The illegal medicinal claims include claims relating to cancer, cardiovascular disease, dementia and diabetes. It has been claimed that probiotics</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/3" class="indent">&quot;significantly decrease a risk of cancer&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/4">or that the product Chelogarde</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/5" class="indent">&quot;reduces heart disease by up to 50%&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/6">Such medicinal claims are extremely dangerous, as they can discourage people from seeking proper medical advice, and so put their health at serious risk. In the UK, we have strict regulation to prevent that, and no medicinal claims may be made for products that do not hold a marketing authorisation under the Medicines Act 1968. The European Union has recently introduced a raft of directives and regulations, which apply to foods in general, that are designed to protect consumers. They include the food supplements directive and the regulation on the use of nutrition and health claims for foods, the short title of which&mdash;the nutrition and health claims regulation&mdash;is more widely used.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/7">The Government are also in the process of implementing the traditional herbal medicinal products directive, which is intended to further protect consumers. The UK has implemented, or is in the process of implementing, all that legislation, with which responsible UK operators have to comply. As my hon. Friend the Minister will be aware, I have serious concerns that much of that legislation is unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome on companies in the UK, but we are obliged, by our treaty obligations, to implement it.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/8">Our Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the MHRA, and our trading standards officers, have powers to take steps against UK operators that contravene those regulations and directives, but they do not have jurisdiction in the Channel Islands. Therein lies the crux of the problem. The Channel Islands do not have similar legislation, and so companies in Guernsey and Jersey, in particular, are able to abuse the situation and market vitamins, minerals, food supplements and herbal remedies, which may contain illegal ingredients, to UK consumers using illegal claims. Clearly, operators are keen to take advantage of that lack of regulatory control. In the last decade, the turnover of Channel Island businesses that deal with such products has risen from zero to an estimated &pound;100 million today, and the business is still growing. Meanwhile, the turnover in the UK sector has stagnated in comparison.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/9">The problem is further exacerbated by the inequities of the low-value consignment relief, or LVCR, regime, which allows companies based in the Channel Islands to avoid paying VAT on deliveries in which the contents are valued at less than &pound;18. I shall not go into the details of that issue, as it was raised in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-27">27 January</phrase> by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">the Member for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase>. However, the freedom to make illegal medicinal claims with impunity, combined with the price advantage generated by the LVCR regime, has led to Channel Island operators capturing a substantial share of that market in the UK. That not only poses a serious threat to UK consumers, but gravely undermines the responsible UK suppliers and health food businesses that continue to make considerable investments to comply with the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/10">That unlevel playing field has arisen because the Channel Islands are not members of the EU. The relationship between the Channel Islands&mdash;as well, incidentally, as the Isle of Man&mdash;and the EU is set out in protocol 3 to the Act of accession that was annexed to the 1972 treaty of accession, by which the UK became a member of the then European Economic Community. Even though the Channel Islands are not members of the EU, some EU laws apply to them. That was confirmed in May 2007, when a Minister in the other place acknowledged:</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/11" class="indent">&quot;The United Kingdom (UK) view is that the nutrition and health claims directive, the food supplements directive and the medicines directive remove barriers to the free movement of goods within the European Union...it is our view that the directives should apply to the Channel Islands under protocol 3&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-05-23.113"><i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i>23 May 2007; Vol. 692, c. WA113</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/12">However, despite the view that the Crown dependencies should implement the legislation in question, only limited progress has been made. The Medicines (Human and Veterinary) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2008, received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-10">10 December 2008</phrase>, after a protracted delay. Although the introduction of that law in Guernsey is a very positive step, it is not fully consistent with the EU medicines directive. That was confirmed by the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">the Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, when she said, in response to a written question:</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/13" class="indent">&quot;The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has reviewed the draft&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/14">as it then was&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/15" class="indent">&quot;Medicines (Human and Veterinary) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 2008 in respect of human medicinal products and believes that it is not consistent with the Medicines Directive 2001/83/EC.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-03-27.414"><i>Official Report</i>, 27 March 2008; Vol. 474, c. 414W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/16">The Government of Guernsey now have to bring forward secondary legislation to implement fully the EU medicines directive. That must be an absolute priority, and should take place as soon as possible. Only when Guernsey has fully implemented the directive will it be able to prohibit and allow enforcement action to be taken when food supplements are marketed with medicinal claims. I am keen to hear the Minister's view on what kind of assistance is provided to the Government of Guernsey in that respect. Is there a time scale for Guernsey to bring forward such secondary legislation? Guernsey has not made any firm commitment to a timetable for bringing forward other legislation, including the food supplements directive and the nutrition and health claims regulation. What steps are the Government taking to ensure that that happens?</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/17">Let me turn to Jersey. Although Jersey has some basic medicine law in place, as is the case in Guernsey, it does not meet the obligations set out by the EU medicines directive. I understand that discussions on the implementation of the EU medicines directive with the officials in Jersey are only beginning. I am keen to know what discussions have already taken place on that issue in Jersey and whether any further meetings are planned for the near future. Will my hon. Friend say what resources are provided to the Government of Jersey to assist them in implementing the EU medicines directive?</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/18">Encouragingly, Jersey has made a commitment to implement the food supplements directive and the Nutrition and Health Claims (England) Regulations 2007 as part of the major update of food safety legislation that is under way there. I am aware that my hon. Friend's colleague from the Ministry of Justice, Lord Bach, visited Jersey on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-17">17 April</phrase> this year. Based on the feedback from that visit, this debate is extremely timely. Is the Minister aware whether there is an agreed time scale for when the Government of Jersey will bring forward such legislation?</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/19">In terms of drafting legislation, I appreciate that there are limited resources available to Crown dependencies, but I am anxious to be reassured that our Government are doing everything in their power to encourage the Channel Island authorities to meet their obligations and implement these regulations effectively and without any further delay. I am also anxious to be reassured that our Government and their officials in the relevant institutions will work with other UK authorities and businesses, including the postal authorities, advertising regulators, periodical publishers, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and others, to ensure that every avenue is explored to protect UK consumers and the responsible UK health food businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/20">I am keen to know what discussions the Minister or his colleagues have had on the issue with any of the authorities I have just mentioned. Dealing with this matter is not just about implementing the legislation; it is about effective enforcement. I would like to press the Government and the relevant authorities to provide the necessary assistance to the Crown dependencies to enable them to enforce legislation to protect UK consumers. There is a pressing urgency about the matter because the European Commission is about to introduce maximum permitted levels for vitamins and minerals under the provisions of article 5 of the food supplements directive, which may limit the potency&mdash;and hence the attractiveness&mdash;of products in the UK market. That would obviously give the Channel Islands' suppliers yet another potential advantage over the UK market.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/21">The nutrition and health claims regulations threaten to restrict even further the ability of responsible mainland suppliers to make a range of currently acceptable modest and accurate claims about their products. That will give companies operating in the Channel Islands yet another advantage over UK-based suppliers. By 2011, the issue will have got worse because, when the directive on traditional herbal medicinal products is fully implemented, herbal suppliers on the mainland will be unable to compete in that business area with their competitors in the Channel Islands. So, urgent action is overdue, and I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to give me an assurance today that there will be no further intolerable and unjustifiable delays in requiring our Crown dependencies to address these matters by replacing the earlier promises that they have given, which have not entirely been maintained, with legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/22">I should add that the current economic recession is making it even harder for UK companies to stay in business, especially when faced with such aggressive and unfair competition. What is more, it is a constitutional quirk that, if the European Commission becomes aware of the failure to enact and implement appropriate legislation in the Crown dependencies, it is not the authorities of the Crown dependencies but the British Government who would face enforcement action. I am sure that the Government wish to avoid that.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.3/23">I am grateful that my hon. Friend the Minister is present this morning. I fully understand that the Minister of State, Department of Health, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">the Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, cannot be here because she is dealing with the swine flu outbreak. I look forward to my hon. Friend's response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-05a.55.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="55"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090505/halltext/90505h0009.htm#0905051000485">
	<p pid="a.55.2/1">Good afternoon, Mr. Wilshire. I am grateful for the chance to raise an issue that has been something of a perennial for me in the 12 years that I have been a Member of Parliament, although it is particularly timely in view of what is happening in my area at the moment, following a local development on bus services which I will describe to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/2">I want to flag up a question and I should be grateful for a response from the Minister. Flagging it at the start may give him the opportunity to seek inspiration, as it were, as I progress. I want to know whether bus companies can subsidise less profitable routes with more profitable ones. The local company, First bus, has withdrawn a service on the grounds that it was not making enough money. My constituents wrote to First, asking, &quot;Why don't you subsidise this service with one of your city centre routes on which you make a lot of money?&quot; and it replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/3" class="indent">&quot;We are not able to cross-subsidise routes. The Transport Act does not allow busy city routes to support less-used routes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/4">It would be helpful if the Minister commented on that response by the bus company and said whether its understanding of the law in this regard is correct, because I think the situation may be slightly more subtle than it says.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/5">Stepping back to give the context for this debate, I represent a part of south Gloucestershire with many small towns and villages where there is heavy car usage and bus services are, on the whole, pretty poor. If people live on one of the main arterial routes into the centre of Bristol, they stand the best chance of getting a bus service, but if they live in a village or if they need to travel in the evening, on a Sunday or out of hours to get to a hospital appointment, for example, they have serious problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/6">One local service, which was an express, or X, service&mdash;the X27&mdash;went down the M32 motorway from Yate in my constituency, past a village called Iron Acton, through Winterbourne and into the city centre. That was a popular local route. Bus changes were announced by First not many months ago. It originally proposed withdrawing its fast bus services down the motorway, but we all thought that that was ludicrous. There has been talk of bus lanes and special methods of getting buses into the city centre quickly, but here the bus was planning to take some of its express routes off the motorway. We fought a campaign and there was an extensive period of public consultation, and, to be fair to First, it revised its plans in light of that consultation and campaign, and we were able to keep some of the express motorway services going.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/7">Given that experience not many months ago, we were all horrified to get a letter in March, telling us that in eight weeks First would stop running the X27 service. There was no consultation and minimal warning. The local authority found out about it pretty much at the same time as the rest of us. The bus company just said, &quot;Things have turned down; we're not making the money we want to on this route. We're pulling out.&quot; An awful lot of people were unhappy about that. This company does not have the best local reputation. We ran an online petition and many of my constituents made comments, saying, for example:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/8" class="indent">&quot;First buses truly are Worst buses!!!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/9">and</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Shame on you, Justin Davies&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/11">the managing director&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/12" class="indent">&quot;and your company, you have returned us to the dark ages when only those who can drive have the freedom to get around and live their lives!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/13">The Bristol<i> Evening Post</i> regularly gets a front-page story from the latest outrage perpetrated by First bus on the benighted residents of Bristol and south Gloucestershire.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/14">There is a history of poor service and people are unhappy about a lot of things, but First took its performance to a new level by announcing with the minimum possible notice that the X27 route would be taken away. That impacted on a range of people. In the context of social exclusion, some of the comments from my constituents are germane. One lady wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/15" class="indent">&quot;Please do not cut the X27. I will be totally unable to get an alternative bus as I am 84 and this is the only bus which goes from outside where I live...I will be unable to go anywhere, which is very depressing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/16">The elderly, who are heavily dependent on this service, were disappointed. Somebody said:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/17" class="indent">&quot;Just got my bus pass&mdash;no bus.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/18">Older people were particularly affected by all this, but they were not the only ones. Young people were also affected. One young student responded to a survey we did via Facebook, saying, &quot;I'm doing my A-levels and you're going to cut the bus on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-10">10 May</phrase>. How do you expect me to get to my exams?&quot; Nobody had thought about that. First just said, &quot;We're not making money. We're pulling the plug in eight weeks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/19">I am worried about the structure of our bus services. It is fine to say, &quot;Well, they're just in it to make money. They make money and we subsidise the rest.&quot; But unless there is long-term stability planning&mdash;for example, in this case people know that a service can be cut with eight weeks' notice&mdash;how will there ever be long-term growth in bus usage? People plan their jobs, their studies and their lives around transport arrangements. If bus companies can just pull the plug with eight weeks' notice, that will not give anybody confidence to plan their lives around public transport, and yet another person will assume that the only thing they can do is use the car. If we had not been able to do something about the X27, the young woman doing her A-levels said that she would have had to move out of her home for the period of her exams because there was no other way for her to get to her studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/20">One woman wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/21" class="indent">&quot;My daughter...is in her final year of A-levels and works long hours in the library. Getting into college quickly makes her long day much more bearable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/22">Interestingly, she talks about the quality of service offered by the bus company:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/23" class="indent">&quot;Over two years of poor time-keeping, often rude and aggressive drivers and overcrowding on the X27...A company with such a poor name for service should be doing its utmost to improve customer relations, not anger its client group of travellers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/24">So there is a saga of poor quality of service and unpredictability, and now the company is pulling the rug out from under people at the last minute.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/25">We launched a campaign to get South Gloucestershire council to subsidise the route. That has happened after our successful campaign. The council agreed to step in to provide money for a reduced service once an hour for six months, but, of course, in six months we shall have the whole thing again and people will not know where they stand or whether they can rely on the service beyond the six-month period. I welcome the fact that the council will promote the service, which First should have been doing anyway, because often people stand at a bus stop along that route and do not even find timetable information. For instance, when First announced that it was planning to scrap the service, or prevent it from using various stops, it did not even put information on the bus stops.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/26">That shows the contempt with which First treats its passengers. It can do that because it is a monopoly. In theory, Steve Webb Buses could set up and run along the same route, but we all know that First will be the only one that does so. The irony is that First won the tender for the subsidised service, so it still ends up running it anyway, but is paid by the council to do it. I cannot help feeling that we have got to the worst of all worlds in respect of buses in the last 20 years, because in many places we do not have a public monopoly, which at least could be in the public interest, or vigorous private competition, which might be efficient, but we end up with a private monopoly, which is probably the worst of all worlds.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/27">Stepping back from that local example, where we have a sticking plaster solution and local council tax payers are now paying to keep the service going once an hour for the next six months, but no long-term solution, what is the long-term prospect for my constituents getting a decent bus service not just on this route, but across the area?</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/28">The context, with which the Minister will be familiar, is that more built-up areas, such as Bristol and the surrounds, have suffered big time since deregulation. With a 94 per cent. rise in the real value of fares and a 46 per cent. fall in patronage, there have been huge hikes in fares and a drop in bus usage in those built-up areas. That contrasts with London. The Minister will be familiar with this, but it is worth putting on the record that in London, where the local authority can essentially dictate and co-ordinate the services, fares and routes, bus usage is growing at its fastest rate since the mid-1940s; buses in London carry the highest number of passengers since 1968; and bus mileage in London is higher than at any time since 1957. I accept that London is different, but a lot of features of the London model could be applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/29">What have the Government done? The Minister's response might be that the Local Transport Act 2008 is the way forward. That Act allows more flexible voluntary deals between bus companies and councils, but, frankly, in our area First has got the councils over a barrel, because it is the only provider. I was rather alarmed to discover that, in the passenger transport executive areas, 90 per cent. of the services are run by the big five operators and, in general, they do not fight each other. It feels like a stitch-up.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/30">First runs in Bristol. Do Arriva and all the others compete against First? Mysteriously, it does not seem to happen. The theory of competition is great, but the reality is that we all know that the vast bulk of the services will be run by First. Wessex Connect will pick up the odd one, as will South Gloucestershire Bus &amp; Coach, but we all know that First will be in there as the main provider. We do not have realistic competition. If the bus companies have the councils over a barrel on voluntary partnerships, what about statutory partnerships? They are another option, although they are limited in scope. My preferred model is a franchise or quality contract. The 2008 Act provides for that, which is welcome, but although the Act was passed last year, the regulations and guidance are not yet in force. Will the Minister tell us when they will be?</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/31">In theory, it has been possible for some years for local authorities to franchise services throughout an area, but in reality no one has applied for or been granted permission to do so, because the legislative hurdle has been very high. The 2008 Act relaxes that, and I welcome that relaxation, but I am worried that even when its provisions are in place we may not see franchising and fierce competition between companies in the Greater Bristol area, because many tests will still have to be overcome. The decades of public transport failure in my area should be enough evidence that the alternatives have been tried vigorously. Yes, we will have quality corridors, or whatever the latest jargon is, and yes, there will be new bus lanes and better bus stops, but they will be on the major arterial routes in and out of the city, and people living in villages, young people, elderly people and those who want to travel off peak will receive limited benefit because they do not live where the major routes are.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/32">I do not doubt that the Government want to do something about the problem, and I am sure that the 2008 Act was well intended, but when will we see a difference on the ground? I know that there is already co-operation with bus companies in Bristol and south Gloucestershire and that there will be new bus lanes, but that will not scratch the itch for my constituents who live in villages or areas that are not on major routes. We had a public meeting in Iron Acton, which would have been completely cut off by the changes. Elderly residents said that they would have to move out of the area because, for example, there is no GP in the village so they could not visit their doctor without ringing community transport. People who have appointments at the eye hospital early in the morning could not get there. Losing those services would have killed communities, and I see no evidence that anything other than a radical shake-up will address those concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/33">First is in the business for what it can get out of it, and we should stop pretending otherwise. It makes hefty profits and its bus services are profitable overall. It is not a charity, and we have given it the opportunity to prove that it has a public service ethos, but it has kicked us in the teeth. Let us not pretend that relying on the good will of First or anyone else will get us there. The answer in my area&mdash;it may be different in other areas&mdash;is for local authorities to work together and to franchise a comprehensive network of services that will be stable in the long term and not cut with eight weeks' notice, that will link in with other public service infrastructure, such as main line and suburban railways, and that will provide off-peak and rural services. I know that such services cost money and that the pot is not unlimited, but if First and other companies had to bid for the complete network, they would have to make a choice. They would have to decide whether they were going to be in or out of Bristol. That would force the issue, because it is in their interests to stay in the area, and we could get an awful lot more from them than if we just relied on their good will, which is the model that we have relied on too much in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.2/34">I could read out dozens of comments from angry people who want to be bus users and do not want to use their cars. Many of them commented on the website that they are always being told to get out of the car, but bus services are being cut. They are profoundly frustrated, and I hope that the Minister will say that the Government's changes will be implemented quickly and bring about a real change, not just in services, but in fares. I have surveyed young people who say that the cost of fares is their overwhelming problem. We have relied too much on bus companies' good will, but they are not in the business of showing any, so we must be much tougher on behalf of bus users, and I hope that the Minister will assure us that the changes will make a difference on the ground. If not, further powers may be needed to make bus companies provide a public service, which is what should have been provided all along.</p>
