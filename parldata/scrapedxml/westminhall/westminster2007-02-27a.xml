	<p pid="a.228.0/1">I add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">my congratulations to the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase> on securing today's debate. He could not have chosen a timelier subject. I congratulate him on the way in which he presented his case&mdash;he did so very well.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/2">As we have heard from a number of hon. Members, Iran is challenging&mdash;I use that word carefully&mdash;the United Nations Security Council over its nuclear programme. Iran is also providing destabilising support to extremists in Iraq and Lebanon, issuing dire threats to wipe Israel off the face of the map and, as we have heard, denying fundamental freedoms to its people. Addressing Iranian policies in those areas is rightly at the top of our foreign policy agenda. I shall take them in turn and deal with some of the questions that have been raised this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/3">On Thursday, Dr. Mohammed EI-Baradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who I met the week before last, issued another report on Iran's nuclear programme. The report makes it clear that Iran is continuing&mdash;and, indeed, expanding&mdash;its uranium enrichment activities in defiance of the Security Council. If mastered, those activities would give Iran the know-how to produce fissile material that could be used in nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/4">President Ahmadinejad claims that bullying western powers are trying to deny Iran its rights. He says that Iran's ambition is simply to generate electricity. For the sake of clarity, it should be put on record&mdash;I do so now, and I hope that it is marked&mdash;that we have no wish to deny Iran, or any other country, its rights under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, provided that it meets its obligations. We have not sought to stop Iran building a nuclear power station at Bushehr to generate electricity. We have even offered to help Iran develop a modern nuclear power industry, if it shows that its intentions are peaceful. I do not know whether that constitutes <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the appeasement of which my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> accused me and others&mdash;it is great to have a new slur put against one's name. Never before have I been called an appeaser; clearly, I shall have to clean up my act.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-27a.230.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" speakername="Kim Howells" colnum="230"  time="012:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070227/halltext/70227h0007.htm#07022751000510">
	<p pid="a.230.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to raise that question. We have raised it with the Pakistani Government on many occasions, because what the hon. Gentleman describes as luxurious house arrest is not an appropriate punishment for what the AQ Khan network did. In relation to Iran, the matter is extremely serious, and I shall add to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/2">I have taken part in two debates this morning, Mr. Martlew&mdash;this and the previous debate on Lebanon and Syria&mdash;in which I have heard Rafsanjani described as a moderate. I saw him give an interview in the run-up to the last presidential election with Gavin Essler on a BBC World interview. He declared: &quot;Yes, of course we have hidden aspects of our nuclear policy. We would not have been able to develop it otherwise.&quot; Rafsanjani was in charge of that Administration. We should be careful about dividing Iran into reformers, moderates and extremists. We have all got form, and Rafsanjani has got some too.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/3">The International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors and the UN Security Council have set out the essential steps that Iran needs to take to build confidence, which include the full suspension of enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. The measures required by the Security Council would not affect Iran's pursuit of nuclear energy. Iran does not need to enrich uranium to generate electricity. However, the suspension would<i></i>help to provide confidence that Iran is not seeking the know-how to make fissile material for weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/4">I sometimes hear the argument that&mdash;I have not heard it this morning, although I was waiting and prepared to hear it, but I have heard it from Dr. el-Baradei among others&mdash;the IAEA board and the Security Council are wrong to insist on a suspension because Iran has either mastered enrichment or cannot be stopped. That is entirely misguided. Iran has enriched relatively small quantities of uranium, but it has not learned how to operate the process properly. Iranian scientists are yet to solve a range of technical problems and therefore although suspension remains crucial and pressing, there is still time for diplomacy to work. We remain committed to finding a negotiated solution and our approach has been to make it clear to Iran how it might benefit from meeting its obligations. At the same time, we have made it clear that it will face the risk of greater international isolation if it fails to take the steps required by the Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/5">In June 2006, Javier Solana&mdash;the EU's high representative&mdash;presented proposals to Iran on behalf of the so-called E3 plus three&mdash;the UK, France, Germany, China, Russia and the US. Those proposals are far-reaching and offer a way forward that would provide confidence that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. The proposals would also give Iran everything that it needs to develop a modern civil nuclear power industry, plus other political and economic benefits. Despite that, Iran has failed seriously to engage in discussions. The proposals are still on the table and, even at this stage, I hope that Iran will acknowledge the benefits of them and take the steps required by the Security Council so that talks can begin. The current sanctions will be frozen if Iran complies with the proposals and would be lifted in the event of a long-term solution. I welcome the efforts by Javier Solana in the past few weeks to urge the Iranians to take a positive path. I hope that everybody understands the significance of that and that real attempts have been made to engage with the Iranian Government. If the Iranians do not address international concerns, the Security Council will have no choice but to impose further measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/6">I was glad to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> talk about the effectiveness of financial sanctions, which are incredibly important. We know that such sanctions worry the Iranians most. An indication of that is the 400,000 Iranians who live in Dubai, where they think that they can do their business. They are living there in preparation for what they consider the inevitable imposition of sanctions as a consequence of the intransigence of the Ahmadinejad regime. Iran is not North Korea. It has a great history, as the hon. Member for The Wrekin has described, and it has a large merchant class&mdash;traders, scientists and engineers. The people of Iran want a prosperous country, but they know that that will not happen under the leadership of Ahmadinejad. The people of Iran understand that economic sanctions would be effective and therefore they are taking measures to ensure that, if necessary, they can carry on with their business outside Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> asked about the straits of Hormuz. I was recently in Oman, where people are very worried that the straits of Hormuz will be blocked. This time next year, about 20 per cent. of our gas will come by ship from Qatar, where there is the biggest gas field in the world. There is always a reluctance to talk about the politics of energy in discussing this type of politics, but if we attempt to turn on the lights in our homes and nothing happens, we will be very worried about the straits of Hormuz. It is extremely important that measures are taken to ensure that the straits are kept open&mdash;all the Gulf states believe that that should be the case. We must redouble our diplomatic efforts in the Gulf to ensure that the other states in that area put pressure on the Iranians together with the E3 plus three and any other group of nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/8">On the proscription of Mojahedin-e Khalq, the Home Office rejected an application for de-proscription last year and that is, strictly speaking, a matter for the Home Office. As hon. Members know, however, the MEK is proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and its involvement in violence means that it has little support in Iran. The MEK claims to support human rights and democracy, but it is hard to square that with its authoritarian structure and claims by respected human rights non-governmental organisations of serious violations of the rights of its own members. I understand that an EU court has ruled that the EU's proscription of the MEK is illegal for procedural reasons and not because there is not a case against the MEK. The MEK remains proscribed in the UK.</p>
