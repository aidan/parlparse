<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-23a.151.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" speakername="Sadiq Khan" colnum="151"  time="015:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060323/halltext/60323h01.htm#60323h01_spnew17">
	<p pid="a.151.3/1">I wish that that was the case. I feel like a greybeard after nine months in Parliament, but the suggestion that the media simply report what we do is, frankly, disingenuous and not the case, although it pains me to say so.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/2">The Power commission accepted that the British public are not apathetic and referred to clear evidence of involvement in pressure politics. For example, the number of people signing petitions, supporting consumer boycotts and joining campaign groups has grown significantly in recent years. I mentioned the Make Poverty History campaign because the report gave an example of the mass public, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister coming together on an issue that is dear to the hearts of many people.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/3">Since I was 15, I have been knocking on doors for the party that I have been a member of since then and never before has making poverty history been the sort of issue that it was during the last general election. That is a testament to the public and young people in particular getting involved in politics, but not necessarily party politics. The fact that the Conservative party now talks about Africa in terms other than how much money we can make out of it is a testament to young people changing the way in which we discuss politics, poverty and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/4">The Power commission also referred to the reasons for the decline in formal politics and the fact that it began in earnest after the 1997 general election. The report is worthy of reading because it made an international comparison and the reality is that it is a problem for most of the western developed world. It is not unique to this country. We can learn lessons and teach other western countries about participation of young people in politics and try to use that as a way of levering them into party politics and democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/5">The Power commission discussed voting at 16 and received publicity on that. There were murmurings from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1545" name="Edward Miliband">the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband)</phrase> when the Minister referred to her personal view that voting at 16 may not be a bad thing. My concern about that is that there is a danger that it may be a gimmick to get out of the bigger problem that many people over 18 do not vote. The debate is about engaging young people in democracy, but there is a crisis with those over 18 who do not take part in mainstream politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/6">One reason for that is that politics is not accessible to the general public. Our language&mdash;I cannot say Ed Miliband and must say my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North&mdash;is one reason why the public do not understand what we are talking about. The fact that we must refer to people in the third person is a source of concern. Most people in my constituency of Tooting, which is less than five miles away, have not been to the Palace of Westminster and do not realise how accessible it is. That is also a source of concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/7">I shall give an example of the problem. Recently, I was approached by an organisation that wanted to organise a promotion by a young music band for young people taking part in democracy. I rang the Serjeant at Arms to find out whether the band could use a room to promote the CD and was told that music is not allowed on the Estate, which meant that the event could not be held in the Palace of Westminster. I then thought of the wheeze of holding it in College gardens across the road, where there would be a backdrop of Parliament. I rang the Director of the Estate and was told, after to-ing and fro-ing, that it could happen if there were fewer than 12 people, if props were not used on the grass and so on, and that there would be a charge of &pound;250 per hour for the promo to get people to vote. I was then told to contact Victoria park gardens.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.3/8">The matter went on and on and eventually the organisation that wanted to hold the event to persuade people to vote at elections decided to pull the plug and not to hold it. It is a sad story. I tease the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1882" name="David Lammy">the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy)</phrase>, whenever I see him by saying that one reason why I became involved in politics was that he managed to get Alicia Keys to Parliament to perform. I suspect that that is why there is now ban on music. I thought that if I could meet lots of pop stars by being an MP, I should become one. The point is that Alicia Keys and musicians are able to access an audience that we cannot. I am not suggesting that all of us or any of us should go on &quot;Big Brother&quot; or &quot;The Games&quot;, although one hon. Member is involved in &quot;The Games&quot; and I wish her luck in her competition, but that may not be the best way of making politics more accessible. There are problems with the place where democracy is seen to take place, because it is not accessible to a significant number of our constituents.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.0/1">I agree. The programme also mentioned the special helicopter laid on to take her from London to Sheffield and back, but I will not go into that.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/2">Before we leave the point about politics not engaging young people&mdash;the Heineken dilemma&mdash;it is worth mentioning that we need to find a way of reaching those parts of our community that we have hitherto not been able to reach, including the hip-hop generation, people in our mosques, those who follow football and sports teams, and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/3">My hon. Friend the Minister talked about the citizenship curriculum and how we could use that as a way of getting people involved, and engaging and teaching them about politics and the community. For me, the reason it is so important to do that was compounded by what happened on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase>. Not only did those four people kill themselves and 52 Londoners, and injure 700 people, but they were born and raised in this country. They went to our schools and, for all intents and purposes, were integrated, but they thought that the only recourse that they had was to commit an act of terror against their fellow citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/4">When I was involved in the task force, going around the country speaking to people, I discovered how disengaged they felt from the process. They thought that their Government and politicians were not engaging with them on simple issues to do with foreign policy, why we do certain things, why certain things happen and their knowledge of the political process. That is an example of the extreme end of the spectrum of what can happen when politics is completely disengaged from the lives of ordinary people.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/5">I conclude with two points, the first of which is the routes to becoming a politician, MP or councillor. As things are structured&mdash;they have been like this for a while&mdash;politics is a profession that someone can get into only if they are a person of means. When people have applied to me to become an intern, I have been surprised that unless they are the son or daughter of a middle-class parent or have other means, it is impossible for them to do the work of shadowing a parliamentarian and learning about the trade, although that is perhaps not surprising when one considers that interns work for free.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> referred to the OBV scheme. One of the beauties of that scheme and the Electoral Commission scheme is that they involve people of low means who would otherwise not have a chance to shadow MPs. Standing as a parliamentary candidate for a political party is an arduous process, requiring people to give up their jobs for 12 to 14 weeks. The challenge is this: how many working-class politicians will be standing for a political parties in winnable seats in four or five years' time? I am concerned that the number will fall.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/7">Secondly, my hon. Friend the Minister talked about those who shout the loudest having their voices heard. That is a concern, but the real travesty&mdash;all three parties deserve blame for this and should take responsibility for it&mdash;is that, in our quest to get the vote in marginal seats in middle England, we may have neglected those parts of the country that our party thought formed our core support. That has led to the rise of the British National party and the 19 councillors that we now have from a far-right party. People have lost all respect for their politicians and are disengaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/8">The reason the debate is so important is that an opportunity has been opened up to us by the citizenship classes in our schools and via a new generation of young MPs who were elected in 2005 and who are engaged in their communities&mdash;I see evidence of that from all three parties represented in the Chamber today. The challenge for us is to ensure that our young communities get more engaged in politics in the lead-up to the next general election than they have been in the last two.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-23a.154.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1622" speakername="Michael Jabez Foster" colnum="154"  time="015:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060323/halltext/60323h01.htm#60323h01_spnew20">
	<p pid="a.154.0/1">It is often still asked, &quot;Where were you when Kennedy was assassinated?&quot;&mdash;I do not mean the local events among the Liberal Democrats, but back in 1963. I know where I was: I was at the town hall in Hastings, speaking as a member of the youth council. Some people think it a bit sad that one should be so engaged, and that young people today are very different and do not behave in that way. I am not so sure. Young people today are just as keen to get involved in politics, but they are not so keen to get involved in party politics. They certainly have an opinion and if given the opportunity, they will express it.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/2">The trouble is that young people are put off by we oldies. We say that they do not have experience, but the truth is that all young people have experiences that we do not have. They know what it is like to live as a young person in 2006. They know what it is like to be on the street. They know about drugs. Many of us are simply unaware of that sort of activity. They know how they feel about the police and sometimes they know what it is like to be looking for accommodation, so we should celebrate it when young people get involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/3">Rather like the Minister, I want to talk about what has been going on in my constituency and why it is important to encourage the participation of young people in the political process. We have had an excellent youth council in Hastings and Rye&mdash;it has not run since 1963 until today, but come and gone, although today we have an excellent council once again. The schools and the youth organisations choose their representatives and, most importantly, have a formal link with Hastings borough council. The issue is therefore not just about young people's concerns, but the wider concerns that they discuss and which might be thought of as adult.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/4">My hon. Friend the Minister gave Lewisham a plug, so I want to give a plug to the Labour Hastings borough council, under the leadership of Jeremy Birch. The council should be applauded for its work with the youth council. It provides the youth council with a full-time worker and a budget of &pound;16,000&mdash;not as much as in Lewisham&mdash;but with &pound;6,000 for the young people to decide how it is spent. They make those decisions and they spend the money wisely.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/5">Just recently the youth council conducted a survey involving the bus service, although they did not do that just by themselves, but linked with the seniors forum to produce their report. It was discovered&mdash;oddly, some would say&mdash;that young people and older people often had common interests. They had the same concerns about the buses not running late enough and about the safety of standing around at a bus stop late at night. The survey was a great example of young people's experience helping to form a policy and perhaps making some changes in the decisions that were subsequently made.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/6">The young people's council also has regular two-monthly meetings in session with the borough council. There is an exchange of views, in which the members meet up, talk and discuss the various issues. In fact, last month the young people's council went in for speed dating with Hastings borough council. That was not something that I would expect to happen, but each youth councillor and each member of the borough council spent three minutes together, exchanging views. Actually getting a view over in three minutes is a lesson for politicians, and that is the point: young people are impatient to express their views. They want to express them, but often the way in which we engage with them prevents that from happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/7">The youth council's next project, again in conjunction with the seniors forum, is a crime and safety film, which is to be produced by a local TV station. The lesson is clear. If young people are offered opportunities, they will get involved and come up with conclusions that can help the wider community too.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/8">Likewise, I recently attended the hustings for members of the Youth Parliament. The Youth Parliament has been mentioned, but it does not receive the publicity that it deserves. It was launched in the House of Commons as long ago as 1999 and there are now 300 elected MYPs, aged between 11 and 18. They represent young men and women across the nation, and they tend to be a heck of a lot more representative than we are. There is a goodly number of ethnic minorities, and some members have physical or even learning difficulties, yet still they become MYPs. How come we cannot learn from that?</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/9">The year before last, the MYP for Hastings and Rother was a chap called Phil Carey. I mention his name because I was surprised and pleased to note that the Power report was published last week with his name on it, as one of the youth representatives on the commission playing a part in advancing engagement in the political process. He was able to achieve that position through the Youth Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/10">The week before last, I was invited to attend the declaration of poll for this year's MYP for Hastings and Rother. The campaign was impressive, resulting in a victory for Luke Springthorpe, a 16-year-old from St. Leonards, followed closely by his deputy MYP Nicole Pavitt, a 14-year-old from the Grove school in Hastings. Incidentally, it might not be a bad idea for us to have deputies. It is a heck of a job this MP business, but MYPs share it. They allow a deputy to take over when exams or other things get in the way.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/11">What impressed me about the campaign was the dedication of the candidates to the issues in hand. Anti-bullying, which we hardly talk about in the House, was a key issue in the campaign materials of almost every young person in the campaign. One might expect some of the other issues that were addressed to arise, such as the environment, but another issue that came up was asylum seekers&mdash;not <i>Daily Mail</i> front-page issues, but how young people really feel about people who come to this country. They wanted to engage in a&mdash;I do not like to use the word liberal&mdash;progressive way in meeting people from overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/12">Those are adult issues, not kids' issues. I believe that when young people are given the opportunity to do so, they will engage in that way. We should therefore encourage groups such as the UK Youth Parliament to play a fuller part in our democratic process. Perhaps we should invite them here to the Houses of Parliament more often. Three or four years ago, when I suggested in the main Chamber that perhaps at the weekends or in the evenings when we were not using the green Benches, the UK Youth Parliament might do so, there were cries of horror. One Member said, &quot;It would be treason to allow young people to sit on the green Benches if they have not been elected.&quot; They have been elected, but to a different Parliament. That sort of initiative might be just a gesture, but it is important that we make gestures to show young people that adult politicians in this Parliament care about what they say.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/13">I have found it useful, in my work as an MP, to work with my MYP. I think that they have found it useful too. I have conducted joint surgeries and question-and-answer sessions with their peers. They enjoy being part of that process and finding that we have methods to bring about outcomes that they would not be able to effect in isolation.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/14">I mention those experiences because it is important to appreciate that people such as Phil Carey, Luke Springthorp, Nicole Pavitt and others will one day be making decisions for us. It is not just about them; it is about us too. I rather like the amusing little sign that goes in the back of cars that says, &quot;Be kind to your children, they'll be choosing your nursing home.&quot; Young people will choose our future as well as theirs, so it is important that we do not have a disengaged group of young people who find our values alien. We respect their values, of course, but it would be nice to feel that we have common values. We have to engage them, respect their opinions and, to some extent at least, take note of what they say.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.0/15">It has been mentioned that back in the 2001 election, just 39 per cent. of young people aged between 18 and 24 voted. That number dropped to 37 per cent. in 2005. Some young people were asked why they were uninterested and did not vote. The survey suggested that it was simply party politics that they were not interested in. They were interested in the issues, but did not see party politics as the answer. Obviously, the parties have failed to make party politics relevant to meeting young people's genuine concerns. Engagement could be the starting point. We should welcome young people's contributions, experience and, perhaps, wisdom, but, above all, for sure, treating them with respect is a good starting point.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-23a.160.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="160"  time="015:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060323/halltext/60323h01.htm#60323h01_spnew24">
	<p pid="a.160.0/1">I do not know whether that was meant to be a topical question for me, but I agree. I look forward to having a debate later with the hon. Gentleman, outside the Chamber, about the Power commission. I agree with his reservations about some of its comments, but I hope that we might agree broadly about its recommendations, which are the crucial part. It is interesting that the Power commission was set up by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust and the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, which have always been part of that progressive social group that seeks always to make democracy more participatory. I thank them for putting up the money so that that body could do its work and report to us. Everyone is taking that seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.0/2">I want to pay one last tribute. The hon. Member for Tooting referred to one of the difficulties of being elected, whether as a local councillor, a member of the London assembly or as a Member of Parliament. In spite of those difficulties, be they the loss of privacy or of personal time and space, with people knocking at the door or ringing up all the time, some people stand for election as young as they can. One member of our party, a woman called Hannah Hedges, was the youngest parliamentary candidate in the country and stood at the age of 21. It was important that she did that. She was selected through the proper process and stood for a parliamentary seat.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.0/3">A friend of mine, Niko Baar, became the youngest councillor in the country in Southwark some years ago, at the age of 21. He did a good eight years as a councillor and then went off to do other things, which was reasonable after eight years of such intensive work. There are other things in life. That is another important message: people do not have to go into politics to stay. Politics needs people who come in and go out, or who do other things and then come in. It is important that people do not think that they will get locked in for life. There is a lot of pressure, once one says yes. My friend Richard Allan, the former MP for Sheffield, Hallam, stood down for no other reason than that he had other things to do with his life at the end of his 30s and in his early 40s.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.0/4">I will be quick and make three substantive points. There are ways in which homes, schools and the media can do more to ensure that the political engagement with young people happens better. Parents have that responsibility. Families often have strong political debates, even in this country&mdash;I know that the French have much more politicised meal times than we do. The children with the most encouragement often become much more politically engaged. Baroness Williams tells the story of being brought up in a political household. Of course it makes one more politicised. Parents have a duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.0/5">I agree with the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye that visits here and to council chambers, and use of the Chamber and the council chamber, are important. However, it must not be seen as theatre. There is a danger sometimes that it is seen as theatre, not reality. People dress up and it is a game. The important thing is that there should be real discussion, real debate and a real exchange of views.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.0/6">I have just come from the Globe theatre, which is holding a schools spring event. Lots of schools are doing &quot;As You Like It&quot;. Theatre can often engage people in politics. The great Shakespearian plays, as well as others, contain some big political issues. There are a lot of ways to enable young people to emerge with strong feelings. We need to encourage them at all times.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.0/7">We need to keep on encouraging our radio, television, video and other providers to do the job better. That is why it is a good thing when the BBC do &quot;Question Time&quot; and &quot;Any Questions&quot; for young people. That may give us a lesson.: those programmes move around the country. Last time I was on &quot;Question Time&quot; it was in Harlow, I think. We could do better as a Parliament not to move ourselves round lock, stock and barrel but to do a bit of what the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly do, and to take what we do more visibly from this place to the boroughs, to the counties and around Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.0/8">We need to think about how we take politics to people. It is exactly the point that the Minister made about going to register people rather than expecting them to come to us.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.1/1">And above all to the bus stops, the bus and railway stations, and&mdash;in London&mdash;the tube stations, where there are real numbers of people, and where we can catch people as they go about. We could also take voting to the supermarkets, I guess, and other places.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/2">All of us are probably very good at involving young people in the political process as we go about our weekly lives; that is why we are here. We should be taking young people to surgeries, and when we knock on doors, we should not say to the young person who answers, &quot;Can you find your dad or your mum?&quot;, but should talk to them first about why we are at the door. We should let them come out with us if they want to, as they often might in school holidays. They might ask, &quot;Where are you going? What are you doing? Can I canvass with you?&quot; If they came with us, they could see the process; we have a duty to engage them, and for kids it is often very exciting and interesting. A bit of a competition is always a good thing, and they normally enjoy it.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/3">We all have a duty to do the best we can to ensure that our parties are properly representative. I am trying hard to make sure that ours is, as are my colleagues who are present. I know that we are all trying to do that but, bluntly, we have to work harder. None of us have got there, yet.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/4">I support votes at 16, as does my party. The key reason is that if we allow people to leave school at that age, but they cannot vote until a period afterwards, there is a disconnection in their learning, between the preparation and the opportunity. As young people have shorter attention spans, any interest that has been cultivated may well be lost by distractions. That, for me, is the overwhelming reason, quite apart from the reason to do with the civic age of responsibility. The other day, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" name="Stephen Williams">the Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams)</phrase> made a persuasive case for votes at 16 under a ten-minute Bill downstairs; it failed by only eight votes, I think. I had the figures somewhere, but I have mislaid them.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/5">The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye asked the important question of what young people are interested in: issues or parties? It is issues, of course. Parties are only methods of getting issues changed. Political parties are only the means, not the ends, and young people are interested in the ends&mdash;in peace not war, justice not injustice, equality not inequality, and no discrimination rather than discrimination. They are really engaged. I particularly pay tribute to minority ethnic community young people; in my experience, they are often much more politically alert than those born and brought up here, and whose families have been here for generations. That is because at home there is a combination of an international experience and a national experience, so they probably understand international affairs much better than people who have links with no other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/6">The youth services and local authorities have a duty to be always helpful. To end, I give an example of one thing that we might do. Young people's interest is often cultivated by seeing the political process deliver. Kids might knock on my door and ask, &quot;Simon, can we have a football cage on our estate?&quot; If there is a process whereby in a short period their interest in getting something done can deliver them through the consultation and the outcome, and if they can then see that cage there, they are far more likely to trust in the process. If the process takes power away from them and says, &quot;Leave it to us,&quot; they will not be engaged. If the process says, &quot;Okay, let's get on with it,&quot; and nothing ever happens, they will say, &quot;When we asked, nothing was delivered.&quot; For most young people, the important thing is seeing that they have the ability to influence something through to a conclusion. That, more than anything, would make them feel more engaged. We are going in the right direction, but there is real urgency for us to do better and go faster. If we do that well, we can ensure really healthy politics; if we do not, we are in for trouble in the years ahead.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-23a.163.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1545" speakername="Edward Miliband" colnum="163"  time="015:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060323/halltext/60323h01.htm#60323h01_spnew29">
	<p pid="a.163.0/1">I am grateful to you for calling me to speak, Mr. O'Hara. I apologise to the House, because I shall have to leave a bit later, but I hope to come back for the winding-up speeches.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/2">This debate is timely, because there is a crisis with young people's participation in politics. Other speakers have spoken eloquently about the shockingly low percentage of young people who participated in the general election. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase> is right: there is a general problem with engagement and disengagement, but it is particularly acute among young people, and disproportionately so.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/3">There are three things that we need to talk about in this debate in terms of making a difference to young people's participation. The first has to do with how we talk about young people, both in politics and in the media. The second is about the way in which we engage young people on issues that directly affect their lives, and I will say a little about what I mean by that later. The third has to do with the democratic process.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/4">On the first issue&mdash;how we talk about young people&mdash;part of the problem is that we tend to see young people either as problems and people who cause trouble, or as bearers of potential and people on whom the future of our country depends. We rarely talk about them as citizens in themselves, who have legitimate voices. That is partly why such debates are important; they start to change that dynamic.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/5">The reality of young people today is that 98 per cent. of 10 to 17-year-olds are neither cautioned for, nor convicted of, a criminal offence in any given year, but one certainly would not know that from listening to some debates in the House or in the media. I cite one example in the media. MORI carried out a poll in 2004 that showed that 70 per cent. of press articles about young people were negative. It said that young people are quoted in only 8 per cent. of stories about them. Two thirds of 11 to 18-year-olds would not trust a journalist to tell them the truth and perhaps that is not surprising given the nature of the stories written about young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/6">That is not to deny the issues of antisocial behaviour and so on in all our communities, but it is the responsibility of both the media and us politicians to give a more rounded picture of young people. Put it this way: if, on 49 out of 50 occasions when we talked about young people, we did so in positive terms, they might regard our political proceedings somewhat differently. If we were doing that, we would be representing young people fairly.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/7">In a way, my second point echoes the words of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, who has talked about such issues over a long period and who has done incredibly important work on the subject. We have to start to engage young people on the issues that affect their lives which are simply unaddressed. I am thinking particularly of services for young people in their own communities, and of spaces and places for young people to go. I care a lot about that. For a long time, that has been a neglected area of Government policy. I am not making a party political point; I think that that has happened under Governments of both parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/8">I much welcome the fact that the Government have started to redress the balance with the youth Green Paper and the youth funds, which are now starting to become available. Over the next two years, more than &pound;100 million will be available on giving young people a say about the kind of services that they want in their communities. That is important as young people care about a whole range of things beyond the issues that directly affect them, such as youth clubs and so on. However, if we in politics do not engage with and listen to them on those issues, what hope can we have that they will believe that we take them seriously on the whole range of issues?</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/9">The democratic process is at the core of this debate. I am sympathetic to&mdash;and, it is fair to say, a convert to&mdash;the idea of votes at 16, partly because of the issues of principle involved. At 16, young people have the right to get married and join the military, although only with parental consent, it is true. They can also leave compulsory schooling and go out to work. Those issues of principle are important. I do not mean that they are overwhelming and should automatically mean that people of 16 should have the vote, but they are a compelling case to begin with.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> mentioned that the younger people get involved in the possibility of voting, the more likely they are to vote. I also cite a report from the Social Market Foundation on that subject. It may seem counter-intuitive, but where the date of a general election falls, relative to the 18th birthday of a young person, makes a big difference to whether they will vote. That may be to do with their going to college or university or their excitement about gaining the vote and having the chance to exercise it immediately. It is also an important part of the case for lowering the voting age.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/11">The voting age was changed to 18 in 1969 and I have looked back at the House of Commons debates of 1968 on the issue. They are interesting because they reflect the same sorts of arguments that we hear today about voting at 16. For the interest&mdash;I shall not say amusement&mdash;of Members, I cite a speech made by the late Quintin Hogg, who spoke in one of them, although not, I think, for the Conservative Front Bench. He stated that his belief that the voting age should not be lowered to 18 was based on</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/12" class="indent">&quot;the conviction that there is a case for a period of time after maturity, of which three years is <i>prima facie</i> not a bad period, in which to go about the world getting experience before one is held to one's contracts, before one makes an irreparable mistake in marriage and even before one has what I still regard as the privilege, as well as the right, of the parliamentary franchise.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1968-11-18.1015"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 November 1968; Vol. 773, c. 1015</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/13">Some of the arguments today about whether people are ready for votes at 16 are based on similar convictions. Obviously, we have to draw the line somewhere; no one proposes that we should lower the voting age to below 16, but hon. Members who doubt the proposal should bear those debates of 1968 in mind. A lot of the 16-year-olds whom I meet are either ready for the vote or would be, with the right sort of citizenship education and other things.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/14">Lowering the voting age is not a panacea and no one should pretend that it is. That takes me to a wider point about the democratic process. We need to think across the piece about how to show that mainstream politics is more open to young people. Citizenship education is important and working out how it can be strengthened is part of this issue. My sense is that the teaching of citizenship is great in some places, but not so great in others. In some places, the subject seems to be more about institutions than live and controversial political issues. One of the ways in which to engage people in politics is to make them think that they are exciting and about their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/15">I echo the words of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1622" name="Michael Jabez Foster">the Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster)</phrase>, who says that we need to find ways of opening up Parliament. I am struck by the fact that, to my knowledge, the UK Youth Parliament has been sitting for four or five years, but never in this place.</p>

	<p pid="a.166.0/1">I apologise for arriving late; I was at a sitting of a statutory instrument Committee. I shall have to leave about half an hour before the end of the debate to catch my flight to my constituency, although I would very much like to hear the summing up. I am sure I shall read the <i>Hansard</i> report.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/2">I want to share my experience as the youngest MP in the House. People often talk to me&mdash;in party political contexts, at conferences or at events in the wider community&mdash;about the issue of young people and democracy. They ask, &quot;How do we get more young people interested in politics?&quot; I often think, &quot;Are you not asking the wrong person?&quot; Given that I have stood for election and been elected, I am clearly a young person who is very interested in politics. It is the wrong question to ask because as we have heard today, young people are interested in politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/3">Last July, I was at the Make Poverty History march in Edinburgh and it was stuffed full of young people from all around the country making their voices heard. I am sure that hon. Members who attended the Stop Climate Chaos lobby a few weeks ago will have noted the number of young people there who were campaigning on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/4">Young people are generally engaged in the issues, but how do we turn that engagement towards the political process? That is the challenge for us all. Members have talked today about different options and other things that are happening in their constituencies to engage young people. We all go to speak in schools in our constituencies and answer pupils' questions about our work as MPs and how the parliamentary system works. I, for one, always find such events incredibly enjoyable. It does not matter whether I have been wading through the intricacies of a Bill and its legislative jargon or finding piles of correspondence in my office&mdash;when I go to a school, I forget all that.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/5">Usually, there is a group of several dozen young people who start off slightly sceptical and think that the meeting will be dull and dry. However, starting to ask questions acts as a catalyst; more and more questions keep coming and they get incredibly engaged. The brilliant thing about school pupils is that there is no politeness or faffing around not being direct&mdash;they get straight to the point, asking how much I earn or whatever is on their minds. I always come away from such meetings feeling inspired about the next generation of people coming through the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/6">We have also heard about the Youth Parliament, which does a huge amount of good work. I lend my voice to the calls for it to be able to use the Commons Chamber when it meets. That would be excellent. Many schools have debating societies. I got involved when my school ran parliamentary debates, which sparked my first interest in politics back in the early 1990s. Last Friday I went to a meeting of the European Youth Parliament, west of Scotland division, which was being held in my constituency and where people were debating European issues. In addition, there is also an extremely successful BBC schools question time event.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/7">There are many projects or organisations set up to involve young people in politics. Often, they are all siphoned off as a separate section: we say to ourselves, &quot;This is the young people being involved in politics bit. The other politics bit is in the House of Commons or the council chambers, or in groups up and down the country&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/8">We must also promote direct engagement with the political process. Currently, young people cannot vote until they are 18. My view is clear: whenever I meet young people, whether it be in schools or at any community events, I am their Member of Parliament. Whether or not they can vote does not matter. If they are concerned about issues, they should write to me, e-mail me, check on my website to see what I have said or listen to my podcast. They should use whichever means they can access to find out about politics. I want them to get in touch. Sometimes when I say that to a young person it is a bit of a new idea to them. As they cannot vote, they have not thought that they can have that voice. I am pleased to say that I have received more letters and e-mails from young people as a result of that approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/9">It is also important to encourage young people to go further than just having their view. They might like to get involved in many ways. For example, they might want to join a pressure group and get involved in the organisation of campaigns. If they have a particular affiliation to a political party, they should go further and join the political party. They should find out more about standing, be it for a local town, parish or community council, the local authority, Parliament, one of the Assemblies or the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/10">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> mentioned that the youngest candidate at the previous election was a Liberal Democrat. At the one before that, in 2001, I was one of the youngest candidates in the country. I found it an incredibly valuable and interesting experience. We should encourage young people, not just to tell us their views, but to get involved and be part of the system. That must be the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/11">Many hon. Members have signed early-day motion 1218 on the 2009 Project. There is an excellent website associated with that: <a href="http://www.the2009project.com">www.the2009project.com</a>. It aims to get young people&mdash;it extends the definition to everyone who will be under 35 at the next election&mdash;to sign up to pledge that they will vote. Irrespective of who they vote for, the aim is to get them to pledge that they will vote and use their voice. As has been mentioned, young people care about many issues&mdash;anti-bullying was one that came up and, recently, issues about the minimum wage were raised. It took a long time for 16 and 17-year-olds to be enfranchised within that. Tuition fees affected younger people in particular. If the voice of young people is not heard at the voting booth, those issues are less likely to be taken seriously in this House. Apparently, 13 million under-35s will be eligible to vote at the next general election. Politicians should be taking account of that huge number of voters. I hope that hon. Members have used that opportunity to encourage young people in their constituencies to sign up to vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/12">The issues about how young people vote are also important. I remember the first time I was able to vote. Very frustratingly, I could not vote in the 1997 election, although by a cruel accident of birth many of my best friends were able to do so&mdash;they were several months older than me. I restricted myself to lobbying them and trying to convince them to vote Liberal Democrat.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.0/13">My first vote was in council elections, when I was a student living in Southwark and studying in London. I was keen to vote as I was interested in politics. I received my polling card and it mentioned a certain primary school. I had been living in London for eight months and I had no idea where it was. As I was walking out of the halls of residence to try to work out where to go, my hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey came up&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.168.1/1">I do not think that I have shared this story with my hon. Friend. He might not remember the occasion, because I was just some student in Butlers Wharf hall of residence. He said, &quot;Get into my car and I will give you a lift to the polling station&quot;. I said to myself, &quot;Fine, that's great&quot;. The polling station was about 200 m away; it was so close to where I had been living for eight months and I had no idea where it was. Students move into their halls of residence and work out how to get to their university classes and where the nearest bar is. Other than doing that, they might not be very integrated into their local community. That is a big problem, because if it is not easy for people to work out where to go to vote, they are far less likely to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/2">I got back from the polling station, got a sheet of A4 paper and, using a marker pen, drew a little map that said, &quot;You are here. Go there, turn right, and take the second on the left. There is the polling station. Voting is today&quot;. I stuck it by the entrance to the hall of residence. According to the marked registers for that year, many more of the students voted. Simple things such as that can make a difference. It is about both ensuring that people are on the register and that the polling stations are accessible. For halls of residence in particular, how difficult would it be for the local authority to issue a map with the polling card?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-23a.176.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" speakername="David Kidney" colnum="176"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060323/halltext/60323h01.htm#60323h01_spnew50">
	<p pid="a.176.1/1">I shall remember your words, Mr. O'Hara, and I promise to be brief. I apologise for missing the beginning of the debate and the speeches by my hon. Friend the Minister and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>. I was next door in a Standing Committee making an important contribution, I thought, to trying to save lives on the roads by reducing the drink-driving limit. I mention that only because it is endlessly fascinating to me how politics invades every aspect of public life. For me, that is the driving passion about politics and I would like to instil it in every young person I meet.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/2">Since I was elected in 1997, I have visited schools in the Stafford constituency regularly. Everywhere I go I see positive, happy learning environments and youngsters who are bursting with ideas and able to express themselves. Every time I come away from those places, I cannot help feeling a great optimism that when I retire, whether by choice or because I am compulsorily retired by the electorate of Stafford, excellent MPs will follow me in Stafford who went to schools in that constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/3">I repeat the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1545" name="Edward Miliband">the Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband)</phrase> that that positive view of youngsters is so perverted in media reporting about young people that most of the public have a very poor view of the youth of today. He gave the statistic that 70 per cent. of news reporting about youngsters is negative, with headlines about &quot;Yobs&quot; and so on. I heard the Children's Commissioner for England, Al Aynsley-Green, cite that in a lecture, in which he made an impassioned plea for the media to be fair in their reporting and give youngsters a chance. I hope that the media will listen to that plea from politicians and people such as Al Aynsley-Green.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/4">I shall say a little about the support for young people to participate in democracy. Many hon. Members have mentioned the citizenship curriculum, which became compulsory in our secondary schools in September 2002, with its three main themes of social and moral responsibility, community involvement and political literacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/5">In the previous Parliament, I was so excited by the opportunity presented by citizenship education that off my own bat, with no prompting from anyone, I devised a pack that I sent to every Member of the House of Commons and of the House of Lords. I did so because I felt that teachers throughout the country would be anxiously contacting their local politician to ask for their assistance in delivering citizenship teaching in their schools. I wanted MPs to know, when they were contacted, what that was all about and how they could respond positively. It was only a little pack&mdash;nothing very exciting&mdash;but it had basic information about the traps and pitfalls, the other sources of information available to them and how they could conduct themselves if they went into schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/6">As a result of putting together that pack, I have taken a close interest in citizenship teaching and I am convinced that it is very variable, as has been said. That is understandable given that many of the teachers had no previous training in the subject and perhaps have no history of an interest in politics, for example. The time has come to review the effectiveness of the citizenship curriculum to see whether there are things that we need to do to make it more effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/7">My other point in this connection relates to the role of Parliament as an institution aiding the teaching of the citizenship curriculum. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> said, we have a brilliant parliamentary education unit. That unit is superb and does fantastic work. When I was on the Modernisation Committee in the previous Parliament, we interviewed members of the unit, who told us about the service that they provided and about sending information packs to schools. Quite a lot of the members of the Committee around the table did not know about that, and they all sent off requests to the unit the next day to get the packs for their local schools. There was a bit of a run on the unit's material as a result, but perhaps even today many MPs do not appreciate the work that it does. It not only provides and sends out material, but gets youngsters to come into this place, whether for the sort of debates that the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey mentioned or for other events.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/8">I have sat in your place, Mr. O'Hara, and acted as Mr. Speaker during a debate among young people, and it is a very entertaining thing to do. The unit also arranges for tours of Parliament, showing a video, and a question and answer session with a leading politician&mdash;perhaps I should just say &quot;a politician&quot;, because it is often me&mdash;or sometimes an Officer of the House. Those ways of introducing young people to the teaching of the citizenship curriculum through the institution of Parliament to develop political literacy are very important. However, it is obvious that not every youngster can get to Parliament to have that experience, so a link is missing.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/9">The Modernisation Committee produced a report called &quot;Connecting Parliament with the Public&quot;, its first report of the 2003&ndash;04 Session, in which it made recommendations about turning things round by taking Parliament to where young people are. I suggested a partnership with local government so that every youngster can go to their local town hall and access a virtual Parliament on their doorstep, with links to this place. We have television, videoconferencing and so on these days&mdash;I liked the earlier reference to iPods&mdash;and we could make the process much more accessible, so that every youngster in the country was able to have a direct experience of Parliament in their community. I am pleased to say that Parliament has given extra resources to the unit to employ outreach workers who are engaged in the process of making contact with schools and local authorities in order to make that happen. That is a welcome development.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/10">I have missed out a lot of what I was going to say, but I have two more points. In addition to the unit, we have a website, which these days is an important means of communication, but it is not as good as it could be and work is still ongoing with the Parliament website to make it a resource for young people as well. That is coming along and we need to encourage it. Other organisations have been mentioned that can give assistance in this regard, such as the Citizenship Foundation, the Hansard Society and the Electoral Commission, with its &quot;Democracy Cookbook&quot;, which is a marvellous document, although it is big and heavy.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/11">My final point concerns the support youngsters should have from political parties. I ask the other hon. Members in the room to be honest. Are their local parties like mine in that they are uninteresting for young people? I have real difficulty in attracting young people to join my local party because we do not offer the right things. I have spoken to the Duke of Edinburgh award co-ordinator in my area and asked whether activities that young people can do as members of a political party count towards awards from the Duke of Edinburgh. In a guarded way, I was told, &quot;Yes&quot;. I am trying to persuade my party to make a step change in the way in which we offer activities to young people to make ourselves more attractive to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/12">At the national level, people are attracted to the issues raised by political parties, but they are also attracted to values. Sometimes we get autocratic in the way that we offer ourselves in what is called the middle ground of politics as being competent, by offering to do something similar to the other lot, but better. We forget to talk about our values. If we can offer people exciting visions about why we are in politics and what we want to achieve, we can attract people to follow in our footsteps. I very much hope that we can achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/13">I came prepared to say a lot more, but I arrived late, which is my fault. I shall now stop so that the Front Bench spokesmen can have the time to which they are entitled.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-23a.180.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1771" speakername="Justine Greening" colnum="180"  time="016:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060323/halltext/60323h01.htm#60323h01_spnew53">
	<p pid="a.180.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Perhaps the heart of people's frustration lies with party politics rather than individual good constituency MPs. I shall come to that. Party politics often switches people off more than any other thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/2">The Power inquiry talked about engagement, or lack of engagement with, and alienation from, politicians. What often comes across to me on the doorstep, particularly at the moment, while we are out campaigning for the local elections, is a sense of Westminster being full of a political elite. People do not feel that politicians have any real understanding of the day-to-day lives of most people in the country, especially younger voters.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/3">As a London MP with a young constituency, perhaps I am better placed than many MPs to stay outside the Westminster bubble because I can go home every night. On a personal level and also on a pragmatic level, I find it helpful to be able to escape from the bubble that the Westminster village can sometimes be.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/4">The Power report said that there is a weak dialogue between politicians and people, and I agree. I shall mention the classic example of something in which I tried to get people in my constituency engaged. They did become engaged, but they came out of it with a worse impression of politics. I do not want to go into too much detail, but it involved the recent consultation on night flights at Heathrow. Thousands of people and councils representing 2.5 million residents wrote in during the consultation process to say that they were very concerned about night flights. Many of them said that they wanted no night flights. When I went to the Department for Transport and looked through all the submissions that could be shown to the public&mdash;more than 1,000&mdash;I found just three from people who had asked for more night flights. Yet during the second phase of consultation more night flights were proposed. It is an example&mdash;I am sure that similar examples could be found from Governments past and present&mdash;of people engaging in an issue and having their engagement thrown back in their face. Such experience, perhaps more than anything else, switches people off. We must ensure that when we have removed the barriers to voting and people take steps to vote or become involved in a local issue, they feel that they have at least been listened to or, even better, genuinely had their views taken on board and represented.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/5">Finally, I shall not cherry-pick from the Power report, but will go through the points that it made. It talked about a quiet authoritarianism that people feel comes from the Westminster centre. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> talked about the autocratic style and made a valid point. The more approachable MPs are here and in their constituencies, the better it is for breaking down those barriers.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/6">To summarise the problems, there is a lack of trust between younger voters and politicians, which is partly born out of the political process, spin and the way in which politics has become more refined in the past decade. Spin has not been helpful in engaging young people in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/7">I come originally from Yorkshire and the north where people tell it like they see it. Young people are the same. They like to know what their politicians think. They like to see that their MP has recognised that there are always two sides to a debate and that they have come to a balanced view.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/8">Lack of delivery is often behind the lack of trust, whether at local or national level. Younger voters and those coming up to voting age want to be able to see that if they bother to cast their vote it will make a difference to promises being kept at a later date. &quot;Making a difference&quot; is a common phrase throughout all the research and when talking to young people. It is about politics being relevant to them and being a mechanism by which they can really make a difference, not just to their own lives but to the broader community and world in which they live.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/9">There is also a pragmatic issue with education. There is no doubt that many young people do not know who to vote for. Perhaps we are in a political cycle when political debates are increasingly on the centre ground. That is a pragmatic problem, and educators and political parties should perhaps work harder to set out where politicians stand on issues. It is genuinely an issue for all of us.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/10">What is the solution? I have made my diagnosis, so what is the antidote? For me, it is most important that if there is to be a wholesale change we must improve the quality of our political process so that when people speak their voices are heard and make a difference. There is no doubt that relationships of trust are built up over time. The Power report and the Russell commission show that many young people in particular feel that a four-week election campaign is a cursory way of trying to get them engaged in issues. Clearly, we need to start much earlier with an ongoing discussion with younger voters to build their trust. Parliament needs to be more accessible and the Hansard Society has come up with a number of great suggestions of how to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/11">I do know where the parliamentary education unit is. I used to think that my office on the fifth floor of Norman Shaw North was the fringe of the parliamentary estate, because it seemed that nobody passed on the way to anywhere, but people do go past it on their way to the unit, which is on the sixth floor. I have a good working relationship with the unit and have been able to get some of my local colleges and schools to come and do trips. I am particularly pleased that the Paddock school, which is one of the special needs schools in Putney, will hopefully be able to bring some its students to look around the House over the next couple of months.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/12">Some particularly good points were made about remote access to Parliament. I grew up in Rotherham, and I do not think that I ever had the chance to come to Parliament until I lived in London. There is nothing like the sensory experience of going round an amazing building like the one in which we are all privileged enough to work every day and seeing the tradition to bring home what happens in this place. That is particularly important and we need to get over the barriers. Even if people are a few hundred miles away we somehow need to make Parliament just as accessible. Perhaps technology today gives us the opportunity to do that in a way that was just not possible when I was growing up.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/13">I will not reprise all the arguments about schools, but we should strengthen citizenship classes. It was mentioned that we did not have them in the '80s, but voting in the '80s was vibrant. Perhaps one of the reasons for that was that the politics was more clear-cut and principle-based, so there were more arguments that people found accessible. They could take a clear stance on whether they were for capitalism or socialism, or for or against nuclear weapons. Politics in the '80s was black and white, in a way that meant that even younger voters could grab hold of the issues and talk about them. Growing up, I certainly had no problems understanding the &quot;either/or&quot; debates that we all had back then. Today the situation is more challenging, so helping people to understand the process and the issues through citizenship classes is valuable.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/14">I thoroughly support groups such as the Youth Parliament and the British Youth Council. They play an incredibly valuable role and have gone from strength to strength. I read the manifesto in the previous election to the Youth Parliament, which was an incredibly balanced, well argued, articulate and impressive document. It covered a wide range of subjects and showed a depth of understanding that was a credit to the people who pulled it together. In my role as a spokesman on youth, I am looking forward to working more closely with the Youth Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/15">We need to engage young people in the community far more. The Russell commission has focused on volunteering, which is absolutely the right direction in which to go. Our new leader, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase>, has talked about a youth community action programme, which is about getting people to put something back into their community and in so doing linking them to it in a way that they perhaps did not think was possible. All those things must surely be good in making people feel part of their society and, as a result, making them want to vote to change the direction of that society.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/16">We should also recognise achievement more. The Duke of Edinburgh awards have been mentioned, and I know that some of the charities and social enterprises that work with volunteering projects up and down the country give awards to children and younger people who are involved in volunteering. I should like those schemes to be developed more and formalised, so that perhaps more disadvantaged children who come out of education with few qualifications can still turn to their skills and say, &quot;These are worth something too&quot;, and they would be absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/17">We need to move to a more a positive style of politics, so that we do not just throw stones at one another at every opportunity or complain about problems, but talk about solutions. That is what we tried to do in the general election campaign and for the three years before that in Putney. We talked about what we wanted, rather than about what we did not like. For more than any other section of our community, a positive debate is vital with young people. We can have all the initiatives we like, but if people switch on the TV and see a yah-boo politics, in which people throw stones at one another just because they are on the other side of the Chamber, many younger voters have every right to turn around to us and say, &quot;Don't talk to us about being young voters. When are you lot going to grow up?&quot; Those are our challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/18"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">The hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase> talked about Wandsworth and its youth policy. I will forward him the well developed draft of the youth strategy that I have seen&mdash;I wanted to find out what my council was doing, so I called it. I am sure that he will be suitably impressed with that detail as it is developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/19">Finally, at its heart, democracy is about giving people an informed choice, so that when they vote they know what will change, how it will change and when it will change. Too often, politics in Britain boils down to what I would call Politics, with capital &quot;P&quot;. It is almost game playing&mdash;something that we all switch on when we get home, in the same way as we switch on &quot;Match of the Day&quot; and watch, say, Chelsea play Portsmouth. The challenge to us all is never to forget that politics is about the people out there. If we always keep people in the forefront of our mind and focus on who they are and what their concerns are, we will do much better.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/20">We will do our bit on the Conservative side of the House to set out what we have to offer people and what our agenda is, which we hope will reflect theirs at the next election, so that if nothing else, they will know what voting for us means. If the other parties do that as well, we will make a huge step forward, with younger people feeling that they know what voting means and what it can deliver. With those two things in prospect, I hope that we will see voting rise for the right reasons. I therefore welcome the debate and am grateful for hon. Members' patience in listening to me set out the Opposition's case.</p>
