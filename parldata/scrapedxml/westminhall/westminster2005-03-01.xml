	<p>I thank my hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire (Jim Sheridan) for raising this important subject. I want to tell the House my experiences with violence at work, not because I am trying to score brownie points or tell an elaborate story, but because it is important that people understand exactly what workers in a profession such as my previous one&mdash;nursing&mdash;are subjected to. During my first week working in a hospital, I suffered my first attack, which was carried out by a patient suffering from a mental illness. That creates a problem in itself because people suffering from a mental illness may not be in a position where they can be criminally prosecuted for what they do.</p>
	<p>I have suffered numerous injuries: I have had a broken leg, both of my collarbones have been dislocated, and I have had numerous black eyes and the usual bumps, bruises and scratches that happen when people work in a hectic nursing environment, whether they work in accident and emergency, with people suffering from mental health problems, with drunks coming in off the street or with people under the influence of drugs. I remember working in Belfast, and it was ironic that I was standing there as a staff nurse in a white uniform having to admit a patient who was in a Land Rover being protected by four policemen with bodyguard stuff, rifles and so on. They let this guy come in, then I had to take over and look after him. That sort of thing happens.</p>
	<p>I am not saying that the police do not do a good job; they do, and they suffer from assaults themselves, but the front line of the health service is not protected in the same way as the police. We are not in a position to protect ourselves because if someone is being attacked, there is a lot of ambiguity about the level of restraint they can use and how they can protect themselves. Far less is there any sort of support in the way of administering medication.</p>
	<p>My story continues when, later on in my career, I was in charge of a big psychiatric hospital at night. Thankfully, we have moved on from big asylum-type institutions, but in that hospital there were 60 exits and entrances, where any intruder could get access. When I was doing my rounds, I was attacked by an intruder who pushed me to the ground. We do not know why he attacked me&mdash;whether it was a sexual thing, whether he was an ex-patient with a grudge, or whether he quite simply wanted to secure the hospital drug keys, which I had. He tried to suffocate me, but thankfully something attracted his attention and he got up and ran off. The police tried to get him. The dogs got the scent, but unfortunately he got away because we were out in the wilderness. With all those exits, he could have gone in any direction and he managed to get away. I spent six months out of work, severely traumatised by the whole event and with a serious injury to my back.</p>
	<p>Those are not isolated incidents that people have to go through. I found it quite unbelievable, not so long ago, when the Countryside Alliance was marching and demonstrating in the streets and I tried to get access to my workplace to cast my vote against fox hunting, that I was punched in the face by one of the protestors. I really thought that I had left that level of abuse behind before I came to this job. There is an onus on us as a Government to do something about this issue. There should be strict penalties. Legislation should be brought in to penalise people who are prepared to hurt other people who are just trying to deliver a public service, sometimes against a background of great adversity.</p>
	<p>The Scottish Executive have led by example and are consulting at the moment on the protection of emergency workers. I greatly welcome that, but I am concerned about the ambiguity over who is or is not an emergency worker. A nurse going about her ordinary working day in a ward would not necessarily constitute an emergency worker, whereas a nurse attending an accident with the paramedics would. We should have similar legislation, but it should cover all public sector workers who face assault and abuse in the workplace.</p>
	<p>Once again, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire for raising this debate. I look forward to hearing the response from the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety. It is admirable that she is here this morning, given the time that she had to put in yesterday. I am sure that she felt under assault herself on many occasions, so she will be quite sympathetic towards us.</p>

	<p>I join my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Anne Picking) in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire (Jim Sheridan) on securing the debate. He reinforced something that all Members know: he is always to the fore when it comes to defending workers' rights. Today is a good example.</p>
	<p>We are talking about people who are public servants in the health service, who teach, and who work in public transport and the emergency services. People working in all those areas face violence day in, day out. It would be crass to say that that has become routine to some extent. As part of the debate, we must say that we will never accept that facing violence every day or every shift should be a routine part of a person's job or their contract of employment. There is nothing inevitable about violence. We must try not just to lift awareness, but to clamp down solidly on people who assault public service workers. It is as straightforward and as simple as that.</p>
	<p>The evidence is everywhere. There is first-hand evidence from people who are involved, such as my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian, and from others who can tell similar stories, such as firefighters who turn up for a fire and find themselves under a hail of bricks and stones and are assaulted. That is almost a normal part of their job. Much the same situation applies to ambulance staff. They turn up to a very serious accident and are assaulted and abused, verbally and physically. It is a tale that applies across the public sector. No part of that sector is different in any way. All people who work in the public sector face the problem. For example, we heard an Ofsted report on the question of violence against teachers. The problem does not affect just the people whom we would normally expect to be involved in violence&mdash;front-line staff&mdash;but even people involved in teaching. We need to do everything we can to protect them.</p>
	<p>What is the extent of the problem? The British crime survey said that there are about 1.2 million assaults on public sector staff. If thought of day to day, month to month, or year to year, that is frightening. It is something that we need to report not as a statistic or a figure, but as something that encourages us all, whether we are employers, trade unionists or politicians, to do more. It firmly sets an agenda: we need to make changes to the situation that public sector workers face.</p>
	<p>There is greater awareness about public sector staff being assaulted. There are posters on the underground. I congratulate Transport for London and others who are trying to lift awareness of the issues and to involve the public in ensuring that the situation is not accepted as a normal way of life for staff. So employers are doing their bit. There are also trade union campaigns. My hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire referred to the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers and others such as Unison, the Transport and General Workers Union and the Royal College of Nursing. Throughout the TUC, trade unions are interested in protecting their members and rightly so. They have done a lot of work, not just at TUC level but locally, to reinforce the agenda of protection of public sector staff. I, for one, am signed up to that agenda.</p>
	<p>There are some specific areas of concern. In its survey of health staff, Unison asked 3,000 staff to give an opinion about what they felt their reaction would be to the situations that they have faced in the past. Among nursing and ambulance staff, there were increases in violence year on year. That is unacceptable but it is the reality. The figures are there. I am sure that other trade unions could repeat those statistics.</p>
	<p>The Government have, of course, done a lot on violence at work and assaults on staff. They have developed and implemented a zero-tolerance agenda and policy. However, the problem is that that policy is falling down in certain areas. For example, while 18 per cent. of trusts say that there has been a reduction in the number of assaults on hospital staff, more than 50 per cent. of trusts report that there have been increases of assaults against staff, whether they be nurses, porters or whatever. That statistic should make us worried.</p>
	<p>If we manage nothing else in this debate, we should be clear about one thing. All staff should feel safe in the place where they work. There is no question about that. They should feel that they can turn up to work. They should know that they will work for a certain time&mdash;be it seven or eight hours&mdash;and they must feel that they can work in safety and be under no threat. It must be our aim as politicians to try to bring that to the public sector.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire made a number of points in opening the debate. I think that we have to talk about creating a specific charge of assaulting a public service worker and that the Government will have to move on that. There is no way that the matter can be left without anything being done. We need to develop new legislation so that people are clear that if they assault or abuse a public sector worker, a specific charge will be raised against them.</p>

	<p>I understand what the hon. Gentleman said, but is there not a danger that, if there is a specific charge of assault against public service workers, it would leave some people thinking that those in the private sector are second-class citizens, notably, as the hon. Member for West Renfrewshire (Jim Sheridan) said, shop workers?</p>

	<p>I welcome that point. I am not arguing that we need to protect public service workers and do nothing else, but, if we seriously want to make a practical start, that start needs to be in defending public service workers. They are out there in a way that bears no comparison with many private sector jobs. If we can get the legislation to work in the public sector, I am happy to extend it to the private sector, but we should initially target the problem, which is in the health service, the ambulance service, the emergency services, social work and teaching. We need to concentrate our efforts on the public sector so that people are clear about the charge they would face if they decided to assault someone.</p>
	<p>Lots is being done, and I compliment the people who are doing it. For instance, closed circuit television is being used more and more in hospitals to protect staff and ensure that they can work safely, and we need to extend such arrangements where we can. I welcome the use of DNA swabs in cases where someone spits at public transport workers. The First group has been using DNA swabs throughout the UK, and they can be used in evidence to prosecute someone who has assaulted or spat on a driver, which is a horrid thing to happen to staff in the course of their daily duties. I welcome those developments, but we need to do more to ensure that they extend across the range.</p>
	<p>I am quite happy to support this debate and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire on securing it and on giving us all the chance to discuss how best we can protect public service workers.</p>

	<p>That brings us to the question of ID cards. Just last week in Scotland, other parties decided not to go ahead with ID cards, and I regret that. At the end of the day, it is a simple matter. When I speak to people in my constituency&mdash;I stay in the biggest council estate in Midlothian&mdash;they wonder why ID cards are not a normal thing.</p>
	<p>When I was in America, in Florida, I saw a young couple walk into a bar. They looked to me to be obviously 23 or 24 years old, but the barman asked for an ID card. Afterwards, I said to him that that seemed a bit heavy handed. He said, &quot;Sir, if the cops walk in here today and I am serving somebody who is under age,&quot;&mdash;this addresses the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire (Jim Sheridan)&mdash;&quot;they will close my bar immediately and it will take me two weeks to open it again. I cannot afford to lose that custom.&quot; That was a good point, because one of the benefits of a simple thing such as an ID card is that it protects the shopkeeper and the bar staff and allows them to make that distinction. That is a simple way forward, and ID cards are a good thing in relation to such problems&mdash;without our talking about terrorism or anything else.</p>
	<p>What I said about hospitals and what they have to suffer is also true of buses. Some cities have no-go areas where the bus companies have withdrawn because of continual stoning. Of course, the police do not have the back-up to be able to put 24-hour coverage into such areas or to form a convoy. I do not want to paint a bleak picture, but that happens throughout society and is due to the change in how we deal with things as parents and as families. It is a major concern. At the back of everything that has been said, including by my hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire, is the fact that discipline is lacking in society, which has to be addressed. There are much bigger issues about how we deal with that.</p>
	<p>I have a nephew who is a bus driver for First Bus throughout the Midlothian area and in Edinburgh. Not all the buses have a cover to protect the driver. Not all the buses have a radio control frequency; then again, though, a radio control frequency will be helpful only after the event, not before. A man jumped on my nephew's bus, punched him across the jaw, very nearly broke his jaw and jumped back off the bus, all for no apparent reason. Bus drivers are so apprehensive nowadays that if there is a carry-on up the stairs, they will stop the bus and go, to try to get the person off. Back in your young days, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and in mine, if we were up the stairs as kids and were doing something wrong, the bus driver would come up, tell us off and that would be it. It is not like that now. A driver is apprehensive about whether he or she should go up and deal with it.</p>
	<p>Two areas of this discussion are really important, and I have seen that because I have been there. When I went to Craigmillar in the south part of Edinburgh, a rough area where major redevelopment is taking place, I saw the fire services coming in and being pelted, and I tried to intervene to stop people. It is kids who do that, and we need to ask why kids are out at 9, 10 or 11 o'clock at night.</p>
	<p>I come back to a core problem in society. That problem is about people taking responsibility. We should accept zero tolerance and individuals should be challenged, and families should be challenged, too. Maybe I was too hard on my two girls, and I have five grandkids now, but I do not understand why a 10 or 11-year-old should be out at midnight on a Friday or Saturday. To me, the parents have to be drawn into line. Many of the issues that we are talking about, such as the throwing of stones and so on, involve children. Discipline needs to be put forward.</p>
	<p>When we talk about the trade unions&mdash;I support many of the trade unions that are trying to do something on behalf of their members&mdash;we need to look at joined-up issues. Local authorities, health boards, fire authorities, police boards, local government and the Government, whether the Scottish Executive or the one in Westminster, should have strategy meetings to see how best to combat problems when dealing with people working with the public as part of an overall strategy. That would take care of public sector workers as well as people working with the public, and it would be a step towards meeting people's expectation that they can go to work and not be assaulted.</p>

	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for West Renfrewshire (Jim Sheridan) on securing the debate. The contributions made today suggest that we all agree that there are real issues and real problems to be addressed. To be honest, we are all groping for a solution.</p>
	<p>As the hon. Member for Midlothian (David Hamilton) said, we need a joined-up approach across several sectors, and although attacks in the workplace are a problem in both the public and the private sectors, they are a particular problem for people whose primary job is to interface with the public. The statistics for the total number of assaults in the workplace are appalling&mdash;we are talking about some 800,000 plus assaults. As the Minister will tell us, that figure is lower than previous figures. Nevertheless, 800,000 plus people a year facing assaults at work is unacceptable, even if a relatively small percentage of people have suffered assaults.</p>
	<p>It always enriches a debate when hon. Members can cite personal experience. I am glad to say that I do not have any personal experience to bring to the debate, but I was moved by the experiences of the hon. Member for East Lothian (Anne Picking), which make one wonder why people go into nursing if they have to face such treatment. Yet we know why people go into nursing: it is because they care, and they want to serve the community and give something back. They want to do that job. It is a huge and appalling irony that people whose prime work function and objective is to look after people who are mentally or physically sick face such aggression when they are trying to help others. That is simply unacceptable.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Midlothian mentioned people working in casualty departments. It can make one angry, when we are fighting a hard battle for health service funding and resources, that so many resources are used to deal with self-inflicted wounds brought about by drunkenness and aggravation, rather than being used to deal with genuine illness or accident, which is what the service is there for. We cannot, however, refuse to treat people or to take people in because they are drunk, although we must address the reasons why the problem arises.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Midlothian and I broadly disagree about ID cards, but I agree with him about their use in combating under-age drinking&mdash;indeed, I have actively encouraged that&mdash;in circumstances in which the landlord, the publican or the licence holder is obliged to require proof of age before serving someone. The local authority or agency should provide an ID card for people to produce in those circumstances. I have a different view about a national ID card and the data required for it, but ID cards clearly have a role to play, and I support their use in the context that I just described.</p>

	<p>There are several voluntary schemes. A scheme promoted by the council and the social services in Aberdeenshire and Moray enables young people to apply for such a card, which enables a publican to refuse to serve someone who does not have one. It is not the law, but the licence holder has the legal responsibility, and the legal right, to refuse to serve someone. Several publicans have told me that that is useful and that they wished the scheme was publicised more widely.</p>
	<p>The debate about ID cards and the role of identity is not black and white. There is clearly a role for them. We must all produce identity every day for various reasons. Indeed, we are required to produce ID to get into Parliament. Some longer-established Members may claim to find that irksome, but most of us fully understand the reasons for it and are happy to co-operate. I do not want to create dissent, because we agree about the practical role of ID cards.</p>
	<p>To return to the central subject of the debate, the Scottish Parliament is, as the hon. Member for East Lothian has said, struggling to some extent with the proposed measure for dealing with violence in the workplace, particularly with respect to public sector workers. I am sympathetic to the intervention made by the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) about the distinction between public and private, although I accept, having read an article in my local paper, <i>The Press and Journal</i> of Aberdeen, that there is a particularly serious problem in the public sector.</p>
	<p>The figures show that 67.9 per cent. of occupational injuries in the national health service in Scotland are the result of violence and aggression. That is a pretty appalling statistic. The figure for general practices and surgeries is 54.4 per cent., and among nurses and midwives it is 75.3 per cent. There is clearly a serious problem when the biggest risk of injury to people working in the health service is from violent assault by a patient rather than from an accident at work. That must clearly be tackled.</p>
	<p>I want to make a point that is, perhaps, philosophical, and a related practical point. I am not against exploring the possibility of a law. If the Scottish Parliament is pursuing that, I am interested, but it is interesting that it is encountering difficulty in formulating it correctly. However, we should not reach for the idea that we must pass a law and that will solve the problem. There is a cultural problem to be tackled.</p>
	<p>Assault is a criminal offence in any circumstances, so the law exists. People know that it is a criminal offence, but they still perpetrate assaults; that may be because they are drunk, angry, out of control and not thinking; it may be because they think that they will get away with it; or it may be because they are in some other way not engaged. I do not say that there is not a case for a law to protect public sector workers in particular, but it would be wrong to think that we could just pass a law and feel comforted, or even to think that passing a law would materially change the figures. We must change a society in which people feel that it is all right to behave in the way in question.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. We do not need to make a law when there is already a law for dealing with the issue. However, does he agree that it not so much the law that is the problem as the judiciary and magistrates? It must be extremely frustrating for police officers to go through the procedures of arresting and charging someone&mdash;particularly a young person&mdash;and doing all the paperwork, only to find that the offender is back on the street even before the officer concerned. The problem is not so much the law as its application, together with effective sentencing.</p>

	<p>Indeed, but that may be true of casualty departments all over the UK, and it is a sorry situation. To pick up the point about drinking and violence, which is a factor in the workplace too, I wonder whether, as part of the education programme, we might encourage publicans and landlords, and certainly those who have had problems with drunks coming out of their premises, to spend a night in a casualty department. They could see the consequences of serving people who are under age or beyond the point where they have drunk too much, and then letting them out on to the street. We require publicans and landlords to accept responsibility for not fuelling people with drink and then letting them out into situations in which they can cause problems.</p>
	<p>I have strayed slightly wide of the debate. We are talking about violence in the workplace and I should like, briefly and finally, to touch on the connection that there can be between a climate of bullying and violence. Bullying is not violence, but it can lead to a climate of violence. An employer who uses bullying-style tactics can create an environment in which violence is likely to occur, not necessarily between employer and employee but among frustrated employees. We have to recognise that bullying is an issue in the workplace. Clearly, responsible employers will take the view that they should be aware of behaviour that might lead to violence in their workplace, and be prepared to act on it.</p>
	<p>I totally accept that, although not all workplaces are unionised and not all people are members of trade unions, that is the sort of issue with which the trade union movement has a long and reputable history of engagement. Their approach is to say, &quot;We want employers to understand our problems and to address them, but we will accept responsibility also for engaging with our members to ensure that they understand their responsibilities.&quot; There are two issues: violence between the public and people in their workplace, and violence between employees. Both are serious.</p>
	<p>I hope that all of us believe effective, efficient, consumer-friendly, compassionate public services are an essential facet of a civilised society and central to the political debate. We have been talking for years about resources for health and education&mdash;smaller classes, more teachers, more doctors and more nurses&mdash;so that we can have a better ratio between the public and those who serve them. All that is designed to create a better interface and, one hopes, might have contributed a little to the reduction in the number of violent incidents. Nevertheless, if we want to recruit people to be nurses, teachers, doctors and social workers&mdash;to serve society&mdash;we have an obligation to protect them from violence in the workplace. That is partly because it is right&mdash;people should not be subjected to violence, and we should do all we can to lower the incidence&mdash;and partly for the practical reason, as I said by implication to the hon. Member for East Lothian, that if we cannot do it and people feel that by taking up those professions they will put themselves in situations in which they might suffer, we will not get people to do the jobs. The hon. Member for West Renfrewshire has done us a great service by initiating this debate, and I welcome that and thank him for it.</p>

	<p>I, too, heartily congratulate the hon. Member for West Renfrewshire (Jim Sheridan) on having initiated the debate. We have had some excellent contributions and heard recounted some first-hand experiences. I must declare my interest as a director of a retail outlet; that may explain my somewhat biased attitude toward shop workers. Although director of a retail outlet may sound grand, it is a family business in which I have spent most of my time on the shop floor dealing with members of the public. In such a situation, one is open to whoever should come through the door in whatever state they may be. Dealing with the public is a difficult job.</p>
	<p>People, perhaps, do not properly understand how the problem starts with a culture of abuse toward those people who serve us, which may be due to frustration or other reasons. Members of Parliament probably find the public more ready to abuse us straight away, without first bringing their complaints in a more civilised manner. If only people knew that they would be more likely to get a better result if they were to treat public service workers, shop workers, and even Members of Parliament in a more civilised way.</p>

	<p>The hon. Lady is absolutely right. I should declare another bias: my wife was a teacher. I remember that once when she was pregnant she was tripped up maliciously and fell down. Nobody particularly thought that that should be regarded as an incident; it was just one of those things that happens. I was not best pleased, but Members will be happy to know that I usually bow to my wife in everything.</p>
	<p>It seems to me that these incidents are increasing. The Minister might have some statistics with regard to what the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) said, but I think that there is a perception that there is an increase. It may be the case that fewer people than in the past are now technically in public service, but attacks seem to be more violent and not just confined to one area&mdash;they occur throughout the country.</p>
	<p>Members of the nursing profession, and doctors and ancillary workers within the health service, face very serious violence. I cannot understand that, but the hon. Member for East Lothian (Anne Picking) described it very clearly, and I know it happens. That is appalling. I am also aware of the experiences of bus drivers and transport workers. When I speak to bus drivers, they tell me that the time they fear most is when the schools finish for the day, which is a great worry. Before I looked into this matter, I naively thought that the time they would fear most would be late at night, but far from it.</p>
	<p>We might be able to tackle that problem that arises when the schools finish a little more easily than some others. A bus driver I know told me about something that happened to him when he was driving during the day near Shepherd's Bush. A smart-looking car cut him up. He just stopped the bus&mdash;he didn't hoot his horn or do anything else like that&mdash;and the driver of the car climbed out and approached him. The bus driver wound down his window, and the driver of the car hit him straight in the face, breaking his nose, and then drove off. That happened in the middle of the day. I am afraid that that is where some sections of society seem to have got to. There is a lot of frustration in some jobs.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman is right on both counts.</p>
	<p>The point about letting parents see what is going on leads me on to something that I have always thought would be helpful, particularly from my viewpoint from behind the counter, as it were. If more people had served the public and seen the public in action, they would probably be a little more sympathetic in their dealings with public service workers and shop assistants. It is necessary to spend some time on the other side of the fence in order to realise how awkward, difficult and unpleasant people can be.</p>
	<p>In the past, violence in the workplace sometimes arose out of industrial problems, although I am pleased to say that that is very rare now. We have only to look back to the miners strike to see that serious violence can arise at certain times. Happily, I think that those days of real confrontation have gone, and that is to the credit of all sides involved.</p>
	<p>There are more subtle pressures, and the hon. Gentleman talked about bullying. Racial bullying can lead to violence. Often, the frustration of the person being bullied eventually boils over and leads to violence in the workplace, and that is where management has a strong role to play by monitoring and ensuring that those incidents do not happen. It is important to recognise that within the workplace there are traditions that must be eradicated&mdash;a macho tradition in some cases. As I have said before, employers have a duty of care. Although they cannot shoulder the burden of fighting lawlessness on their own, they have a responsibility to provide reasonable external security against intruders&mdash;however regrettable that might seem in a civilised society. Unfortunately it seems to be a fact of life. Employers have a duty to ensure that women do not work singly and in potentially difficult environments, and they also have a duty to provide adequate back-up to those staff who are exposed on the front line.</p>
	<p>As the hon. Gentleman said, training people to handle violent incidents with the minimum of counter-force is extremely relevant. We have to recognise that more training must be done by management. There are ways of trying to calm people down, although not necessarily when they are fuelled with alcohol or drugs, as that must create a very difficult situation.</p>
	<p>As we have heard, the problem under discussion reflects a wider malaise in society. The fact that we see security personnel in hospitals, shops, all sorts of other places and even schools reflects something about which we must all be worried&mdash;the culture of violent confrontation. I see it on my television screen much more than I used to. People are growing up with the idea that the way to settle an argument is to shout loudly, and eventually that will lead to violence. We all have a responsibility to try to stop that, and we have to clamp down on it. The police must respond and they must have the resources.</p>
	<p>This is so easy to say, and I am sure that we all say it, however discipline and the respect for&mdash;not deference to&mdash;authority must start in school and in the home. I am not sure how we achieve it and I am not sure that we can legislate for it, but we must all work hard to do so. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on giving us an opportunity to discuss the problem, and I hope that we can return to the subject to see how we are doing.</p>

	<p>I confess that after yesterday's business, the prospect of an hour and a half's Adjournment debate this morning did not exactly fill me with joy. Having listened to the debate, however, I think it has been one of the best I have been at for a while. It has raised an important issue, which has been addressed in a practical and thoughtful way by all Members. I hope that I can add something to it, because I have thought about this issue for some time. It is an important area to be concerned about.</p>
	<p>I thank in particular my hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire (Jim Sheridan) for raising the issue. He has a good record of raising issues of concern to people in the workplace. He had a private Member's Bill on protecting people who have been exploited by gangmasters, which links to this morning's agenda of ensuring that people can go about their day-to-day work without fear of harassment, alarm, distress or violence.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend mentioned the work of a range of trade unions: the Transport and General Workers Union, GMB, Unison and the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers. All trade unions are concerned that workers should be protected and able to go about their lawful business.</p>
	<p>Various hon. Members have raised specific groups of workers, including shop workers, firefighters and other emergency personnel. I will comment on those issues, but first I want to deal head-on with whether a new offence is needed and whether the law should be changed. Consultation is going on in Scotland, and I have thought about the issue quite deeply. My starting point is that the existing criminal law should usually be applied to people who commit offences of violence, whether that is assault, wounding, grievous bodily harm, violent disorder or affray. There is a framework in the existing criminal law to deal with various levels of violence. I am reluctant to go down the path of a specific offence for public sector or emergency workers, because there would be difficulties in defining people in a way that allowed us to tackle the mischief that we are trying to tackle. A specific offence could be too rigid. People might fall just outside the boundary, and then we would then have a legal system that was unfair to different sets of workers.</p>
	<p>The right approach is the one that we have taken recently. Perhaps hon. Members are not fully aware of it and it is not yet making an impact in the courts, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire said. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 established the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which is charged with drafting and distributing consolidated sentencing guidelines applicable throughout all criminal courts in England and Wales. The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure consistency&mdash;the exact point raised&mdash;and to require the courts to take account of all the relevant aggravating or mitigating features of a case. The council has issued guidelines on determining the seriousness of an offence, which refer explicitly to the fact that a victim was at the time of the offence providing a service to the public as being an aggravating feature. That is a better definition than referring to a public sector or emergency worker, because we may be talking about people working in shops or in a privatised transport undertaking. If such people are subject to assault, grievous bodily harm, violent disorder or affray while providing a service to the public, that should be an aggravating factor when the case comes before the courts, and the penalty should be more serious.</p>

	<p>I shall not mention the miners strike; it was unfortunate that the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) made a digression on that.</p>
	<p>How will the message outlined by the Minister translate to the public? It will be some time before cases go through the courts, but the public must be made aware now that zero tolerance is the issue. I travelled on a bus in Nevada last year, and there was a big sign on every bus there saying that there would be a $1,000 fine for any assault on a driver. The public there know right away that they will be treated harshly if they assault a driver. Judging by the Minister's description of our system, however, it will take some time for the message to filter through to the public.</p>

	<p>In fact, violent crime has fallen dramatically&mdash;by about 30 per cent. in the last few years&mdash;and the figures are now relatively stable. I was saying that 9 per cent. more of those who are convicted now receive a custodial sentence, when they might previously have been given a conditional discharge or a suspended sentence.</p>
	<p>The courts are taking the matter more seriously. However, I think that my hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire was right: we need to ensure that magistrates are fully aware of aggravating circumstances. It has long been a passion of mine that magistrates should come from a wider cross-section of the community. Many magistrates do a sterling job, but I know that in my area they tend to come from the more affluent and better-off parts of the community. Rarely do they come from the inner city where many of the problems of crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour happen. The Department for Constitutional Affairs is running a big campaign to try to recruit more locally based magistrates. That would certainly help us to get issues of this kind taken more seriously by the courts.</p>
	<p>As well as levying punishments on those involved in violence, it is important also to engage in preventative work; it should be everyone's aim that no one is assaulted at work. Enforcement by the police is important, but we must work with the Health and Safety Executive and companies to train and to spread good practice. The HSE has been running a three-year work programme to try to reduce the incidence of violence at work, and it has commissioned research to find examples of good practice. That research is now on its website and is being made available to industry.</p>
	<p>The HSE has funded the development of new national occupational standards in the management of workplace-related violence. Those standards are aimed particularly at small businesses, which often find it difficult to deal with such issues, perhaps because they do not have the management infrastructure of larger companies. It is obviously important to help small and medium-sized enterprises as well as large ones.</p>
	<p>Work is also being done on protecting people who work alone. The one person working in the late-night corner shop is particularly vulnerable. We must ensure that premises are designed in a way that minimises the prospect of people being assaulted, including the installation of closed circuit television, alarm systems, and radio networks so that people can call for immediate support. Such things can be designed into premises from the beginning.</p>
	<p>We are also supporting a range of retail and business crime partnerships; 100 are already established, and we are working to set up another 100. Last week, I visited the Dudley partnership in Halesowen. It has a tremendous scheme in its shopping centre; photographs of known prolific offenders are circulated to a network of all staff, so that they can warn each other that one of those persons is in the shopping centre and might come into their shop. People can thus be prepared and take action in anticipation. Those partnerships enable people to help themselves, but they also allow them to call for immediate help&mdash;from a security guard in the shopping centre, from the local police, and increasingly from the community support officers who patrol such areas.</p>

	<p>I say two things to the hon. Gentleman. The staff in the Dudley partnership to whom I spoke felt very able to tackle such people. They did it politely and firmly, and found that, overwhelmingly, people simply left the premises. The staff felt that they were well supported, as they could call on security staff, the police and community support officers. People who were subject to an exclusion order did not need to commit a crime but could simply be excluded, and the staff felt that the system worked extremely well.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Anne Picking) graphically set out in a moving speech the problems in the health service. It is an irony of the worst kind that people who dedicate their lives to caring for others should far too often be on the receiving end of abuse and violence. Several Members discussed the links between alcohol and binge drinking and the way in which people, particularly those who work in the NHS, are subjected to violence. Our research shows that about half of violent crime is linked to alcohol and that some 70 per cent. of accident and emergency visits at the weekend between midnight and 5 am are the result of alcohol. That is the reason for our massive campaign to tackle binge drinking.</p>
	<p>The police have undertaken two big enforcement campaigns this year and have issued fixed penalty notices under their powers to disperse groups and close premises. The Government have just issued a consultation document on the possibility of setting up alcohol disorder zones in which the industry will have to make a contribution towards the cost of dealing with crime and disorder, and we are consulting on banning orders under which people who deliberately go out to drink to excess and then become violent could be banned for a period from drinking in a vicinity. Such issues must be tackled urgently.</p>
	<p>I was struck by the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (David Hamilton) about the American experience. He mentioned a bar that the police could walk in and immediately close. That is exactly the kind of power that we seek to obtain. Such short, sharp intervention really does concentrate minds and can start to change behaviour in the long term. There is almost nothing more important to us at present than tackling the binge drinking that has become the blight of many of our town and city centres.</p>

	<p>Policing and enforcement is a devolved matter in Scotland, but I have detailed discussions and a good relationship with the Scottish Ministers on these issues. I saw in the Scottish newspapers today that Scotland is as exercised about the problems of binge drinking as England and Wales are. We can share our good practice, particularly the enforcement campaigns that our police have run, which have been innovative. They used the whole range of fixed penalty notice powers to deliver on-the-spot, short, sharp shocks. I am perfectly happy to share the information and good practice that we have developed from that experience.</p>
	<p>The British crime survey shows that there has been a fall in the number of incidents of workplace-related violence in England and Wales. It was 1.3 million in 1999 and is down to 850,000. That fall is significant, but we certainly are not complacent. We must work hard to maintain the downward trend.</p>
	<p>Various initiatives involve working with employers; for example, training programmes. Workplace inspections that are targeted at NHS trusts and nursing homes can be useful. Inspectors can go in and determine what procedures are in place to minimise the chance of violence happening. There is improved advice and information for health and safety inspectors, and a specific project with the railway industry that involves targeted investigations of known areas of weakness. My hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire discussed the important contribution of the British Transport police, who do some excellent work in this area. Railway workers, like bus workers, are particularly vulnerable to assault.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Lyons) raised issues around fire and ambulance staff. One of the saddest things in our society is that firefighters who turn up to save lives are abused and sometimes stoned by children as young as seven, eight or nine years old. That is symptomatic of the wider malaise&mdash;the breakdown in decency and standards of behaviour&mdash;that all hon. Members have raised.</p>
	<p>I know that, in many areas, the fire service has started to run projects. It runs one in my community, where the firefighters work with young people to try to get some discipline back into how they behave. Some projects have been incredibly successful. There are junior firefighters, aged 10, 11 and 12 years old, who now appreciate what the fire service is trying to do. They understand that it is saving lives and that it could save the lives of their own families, and they are much less likely to abuse firefighters in the way that happened previously.</p>
	<p>I recently visited a project in south London, where the fire service is helping some of our most difficult young people. The fact that it is a uniformed service, but that its members are not the police has given the firefighters a real relationship with some of those young people. They have ended up mentoring them and trying to show them a different way of life. However, it is a pretty sad state of affairs when our fire service finds itself having to do that to counter the violence that is raised against it.</p>
	<p>I want to raise the issue of antisocial behaviour because everything that we have been talking about falls very much in that category. One of the things that I have been working on with USDAW, in relation to &quot;freedom from fear&quot;, is trying to get authorities to use antisocial behaviour orders in those circumstances. They can be the most useful tool. If an antisocial behaviour order that excludes or restricts people from going into a shopping centre or a medical facility, such as a hospital or a GP's practice, is breached, that can carry a custodial sentence. That can be a useful tool for reducing violence. In addition, the dispersal orders available under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 have been used 400 times since they were brought in. They can bring calm and peace to an area that is out of control. We also now have parenting orders. It is important to try to ensure that parents are involved and take responsibility for the behaviour of their children. If parenting orders can be attached to antisocial behaviour orders, it is a criminal offence if they are breached. Using the whole range of powers available to the police and local authorities to tackle antisocial behaviour is really important.</p>
	<p>I appreciate the concern of the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) on these issues. The way that he expressed that concern was heartfelt. He said that we must make a cultural change in our society. I am not making a party political point, but, yet again, I feel that the Liberal Democrats will an end&mdash;a better society&mdash;but are not prepared to will the means. Those means must include using antisocial behaviour powers and saying, &quot;These are the norms of behaviour we expect in our society and if you transgress them, there will be sanctions. There are boundaries, and there are consequences to your actions.&quot; One of the reasons why we have a breakdown in decency in our society is because people do not feel that there will be any consequences to their actions and some people feel that they are untouchable by the authorities. That must end. We are making huge inroads into that and have seen a massive expansion in the use of antisocial behaviour powers. I really wish that Members who want to see a better society would also be prepared to support some of the tools that we have put on the statute book for the police and local authorities to use.</p>

	<p>As the Minister knows, our home affairs spokesman has modified his position on that, and that is fine and good. My point about the cultural change, however, is that we must get at the root cause of why people are behaving as they are and change their behaviour patterns. With the greatest respect to the Minister, whatever the role of antisocial behaviour orders, they do not do that. They are a sanction. We must go into the issue more deeply and ask why people feel that they can behave as they do. There is a whole variety of measures, for which we could probably get cross-party support, that would deliver results. There are good examples. As the Minister will know, my noble Friend, Baroness Linklater has introduced a number of radical proposals, which I hope the Government will consider.</p>

	<p>I am afraid that that picture is still too widespread. Many authorities are using the powers, but my message to others is that they are responsible to the communities that they serve. The powers are on the statute book, and we have to use them to make a difference.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian raised important issues concerning ID cards and the idea of people not being able to obtain alcohol without proof of age. I am absolutely committed to ensuring that we have a good, robust framework in place. It will be a couple of years before we have the formal ID cards with biometric identifiers, but even now there is a lot more we can do to ensure that young people produce a driving licence, a passport or a pass card&mdash;an officially approved proof-of-age card with a hologram on it, which makes it difficult to forge.</p>
	<p>We need a big campaign that will start to change the whole culture so that young people expect to be challenged when they want to buy alcohol. No ID should mean no sale, which will help to protect many people serving in shops and ensure that alcohol does not get into the hands of very young people, which leads to some of the problems we see now. I am working actively on that with the industry to ensure that we have a big publicity campaign of the sort described by my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian. If we change the balance so that people expect to be challenged, we will be able to minimise the violence that goes on.</p>
	<p>We are tackling not just antisocial behaviour but prolific offenders. Many of the people who undertake violence against people in the workplace would fall into our category of prolific offenders, and a huge amount of our work is focused on three strands: trying to deter and prevent prolific offenders, catching and convicting them when they are offending, and resettling and rehabilitating them when they come out of custody. Breaking the cycle of violent crime is very important.</p>
	<p>The debate has been tremendous. It has certainly re-energised me to ensure that I get my officials to focus on some of the issues. My hon. Friend the Member for West Renfrewshire raised some detailed issues, particularly in relation to transport. I have not been in a position to respond to him about those today, but I have asked my officials to liaise with other Departments where necessary, and I would be more than happy to write to him in detail to deal with the specific issues he raised.</p>

	<p>The conditions that can be put in an antisocial behaviour order are designed to prevent the particular behaviour from happening in future, and those restrictions can cover a whole range of issues. I see no reason why some conditions could not be specifically aimed at the sort of violence that takes place in schools in order to restrict it. ASBOs are being used in fairly imaginative ways, and I am delighted about that. They have been used to exclude certain people from hospitals, and used in a similar way in shopping areas. I see no reason why we could not use some conditions&mdash;not necessarily exclusion, because we want young people to go to school&mdash;to deal with behaviour in school, which may well help teachers.</p>
	<p>I say to the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) that we have police officers working in a number of secondary schools who are part of the education team. Where those police officers are working closely with head teachers, teachers and children, they are building relationships and starting to get decent behaviour back into schools, because the police officer is now respected a respected figure of authority. Getting some figures of authority back into our communities is absolutely vital. Far too many were stripped out in the name of efficiency in years gone by. Getting inspectors, park rangers, wardens, and community support officers out there, and saying what the norms of behaviour are, should help to tackle some of the important issues raised by hon. Members today.</p>

	<p>I am delighted to have secured the opportunity to speak today about a question to which I have been trying to get a clear answer for four years, and I am grateful to the Minister for attending the debate to answer the concerns of my constituents who belong to the port of Liverpool police. I hope that he will be able to help my constituents to resolve their inequitable situation. I am delighted that, after trying for many years, we have a Minister present who is willing to answer for the employment rights of the port of Liverpool police.</p>
	<p>Despite the efforts of the police officers of the port of Liverpool in contacting their Members of Parliament, attending meetings, filing a joint case to an employment tribunal, and contacting Ministers, they have been unable to make any headway on the issue of their employment rights. I start by paying tribute to their efforts, because their dedication and determination to achieve appropriate redress has been second to none. I hope that the Minister and other Members will join me in praising those efforts.</p>
	<p>In order to understand the situation of the port police officers fully, it is necessary to provide some background information. The port of Liverpool police is a non-Home Office police force funded by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. The force was founded in 1974 to provide dedicated police cover for the port of Liverpool. It is constituted in the Mersey Docks and Harbour (Police) Order 1975. It has identical legislative powers to those of any other police force in the geographical area of the port, plus special powers granted by the port of Liverpool's byelaws. However, despite the responsibility and risk that the officers of the port of Liverpool police face, it is not a force covered by the police Acts.</p>
	<p>As a result, its officers are not afforded the same protection as Home Office police forces if they have a grievance against their employer. If a port of Liverpool police officer has an employment grievance, there is an internal investigation of the complaint. The case is then referred to a port superintendent, on to the port's chief officer and finally to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company police committee. No external redress is available to port police officers.</p>
	<p>It is possible that the Minister believes that external redress exists in the form of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company police committee. However, that committee is chaired by the chief executive of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. The committee does have some external representation, but it could hardly be called independent of the owning company&mdash;the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company&mdash;against which individuals may have a legitimate grievance. By comparison, a Home Office police officer who has an employment grievance would have access to internal redress in their force. They would then have a right of appeal to the Home Secretary, a tribunal, the divisional court&mdash;if the matter was about a point of law&mdash;and, finally, the House of Lords.</p>
	<p>Port of Liverpool police officers do not have access to a union. As with other police forces, a federation exists to represent their views, but since the port police is a smaller force, the federation has no funding, no office space and no paid officials. It is extremely difficult for a port police officer to access advice and achieve appropriate redress.</p>
	<p>I am sure that hon. Members will be surprised to learn that, despite the port of Liverpool police having been refused the routes of external redress offered to other police officers, when it appealed to an employment tribunal, that appeal channel was refused. On 8 March 2002, the decision of the employment tribunal in the cases of 18 police officers of the Port of Liverpool v. the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company was that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;All of the applicants were employed under contracts of employment in police service and accordingly their claims are dismissed.&quot;</p>
	<p>The tribunal cited section 200 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, in which it is stated that the Act does</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;not apply to employment under a contract of employment in police service or to persons engaged in such service.&quot;</p>
	<p>That section of the law applies because the port of Liverpool police was constituted by an enactment in the 1975 order that brought it into being.</p>
	<p>So there exists an anomaly whereby the officers of the port of Liverpool police are not covered by the police Acts and do not have recourse to an industrial tribunal. They are left at the mercy of their employer, as they have no access to an external independent tribunal. The grievances that the port police officers have tried to raise include claims of unfair dismissal, unfair pension agreements and unfair treatment over sick leave. When injured, some of them have not been able to claim sick pay, and they have been suspended without pay or threatened with dismissal. They are being exploited, and we have not been able to help them, since no one will take responsibility for their employment rights.</p>
	<p>The men involved in that case and their families have   tried to seek redress via all appropriate means. They have pursued their employment grievances appropriately through the internal system. They made attempts to seek redress as police officers, and once that was refused they attempted to seek redress through the employment tribunal system as members of the public.</p>
	<p>Those men have sought legal advice and taken out joint legal insurance to provide quality advice equally to all port police officers who signed up to it. When all their personal efforts failed, they contacted their Members of Parliament and Ministers, and I am ashamed to say that we have not managed to achieve anything on their behalf. In August 2001 I met my hon. Friend the Member for Bootle (Mr. Benton) and the then Home Office Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham). We were informed that the port of Liverpool police fell under the auspices of the then Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. My right hon. Friend the then Minister replied stating that the Department's remit covered legislation relating to the port police, but did</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;not extend to the employment terms and conditions of port police officers.&quot;</p>
	<p>A little frustrated, I sought clarification from the then Leader of the House of Commons, my right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). He assured me that the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions was undertaking a review of the powers, duties and standards of the port police forces. Unfortunately, that review appears to have done nothing to improve the situation of the port police officers. Along with several colleagues I sought further meetings with Ministers, and in 2004 I received assurances from the Home Office that the Green Paper &quot;Policing: Building Safer Communities Together&quot; would explore whether anything could be done to help to rationalise small specialist forces such as the port of Liverpool police. Again, despite that assurance, the Police Reform Act 2002 and the 2004 White Paper &quot;Building Communities, Beating Crime&quot; have not addressed port police. It would appear that no Department will take responsibility for the employment rights of the port police officers, yet we are happy to receive their protection. That is unacceptable.</p>
	<p>On 10 February 2004, the Minister responsible responded to the complaints of one of my constituents by referring to the circulation of a ports police discussion paper. The paper was supposed to have been circulated before the Minister sent the letter. When my office tried to obtain the paper over a year after the letter was sent, we were told that it was still in draft form. I hope to receive a copy of the paper from the Department for Transport after this debate. That is typical of the evasive way that this issue has been dealt with. There is no clear information available, and Ministers have avoided this sticky and exceptional problem for far too long.</p>
	<p>So far, all that my constituents have gained from their active engagement with the Government is the knowledge that the Department for Transport has legislative control of their police force, but it does not have any duty regarding the day-to-day operations of the police or their employment conditions. That knowledge has achieved nothing. Despite numerous reviews and consultations, if the port of Liverpool police officers have a grievance, they are still at the mercy of their employer. I would like the Minister to address the questions of why no Department has taken responsibility for that situation and why there is still no external accountability procedure for the grievances of the port of Liverpool police officers. They find themselves in the invidious position of neither being in the care of the police nor having access to the legitimate rights of normal employees.</p>
	<p>The employment rights of the port of Liverpool police leaves much to be desired, and yet, as I mentioned at the start of my speech, under legislation they have the same powers within the port as any other police force in the country. The nature of the crimes that they face has escalated from petty theft to serious organised crime, illegal immigration and a potential terrorist attack. I am sure that I do not need to remind Members that 37 port police officers were killed in the terrorist attacks on New York in September 2001.</p>
	<p>Port police officers are as vulnerable to serious organised crime as any other police officers. Some would say that the port police are even more vulnerable, as they patrol our borders. Port police officers who have complaints should be treated with fairness and respect, as is fitting for those who risk their lives in order to protect ours. Does the Minister agree that port security is vital for national security, and that the role of the port of Liverpool police is therefore very important?</p>
	<p>Finally, what will the Minister do to ensure that the discrepancy between the grievance procedures for police forces and for the port of Liverpool police is harmonised? As matters stand, their procedure is unfair, and, despite the best efforts of the officers concerned, we have not rectified that disparity in five years of continuous struggle. I ask the Minister to assure my constituents that he, as a Minister with responsibility for transport, will take personal responsibility for this, and that he will ensure that in future they will be treated with the fairness that they have earned through their service to this country.</p>

	<p>I shall be brief, as my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) has covered the ground very fully. I congratulate her on securing the debate, and on the comprehensive and lucid way in which she introduced the subject.</p>
	<p>I have with me a letter from a constituent of mine, Mr. David Hayes. He is a former port of Liverpool police officer who lives in Aintree. In his letter, he sets out his dilemma and that of his colleagues, and he puts it in context:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;On the advice of local Members of Parliament we applied for a hearing at an Employment Tribunal and a pre trial hearing was held at the Employment Tribunal Offices in Liverpool to decide if they could hear our case. Unfortunately the Tribunal decided that they could not hear our case under Section 200 subsection 2(a) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 which states 'section 137 do not apply to employment under a contract of employment in police service or to persons engaged in such service'.&quot;</p>
	<p>It then goes on to define what &quot;police service&quot; means.</p>
	<p>The fact of the matter is that, for purposes of central Government, these men are not treated as police officers. For normal serving police officers, there is an appeal procedure for grievances that can go all the way up to the Home Secretary. That procedure does not apply for these men, but when they go to a tribunal in order to determine whether they are covered by other legislation, they are told that they are not because they have the title of &quot;police.&quot;</p>
	<p>I realise that the Minister and the Government face a conundrum in how to deal with this matter, but I echo what my hon. Friend said: if these men are not policemen, but they are called policemen and are thereby denied the right to go through a tribunal process in the same way that people in any other form of employment would be, there is a gap that needs to be closed. I am relaxed about whether it is closed by my hon. Friend the Minister, the Home Office, or the Department of Trade and Industry, but I hope that Ministers from all three Departments will put their heads together, decide who is going to do it, and then get on with it.</p>

	<p>I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) on raising the employment rights of the port of Liverpool police, and on making her points with her customary thoroughness and courtesy. My hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) succinctly put his points on behalf of his constituents. I am also pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Bootle (Mr. Benton) is present; he has taken a great interest in these matters.</p>
	<p>The port of Liverpool is one of the United Kingdom's top 20 ports. In 2003, it handled almost 32 million tonnes of traffic, which is more than either Felixstowe or Dover. I am told that the total tonnage of cargo passing through the port is at an all-time high&mdash;higher, even, than in the port's heyday in the 19th century. The volume of traffic continues to grow, so the port is a major contributor to the renewed vitality of Merseyside. My hon. Friend the Member for Crosby is to be congratulated on having such a successful port in her constituency. The port, which is owned and operated by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, is responding to new growth. In the past five years, it has invested more than &pound;100 million, including &pound;25 million on expanding and upgrading the Seaforth container terminal in which my hon. Friend has had a considerable interest. She will know that we have been given notice of an application for the further extension of the terminal, and are about to give our opinion on the environmental information that must accompany the application for the order.</p>
	<p>The port activities of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company are well known, but it is also a direct employer of the port of Liverpool police force, which was established under the Mersey Docks and Harbour (Police) Order 1975. The order provides for the appointment of constables, with powers, within the port of Liverpool and one mile of its limits. It also provides for the establishment of a port of Liverpool police federation to represent the interests of the appointed constables</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;in all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency&quot;.</p>
	<p>Port of Liverpool police officers are employees of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. The port police forces are established under section 79 of the Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act 1847 or, as in the case of Liverpool, the incorporation of a similar section into their own legislation by way of the Mersey Docks and Harbour (Police) Order 1975.</p>
	<p>As announced in our policy paper &quot;Modern Ports: A UK policy&quot;, we have carried out an initial review of the arrangements for port police in England and Wales. The review has examined the powers, duties and accountability of port police forces. It has not, however, considered the employment terms and conditions of individual forces or officers. Indeed, it never intended to do so, as terms and conditions of employment are not a matter for my Department.</p>
	<p>Our draft discussion paper on the accountability and standards of the port police forces was circulated in 2003 to the association of port police chief officers and the Home Office. We learnt during that exercise that other initiatives in play had the potential to have an impact on our own work and would therefore have delayed action until their outcomes were known.</p>

	<p>I return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) about the Department's not being responsible. The Minister will recall that, I think it was in 2002, my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) and I met him. It comes as a surprise to discover this morning that the Department for Transport has no responsibility in that regard, because that was the main thrust of that meeting.</p>

	<p>I recall that meeting. At the time we were talking about our review. However, conditions of employment are, ultimately, matters for the DTI.</p>
	<p>The Association of Chief Police Officers port group has launched its own review of port policing, with the aim of ensuring that port police forces are fully integrated into the national policing structure. It has drawn on our initial discussion paper and we, in turn, want to ensure that any conclusions from our paper are take into account. Once the outcomes of the other initiatives are known, we will decide whether the outstanding issues merit our proceeding with the planned full consultation on ports policing.</p>
	<p>We recognise that port police forces such as that in Liverpool have an important role to play in the security of ports. I concur with what my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby said on that. I am pleased to say that the port of Liverpool successfully met the deadline of 1 July 2004 for implementing the international ship and port facility security code. The port of Liverpool is a diverse operation, so the challenge of complying with the new security requirements was significant, and port employees deserve every credit for their efforts in securing that compliance.</p>
	<p>The ports police unit typified the commitment of the port of Liverpool, and was at the forefront of implementing the ISPS security measures. That proactive approach has continued beyond 1 July 2004, and the ports police and the port are participating in a pilot project to determine whether the multi-agency threat and risk assessment programme, which has been successfully rolled out for airports, is relevant to the maritime sector.</p>

	<p>I am delighted to have at long last secured this debate on the operation of police Tetra masts in Sussex, having applied fairly consistently since November. I am also delighted to see many of my hon. Friends from West Sussex here today, whom I know will all try to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, so as to raise their own constituency problems on the issue.</p>
	<p>I am delighted to welcome my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring), who is something of an expert on the subject and will be speaking from the Conservative Front Bench. I am particularly delighted, although slightly bemused, to welcome also the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration. One always gets one's money's worth when he replies to a debate.</p>
	<p>This subject has been raised in assorted Adjournment debates over the past few years. For the uninitiated, Tetra is terrestrial trunked radio&mdash;the emergency services communication system that is being rolled out across the United Kingdom. About 3,000 masts are commissioned and operational, with another 300 or so under construction. It is anticipated that the network will be completed shortly, with about 3,300 masts in total, and that it will go live at some stage in the next year. It has so far been costed at &pound;2.9 billion, and as such it will be the biggest IT overhaul that the police have ever had to manage.</p>
	<p>It is reasonable to suggest that the Tetra system should therefore have been subject to the most rigorous consultation with our constituents, whom the system aims to protect more efficiently and who will ultimately, of course, pay the bills. In the case of the masts in Sussex, especially in West Sussex, the consultation and the sensitivities to the concerns of local people have been deafening by their silence.</p>
	<p>I do not pretend to be a scientist and I do not know whether the Tetra system is the best possible system available or whether it will do the job that the police need it to do to justify the &pound;2.9 billion bill. People have said that an alternative system such as Tetrapol, which is used on the continent, would be more efficient and would require only 21 base stations in the whole south-east region whereas the Tetra system requires many more masts&mdash;in excess of 150 more than the whole Tetrapol system would require across the country.</p>
	<p>As I say, I am not a scientist. I rely on the Home Office and the knowledge of the commissioning police authority to ensure that the right decisions are taken.</p>

	<p>I certainly welcome the extension of the debate to the wilds of Gloucestershire. The hon. Gentleman's contribution, with which I wholeheartedly agree, is welcome. The problem is that we do not have the definitive information that we are entitled to so as to make informed decisions on behalf of our constituents, and neither do they. A study of the sort that he mentions has not been forthcoming, and certainly not in such a form that we can respond with value judgments.</p>
	<p>I do not know whether the emissions from the masts or the handsets pose any threat to health. Is this really not a pulsed system, as some have claimed, and what would it mean for health if it were? I am not particularly reassured when supposed experts admit that they could not guarantee the safety of the system and that it would be at least five to six years into operation before we had sufficient evidence to make a proper judgment. Experts are seeking additional funding of some &pound;300,000 from the Government to conduct research on the likely effect of Tetra on children, some of the most vulnerable people in our communities.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, as the debate travels ever further westwards, although I hope that, in terms of substance, it will not go west. I was in his constituency a little while ago, and certain people expressed to me the fears that he outlines. Interestingly, I saw more masts than police officers in his constituency.</p>
	<p>To bring the debate back to the south coast, I see that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper) wants to intervene.</p>

	<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for that contribution. He, too, makes a valid point: the Stewart report was indeed produced some years ago and it suggested adopting the precautionary principle, although it dealt with conventional mobile phone masts and certainly did not concentrate on Tetra masts, which are the subject of the debate. As I shall discuss in a moment, there is a plethora of different supposed studies, which may or may not have been commissioned by the Government. They are confusing, conflicting and, in any case, incomplete. We need a definitive study to reassure our constituents and to give them back the confidence to believe that the issue is being properly considered and that conclusions will be acted on. The hon. Gentleman's point is therefore absolutely right.</p>
	<p>I am concerned when I hear that residents in several parts of Wales, although not necessarily in Montgomeryshire, are being asked to keep health diaries and fill in questionnaires about the perceived effect of mast transmissions on their health. I am concerned when certain local authorities are worried enough to use local council tax payers' money to commission local studies on the possible dangers of masts.</p>
	<p>I am also concerned when I hear that Birmingham city council is particularly worried about the proliferation of Tetra masts and is, quite rightly, considering hardening its policy on the siting of masts. I am concerned when I read of surveys commissioned by police constabularies whose work forces use Tetra and which are raising cases of illness among users. Again, we do not get the definitive link between the radios, the masts and the work force, but if there is sufficient concern to warrant these studies there may be some basis to that concern.</p>
	<p>All that is partly anecdotal and third hand, but when I see the results of a survey carried out in my constituency by residents living within 250 m of an operating Tetra mast, I tend to take a rather closer interest and become more anxious. Out of a sample of 448 people surveyed by residents since a mast was switched on in a residential area, 58.5 per cent. responded that they had recorded symptoms ranging from sleep disorders to headaches and nausea, all of which were contemporaneous with the operation of the mast. Of those people, 40 per cent. identified with having sleep disorders, 38 per cent. with having headaches and 16 per cent. with having rashes or itchy skin. We also have anecdotal evidence of pharmacies in areas affected by masts increasing their sales of painkillers and other remedies associated with some symptoms that I have mentioned.</p>
	<p>I remain very concerned when questions posed to the Department of Health simply elicit references to the advice in the Stewart report, which is several years old. We are told that we have nothing to worry about, but when we get advice from the Home Office in response to parliamentary questions, it is rather inconclusive. Any research has barely started. A response from the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), said that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Imperial College is carrying out a long-term health monitoring study of police users of Airwave&quot;</p>
	<p>and that the</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Universities of Birmingham and Manchester are looking at patterns of use of Airwave among police users.&quot;</p>
	<p>The reply also mentions work under way on the specific absorption rate in vehicles and states that, in addition, the Home Office is</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;funding research on TETRA as an adjunct to the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research . . . programme.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, </i>8 December 2004; Vol. 428, c. 649W.]</p>
	<p>Those studies are all under way. They are not finished studies that have produced results that can be given as reassurance or to raise worries. They are all ongoing.</p>
	<p>Despite that, the system is up and running in many parts of the country. In the mean time, in my constituency and other hon. Members' constituencies, the masts continue to operate. Appeals to the mast operators to find alternative, more suitable locations go unheeded. My appeals to Sussex police authority to intervene on behalf of the Sussex council tax payers who fund them also go completely unheeded.</p>

	<p>Perhaps we can have a chat afterwards, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You could write to my constituents, passing on the information that the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) mentioned, so that I will not have to receive 50 or 60 such letters asking for my help. Certainly, we have so far singularly failed to get any gesture of good will, let alone financial compensation, from O2 in that respect.</p>
	<p>Over a year ago, I met several local residents and summoned O2 Airwave to a small meeting, to which it was reluctant to come, as it is reluctant to attend any public meeting. Eventually, its representatives attended a meeting with a small group of residents and some planning officers from Worthing district council. The planning department was helpful, suggesting at least seven possible alternative sites in Worthing that would be far less harmful, given their distance from residential areas.</p>

	<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker. That is a greater contribution than any other Deputy Speaker has made during debates in which I have participated, but it is all good information.</p>
	<p>When I made my suggestions to O2, it went through the motions of having a half-hearted look at other potential sites. It told me that only one site would fit the criteria, knowing full well that it was not available. It was right in the middle of town anyway, on top of the building housing the Environment Agency, whose staff are the last people who would have such a mast on their building.</p>
	<p>O2 agreed to go through the motions on the face of it, but it turns out that that was all for appearances and its interest soon fizzled out. It would cost several hundred thousand pounds to resite those masts; of course, this company wants to maximise its profits. I do not dispute that, but should it not be more sensitive to the concerns of the local people paying the bills&mdash;the taxpayers? This is a &pound;2.9 billion contract: surely within its profit margin there is leeway for resiting some masts or putting in additional ones to compensate for lower coverage.</p>
	<p>If O2 is challenged and a planning authority takes it to court or tries to take enforcement action so the matter ends up in a court case, it will use expensive lawyers to overturn cases brought by private individuals or local authorities. Those authorities are obviously hamstrung by having to make difficult decisions as to whether they should risk a great deal of local council tax payers' money to seek expensive legal counsel while being accountable to those council tax payers.</p>
	<p>O2 Airwave has shown complete disregard for the concerns of local people. It did not consult them, it kept the mast sites quiet and it clearly had no serious intention to consider alternative sites. It has shown no concern for the damage caused to TV signals or any health implications, and it is one of the few mobile phone companies that has not signed up to the 10 commitments. It is rather good at producing a lot of reassuring leaflets with glossy pictures, but those leaflets do not convince my constituents.</p>
	<p>People have raised problems about the effect of mast transmissions on digital cordless phones, lawnmowers, computers, police speed cameras and even pacemakers, but the Department of Health has declined to refer queries regarding pacemakers to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. That might sound fanciful, but in the absence of a serious attempt by anyone in a position of authority to address health concerns, people will obviously suspect the worst.</p>
	<p>We have had a number of very well-attended public meetings in Worthing. An action group has been formed, piloted by residents such as Tony Malone and Andy Davidson, who have worked tirelessly in this area. Residents are concerned about the effect on the value of their properties, and many are trying to move. That does not help the confidence of local communities.</p>
	<p>Having failed with O2, I approached the Sussex police authority. After all, it is commissioning O2 Airwave to install Tetra masts. It may claim it has been strong-armed by the Home Office so that we have a national system, but it will be carrying out the commissioning. It had been helpful in sending the police expert to meetings to explain how the system worked and what it was all about.</p>
	<p>Sussex council tax payers have experienced big rises in the Sussex police precept in recent years, and we would expect the unelected police authority to be rather more responsive when there are concerns about the activity for which those taxes have been paid. However, I have been fobbed off with a lot of technical guff about how the whole system is safe. I was told that an equivalent system has been used for almost 100 years and no one has been harmed by it, and that everyone is talking nonsense and being a bunch of whingers with psychosomatic symptoms.</p>

	<p>There are Labour councillors on the authority and it has previously been led by Labour councillors, but I do not seek to make any political point in this debate and I am rather sorry that the hon. Gentleman has introduced that note.</p>
	<p>If a police authority is as unresponsive as this one has been, it deserves a good kick up the proverbial from any of us, whatever party we represent and whatever the leadership of the police authority. That is why that authority should be rather more accountable to the people who pay the taxes and expect to be protected and treated with respect. This does not have anything to do with politics. I hope that point has been made loud and clear to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p>When I expressed my concerns to one of the senior policemen involved in this project in an exchange of e-mails, he replied:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;I think your point about O2 needing to look for an alternative site in Worthing is a good practical suggestion in relation to Worthing&quot;.</p>
	<p>He also said that I had his assurance that he would do all that he believed possible to avoid such a situation in Worthing, or elsewhere for that matter. A fat lot of good that was. All the authority has done subsequently is accuse the detractors of the system of not wanting to install a system that will adequately protect our constituents. It claims that it has no power over O2 Airwave. It promised to have a look at the controversial site in particular, but absolutely nothing has happened.</p>
	<p>All the undertakings from the police authority have proved worthless. Its complete complacency towards the local residents it aims to protect has been appalling. Despite the representations, Tetra was not even mentioned in the last police authority minutes of 10   February. Its PR has been lamentable. I have to say that this situation makes a good case for elected police authority members who can be made more accountable if they show such complacency. It is a shame, because Sussex police authority has done many good things up to now, under whatever political leadership it might have been at the time. However, in the case of Tetra masts in Sussex, it has failed, and failed badly.</p>
	<p>Residents in the area of that mast really are desperate. They have just sent out a letter from the campaigning action group, after all its hard work, showing their frustration. They issued a plea to people in a position of responsibility to help to address their concerns. I will quote a couple of paragraphs from the letter:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Cynics may say that those reporting ill-effects are hypochondriacs; subject to autosuggestion or just mistaken. This mast is right in the midst of one of the most densely populated areas of Worthing. Most of the homes in the surrounding areas are not the 'socially-deprived' classes&mdash;they are established family homes&mdash;young working couples raising families; mature couples still living in the homes where they brought up their children; professional, skilled and retired people. They are honest-to-goodness, down to earth, 'Middle England' and they certainly aren't fanatics, activists or extremists. Looking at this dispassionately, of the 400-plus local people who took the trouble to respond to the survey&mdash;can you honestly believe that all of them have imagined&mdash;or are lying about&mdash;their (and their children's) headaches; nausea; rashes; nose-bleeds; sleep problems etc.?  . . .</p>
	<p class="indent">Someone&mdash;somewhere&mdash;must take responsibility for any ill-effects that Tetra (and of course other) masts may, in future, be proved to have caused. We have yet to find anyone so convinced of the safety of these masts that they will stand up and say 'Yes&mdash;I am totally confident that these masts are harmless and I can be held accountable if proved wrong'. Everyone approached on the subject has very quickly played 'pass the parcel'. That doesn't inspire confidence does it?&quot;</p>
	<p>I wholeheartedly identify with the sentiments of that letter. I am completely exasperated and feel that in some way I have let my constituents down because those masts still operate as they were intended to operate, in the places they were put, without any changes whatever. Yet again the wishes of local people and local councils are being ignored, bulldozed and treated with contempt by a Department&mdash;the Home Office&mdash;and by a multinational big business, O2 Airwave, which stands to make millions from the contract, as well as by a police authority that seems to have forgotten that its role is to protect local people and that a good start in that endeavour is usually to listen and respond to those people first.</p>
	<p>As I said, I am not a scientist, nor do I have resources available to me in the form of Government medical advisers, but I know that many of my constituents and those of other hon. Members are very unhappy. Without being against the whole project, there are serious questions that still need and deserve to be answered.</p>
	<p>The Government, or the local authorities responsible, need to investigate the possible cumulative effect of multiple masts. The mast in question is one of five mobile masts on that football stadium. There are four conventional masts, which are being upgraded for 3G, and a Tetra mast. There is a school of thought that suggests that the cumulative effect of so many masts in a tight, confined area, topped up with Tetra rays, might have a different effect from what one might expect from a single mast placed anywhere else.</p>
	<p>That is a legitimate line of questioning, so I raised it with the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Miss Johnson). I asked her what research has been</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;commissioned on the cumulative effects of multiple mobile phone/Tetra masts on the health of people living nearby.&quot;</p>
	<p>This is the response:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The mobile telecommunications and health research programme supports about 30 studies of the potential effects of mobile phone telecommunications. Many of these are generic and accordingly relevant to TETRA. Some studies include a specific examination of the effects of TETRA. The programme is described on the web site&quot;.&mdash;<i>[Official Report, </i>13 December 2004; Vol. 428, c. 951W]</p>
	<p>Blah, blah, blah&mdash;so it continues. There is not a single attempt in a great long paragraph even remotely to address the question of the cumulative effects of various phone masts, although that is a question that needs to be answered.</p>
	<p>Another question involves the feasibility of having two masts on the edge of town, rather than one in the middle of a densely populated part of town. Those questions need to be answered, but O2 has not answered them. How closely are guidelines to prevent masts from being built close to schools, on top of police stations or close to hospitals being followed? What, in practice, does the precautionary approach mean for the siting of masts?</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman may know that a number of larger landowners in the county of West Sussex have stated categorically that they will not allow masts on their property. I applaud those landowners for having taken that decision, which helps. However, they do not account for 100 per cent. of the county, no matter how much he and his party claim that the assets of rural England are in the hands of a few nobs.</p>
	<p>Last week, I was delighted that the strategic environment and public protection committee of West Sussex county council, under the chairmanship of Councillor Louise Goldsmith, organised a public committee hearing on the issue of Tetra. A meeting was held in my constituency. The committee heard submissions from police, technical experts, local residents and anti-mast campaigners, which shows that West Sussex is taking the problems seriously. As I said, it has been supportive with regard to the concerns of West Sussex Conservative Members, many of whom are present. That committee is not going to let the situation go and will take the matter forward. Ultimately, of course, its powers are limited, except in the case of land that it owns, which relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Lepper).</p>
	<p>This matter has been handled exceedingly badly. It raises the need for an overhaul of our planning laws in respect of how masts get, or rather do not get, permission before they are sited. I am delighted that the policy of my party, which will, I am sure, be restated from the Front Bench, is to give far more powers back to local people and locally elected representatives to make decisions based on what is sustainable for local people. Such matters make people even more cynical about the ability and preparedness of people in authority to address their fears.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Minister for Citizenship and Immigration will give a steer that the Government share my concerns about the lack of confidence that my constituents understandably feel. I also hope that he and his Government will do everything they can to encourage the police authorities that commission masts and the companies that install them to take more account of the local sensitivities of local people, whose confidence has understandably been completely undermined by a system that should be there to protect the public, not to engender fear among them, as it has in my constituency and the constituencies of many other Members.</p>

	<p>My contribution will be very brief, because I appreciate that I did not give notice beforehand. I just want to make one or two comments from the eastern end of the county.</p>
	<p>It is important that we do not take a Luddite view of an important development in the protection of the citizen and the solving of crime. I want to explain the position from Hastings. The Tetra system came into effect in the Rother area of my constituency only a couple of weeks ago. When speaking to the chief inspector, I was told that the effect has been phenomenal. Whereas in the past, areas of the county were unable to receive any radio contact, the new system is making it possible for officers to be in touch and they can more ably do the job for which they are employed.</p>
	<p>I would not go so far as to say that this debate masks the success Sussex police have had recently, but it is worth putting on record that in Hastings crime was down 10 per cent. last year and is also down 10 per cent. this year. That is not the issue this afternoon, however, save to say that those technological advances will help that effort all the more.</p>
	<p>I do not discount entirely comments made by hon. Members who have received representations from their constituents; however, I have not received a single representation from my constituents about masts in the Rother area. In the past, I have received representations about mobile phone masts, but in so far as this particular enterprise is concerned, no representations whatever.</p>

	<p>I am grateful, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I can be brief. It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr.   Foster) and I make an impassioned plea to his constituents: I hope that many of them will write to him. When his local paper picks up on what he said today, I am sure that his postbag will be full. I wish him well in dealing with it.</p>
	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) on securing the debate; it is a tribute to his persistence. His constituents have borne the brunt of the rolling out of Tetra masts in West Sussex, which started in the south and is gradually moving northwards. The first two masts being sited in my constituency at Warninglid and Colgate are causing concern, although not a huge amount as they are not in built-up urban areas. My hon. Friend dealt eloquently with the health concerns that certainly exist but which have not been addressed definitively by the Government or any serious authority. It is inevitable that concerns remain, and the public are entitled to be anxious until their concerns are properly addressed; but I see no sign of that yet.</p>
	<p>My concern is principally about the planning process that applies to Tetra masts and more broadly to commercial mobile telephone masts. None of us wants to stand in the way of progress. We all have an interest in good emergency services and good emergency communications. We should recognise that they are in our interests and in the interests of all our constituents. Indeed, pretty much all hon. Members have an interest in good mobile telephone communication. We use mobile phones a lot, and we complain bitterly if we do not get a good signal; but we also complain bitterly if mobile phone masts go up where we do not want them.</p>
	<p>The planning process is not at all transparent. It does not allow a proper local debate, nor does it give people the sense that, through their elected representatives, such things can be controlled and their concerns addressed. That is one reason for the growing alienation between the governed and those who govern. People have the sense that although they can elect whichever local councillors they like, and whichever MPs they like, it makes no difference to what happens in connection with the things that affect them. That is important.</p>
	<p>I appreciate that planning is not the Minister's responsibility, but he has been put up by the Government to answer the debate, and I hope that he will address that problem and show some understanding of the fact that the way in which the system works is causing grave concern. As I say, Tetra masts are merely emerging in my constituency, but the planning concerns that my constituents already have about commercial mobile phone masts are causing growing anxiety about Tetra masts.</p>
	<p>One specific instance illustrates the point graphically. An application has been made by T-Mobile to erect a mobile phone mast; it is below 15 m, so ordinary planning permission is not required. It would be sited on a mini-roundabout at the junction between St.   Leonard's road and Compton's lane in Horsham. That puts it within 300 yd of four schools&mdash;the Millais girls secondary school, the Forest boys secondary school, the Queen Elizabeth II special needs school and the Heron Way primary school. Three pre-school provisions are also to be found in the immediate neighbourhood. As a result, there will be 3,000 children within approximately 300 m of the mast, and some very much nearer.</p>
	<p>The Stewart report states that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;caution should be exercised when planning these masts near schools or residential areas.&quot;</p>
	<p>It seems that the advice is being ignored in that case. Many local people have expressed serious anxiety about the application. It now emerges that T-mobile has withdrawn it, but it is anticipated that it will submit another very slightly revised one shortly. Indeed, it may already have done so.</p>
	<p>My constituents feel that the system that currently applies simply does not allow their concerns to be recognised and addressed. As the science advances and the research continues, it may well be established definitively that there is no health risk from immediate and close proximity to Tetra masts and ordinary mobile phone masts, but that has not yet been shown to be the case. The precautionary principle really should be applied but, more than that, my concern is that local people should have a greater sense of being in control of their destiny, and the system should be amended, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham set out very eloquently, to enable local councils to have the final say.</p>

	<p>It is a pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude), who is right to raise the matter of public disaffection with the political process and the sense of powerlessness that people now feel under our democratic system. The way the Tetra masts have been rolled out, oblivious to local concerns, is a classic example of that.</p>
	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) on securing this very important debate and on his excellent presentation of the issues that are of enormous concern to tens of thousands of people who live in the shadow of a Tetra mast. I share those concerns. One Tetra mast has already been erected on the site of existing masts at Littlehampton police station. It did not need planning permission, and so could be erected despite the fact that it is close to schools, a community hospital and a large number of residential properties.</p>
	<p>The siting of the mast near a school, as other hon. Members have said, directly contravenes the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's code of best practice on mobile network development. There was no consultation with local people or with the local schools. When the mast was switched on, people began to notice problems with their health. They had nosebleeds, headaches, sleeplessness, confusion, loss of memory and skin problems.</p>
	<p>A survey similar to the one carried out in Worthing, to which my hon. Friend referred, was conducted in the area around the mast in Littlehampton. Some 350 householders were consulted, 68 per cent. of whom reported health problems. There is also the prospect of a Tetra mast in the Southern Water compound at West park in Aldwick in my constituency. Planning permission was sought for the mast, as it exceeded 15 m, and I am pleased to say that it was refused by Arun district council. That is a totally unacceptable site for a Tetra mast. The compound is in a children's park, which is also frequently used for large-scale social events such as the annual Bognor carnival.</p>
	<p>A mast has also been erected at the Bognor Regis golf club in Felpham. Again, no planning permission appears to have been necessary as a mast was already sited there; it was certainly not applied for. That was in June 2004. When the Tetra mast went up at Felpham, some 20 people in the immediate area reported similar health problems. Interestingly, the local campaigners against Tetra masts were sure that the mast had not been switched on, yet the local people insisted that they were suffering from health problems. It later turned out that the campaigners were wrong. The mast had been switched on and the local people were therefore correct. That directly answers the accusation that those people are simply suffering from psychosomatic problems or the power of suggestion.</p>

	<p>It appears that there was a similar experience in Harting in my constituency with respect to the challenge as to whether or not the mast had been turned on. That spills over into concern in other areas, which is exactly what has happened in Sidlesham. An inquiry has been conducted into the mast there, and it is hoped that the inspector's decision will be announced on 7 March. Again, local people are extremely concerned about the health effects of that mast. Does my hon. Friend agree that the only rational way of dealing with this is to give power back to the local people and to allow local decisions to be taken about the siting of these masts? Does he also agree that that is the only reasonable way of reassuring the public about the health risk?</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend is right. The more reports there are of genuine health problems, the greater is the onus on us to ensure that research is undertaken into the effects on health. The Home Office and O2 claim that the symptoms are either psychosomatic or the normal occurrence of such ailments, and therefore unconnected with Tetra. I do not accept that. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has also said, the power of the masts is such that it causes severe interference with television reception in the area around a mast. A special device has to be purchased&mdash;at the expense of the home owner, not of O2&mdash;to counter that reception interference.</p>
	<p>Given the power necessary to cause that interference, and the fact that many people report significant health effects, why is there no Government-funded research into the health effects of living close to a Tetra mast? I understand that Professor Lawrie Challis, of the National Radiological Protection Board mobile telecommunication health research programme, confirmed in a recent meeting that no research is currently being carried out into the health effect of Tetra masts. There has been research into calcium exchanges in cells, but surely the best approach is not to look at each of those isolated areas of research, but to investigate the reported health problems experienced by people living close to Tetra masts, and to isolate those people from the effects of the masts or switch off the masts to see what effect that has on their health. Then research can be conducted to find out what causes particular symptoms.</p>
	<p>There has been significant research into issues such as calcium exchanges in cells, and the effect of heat, but no real research has been conducted into the neurological effect of living near a Tetra mast and suffering prolonged exposure. In a written answer to me on 10   June 2004, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), claimed:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) researchers have completed their work on calcium exchanges in cells&mdash;the main concern of the Stewart report. They found Tetra exposure had no effect&quot;.</p>
	<p>She went on to say:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Work is continuing to see if exposure to Tetra can affect electrical activity in brain cells and to assess the effects of Tetra signals on cognitive performance. Quarterly reports are available&quot;.</p>
	<p>My understanding&mdash;the Minister in the Chamber can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;is that the research has not been authorised and no funds have been released to finance it. In other words, no research is being carried out into the neurological effect of Tetra masts. I emphasise the word &quot;masts&quot;. The Minister replied to other written questions by stating:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) has calculated specific absorption rates from Tetra handsets. Even in worst case situations, these were found to be well below international health and safety guidelines. In areas accessible to the public, signals from Tetra masts are very much weaker than those from handsets&quot;.</p>
	<p>She concluded:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The NRPB has not carried out any further work on specific absorption rates from Tetra masts&quot;.</p>
	<p>On the same date, she said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The main Microwave Consultants Limited expert currently working on specific absorption rates from Tetra equipment is Dr   Philip Chadwick. The research does not include Tetra masts.&quot;</p>
	<p>In another written answer, she told me:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;King's College London is already assessing the effects of GSM mobile phone handsets on cognitive performance and stress levels. It will extend the study to Tetra handsets in 2005. No work is planned on Tetra base stations or masts.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> 10   June 2004; Vol. 422, c. 511&ndash;30W.]</p>
	<p>That is very wrong. There is genuine concern about the safety of the masts. People who live near them are reporting serious health effects as a consequence, and I believe their reports, yet no research has been conducted, or is being carried out, into their complaints or into the general neurological consequences of prolonged proximity to Tetra masts.</p>
	<p>The real concern, which I hope the Minister will address, is the effects of resonances set up by magnetic radiation emanating from the masts. The burden seems to have been passed from the Government and O2 to an unfunded but competently managed group of protesters and local residents, led in my area by John O'Brien. Surely the onus should be on O2 and the Home Office to satisfy the public that the masts are safe. I hope that the Minister will give us a commitment to that effect this afternoon.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to you for that advice, Mr. Deputy Speaker, although I may be able to give up some of my time so that the Minister can give us a slightly fuller reply to this wide-ranging debate.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said that the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) comes from the wilds of Gloucestershire. If he thinks that Gloucestershire is wild, I am not sure what term he would apply to my constituency. None the less, it is interesting to have the opportunity to observe a debate whose subject is so far removed, geographically speaking, from my constituency. It is also interesting because there are so many themes to which I can relate as a constituency Member. I am thinking in particular of the point made most forcefully by the right hon. Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude), who said that, in so many different ways, and in so many different parts of the country, people feel that they do not have control over their own communities and destinies. That lies at the heart of this subject.</p>
	<p>I should also place it on record that the duty of responding to this debate would normally have fallen to my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker). I know how energetic he has been in pursuit of this subject, because I had to read his file to familiarise myself with the topic in preparation for the debate. He has been thorough&mdash;something for which he is widely known, and no doubt admired, in the House.</p>
	<p>As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, there is a need for a proper and comprehensive debate. Coming to the subject fairly new, it strikes me that although there has been a multiplicity of studies, there does not seem to have been an overarching look at the effect of masts, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr.   Gibb) pointed out.</p>
	<p>If I can wear my hat as vice-chairman of the all-party group on telecommunications for a second, the approach taken by O2 in dealing with communities has left something to be desired. Where there is lack of openness and candour, suspicion and concern will inevitably grow. No one who has contributed to the debate has in any way sought to exaggerate those concerns, and they are to be commended for that.</p>
	<p>I commend to the Minister the thorough report on mobile phones and health produced by the National Radiological Protection Board at the start of the year. It made a number of recommendations, and I draw his attention to the first two. The first relates to communities' ability to gain access to all the up-to-date information about Tetra and mobile communication masts and phones. The second is that the planning process associated with the erection of mobile phone base stations and masts should be the subject of an independent review. The report called for particular attention to be given to how best to minimise the exposure of potentially vulnerable sub-groups, such as children, and for continuing research on the possible health effects of mobile phone technologies to be strongly supported. As other hon. Members have observed, some time has passed since the publication of the Stewart report and it would be a worthwhile exercise if the Government were to resurrect that or to revisit its findings.</p>
	<p>The other concern that the NRPB report rightly highlighted was the role of Ofcom. We all know that Ofcom is fairly young, and it clearly still has a lot of proving to do. However, it is quite clear that Ofcom has been able to make available rather less information on such matters than is sufficient. The report also recommended that Tetra base stations should be audited in the same way as global system for mobile&mdash;GSM&mdash;base stations. Until more information becomes available, the board considers that it would be premature to rule out the possibility of health effects on users of Tetra-based equipment and believes that a precautionary approach should be adopted. I think that the Minister will find little in that with which he will be able to argue in principle. We know why the police want Tetra in a broader sense, but surely a proper balance has to be struck.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) on setting out his case comprehensively and rationally. This subject is a matter of concern not only in Sussex but in many other parts of the country.</p>
	<p>I should like, if I may&mdash;particularly as you have an understanding of the subject, Mr. Deputy Speaker&mdash;to relay my personal experience, because it echoes so powerfully the experience of hon. Members. I discovered that a Tetra mast had been erected on a block of flats in Newmarket in my constituency&mdash;90 per cent. of the town of Newmarket is in the county of Suffolk. There were protests and great concern that that had been done in a stealthy way.</p>
	<p>As a result of the protests, I intervened and negotiated with the company that had erected the Tetra mast. I spoke at length with the Suffolk constabulary and there was a public meeting. We had agreed that the Tetra mast would be moved from the flats to the top of a hill&mdash;or what passes for a hill in East Anglia&mdash;just outside Newmarket, and I was confident that that had happened. One morning we all woke up to find that the Tetra mast had been moved, but to that part of Newmarket that is in Cambridgeshire. That was a disgraceful and dishonourable thing to do. I had words with the chief constable of Suffolk, who had no idea that that was happening. We then experienced the ritual with which we are all now so entirely familiar, as the local council challenged the move and lost on appeal, which happens virtually every single time because there is no protection in the law.</p>
	<p>That occurrence was so disgraceful because the new Tetra mast was close to a school and to an area of high population concentration. The code of best practice of the operating companies is simply not worth the paper that it is written on. It includes, for example, consultation with the local Member of Parliament&mdash;some consultation. There is no effective planning control, and the behaviour of some of the operating companies has been a disgrace and has undermined public confidence.</p>
	<p>Five years ago, Sir William Stewart reported on the question of the location of base stations and transmission masts. He talked about the precautionary principle, which we have heard a lot about this afternoon. However, I wonder whether hon. Members noticed that only weeks ago he called for the precautionary principle to be revisited for precisely the reasons that I am suggesting. It has not been applied in practice, because there is no effective planning control. This is a matter of public confidence.</p>
	<p>My right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr.   Maude) is absolutely correct; people are alienated by a process in which they feel they have no control whatever over something controversial that might have an impact on their health and on their lives, certainly from an aesthetic point of view at the very least. They feel alienated from the process and from local government, which is there to protect their interests. I say quite dispassionately to the Minister that that is exactly what is happening in practice, with all the attendant consequences.</p>
	<p>I introduced a private Member's Bill to try to deal with the problem, but I regret that the Government did not accept it and it did not see the light of day. Let me say just this: the effects of the frequencies of the Tetra system are different from those of normal telecommunications masts because the pace of Tetra electrical impulses is such that they affect the brain and human bodies quite differently. That is of great concern to at least a minority of scientists.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) was absolutely right to talk about the health concerns. I do not know&mdash;none of us can know&mdash;whether the outbreaks of dizziness, nausea, and erratic behaviour, particularly in young children in schools close to Tetra masts, are part of some mass hysteria. In view of the fact that all these cancer clusters have developed for no apparent reason&mdash;they have been well documented in different parts of the country because they are in the beam of the greatest intensity&mdash;we must, as Members of Parliament, adopt the precautionary principle and be very careful.</p>
	<p>Cannabis was considered to be completely harmless in the 1960s and 1970s, yet habitual cannabis smokers in California are now suffering from different forms of cancer much earlier than is usual because of the carcinogenic properties of cannabis. At the time, we did not know what the long-term effects of cannabis would be. I simply say, therefore, that we do not know what the health implications of Tetra masts are, but the evidence is of concern and we must respond to it.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster) was absolutely correct to say that we want an efficacious communications service. Of course we do. We want it for our police and our ambulance services. In theory, Tetra involves a national digital mobile radio communications system that the emergency services find quite valuable. However, I have looked into the matter and discussed it at length, and must say to him that Tetra is based on 1950s and early 1990s technology that can no longer be described as the state of the art, as Airwave claims. It cannot, for example, send graphics, faxes, photos or video streams. It cannot access the police national computer, nor can it send or receive files or fingerprints. It cannot access the internet, and it is expensive. It will cost &pound;3 billion to start up, and there will be 3,350 new base stations, including 87 in the county of Sussex.</p>
	<p>Following the reluctance of police forces to adopt Tetra, the Government agreed to fund its introduction with &pound;500 million, to be shared among all police forces. We heard about the police precept. The cost above the &pound;500 million must be met from the council tax. Of all the stealth taxes introduced by this Government, the one that has caused our constituents the most irritation and concern has been the soaring cost of the council tax. That plays a part in all this and, from that point of view, the situation is entirely unsatisfactory.</p>
	<p>In trying to highlight the issue in a non-party political way, as I and many other hon. Members have tried to do, I have been astonished that the Government have not reacted in the way that would be appropriate for a Government in such circumstances, despite private conversations with Ministers and pressure from Labour Members. The fact is that the system, however efficacious, needs careful monitoring. The locations of sites need to be checked, and local people need local control over the local environment. If we do not proceed in that way we shall store up problems for the future.</p>
	<p>My final point is, I am afraid, party political. The Conservative party&mdash;others will share this view&mdash;now believes that masts should require full planning permission. We are an overcrowded and small island, which is densely populated in parts. We must protect our citizens from potential health difficulties and the environment in which we live, and give some sense of control to people who increasingly feel that they have less and less control over the things that are important to them in their day-to-day lives.</p>

	<p>It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring), even if he did, in his final comments, fail to resist the temptation to adopt a party political stance. However, in view of how the debate has been conducted, perhaps we can forgive him that slight lapse.</p>
	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) on securing the debate and on his tenacity and persistence in doing it. He has done the House a service this afternoon, and not only by providing an opportunity for a debate that, although limited geographically, has dealt with issues close to the heart of many constituencies and constituents. I have had my fair share of constituent correspondence on mobile phone masts, although not specifically on Tetra masts. I also congratulate the hon. Gentleman on how he set out his arguments. He was very fair.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman said that many questions need and deserve to be answered. He is right, and I shall endeavour in the time available to answer as many as I can. However, I assure all right hon. and hon. Members who have taken part in the debate that, despite the fact that this subject does not fall four-square in my area of Home Office ministerial responsibility, I shall pass on all the comments to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), who has an unavoidable commitment outside London today dating from long before the debate was fixed.</p>
	<p>I shall, of course, also pass on comments to other Ministers in other Departments, where appropriate. However, I do not want to avoid the responsibility to answer the debate as comprehensively as I can in the time available.</p>
	<p>Before I discuss some detail, I want to mention the fact that there is one area of dispute between me and the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham on this matter, which is the weight he attaches to the results of the survey conducted in his constituency. I am sure he will accept that although it may never have been intended as a scientific survey, there are concerns about how it was conducted, which would normally affect the view someone took on its conclusions. It would serve no purpose&mdash;it would be hypercritical&mdash;to list them all, although I have them available, but as a piece of scientific work the survey is significantly flawed. However, it may not be so flawed as a measure of the views of the hon. Gentleman's constituents. To the extent that it helps us to understand our responsibilities, collectively and individually, and my ministerial responsibilities to his constituents, it is valuable. It is far from being a scientific work, however, and there were serious flaws in how those who conducted it communicated with those from whom they wished to extract the information.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman laid out the background to the issue well. Although I want to say something about Airwave and the Tetra process, I do not propose to explain to the House what the issue involves, because it seems to me that everybody who is present and has contributed to the debate has a fair idea of what is going on in producing a modern communication system for the police. However, I repeat the view that my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster) shared with the House, which is that police officers are delighted with the new system. A significant number of them use it throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p>The increased coverage provided by Airwave means, importantly, that there are no more holes in the system to endanger the safety of police officers. The system's emergency button means that they can summon help quickly and the improved clarity of signals means that they can work more effectively, efficiently and safely than with previous communication systems.</p>
	<p>I shall give three examples of improvements. One is the view of Sussex police, who have given positive feedback on clarity, quality, coverage and freedom from interference and eavesdropping&mdash;that is important&mdash;as well as the functionality of the new system. The hon. Member for West Suffolk criticised the system by implication, saying that it is by no means state of the art and listing a series of things he claims it cannot not do. I do not remember exactly what those were, but I recognise in some of them functions that I have been specifically briefed the system can do&mdash;in particular, providing access to the police national computer.</p>
	<p>I will ensure that that list is gone through and that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. and right hon. Members get a detailed response. I do not think that providing such a response at the moment would be the best use of my time.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman may have been referring to some comments that were made in the context of the publication of that second report. All the report's recommendations are being taken forward and the relevant research is being conducted. Hon. Members seem to have extensive knowledge of the nature of that research, but it is appropriate that I should set out exactly what the Government's position is. In March 2004, the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety updated all hon. Members by way of a letter on Tetra health and safety issues.</p>
	<p>It is important to note that neither the Stewart report of May 2000 nor the follow-up reports of the National Radiological Protection Board in 2003 and 2005&mdash;the 2005 report being Sir William's second on the subject&mdash;nor the 2001 report of the NRPB's advisory group on non-ionising radiation concerning Tetra technology found any established evidence of any adverse effects on health from exposure to radio frequency emissions at levels within international guidelines. The Tetra system works within international guidelines.</p>
	<p>The AGNIR report recommended eight areas for further research. The Government accepted those recommendations and have advanced them either as part of the mobile telecommunications and health research programme or in the Home Office research programme.</p>
	<p>The comprehensive recommendations that have been referred to are further studies on the behaviour of calcium in tissues to determine the extent and significance of any effects that occur; further studies on the effects of amplitude modulation or pulsing; investigation of the possibility that modulated radio frequency fields might somehow increase the likelihood of epileptic seizures; investigation of possible mechanisms by which living cells might demodulate amplitude modulated RF fields; human volunteer studies, which is what hon. Members are calling for, to measure changes in cognitive performance; studies to examine working practices in conditions of exposure to RF radiation from Tetra systems; the inclusion of Tetra-based stations in Ofcom's audit of base stations; and further work on providing more information on exposure from hand portables, which are the part of the system that generates the greatest concern.</p>
	<p>The Government contacted reputable, independent organisations to carry out that research and I am concerned that hon. Members may have misunderstood exactly what has taken place since then. I shall spell it out carefully so that it is properly recorded. The Defence Scientific and Technological Laboratory has looked into the first three recommendations and the fifth. The Burden Neurological Institute, which is part of the MTHR programme, considered the fourth. King's college London and the university of Bradford, which is also part of the MTHR programme, considered the fifth. Imperial college London, the university of Birmingham and the university of Manchester looked at the sixth. The Radiocommunications Agency, which is now Ofcom, looked at the seventh, and Microwave Consultants Ltd. looked into the eighth.</p>
	<p>Interim reports relating to all that work are available from the Home Office websites. Final reports are being peer reviewed for publication in the academic press and will be made available on the web as soon as they are available. Although peer review delays publication of the final report, it is an important procedure that gives credibility to the scientific process&mdash;</p>

	<p>It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to raise this fraught issue again. I am grateful to the Minister for giving up his time to respond to the debate. He has been generous with his time on debates on the A21 in the past, in which we have discussed the issue in some detail, and will be familiar with many of the points that I shall raise. I know that he will not want to read out the official script, but will want to respond directly to points raised by me and other hon. Members.</p>
	<p>We may be privileged enough to have a visit from the Minister on 8 March, when the Lamberhurst bypass may open. If that is the case, and we would be delighted to see him, I hope that he will take the opportunity to drive down the A21 and experience the delays and difficulties involved. If he does so, I hope that he will manage to avoid the rush hour, otherwise he may arrive too late to cut the red ribbon.</p>
	<p>The A21 is the main arterial strategic route from the M25 to Hastings, and provides the economic lifeline not only to my constituency of Tunbridge Wells, and to Tonbridge, but right down to Hastings, which we know to be an area of relative economic deprivation with comparatively high levels of unemployment. I am delighted that the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster) is here today. Yet, as a result of a series of ad hoc initiatives over the past 30 years, instead of a strategic approach being taken to the road, there has been an hourglass effect: the road is dual carriageway, then a single-lane bottleneck followed by dual carriageway, then a single lane, then the new dual carriageway at Lamberhurst bypass, then a single lane right down to Hastings, which creates immense frustration to local people, delays at each bottleneck in each rush hour, and safety hazards.</p>
	<p>The impact of the problem cannot be underestimated: it is the factor holding back economic development in our area and, more seriously, down to Hastings. That is illustrated by the following quotes. The superintendent of Kent police said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The Castle Hill section of the A21 is a nightmare. It adds at least 25 minutes to the journey into Tunbridge Wells. Police movement, despite the assistance of sirens, is inhibited by the current situation.&quot;</p>
	<p>The managing director of AIM Plastics in Tunbridge Wells said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Companies like mine will very soon move away rather than waste our time in a daily unavoidable traffic jam.&quot;</p>
	<p>It was, of course, the previous hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle, Mr. Charles Wardle, who famously said that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;the probable reason that Harold lost the battle of Hastings was that he was held up on the A21.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, </i>11 February 1998; Vol. 325, c. 329.]</p>
	<p>One can imagine the dismay felt by people in west Kent and Sussex in July 1997, when the Weald and Downland design, build, finance and operate scheme&mdash;the previous Government's plan to improve the A21&mdash;was binned and the contractors compensated to the tune of &pound;4 million to &pound;6 million, I believe, and it was announced that instead there would be the trunk roads review. Nevertheless, many local people were prepared to accept that the incoming Government were going to adopt a different approach and were heartened by the announcement by the then Minister for Transport, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang), that the Government intended:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;to bring a fresh approach to the process of making decisions on the roads programme.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 July 1997; Vol. 299, c. 33W.]</p>
	<p>People then looked forward to a fresh approach that would be not only environmentally sensitive, but strategic. What emerged, in reality, was a protracted series of consultations and reviews, endless local consultation and tactical prevarication, yet, even today, there is no strategic approach to the overall construction of the route, no deadlines, no serious commitments to a timetable and immense local concern and indecision.</p>
	<p>The process began with the trunk roads review, then the &quot;Access to Hastings&quot; study, which recommended &quot;on-line improvements&quot; at Castle Hill and improvements south of Pembury. That study is particularly important because it involved consulting all the local people and the subsequent report on it was the subject of consultation by all the relevant regional authorities, including the South East England regional assembly, which was almost unanimously in support of the recommendations for improvement. The process was exhaustive and consultative, and it received virtually unanimous approval.</p>
	<p>At that point, the Government had all the information required to go ahead with proposals for strategic improvement throughout the route. Indeed, that appeared to be happening. The then Secretary of State for Transport announced shortly afterwards that work would probably start on the A21 at Castle Hill in 2006&ndash;07, and a further review would be undertaken to define the best route for improvement for the area south of Pembury. Hope burgeoned and we were all much encouraged. The Government appeared to have a logical strategic approach.</p>
	<p>In July 2003, people from the Highways Agency arrived in Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells and went round the public with computer simulations of the preferred route, showing what it would look like at Castle Hill. We were led to believe that the matter was in hand, the pubic inquiry would ensue and so on. Late in 2004, after much delay and local debate, a preferred route was also defined for the route from Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst, south of Pembury. The Minister and I had discussions on the matter, the Government formed their conclusions with regard to the preferred route, and it was announced to the public. Whether we liked it or not, that was the route that was taken, and it appeared that everything was likely to go ahead.</p>
	<p>Ever since then, we have seen slippage and inaction, and I want to illustrate that with some quotes. The first is from the Highways Agency newsletter of November 2002, which said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;it is expected that construction of the Castle Hill scheme could commence in 2005/6.&quot;</p>
	<p>Seven months later, in July 2003, the Minister wrote to me&mdash;he might remember this&mdash;saying:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The Highways Agency are looking to publish highways orders in 2004&mdash;&quot;</p>
	<p>last year&mdash;</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;and hope to start work in 2005/6 with the road opened in 2007/8.&quot;</p>
	<p>That was the commitment from the Minister himself. Never have we had a word of apology or explanation for any subsequent delay. In fact, no such orders were published in 2004 and no public inquiry has taken place or is scheduled. Latterly, we have had no word from Ministers and no explanation to hon. Members. Instead, a press release has slipped out from the Highways Agency. It says:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;While both the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury Dualling and A21 Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst Improvement schemes remain in the Government's programme, for schemes of regional importance such as these, priorities and decisions will take into account advice from the regional planning body, the South East Regional Assembly.</p>
	<p class="indent">The detail of how this will work is still under consideration, but we expect to know more early in 2006.&quot;</p>
	<p>By which time, of course, the road was meant to be under construction. The press release continues:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;This means that construction . . . will not start before the financial year 2008/9 at the earliest.&quot;</p>
	<p>So we have another consultation, with bodies that have already been consulted and which expressed unanimous approval, and no explanation from the Minister, despite the fact that that is in direct contradiction to his statements in previous letters. Furthermore, we do not even know exactly how the consultation will take place, who will be consulted or how it will work. I have contacted the Highways Agency and am told that it is still waiting to hear from Ministers exactly what form the consultation will take.</p>
	<p>There can be little wonder, therefore, that local people regard the process with some cynicism. We started by hearing that we would have a fresh approach to roads decision making; we embarked wholeheartedly on another series of consultations, despite the fact that there had been a public inquiry on the whole thing in 1991 and all the issues had been thrashed through before; we involved the local regional authorities, Kent county council and other such bodies; everybody was in support and the Minister said that we were going ahead. It appeared that we had a strategic approach, as we were dealing with not just Castle Hill but the area south of Pembury&mdash;we were going to tackle the whole route. It all looked very encouraging, but it just slipped and slipped, and, even today, there is no commitment on the time scale. We do not even know how further consultation will take place.</p>
	<p>Local people may be forgiven for thinking that all of that is a shallow excuse for deferring and spreading out public expenditure. The Minister may want to tell me whether that has anything to do with it. Equally, they may wonder whether the intentions of the Government in respect of this part of west Kent and Sussex were ever sincere. There is widespread cynicism about the Government's intentions. There has always been a belief&mdash;colleagues of mine have expressed it&mdash;that there never was a sincere intention to do the work. I do not believe that that is true. I believe that the Minister will be as good as his word, but he should recognise that people are now looking for a strategic statement of intent and a commitment on the time scale. We want to know what the consultation is for and whether we can avoid further delay. He will recognise that it will serve very little value. Once the consultation has taken place, when is work likely to start? Is there a coherent time scale, or will the work at Castle Hill dribble on for ever? When will work start south of Pembury? Finally, what process will be undertaken for the preferred route for the area south of Flimwell that was recently announced? That is now going out to consultation.</p>
	<p>This is not just a question of convenience or even of economic development, as important as that may be, but of safety. The road is one of the 100 most dangerous roads in Britain. There have been 300 accidents on the Castle Hill stretch in the past five years, four of them fatal. On the Flimwell stretch&mdash;a very short stretch of road&mdash;there have been 116 accidents in the past four years, seven of them fatal. The longer we delay, the more fatal accidents there will be, the more the future economic development of Hastings and other locations along the route will be held back and the more local people will wonder whether the Government have a coherent roads and transport strategy at all.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman) for giving his consent for me to contribute to this debate. He has announced his retirement from the House at the next election, and no one could have done more than he has during his time in the House to promote improvements on the A21. I know that his constituents are grateful for his consistent Herculean efforts.</p>
	<p>I shall speak about the section of the A21 between Tonbridge and Pembury, which is the part that affects my constituency. The lack of dualling on that section has the most baleful economic consequences for the whole of the business life of the Tonbridge, Southborough and Tunbridge Wells area. It has serious implications for ambulances and the police, and it is a continuous source of acute frustration for any number of motorists who find themselves in a jam between Tonbridge and Pembury at any hour of the day, but particularly during the rush hour. It is a very serious impediment to all those who live in the area.</p>
	<p>The history of the A21 is simple. A perfectly good scheme was ready in 1997 having gone through the planning and public inquiry processes. The funding was in place and the scheme was about to go ahead, but since 1997 there have been eight wasted years. A perfectly good scheme was unnecessarily scrapped. The new one included access to Hastings, but this is about access to Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells and Southborough. Huge amounts of money were wasted on consultancy fees and further inquiries. As of today, we are no further forward and, as we look ahead, we find that there is no construction date and that the whole scheme has now become enveloped in the regional bureaucracy beloved of the present Government.</p>
	<p>I say this with great regret, but I have to say it straight to the Minister: the handling of this scheme by the Government has been characteristic of so much of their activity. It has been marked by a huge wastage of public money&mdash;taxpayers' money&mdash;by ever greater layers of bureaucracy, and by no delivery of goods in the end. Will he set a date today for the start of the construction of the scheme, particularly the dualling of the A21 between Tonbridge and Pembury?</p>

	<p>I beg your pardon, Mr. Deputy Speaker. There are more than two of us who will not be here after the next election. However, that will be the choice not of the electorate, but of those who could be standing for the seat.</p>
	<p>I was pleased to hear the contribution from the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley) and I am pleased to see my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster), who has been campaigning on the issues all the way along the road for a considerable time. The road is much busier than it was. There is a lot of economic activity around the country, but particularly in the south-east. My hon. Friend recognises that the A21 is vital to his constituency and to economic development in that area.</p>
	<p>There are essentially four schemes: Tonbridge to Pembury, Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst, the Lamberhurst bypass, and the Flimwell to Robertsbridge improvements. Before 1997, the only schemes that had been given any priority were the Tonbridge to Pembury scheme and the Lamberhurst bypass. The Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst scheme had no long-term commitment in 1996. There was no funding; there were just some plans. Then there is the Flimwell to Robertsbridge scheme. In fact, many of the improvements&mdash;considerable though they were and despite being valuable to many of the communities on that road&mdash;were abandoned in 1996 with no view to reinstating them. It is important that we put the debate in context, because we are doing a great deal, as I shall outline.</p>
	<p>The debate comes at an opportune time because next Wednesday, 9 March, we will see the opening of the Lamberhurst bypass. Parliamentary business permitting, I hope to be there to cut the tape and see the traffic go through. However, I believe that some parliamentary business may keep a number of us here, rather than allowing us to be elsewhere. The opening of the bypass follows on from my announcement on 17 February this year of the preferred route for the improvement of the Flimwell to Robertsbridge section of the A21. That was the scheme that was abandoned in 1996. Those schemes, along with the entry of two other A21 schemes into the Government's targeted programme of improvements&mdash;the Tonbridge to Pembury dualling in July 2003 and the Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst improvement in May 2004&mdash;demonstrate the Government's commitment to the upgrading of the A21, not only in Kent, but through East Sussex.</p>
	<p>After less than two years of construction, the Lamberhurst bypass will open next week, at a cost of &pound;19 million. Although we had hoped to have an early opening of the bypass last autumn, it is now back on target and will be opened next week. This much needed bypass will bring relief to the village of Lamberhurst. The sinuous alignment of the A21 there does not comply with current design and operational requirements, and there are steep gradients on either side of the village. As a result, any incident or routine maintenance on the existing road quickly leads to delay and congestion. The volume of traffic now passing through the village causes community severance and a decrease in air quality, particularly at peak times and during the summer months. On completion, the bypass will remove approximately two thirds of existing trunk road traffic from the village. That will reduce congestion, delay and vehicle pollution in the village, which will benefit not only residents but those on longer journeys from the M25&mdash;perhaps all the way to my hon. Friend's constituency.</p>
	<p>As with all improvements to the A21, this scheme is located in the high weald area of outstanding natural beauty; the design and construction of the scheme has consequently been handled in a way that respects the sensitivity of the environment through which it passes. Of particular note is the land bridge that forms part of the scheme. A land bridge is somewhat wider than a normal bridge with space on each side for planting.</p>
	<p>As I mentioned earlier, the scheme for dualling the A21 from the end of the Tonbridge bypass to the start of the Pembury bypass entered the Government's targeted programme of improvements in July 2003. In December 2004, the Government announced the investment of &pound;950 million in regional transport infrastructure in the south-east. That is in addition to the &pound;1 billion being invested in national schemes, which includes a major upgrading of the M25.</p>
	<p>Even with that level of investment, the number of schemes coming forward was greater than could be accommodated, and decisions had to be made on which schemes could be included in the programme. It was subsequently decided that the A21 Tonbridge to Pembury dualling scheme would be remitted to the regions for advice on priorities. Remitting schemes to the regions is happening throughout the country. We are trying to engage the local regional bodies in informing decisions on major schemes; in the past, the Highways Agency may have had a link with local bodies, but not the sort that we now intend. If the scheme is a priority for the south-east, I am sure that it will be indicated to us through the Highways Agency; the scheme can then move up the agenda.</p>

	<p>Surely the hon. Gentleman will have noted that the Government are providing the funding for the new hospital, as well as the money for the road. He did not say that, and anyone reading the report of the debate might reflect on the probability of either of those things happening under a Conservative Government, if that had continued from 1997, or in the unlikely event of a Conservative Government after the next general election. I have said that whatever the state of progress of the dualling of the section of the road in question, the Highways Agency is willing to consider how the hospital can have a full opening when it is completed.</p>
	<p>The Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst improvement entered the Government's targeted programme of improvements in May 2004. The scheme will link the southern end of the Pembury bypass to the northern end of the Lamberhurst bypass. When that scheme and the Tonbridge to Pembury dualling have been completed the A21 will be a continuous dual carriageway from the M25 to the south of Lamberhurst. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the completion of those schemes in due course will bring significant improvement to the existing A21 through Kent.</p>
	<p>In line with the Government's announcement in December 2004 the scheme will not be constructed until after 2008, and it has also been remitted to the regions for advice on priority. Moving further down the A21, the Government are aware of the problems on the section between Lamberhurst and Flimwell. Both the Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst and Flimwell to Robertsbridge schemes will provide journey time and accident savings, with Kippings Cross to Lamberhurst providing the missing link, so to speak, between the Pembury bypass and the Lamberhurst bypass, and the Flimwell to Robertsbridge stretch providing a reduction in community severance.</p>
	<p>The Highways Agency has been liaising with the hon. Gentleman about the development of measures to deal with problems at the largest accident cluster on the relevant stretch of the A21, on which I know my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye has a view&mdash;the Bedgebury junction on the short stretch of dual carriageway north of Flimwell. It is planned that the measures will be implemented in May, and, together with other small scale safety schemes that are to be brought forward as and when they are identified, they are considered sufficient to deal with the safety issues until a scheme for the upgrading can be brought forward in due course.</p>
	<p>The matter of the safety of the Bedgebury junction was identified during consultation on the Flimwell to Robertsbridge scheme. Consequently that scheme has been extended northwards to include the junction and a roundabout is now planned to replace the existing junction. The Flimwell to Robertsbridge improvement is the fourth major scheme on the A21. Hon. Members will recall that it is the one that was abandoned in 1996. Although only a small part of the scheme is in Kent&mdash;most of it is in East Sussex&mdash;it demonstrates the Government's total commitment to the upgrading of the A21.</p>
	<p>I announced the preferred route for the scheme only two weeks ago, on 17 February, and that marked yet another major step forward for the A21 to Hastings. In addition to tackling the safety issues at Bedgebury that five-and-a-half-mile scheme will provide much needed traffic relief to the villages of Flimwell, Hurst Green and Silver Hill.</p>
	<p>To conclude, I hope that the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells and his right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling will appreciate that with four major schemes on the A21 the Government are committed to its upgrading. The Lamberhurst bypass will open next week and others will follow in due course. I hope that the debate has been a reasonable airing of the issues, but if the hon. Gentleman wants further discussion with me and the Department I shall be happy for that to happen.</p>

	<p>I am very happy to have secured the debate after several attempts to do so. I have been lucky.</p>
	<p>I want to focus on two things. First, how can we make local freight movements environmentally sound and improve them on non-road connections to the ports of Tees and Hartlepool? Secondly, I want the freight originating in my area to be switched from road to rail. My constituency is a typical Tees valley constituency. Many of my constituents work in traditional industries such as chemicals, steel, heavy engineering and mining&mdash;industries that generate a large tonnage of bulk products and use large volumes of bulk products in their manufacturing processes.</p>
	<p>Other industries in my constituency are also bulk producers. At Boulby in east Cleveland, we have Britain's only deep potash mine, which directly employs some 600 people and produces potash and rock salt. Teesside is also home to Britain's largest deep-sea ports,   which regularly host huge vessels of more than 200,000 tonnes. Tees and Hartlepool&mdash;operated by PD Ports, Logistics and Shipping&mdash;represent the second largest port in Britain in terms of tonnage and handle a significant amount of the United Kingdom's exports. That tonnage has the potential to grow very rapidly.</p>
	<p>More than 53 million tonnes of goods of all sorts are moved through local ports per annum. Steel, chemicals, general goods and potash are all moved in bulk. The port is becoming an important player in roll-on, roll-off ferry freight operations and is also able to handle container traffic. Goods pour in from all continents, although much is moved in ways that do not impact on the local road network. For example, potash and salt from the mine at Boulby are shipped by rail freight wagons direct to the port five times a day. Similarly, often five or more trains per day carry steel to the docks. Many liquid chemicals coming into the port are shipped to the end users by pipeline. However, much of the traffic still ends up on local roads and moves through my constituency on its way further north or to Scotland or the midlands.</p>
	<p>A good proportion of such traffic accesses the national road network, but much of it mixes with local traffic on some of the busiest roads in my constituency. The A172, known as the Marton road, takes more than 12,000 vehicles a day. In some places, the road is only slightly wider than the average country highway. It runs through residential areas and also serves the largest hospital in the Tees valley area, the James Cook university hospital. Drastic minimalisation of the HGV traffic using that road would free up the commuter flows and make access to the hospital quicker for everyone.</p>
	<p>There is a far bigger reason for it being desirable to improve rail connections to the port: that would allow the port to pursue ambitious expansion plans and also ensure that we could even out UK regional disparities. As most people know, the global shipping trade is increasing almost exponentially. Ship sizes are increasing to accommodate more exports and larger containers. Those factors combine to produce a requirement for increased UK and mainland Europe port capabilities to accommodate the new bigger ships, each carrying more than 8,000 containers. More and larger UK port capacity is required, and deep-sea capacity is necessary for the UK to remain competitive in that important growth market.</p>
	<p>The main container-handling ports are in the south of England. Overcrowding and delays at those ports are getting worse. Exporters to the UK do not place great weight on the exact port location. The most important factors are capacity, waiting time and turnaround on unloading and loading. Southampton container terminal has suffered problems with congestion of berths, long dwell times for stored containers and delays for hauliers collecting boxes.</p>
	<p>Felixstowe recently opened its completed port extension four years after applying for permission, but the capacity created will cope with only one year's anticipated growth in UK deep-sea container volumes. Other ports, including Felixstowe and Harwich, are awaiting the outcome of public inquiries on planning applications for new terminals. More than 2 million containers entering the UK each year are destined for locations in the north. The southern location of the main UK deep-sea ports means longer road journeys to deliver to the north of England, creating further congestion and pollution.</p>
	<p>Bringing containers to the south for road transfer to the north adds, on average, about 150 miles per container to the journey. That process creates congestion and adds to pollution. In the south, the rail lines are already overworked with commuter passenger traffic. Acting to improve connections to Tees port would take pressure off the national UK road network. As recently as July 2004, introducing the Government's transport White Paper, the Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;We also intend to take a long-term approach to port development and will publish a review of the policy framework for ports by the end of next year.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 20 July 2004; Vol. 424, c. 160.]</p>
	<p>PD Ports' deep-sea container port development at Tees port would help to ensure that the UK was in a position to exploit the growing global shipping market and on a level playing field with its European competitors.</p>
	<p>The existing port and planned development will attract retailers and others to construct import and distribution centres in the Tees area. There is room to develop up to six distribution centres near Tees port, each capable of providing up to 200 to 300 new jobs. The deep-sea container port development will also create between 200 and 300 new dock-related positions and a significant number of indirect jobs in the ports, logistics and shipping sectors, estimated at between 1,000 and 1,500.</p>
	<p>Creating that gateway to the north would remove more than 1 million containers from the UK's southern roads, thereby drastically reducing congestion, but the Government need to take a strategic view of all UK port capacity, particularly that in the north, before deciding whether to allow southern ports to expand. The key to improving UK national port structure and to the aspirations of the ports of Tees and Hartlepool lies in enhancing port rail links.</p>

	<p>Based on my conversations with the management of Tees port, which is in my constituency although close to that of my hon. Friend, I can confirm that they are willing and ambitious to expand their container resources hugely. Their proposal would generate about 3,000 jobs, which are much needed in the Tees valley, as it still has higher unemployment than much of the rest of the country. Tees port management assert that Tees port could supply much of the north of England's container traffic needs. Is it my hon. Friend's understanding that supplying that traffic by rail, which is the optimal way of doing it, would require substantial enhancement of the gauge and tunnelling of rail links? Is he arguing for such investment?</p>

	<p>I thank my hon. and learned Friend for that contribution. I am about to turn to the issue of rail. I endorse everything she said; it is in similar spirit to what Tees port management said to me.</p>
	<p>Tees port is linked by a spur line originating on the Saltburn to Darlington rail corridor. An analysis of the necessary improvements shows the need for signalling improvements on the spur. It is estimated that those would cost &pound;1.2 million and produce savings in reduced road transport costs of more than &pound;17.9 million in 10   years. The rest of the branch line would need investment to carry what are called &quot;high cube&quot; large containers, which are the industry standard. That would require gauge improvements to a tunnel near Yarm or the provision of a new chord on to the east coast main line near Darlington. That might also look costly, but I believe that that cost would be more than outweighed by the savings made in getting HGVs off the road network.</p>
	<p>Where do we go from here? I believe that the essential starting point must be for the Strategic Rail Authority and Network Rail to see the great opportunity of improving links to Tees port. Tragically, as things stand, they do not see it. Indeed, in the key freight document &quot;Gauging Policy&quot;, issued in November 2004, the SRA identified only two &quot;strategic route priorities&quot; for gauging improvements. Amazingly, both are in the south. One priority is to improve the line from Southampton to the west midlands; the other is to improve the line from Felixstowe to the east midlands and West Yorkshire. The short and comparatively cheap option of improving the corridor from Tees port to the national network is considered only a possible future opportunity.</p>
	<p>I ask the Minister to ask the SRA and her officials to query that policy, as it only adds to yet more investment for the relatively wealthy south and does not even begin to address the issue of the key port access improvements identified in the Northern Way growth strategy. Those improvements could be made quickly and cheaply. If PD Ports knew that there was genuine commitment to them, it would be prepared to invest in new expanded port facilities. Indeed, my hon. and learned Friend has heard it say so several times. This is a great opportunity for public investment and for generating private investment.</p>
	<p>I conclude by saying that I hope I have enhanced the case for improving the environment and so benefiting my constituents, for helping the economy of part of the north-east and for reducing the environmental overheating of the south-east. In short, I propose a golden solution&mdash;a win-win situation for my constituents, the Tees valley in general and the UK as a whole. It richly deserves to be considered an overarching issue for the policy document that the Government are preparing and which will be issued later this year.</p>
	<p>I hope that I have made my case seriously and that the Minister responds with positive suggestions.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East (Dr. Kumar) on securing the debate and on providing the Chamber with the opportunity to discuss sustainable freight distribution in the north and through the Tees port. He has raised several issues that I shall try to address.</p>
	<p>The Government are committed to supporting industry by helping to ensure the efficient, free and reliable movement of goods. Our policies to achieve that are set out in &quot;The Future of Transport&quot; and &quot;The Future of Rail&quot; White Papers, providing a framework in which the freight industry can contribute to our continuing economic growth.</p>
	<p>We have made real progress. Rail freight volume has increased steadily, rising by more than 45 per cent. since 1995. Almost 19 billion tonnes of freight were moved by rail in 2004. The market share of freight moved by rail has also increased since 1995, and it is estimated that industry has invested some &pound;1.5 billion in rail freight since privatisation.</p>
	<p>Certain rail freight initiatives are also being driven forward, the most important of which is the proposal that freight operators and their customers will be given long-term access contracts. That will provide the stability and certainty needed to enable the industry to grow and invest. Indeed, that process has already started. The Office of the Rail Regulator is currently consulting the industry on this very matter.</p>
	<p>Of course, structural issues, though important, are not the be all and end all of the Government's support for rail freight. The Department for Transport also provides extremely significant levels of financial support to take freight off road and on to rail through direct and indirect subsidy. Perhaps the most important way in which the Government provide funding is through the funding of the national rail network. Freight-operating companies are charged only for the incremental costs that they impose through their use of the network. All the core costs of the network are picked up through track access charges paid by franchised passenger operators, and by direct grant from the Government.</p>
	<p>The Government also provide substantial grant support for freight&mdash;well over &pound;20 million a year for each of the next two years. That support has helped to create the impressive growth in rail freight that I mentioned, and the company neutral revenue support scheme has taken more than 600,000 container journeys off the roads in the past year.</p>
	<p>However, my hon. Friend really wants to know what the Government are doing for Tees valley, and I am happy to tell him, and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird), that the Government are doing a great deal. Two major grants have been made under the company neutral revenue support scheme to support the transport of intermodal containers out of Tees port by rail. They will provide about &pound;200,000 of funding this year and in each of the next two years, and will take up to 4,000 containers a year off the roads of the Tees valley.</p>
	<p>In addition, the SRA has recently announced a track access grant for the movement of chemical products from Tees port to Workington, which will remove a further 1,462 lorry journeys from the roads. Finally, in 2000, we made two substantial freight facilities grants, totalling over &pound;800,000, to provide funding to support capital investment. That supported the transport of potash to the port, and the facilities became operational in 2002. Those grants are helping to remove 9,700 lorry journeys from the road every year. The Government's commitment to supporting the transfer of freight from road to rail in the Tees valley and beyond should therefore be very clear.</p>
	<p>It is, however, vital to ensure that the Government get the best possible value for money from their freight grants programmes, and last month the Department for Transport outlined its proposals for future freight grants through the sustainable distribution fund. That will ensure that grant funding is allocated across rail, water and road schemes in a way that focuses clearly on the objectives of reducing congestion, pollution and the impact on the environment. With the creation of that fund, we were also pleased to announce the reopening of the freight facilities grant&mdash;from April 2007&mdash;to rail schemes in England, enabling applications to be made for grants to purchase new assets or to replace assets necessary for the carriage of freight by rail. That will help to meet the need for rail freight facilities in the regions, where they can be shown to offer real benefits.</p>
	<p>I take my hon. Friend's point about the adverse impact of HGVs on roads and congestion, and the real need to move freight from the road to rail. I can assure him that the way in which congestion impacts on pollution and other environmental issues will be a key factor in determining which schemes receive support. Taking freight on to the railways is not the only way to tackle congestion. We also need to ensure that we make best use of existing road capacity&mdash;and the Government are providing important funding to ensure that that is done.</p>
	<p>In Middlesbrough, for instance, the council has been   awarded a local transport plan block allocation of &pound;3.94 million for 2005&ndash;06. That will support small schemes across the borough to reduce congestion and improve accessibility, safety and the local environment. The figure includes more than &pound;800,000 for structural maintenance of the A171 Cargo Fleet lane, which parallels the A172 Marton road and provides access to the western end of Tees port. The Department for Transport has provisionally approved up to &pound;11 million of funding for the major north Middlesbrough accessibility improvements scheme, subject to further development.</p>
	<p>The Department is keen to ensure that the freight industry has the necessary support and infrastructure to deliver a continued rise in rail freight movement. I understand my hon. Friend's point about the impact of increased traffic from south-east ports on road networks across the country, including those in the Tees valley. That is why the Government have invested heavily in infrastructure projects that benefit the transfer of freight from port by rail. My hon. and learned Friend raised the issue of PD Teesport's intention to proceed with a container facility there. The Department looks forward to receiving that ambitious application. Indeed, we are doing much ongoing work in order to facilitate the use of large containers on rail.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend spoke about the infrastructure work that has to be done to facilitate that move, but much has already been done. Last October saw the completion of the Felixstowe-Nuneaton gauge enhancement project on time and under budget. That will enable the larger 9 ft 6 in containers to be carried by rail from our largest container port to key freight terminals in the midlands, Wales and the north of England. Likewise, capacity improvements in the Cherwell valley, linking the port of Southampton to the west coast main line, were completed in May last year, which will benefit freight as well as passenger rail.</p>
	<p>The SRA has done some extremely good work with the industry in developing a good, value-for-money proposal to make the entire line between Southampton and the west coast main line suitable for 9ft 6in containers. The Government are now discussing with the industry how the project can be funded. However, the enhancement does not need to have the word freight attached to it to be of benefit. The upgrade to the west coast main line is expected to provide increased capacity for freight traffic from the channel ports, and will considerably improve links to the north west and Scotland. The increased level of track renewals being carried out by Network Rail is also of enormous benefit to freight operators.</p>
	<p>As my hon. Friend knows, having inherited a shambles of an infrastructure, the Government are making a huge investment, which is greatly improving the opportunities for carrying freight by rail. Indeed, the Office of the Rail Regulator last week went out to consultation on a new framework for investment in rail infrastructure enhancements. The Government's agenda is to encourage the carriage of freight by rail whenever possible. Clearly, my hon. Friend is rightly impatient for that agenda to benefit his constituency. However, it does not stop at the south-east ports. It is important also for the north-east and the rest of the country.</p>
	<p>As I said at the beginning, we are committed to driving forward the continued success of rail freight, both across the country and in the north-east of England. I assure my hon. Friend and my right hon. and learned Friend that, as part of the new regional assessment of transport needs and the new structure of rail, we will endeavour to achieve the best for rail freight and sustainable freight distribution in general.</p>
	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate and for representing his constituents, who I know are concerned about congestion and about the regional development of the north-east. My hon. Friend wants to ensure that the port facilities in his patch create the best possible environment for economic development.</p>
