<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.372.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="372"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060214/halltext/60214h01.htm#60214h01_spnew26">
	<p pid="a.372.4/1">I would be loth to break totally with the new Labour indoctrination which I have gladly undergone in the past decade and say that results, targets and impositions are not everything. However, given my constituency and my background, I believe that, not only is the non-targetable stuff nice to have, it helps to create human beings who are capable and who have the social skills to take advantage of the education on offer and then make advances academically. It is not an either/or situation. People understand where I come from on the question of teaching social behaviour alongside literacy and numeracy and so on. That toolkit&mdash;that empathy on a one-to-one level&mdash;whether it be through sport, arts or other areas, is one of the greatest gifts that education can provide and, coincidentally, raises educational attainment as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/2">The improved ethos cited by the Government, the Government-in-waiting and others as a reason for the expansion of faith schools is a natural side-effect of their middle-class intake. Of course a school with better-off pupils will benefit from pupils with good behaviour and the right level of social skills. That is exactly what is lacking in constituencies such as mine. That situation needs to be put right and not aggravated by admissions policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/3">I hope to see the Minister this afternoon about the very issue of teaching social behaviour in primary schools and teaching parenting and social skills in secondary schools in Nottingham. The presence or absence of that teaching is central to future academic performance. Particularly disproportionately in non-faith schools, its absence undermines the ability to create the very ethos that, along with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I think should be part of as many schools as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/4">An Ofsted spokesman recently told <i>The Times Educational Supplement </i>that:</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/5" class="indent">&quot;selection, even on religious grounds, is likely to attract well-behaved children from stable backgrounds.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/6">The Government quite rightly attach much importance to a school's ethos. To say that a positive ethos can be achieved only through religion is absurd and quite frankly insulting to those of us&mdash;the majority of the British public&mdash;of no faith and to the majority who teach and work in non-faith schools. It is sometimes possible to listen to this debate and imagine that those from non-religious backgrounds are a rampant minority jumping up and down and making a lot of noise, when, actually, most people in the UK do not feel strongly about religion and do not send their children to faith schools. Those schools attract so much attention, as well as attracting so much taxpayers' money, that one would be forgiven for thinking that the argument had become slightly out of perspective.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/7">A school's ethos is not merely a product of the religious or philosophical viewpoint of its staff and pupils; it is based on shared human values. Teachers in non-religious community schools frequently have strong ethical and moral values with which to support their pupils. In the city of Nottingham, there is a non-faith school&mdash;not in my constituency&mdash;called Middleton primary school, which was praised by Ofsted for its</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/8" class="indent">&quot;Good religious education provision and very good personal development&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/9">Ofsted continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/10" class="indent">&quot;this includes their spiritual, moral, social and cultural development. Pupils show a high level of maturity . . . They enjoy taking responsibility for creating a harmonious community in which everyone helps each other. Older pupils say that their first responsibility is to set a good example for younger ones and they do so very well . . . The supportive atmosphere means that each child feels very special.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/11">We can see the heart of decent, civilised human values&mdash;helping each other and building a better community&mdash;in action, and not necessarily in the context of a faith school.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/12">Colleagues who support faith schools and their expansion are entitled to their view, but they should be careful not to see faith schools as the only route to a decent ethos and education, because that is not the case. Middleton primary school has children and teachers from between 20 and 30 different faith groups. Let us think of the benefit to those children and what they accrue from learning about other faiths and cultures from such a young age. What are the chances of those children growing up to be dogmatic and intolerant of others after such a positive early life experience?</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/13">Often the schools that parade faith are single-faith schools. They escape the national curriculum on religious education and they can, and do, deny a rounded multi-faith education to pupils. That ossifies the monocultural views&mdash;often of the older generation and community leaders&mdash;which are often the opposite of those of the younger generation, many of whom will be forced to attend minority-faith schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/14">On the subject of ethics, I have to wonder at the ethical practices employed by certain faith schools. The head teacher of an Oldham Church of England school&mdash;typical of many&mdash;was reported in <i>The Times Educational Supplement </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-22">22 June 2001</phrase> as</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/15" class="indent">&quot;happy to admit that many 'Church of England' parents actually attend services with the express purpose of winning a place at his school.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.372.4/16">It was a badge of honour that people lied to get into his school. In a June 2000 NOP poll, 8 per cent. of parents admitted attending church just to get their children into a faith school. The real figures are probably higher. If someone is a caring parent, desperate to get the best for their child, they might take that route.</p>

	<p pid="a.374.1/1">I hope that I have been getting to that right the way through my remarks, but I support the passion with which my hon. Friend speaks. The issue is not about denying somebody else a good education; it is about letting everybody have a good education. Although all constituencies may not be in the same position as mine, many colleagues have areas in their constituencies that they feel are at least as deprived as my constituency. We all want the best for those children. That is what Ministers and the Opposition want, and together I am sure that we can find a way through the problem. At the moment, we often deny youngsters the chance of going to their local school unless we make liars out of parents&mdash;forcible, conscripted, pretend armies of believers. I do not know whether people in the various Churches tick boxes as we do in Government, saying, &quot;Let's pretend that we've got thousands and thousands of believers, because we've got an active school.&quot; That is not the reason why those parents go to a particular church.</p>

	<p pid="a.375.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, because of course a school will admit any child up to the point at which the school is over-subscribed. May I take the opportunity to ask him whether he really meant in response to his hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East that it is a zero sum game? The hon. Member for Wolverhampton North-East suggested that for every child who is advantaged, there is another child who is disadvantaged. Surely it is the intention of the Government and everybody in this House to create more good schools and more places in good schools. So it is not necessarily a zero sum game.</p>

	<p pid="a.375.4/1">I hope that we would all agree that we want an abundance of good schools everywhere and every school to be a good school. That is fundamental to my beliefs on education: there should not be some good schools, whereby if one is lucky enough, one can get in, leaving behind sink schools which may be created by creaming off the best youngsters; there should be a global view of where good schools should be. They should be in every constituency in every area, and not the product of a private members' club arrangement, whereby certain children are allowed in either because of the way that they look, their race and the way that they talk, or&mdash;the one that we still have on our statute books&mdash;because of the religious faith that their parents profess.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.4/2">It is amazing that we are having this debate in the 21st century. If we just changed the term from religion to race, and put ourselves in the position of those who want racial segregation, we could almost be transported back to the deep south or to the UK's education system 150 years ago. It is unacceptable and intolerable in this day and age.</p>

	<p pid="a.377.0/1">My hon. Friend anticipates a further remark later in my speech. I add one point: I was fortunate enough to be drawn No. 1 in Northern Ireland questions last week, and I raised with the Minister the question of what might have happened when the troubles began some 30 years ago had all new schools been non-denominational. What would have happened if an integrated schooling system had slowly developed, year after year, over 30 years? Surely, we would have been in a far healthier position than we are now. Young Catholics and Protestants would have met each other day to day, sat next to each other, played in the playground, fought, argued and talked. As a result, they would have realised that the other kids were just like the kids down their street. My worry&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland touched on it&mdash;is that if we carry on building up faith schools, in 30 years' time we will regret not having taken action to prevent the problems that I have described. It is in our gift to take that action right now, and that is an onerous responsibility on all hon. Members present.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/2">In education, as we know, choice for one group can often come at the expense of choice for another group. As faith schools choose their pupils&mdash;not the other way round&mdash;their proliferation will decrease choice for the majority of parents, unless they are prepared to pretend to join a religion. That pretend piety is a skill or tool that is almost always employed by middle-class parents, who get to know their local priest or vicar. As usual, it is the most deprived families, such as those in my constituency, who lose out. A May 2003 report by the Education and Skills Committee, which was based on evidence from numerous experts, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/3" class="indent">&quot;In practice, parents have found that the reality of school diversity and choice can act to limit rather than expand their options for their children's education.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/4">That leads me to the issue of community cohesion, which has been raised by many colleagues from both sides of the House. Faith schools can seriously damage the health of the communities that they are meant to serve. Those in poor areas often serve few local pupils, with middle-class pupils travelling from other areas to attend. A 2005 study by the IRIS think-tank&mdash;the Institute for Research in Integrated Studies&mdash;found one faith school at which 10 per cent. of pupils were eligible for free school meals, in an area where 45 per cent. of local children were eligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/5">School is the primary means by which children mix with one another. The other children they meet at school are the people they will grow up with, who will influence them and shape their outlook on the world. Schools that are segregated on any basis, including religion, serve only to narrow children's view of the world and of those who are different from them. Such a policy creates religious apartheid in schools and pulls up the drawbridges&mdash;it is a policy of retreat from the multicultural, multi-ethnic society that is our future. We tamper with that future at our peril.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/6">I fundamentally believe that it is not acceptable to segregate children on the grounds of race. If anyone disagrees with that and feels that we should do so, I would gladly give way.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.380.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="380"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060214/halltext/60214h01.htm#60214h01_spnew48">
	<p pid="a.380.0/1">Again, many who support the expansion of faith-based schools might fear that their children will otherwise be plunged into a valueless, soulless, faithless education. On the contrary, it is a far more enriching experience for a young person to know about all religions, to understand all their friends and colleagues in the same classroom, and to draw on that broader education. Some might then be able to make up their own minds on how to express their spirituality and their views. However, that might create even greater fear in those who believe in single-faith schools&mdash;but to pursue that issue would be to delve into the depths of religious philosophy, and I shall stay with the expansion, or not, of faith schools rather than enter that boggy area.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/2">To finish my point about Northern Ireland, Lord Dubs in the other place quoted a survey that found that 82 per cent. of parents in Northern Ireland supported integrated education, and 52 per cent. said that their only reason for not sending their children to an integrated school was that there was not one in their locality. Many parents on the mainland are not sending their kids to the school of their choice, because they cannot send them to the school in their locality. I worry that if the expansion continues without proper debate or discussion in Parliament, or between those of faith and those with no faith, we could find that most people do not want to send their children to a faith-based school and do not support non-integrated education, but they have to lump it because that is all there is.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/3">If a Member of Parliament in Westminster wanted to send their child to a local secondary school, they would have to get a letter from their vicar, and if they chose the school second furthest from the House of Commons, a letter from their priest. They would not be able to send their child to the local secondary school.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/4">Surely, the answer to these problems is, at least as a first step, for all new schools to be community schools and for no further schools to be converted to religious schools. It is barely credible that we are talking in these terms in the 21st century. Some would argue that that would push more parents to send their children to religious private schools outside state control. If that were their choice, so be it. What is objectionable is we as taxpayers not only have to pay for such schools, but that our children are barred from attending them because they are not of the right religion. Faith schools are intrinsically selective. They attract children by religion&mdash;real or professed&mdash;and, all too often, religion is a proxy for class or race. There is immense scope for faith schools to choose &quot;desirable&quot; children who are likely to boost their league table standing and to palm off &quot;undesirables&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/5">Where could the Government go from here? Where would a reforming Government go? They could oblige all schools, including faith schools, to follow a curriculum of broad and balanced religious education, such as that laid out in the new but non-statutory national framework for religious education. In the case of faith schools, that could be in addition to whatever optional religion-specific teaching those schools were permitted to offer. The Government could oblige faith schools to be non-selective, making their intakes truly inclusive, like those of other schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/6">Governments could reform the law to remove the requirement on community schools to have a daily act of broadly Christian collective worship, making such schools more welcoming places for families of no faith and of other faiths, giving them the broader education that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East mentioned&mdash;the rich variety of spirituality and human values of which we dismiss 98 per cent. when we send youngsters to a mono-faith school.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/7">Governments could reduce any desire for separate schools on the part of minority faiths by making community schools more inclusive and accommodating, or they could refuse to use taxpayers' money to subsidise schools from which most local taxpayers' children were banned on the grounds of religion, just as we already do if they are banned on the grounds of race. We do it for race; we should do it for religion.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/8">Secular schools offer an environment in which children of all backgrounds can mix. I repeat that we should put the matter into perspective. Most schools are secular places in which youngsters are not forced to take one religious view, and where they can learn about religions and none without fear of bias or indoctrination. Let us give children the facts in schools, and leave parents to guide their children along the spiritual or non-spiritual path of their choosing.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/9">We have had a good debate, and I am glad that so many hon. Members from all parts of the House have participated. I have deliberately taken a long time in order to facilitate an exchange with colleagues and have, I hope, left enough time for others to make their own speeches and for Front Benchers to wind up the debate. I hope that, ultimately, the thing that will unite us will be ensuring that the Government move towards a position where parents and children want not religious schools but good schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.382.0/1">I will endeavour to move swiftly, because the subject is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase>, because he has clearly demonstrated the great need for a full and open debate. I am not convinced that time will allow us that this morning, unfortunately, but that was the one part of his argument that was absolutely convincing.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.0/3">Personally, I am supportive of faith schools but I recognise that there is an alternative view that our education should be entirely secular. A lot of questions need to be openly and honestly addressed. I concur that the ideal is good local community schools, which means investing adequately in all our schools. It is not sufficient to attack schools that have more facilities than another; we need to attack the problem of the traditional lack of investment. Even where I come from, which is a relatively affluent part of the country, there are two areas where for years and years children in secondary modern schools were badly let down. I do not see that as a consequence of the faith school.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.0/4">It is highly important that community schools are incredibly sensitive to multi-faith sensibilities. We are where we are because of the history of Anglican, non-conformist and Roman Catholic schools and the partnerships that formed over centuries, which were reinforced by the Education Act 1944. By 1998, we as Liberal Democrats felt that if partnership is offered to Anglican and Roman Catholic Church schools, it would be unacceptable to deny partnership to schools from other faiths. That is a difficulty, but it gives us a great challenge. Here I do agree with the hon. Gentleman: right across the country&mdash;although it obviously differs according to the circumstances&mdash;the challenge to us all is to promote co-operation, understanding, joint working and other arrangements that help bridge divides without losing the importance of individual faiths and ethos.</p>
	<p pid="a.382.0/5">I share the views on community integration. The Cantle and Ouseley reports noted the roles of schools, which are important for integration but can serve to fragment the community. The recent statement from David Bell, with all his expertise from Ofsted, expressed such reservations, too. We cannot ignore that; I absolutely agree. However, I recognise, as my party does, the popularity and success of many faith schools. Many are oversubscribed; many achieve higher than average GCSE and A-level scores. We certainly do not argue for the removal of state funding from existing schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.384.0/1">This is a very welcome and important debate. It has drawn attention effectively to the key issues that need to be aired and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on the easy going and open way in which he introduced it. The Opposition approach to faith schools is one of support. We believe in a diverse range of education provisions to cater for the varied demands of parents and pupils. The choice might not be perfect, but some imperfect choice is better than no choice at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/2">We also support faith schools because the majority of them deliver a high quality of education. In my constituency, the primary school with the best results in 2005 was St. Mary's Roman Catholic school in Bognor Regis; 91 per cent. of its pupils reached level 4 in English and 97 per cent. in science, and that school does not have a rarefied intake. It achieved those results because of the ethos that it has established. In the top 200 comprehensive schools in the secondary sector, 42 per cent. are faith schools, even though, overall, faith schools represent only 18 per cent. of the total.</p>

	<p pid="a.385.1/1">That may or may not be a better reason for the ethos, but the ethos of such schools is certainly different. Parents are so desperate to send their children to the school, because it has an ethos that they do not detect for whatever reason in other schools in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/2">Let us consider Catholic schools, in particular. In the key stage 2 results in 2005, nearly one in five of the best primary schools were Catholic; 21 of the top 115 primary schools in terms of their value-added element are Catholic, which is about 18 per cent., whereas they represent only about 10 per cent. of schools in total. In the secondary sector, 23 of the top 100 comprehensives are Catholic&mdash;more than twice the 10 per cent. that they ought to represent given the number of schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/3">Research undertaken for the Church's review group showed that Church of England schools achieve five percentage points above the usual average LEA school in their five or more GCSE results. There are similar high-achieving results in Jewish schools. We must ask why. The hon. Members for Nottingham, North and for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) argue that the results are high because the intake of the schools is skewed. The report by the Institute for Research and Integrated Strategies, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> referred, argues that voluntary-aided schools submitted a lower proportion of children eligible for free school meals compared with the eligibility criteria in the local postcode area of those schools. The disparity is not that huge; overall, it is 19 per cent. versus 14 per cent. The Catholic Education Service argues that the most likely reason for such a disparity was that its schools served a much wider geographical area than the immediate postcode area of the school. My understanding is that faith schools do not try to cherry-pick students.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/4">The value-added results of faith schools are far better than the average, which shows that, even if the intake were skewed slightly from 19 per cent. to 14 per cent. away from the average of free school meals&mdash;we cannot always control whether parents have to apply to such schools&mdash;that is not the key driver of higher standards compared with other non-faith based schools. If it were the sole reason for the better results, there would not be high value-added figures for faith schools.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.386.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1429" speakername="Nick Gibb" colnum="386"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060214/halltext/60214h01.htm#60214h01_spnew59">
	<p pid="a.386.1/1">There is academic research that proves the contrary. For example, the parliamentary answer to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" name="Mark Hoban">the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)</phrase> from the Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-28">28 November 2005</phrase> showed the percentage of pupils receiving free school meals and achieving five or more A* to C grades at GCSE. It illustrated different schools and different categories of proportions of free school meals. It showed faith schools out-performing similar non-faith schools with similar intakes of children with free school meals, and a much higher proportion of those children achieving higher grades.</p>
	<p pid="a.386.1/2">For example, I refer to a complex table, which shows that in 2004 of schools with between 35.1 per cent. and 50 per cent. of pupils eligible for free school meals, 25.9 per cent. of pupils in non-faith schools achieved five or more GCSE grades A* to C compared with 36 per cent. of such pupils who achieve those grades at faith schools. That figure is pretty typical across the range of tables that were shown in the Minister's reply. The more that we examine that parliamentary answer and the data that it contains, the less convincing is the reputation that faith schools achieve their results by skewing their intake. The fact is that many faith schools can develop an ethos and an approach to education that delivers higher levels of educational attainment. For example, Ofsted said about one faith school:</p>
	<p pid="a.386.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The school successfully imports to pupils the idea that the pursuit of excellence is part and parcel of the spiritual life of the school.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.386.1/4">It went on to say that the school's success is</p>
	<p pid="a.386.1/5" class="indent">&quot;due to the implementation of good practical approaches to teaching and school management within a strong framework of Christian values and ideals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.386.1/6">I do not accept that the high levels of achievement in faith schools are solely the result of the intake. The reason why parents&mdash;even non-religious parents&mdash;are so desperate to put their children into faith schools is often that the ethos, the discipline and the behaviour in such schools are more in tune with what they want for their children. They find that other schools in the locality simply do not have that ethos, not because of the intake of those schools but because the leadership of the schools takes a different philosophical and ethical approach to education.</p>
	<p pid="a.386.1/7">Catholic schools also tend to have a much more diverse ethnic mix than similar non-faith schools. As the Catholic Education Service said,</p>
	<p pid="a.386.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Catholic schools are truly comprehensive, resisting grammar school routes and welcoming children of every ability, including with Special Educational Needs, race and ethnic mix. The vast majority of Catholic VA schools, where they are oversubscribed, select only on the basis of religion.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.386.1/9">That statement was endorsed by Trevor Phillips, the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.386.1/10" class="indent">&quot;Data from OFSTED shows that when we look at the ethnic mix of schools, Catholic schools tend to be far more mixed than local authority schools. A healthy mix might be a school with a proportion of ethnic minority pupils somewhere between 5 per cent. and 40 per cent.&mdash;where these children neither predominate, nor are they isolated.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.386.1/11">He went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.386.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Among state schools, about a quarter (25.6 per cent.) fall into this group. But amongst Catholic schools, a third (32.5 per cent.) would fit this description. So the passion being spent on arguments about whether we need more or fewer faith schools is, in my view, misspent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.386.1/13">In all the debates in recent months about education policy, there has been an obsession about the intake of a school. It is an ideological obsession that says that the quality of a school is determined by its intake and that excellence or high levels of achievement can have been gained only by fiddling the admissions criteria. I do not accept that. The debate about faith schools, in particular, is dominated by ideological obsessions&mdash;the anti-religious, secularist movement on the one hand and those obsessed with the issue of how over-subscribed schools determine their admissions on the other. It is important that we do not let ideology determine education policy, whether it is ideology of the right or of the left. What matters is what works. It is clear that faith schools work. They are popular, they are oversubscribed, they have good behaviour and they achieve high levels of attainment. We need to focus on what works. It seems to me that faith schools do work. They are demanded by parents, and the state needs to ensure that they continue to be provided.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.387.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" speakername="Jacqui Smith" speakeroffice="The Minister for Schools"  colnum="387"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060214/halltext/60214h01.htm#60214h01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.387.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on what has been a very good debate. It has, of course, gone significantly wider than its title, and in the relatively short time left to me to respond I shall focus largely on admissions arrangements, although it is worth setting out, as other hon. Members have done, the historical context for the system of faith schools in this country. Those schools have for many years contributed to the education of our children. Almost 7,000 schools&mdash;nearly a third of all state schools&mdash;are faith-based, and the great majority of them are provided by the Christian Churches. Indeed, the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church established an education system in this country long before the state became involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.0/2">There is a perfectly respectable argument for moving to a secular education system in this country. I do not think that anyone&mdash;with the possible exception of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1935" name="Ken Purchase">the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase)</phrase>&mdash;has attempted to make that argument today. I therefore find it quite difficult to envisage our being willing to countenance the continuation of faith schools while deciding to shut off opportunities for other parents and faith-based groups who might want the same kind of publicly funded state education rather than to have to go independent. It is for that reason that the Government have welcomed schools of other faiths joining the maintained sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.0/3">I want to make clear the framework within which we expect such schools to operate. We expect every school in the maintained sector to work within the school admissions framework. All such schools have a statutory duty to comply with parental preference, offering parents a right of appeal if they cannot offer a place, and, since the Education Act 2002, faith schools, like all other maintained schools, have had to participate in the local authority co-ordination of the secondary school admissions process. They have also, of course, had to set their admissions policies after having regard to the school admissions code of practice, which gives guidance on what the Secretary of State considers to be good or poor practice. They also need to ensure that their arrangements are clear, fair and objective and that they serve the interests of all parents and children in their area; the method of assessing religious observance, where that is used, should be clearly stated and published. If other schools or local authorities believe that any school's arrangements are not fair, or are unlawful or discriminatory, or not in line with the code, they can object to the schools adjudicator. Schools have also worked through mandatory admissions forums, with their local authorities and other schools and academies, to discuss and improve local admissions arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.0/4">However, while most faith schools give some priority to members of their own faith, the 2002 Act&mdash;as I think <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> mentioned&mdash;made it unlawful for any school in the state system to refuse places to those of other faiths or no faith if they have vacancies. That means that it is no longer possible for schools to adopt the previous practice by which they could keep places vacant if they did not receive enough applications from members of their own faith&mdash;even if there were other applicants. The effect has been to ensure that faith schools that are not oversubscribed have become more inclusive for children of other faiths or none, and that they can no longer hold on to empty places when children need and want them.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.0/5">There has been considerable and understandable discussion about the extent to which faith-based schools equate with social segregation. I acknowledge those concerns but increasingly I think&mdash;and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> made the point&mdash;that segregation in schools is frequently as much an accident of patterns of employment and housing as a reflection of school admissions arrangements. That is not to say that we do not believe that faith schools need to be inclusive of other faiths and maintain admissions policies that admit pupils from their local area, as well as those of their faith. That is why the existing school admissions code of practice&mdash;I shall talk shortly about changes that we propose to make to it&mdash;already encourages schools to widen their policies to contribute to community cohesion.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.0/6">I have a fact to contribute to the debate: it is not statistically the case that there are large discrepancies in the social make-up of faith schools as compared to non-faith schools. For the most disadvantaged schools&mdash;those with more than 21 per cent. of their children receiving free school meals&mdash;the proportion of voluntary-aided and other schools is broadly similar. The average free school meal rate in the two categories is similar. In voluntary-aided schools it is 33.8 per cent, whereas in non-voluntary-aided schools it is 34.1 per cent. However, it appears, from the achievement levels in those equivalent most disadvantaged schools, that despite those similarities voluntary-aided schools are making an important contribution for disadvantaged pupils: 47.6 per cent. of pupils in voluntary-aided schools achieve five or more GCSEs at A* to C grade, compared with 40.6 per cent. in non-voluntary-aided schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.0/7">There has been discussion about the extent to which faith schools should develop or are developing their admissions arrangements to ensure greater inclusiveness. The Archbishop of Canterbury, for example, several years ago committed the Church of England and all its schools to giving priority for at least some places to children of other faiths or none. That was a welcome pledge. Similarly, as we have heard, many Roman Catholic schools admit a high proportion of non-Catholic children, particularly in the inner cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.0/8">My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North rightly, I think, gave a challenge to the Church to take seriously its mission to tackle educational disadvantage. There are certainly good examples of how faith schools can work very well in contributing to community cohesion and tackling social and educational disadvantage in some of the new academies. The Liverpool academy has already been referred to. In a deprived area of the city it is an innovative partnership between the Catholic Church and the Church of England, and it does not use faith-based admissions. The Church of England sponsors six academies in partnership with businesses, the voluntary sector or other faith denominations. Other faith-based groups are supporting academies, in the vast majority of which there are no faith-based admissions criteria, and every one of them is firmly centred in its local community, with 100 per cent. of the pupils drawn from that community.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.0/9">That is important progress, but of course we recognise that there is still work to be done to improve the school admissions process. One aspect of that is ensuring that applications reflect parents' aspirations, and that parents are not put off because of what they view as the actual or potential selection arrangements of schools. That is why we shall present proposals for choice advisers to advise all parents&mdash;particularly those who have not always had the information and ability to make the right choices for their children. That is, in addition, why we will extend entitlement to free transport and tighten up, and change the status of, the school admissions code of practice, so that schools must &quot;act in accordance&quot; with it. We will provide much clearer guidance to schools, local authorities and the schools adjudicator on what we consider to be acceptable and unacceptable practice. We shall also legislate to prevent schools from interviewing as part of their process to determine whether a child should be admitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.0/10">We are concerned, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase> pointed out, to promote ethnic, religious and cultural tolerance, and respect among different groups of people living and working together. To that end, we already expect promoters of new schools to show how their proposals will help to promote community cohesion. That will be very clear in the future, and new and expanding schools will need to put forward their proposed admission arrangements; once a proposal has been approved, we will require, under new legislation, their admission arrangements to remain unchanged for the first three years of operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.0/11">We shall give admissions forums a stronger role. We will in particular expect them to monitor the impact of local admissions arrangements on social segregation, and give them the power both to prepare and publish reports on matters connected to admissions to maintained schools in their area and to refer objections to admission arrangements to the schools adjudicator.</p>

	<p pid="a.391.1/1">I am most grateful for the opportunity to have this debate and to the Minister for coming to listen to it. I thank him for the time that he gave to me recently, and I have no doubt that his reply to everything that my colleagues and I say will be similarly measured.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/2">It is St. Valentine's day and we should spare a thought for the wives, families and girlfriends of the marines of 42 Commando Royal Marines who left for Afghanistan today. I have no doubt that, as their commanding officer said, they are focused and full of energy, drive and aggression, but the girls they leave behind will not be. The next few months will be extremely difficult, dangerous and worrying for them, and we should bear them in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/3">I have made a couple of trips to Afghanistan. The first was immediately after the cessation of violence when I was in the hands of the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Anglian Regiment and felt extremely secure. The second was about 18 months later&mdash;a little over a year ago&mdash;when conditions were considerably worse. I took the opportunity to visit the graves of the 2nd Nottinghamshire Regiment, the old 59th Regiment of Foot, at the British memorial in Kabul. I will not talk about Britain's time in Afghanistan because I am sure that my former tutor, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase>, will do that much better than I can. However, it was interesting that on the wall was a memorial to Private Kitulagoda of the Royal Rifle Volunteers. He was a territorial army soldier who was killed about two years ago by a suicide bomber who was allegedly born in Britain. That is a chilling reminder of how conditions can deteriorate in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/4">As we stand on the verge of deploying extra military forces to Afghanistan, it is worth bearing in mind exactly what they will face when they get there. Over the past 10 days, 89 people have been killed in Afghanistan compared with 54 in Iraq. We have seen the first outbreaks of Sunni and Shi'a violence in Afghanistan. During the Shi'a festival of Ashura in Heart, five people were killed and 51 were injured, and a Sunni cleric was dragged from his house and abducted, apparently by supporters of the Shi'a cleric Abdul Aziz Hakim. The governor of Herat tellingly said:</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/5" class="indent">&quot;This is not the kind of thing that we are used to in Afghanistan. We do not have this kind of trouble between Sunni and Shi'a. This is caused by people trying to cause mischief.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/6">Similarly, 13 civilians were killed last week in Kandahar by a suicide bomb. That was the 14th bomb in Afghanistan during the past few months. The Taliban commander, Mullah Dadullah, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/7" class="indent">&quot;More and more people are joining us to become suicide bombers. Suicide bombings will continue against the coalition forces and their agents.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/8">If that is not chilling enough, last week eight Afghan soldiers were killed in action in Kunar province by an infrared detonated device, which is very similar, if not identical, to those devices that recently killed British soldiers in the southern part of Iraq. There is little doubt that the technology in Iraq has come from Iran. I can only speculate on how the technology is transferred from Iran to Iraq to Afghanistan, but it is interesting to note that in Nimruz province recently one Iraqi, one Iranian and two Kashmiris were arrested on the border. I probably do not need to remind anyone about Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's statements from Iraq that Afghanistan will become the second front in the war against the coalition.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/9">It is into that maelstrom that we are about to plunge more British soldiers. Afghanistan is no stranger to the British Army and the British Army is no stranger to Afghanistan. We had three semi-successful expeditions there in the 19th century and early part of the 20th century, and when operations began in Afghanistan in 2001, I thought that we would be able to bring it back to the condition that it reached during the 1960s when there was a democratic Government, when there were elected representatives, when there was peace throughout the country&mdash;if peace can ever be created in Afghanistan&mdash;and when the country was on its way to a new form of prosperity that it had not seen for many years. The British military intervention&mdash;the allied intervention&mdash;after <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> was correct and I salute those soldiers, sailors and airmen who took part in that expedition. I would not hesitate to support a similar expedition again if the circumstances pertained.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/10">However, things have changed big style, as the Americans would say. Let us not forget that we have had an operation in Afghanistan with a series of province reconstruction teams under the command of the international security assistance force in the north. However, little known and little remembered is the fact that in the south, under American operational command, a squadron of GR7 Harriers is operating under the rules of engagement in Operation Enduring Freedom.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/11">It is clear that our operations against terrorists or insurgents in the south, and our operations to reconstruct the country and in support of the Afghan Government, will develop. What will be our precise role in the south? I understand what a province reconstruction team is and that it can operate perfectly adequately, as it has done with great success in the north, but I wonder how successful that policy will be in a much less benign area in the south.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/12">We are told that one key task of the new deployment in the south is counter-narcotics. In December 2005, the operational plan for south Afghanistan was endorsed by NATO. Key military tasks were detailed, as were key support tasks. The key support task relating to counter-narcotics of the allied troops in the south is:</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/13" class="indent">&quot;To support the Afghan government and internationally sanctioned counter-narcotics efforts within limits&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/14">that is good military language&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/15" class="indent">&quot;although this will not include participation in poppy eradication or destruction of processing facilities or the taking of military action against narcotics producers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.391.1/16">What exactly will our role be against the production of narcotics and how will a balance will be struck between the warlords and the Taliban? Until now, the warlords have been against the Taliban&mdash;I am being simplistic&mdash;but much of their income derives from the poppy crop. With the destruction or interdiction of the poppy crop, how will we balance warlords against Taliban? Do we not stand in danger of allying the two against us? If we give incentives for poppies to be destroyed or their production curtailed, is it not likely that farmers will grow more poppies to get more money or more incentives in return?</p>

	<p pid="a.393.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend who, as usual, makes a better case than I can and, indeed, anticipates me. He makes the interesting point about what sustainable alternatives will be prepared to help farmers out of the narcotics trap. How can NGOs hope to operate in Helmand, which is far from benign? That is one of the problems that the Americans have had. NGOs have not been physically capable or strong enough to be on the ground, or properly prepared or protected to be so. I would be grateful if the Minister answered that, and I should like him to bear in mind that the campaign planning for Iraq was lamentable once the fighting had finished. We are in danger of falling into the same trap with this deployment if we do not have a sustainable plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.1/2">Currently, 35 nations are involved in Afghanistan, and each has a different rule of engagement. Challenging changes will need to be made to the rules of engagement for deployments in the south, where there are running fire-fights, as compared with the relatively benign areas of the north. A similar point applies to the command status. Why are we prepared to deploy aircraft to Operation Enduring Freedom, to operate to all intents and purposes under American operational direction&mdash;to pursue terrorists, and to kill, or attempt to kill, the Taliban and other insurgents&mdash;yet when our troops deploy to that area they are not allowed, or empowered, to take part in similar operations? Also, why are we withdrawing the Royal Air Force from that particular task? Does it not strike the Minister as odd that our allies have been taking on the burden of fighting terrorists, and that now, when we have eventually got around to providing more troops to support them, they do so with their hands tied behind their backs? In September 2005 in <i>The New York Times</i>, Mr. Rumsfeld emphasised</p>
	<p pid="a.393.1/3" class="indent">&quot;that American troops would continue to handle the counterinsurgency mission 'for a time'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.393.1/4">The article continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.393.1/5" class="indent">&quot;NATO should consider deploying troops to the eastern border region, which the United States oversees and where much of the fighting is occurring. He added that 'over time, it would be nice if NATO developed counterterrorism capabilities, which don't exist at the present time.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.393.1/6">Can the Minister explain why we have this apparent contradiction? Why do the command and control arrangements beggar belief?</p>
	<p pid="a.393.1/7">It has also been said that under these arrangements, a deputy commander of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps is expected to be responsible for counter terrorism operations and will be double-hatted, answering to both the ARRC commander and US central command. They will also have responsibility for co-ordination and de-confliction between the international security assistance force and Operation Enduring Freedom.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.1/8">That is a recipe for complete and total disaster. How can troops operating on the borders of Operation Enduring Freedom have one set of rules that govern them in one area, and yet they are not allowed to move across the border into an area of American jurisdiction? That is a command arrangement from hell, and I would be most grateful if the Minister tried to explain how we have got into that situation and how it is likely to evolve.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.1/9">I want to ask my favourite question, which I fear I have asked the Minister before: what exactly is the mission? What is the mission statement? Are these people going there as a provincial reconstruction team or as a quick reaction force? Are they likely to be used in support of the Americans? Are the Americans likely to be used in support of our troops when they come under fire?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.395.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1726" speakername="Patrick Mercer" colnum="395"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060214/halltext/60214h02.htm#60214h02_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.395.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for broaching the very points I was about to come on to. On combat power, have we got enough troops to do the task, and if we get into difficulties&mdash;this is the point that he articulated very clearly&mdash;are we prepared to send more troops? If we are prepared to do so, where will they come from?</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/2">We hear that there is a frisson within the Ministry of Defence, with very senior officers discussing whether enough combat power is being deployed to Iraq. Precisely the same kind of discussions took place on whether we were sending enough troops to Iraq during the second invasion. An extra armoured brigade was asked for and not delivered. Can the Minister be clear that we will not make the same mistakes and go into Afghanistan with too few troops? We have one battalion and one battery of light guns; they are not AS90 or self-propelled Howitzers, but the sort of guns that our grandfathers would have recognised&mdash;105 mm guns, not much better than the 81 mm mortar of 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment. There are also eight Apaches, which are unproven aircraft. <i>[Interruption.] </i>All eight will never take to the air; there is no doubt about that. The Minister knows that with a following wind&mdash;if he will forgive the pun&mdash;we will have a maximum of six of those aircraft in the air at any one time, and for a limited flying time. There are also six Chinook aircraft, which I am deeply worried about in terms of clearing our casualties from scenes of action. There can be nothing more demoralising to a soldier than knowing that he places his life on the line but there are not sufficient aircraft to get him clear and into a hospital if he is injured.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/3">The Secretary of State for Defence made it clear in a statement that we had received a number of promises from our allies&mdash;that we would receive combat air support, and fast air and other combat service support elements, from our allied nations. Promises are great, but they do not answer the radio when there is trouble.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/4">On overstretch, 3 Para is woefully undermanned and it has been woefully over-employed. Again, 3 Para is leading the deployment, and yet it is backed up by troops from 1 Royal Irish and the Ghurkas, other lads freshly out of the depot, and Territorial soldiers from the Royal Rifle Volunteers. Can the Minister assure me that 3 Para will get a rest at the end of the deployment, and, more to the point, that those soldiers from other battalions will not be immediately flicked back into other operational deployments with their own cap badges? Can he also assure me that in this relatively large deployment, which is incredibly light on combat power, we will have more fighting soldiers&mdash;not signallers, staff officers or batmen, but bayonets that are ready to go to help out 3 Para when the troops get into the sort of trouble that we know they can get into? Will he also assure me that their families are being properly looked after back in Colchester?</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/5">I have one last tiny point. Will the Minister explain why 3 Para's acclimatisation exercise takes the troops abroad and then returns them to the United Kingdom, so that their acclimatisation deteriorates before they deploy?</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/6">I think I have said enough. The prospect is exciting. I genuinely and fervently believe that we must take the war to the terrorists, and I fervently believe that we must support Afghanistan. I wish to see a proper democracy arising in Afghanistan, with, if necessary, allied troops covering 100 per cent. of the terrain until such time as we have delivered safety, cohesion and proper democracy back to the Afghan people.</p>

	<p pid="a.396.4/1">Congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1726" name="Patrick Mercer">the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase> on raising the subject. I join in his congratulations to our soldiers in Afghanistan on their courage and professionalism, but I cannot share any of his optimism. I feel a sense of hopelessness about the whole operation. We all pray that it will be a success, but there is very little to suggest that it can be.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/2">The likely outcome is the &quot;Colombianisation&quot; of the whole of central Asia, and the possibility that we are entering into our own British Vietnam. Look at the experience of the Russians: they went into Afghanistan with great hope and confidence, but they were there for 10 years and lost 15,000 soldiers. When they left, there was an army of mujaheddin of 30,000 surrounding Kabul because the occupation antagonised Afghanistan's population. We know that the answer to terrorism is not to go in with guns blazing, but to win the hearts and minds of the people. By going into Helmand province we are losing the hearts and minds of the people. The province has been relatively peaceful, but it has one economy: growing poppies. The rest of the economy was destroyed, partly by the Soviet invasion. We are about to go in and eradicate the region's only means of support and the only way for its people to escape the dirt poverty of their existence.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/3">There is an alternative, which is to respond to another crisis in the world. If someone in a developing country is dying of AIDS or other diseases, there is only a 6 per cent. chance that they will get relief from their agony by using diamorphine. There is a world shortage of the drug. Some 70 per cent. of the world's supply of morphine is used in 7 per cent. of developed countries, so there is little chance of it being available for someone in a developing country. In Afghanistan, we are destroying the raw material for making morphine, as it is also the raw material for making heroin. The alternative is to license some of the poppy growers in the Helmand province, to win them over to our side, and to solve the problem of the world shortage of morphine. That is a simple solution. It is not guaranteed success and there are difficulties involved, but it offers at least some hope. The alternative is one of hopelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/4">Let us look at the experience elsewhere in the world where something similar has been tried, and let me explain why we use the word &quot;Colombianisation&quot;. The problem of Colombia was considered very simple as far as the United States and world opinion was concerned: they would go in and destroy the coca crops, which have been grown in south America for a thousand years as an appetite suppressant and for use against altitude sickness. However, it was ingested in such a way that there was not the high that we in the west get when we use it in the form of cocaine. After nearly two decades of suppression of the coca crop, the result is no improvement. The amount of coca on the world market is exactly the same because of the squeezed balloon principle: if we reduce crop production in Colombia&mdash;it has been reduced&mdash;it expands elsewhere, for example in Peru and Bolivia. The amount on the streets in the United States is the same as it was.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/5">Going into Afghanistan was justified on the grounds of attacking the Taliban and al-Qaeda, but it was also justified on the basis that it produced 90 per cent. of the heroin on the streets of Britain. What is the situation now? It is exactly the same. Have we reduced the crop? Not at all. In fact, the heroin on our streets is now cheaper than ever because there is a greater supply than ever. We have achieved nothing in the years there. Our mission&mdash;the British soldiers' mission&mdash;is to eradicate the crops. There has been a reduction of 20 per cent. in the area cultivated, but a reduction of only 2 per cent. in the amount of heroin produced, because of increased production. If the mission were successful and we destroyed the entire crop of Afghanistan poppies, all that would happen would be increased planting in Myanmar, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and north Pakistan. But that eradication will not happen; the squeezed balloon principle will operate. So we are on a mission impossible as far as the eradication of poppies is concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/6">Far more dangerous is what we will do with the population of Helmand province. If we are successful and reduce the poppy crops, we will affect farmers there, who want to make a living. That is their primary motivation. Four of them were here last week, talking about their position. They would love to go into the legal production of opium for morphine. They want a peaceful future, but we are repeating exactly the folly of the Russians, who created the mujaheddin and incited them, and who were driving the Helmand farmers into the arms of the Taliban.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/7">I do not wish to add to the fears of the families who today saw off their loved ones, but I believe that we are sending our troops into the gravest danger. You asked for brevity, Mr. Weir. I should have liked to go on at some length, but I shall make my points briefly. I am more concerned about this military expedition than any other that we have ever taken. We are putting our brave soldiers at the gravest possible risk by sending them to Helmand province. There is no precedent of success in such circumstances. Operation Enduring Freedom has become operation enduring stupidity.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/8">The idea that we can eliminate a drug at the supply stage has been proved to be false. In a report published by the Government's strategy unit, Lord Birt&mdash;who no longer works there&mdash;emphasises again and again that we cannot eliminate drug use from the supply side because of the enormous demand and the sums of money to be made. We must solve the drugs problem on the streets of Chicago, Cardiff and London; otherwise, the enormous demand there will suck in the drugs. The trade is lubricated by the huge amounts of money made at every stage, from the poppy field to the street corners. There answer is not to try to destroy the supplies. That has been a total failure. We spent much money and achieved no reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/9">One of our newspapers had a headline on the subject yesterday and was mocked for its pains by a Minister at the Foreign Office, who mentioned the muesli-eating and <i>The Independent</i>-reading people who attend the first nights of Harold Pinter plays. That is a despicable attitude to something so serious. It is not a subject fit for humour. What <i>The Independent </i>wrote had an air of prophesy about it. Its front-page headline was &quot;Into the Valley of Death&quot;. Someone looking back on this folly in ten years' time&mdash;a latter-day Tennyson&mdash;might well amend the words of Tennyson's poem about ministerial and officer folly to talk about the tragedy that is about to unfold. Tennyson started off by saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/10" class="indent">&quot;Someone had blunder'd . . .</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/11" class="indent">Their's not to reason why,</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/12" class="indent">Their's but to do and die:</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/13" class="indent">Into the valley of Death&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.396.4/14">or into the mouth of Helmand&mdash;drove the 5,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.405.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Pope. I understand the rules&mdash;I have been here for a long time.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.3/2">I want to ask the Minister a few questions. All such debates are understandably MOD-focused, but please could we have a statement from a Minister from the Department for International Development some time? What is the DFID budget for the operation? How many DFID officials will go to Helmand and how will they operate? Will they operate through local NGOs or UN agencies? Will DFID officials work with the armed forces and if so, how will that be done? How will we ensure that DFID and aid and development workers are not seen as part of the counter-insurgency operation?</p>
	<p pid="a.405.3/3">It is clear that if DFID had been left to its own devices, it would not have gone to Helmand province. In fact, DFID has to date rightly focused on Kabul and building the capacity of the Afghanistan Government. Indeed, President Karzai has been concerned that the international community seems to be schizophrenic about whether it wants itself or the Afghan Government to deliver. At some stage, therefore, please could we have a statement by the Secretary of State for International Development about which alternative livelihoods will be delivered in Helmand province and exactly how they will be delivered. That is a critical part of the situation, but we have received far too little information about it to date.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.407.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" speakername="Julian Lewis" colnum="407"  time="012:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060214/halltext/60214h02.htm#60214h02_spnew27">
	<p pid="a.407.4/1">I am not aware of that; indeed, I think it absolute balderdash. We do not want to spend our limited time refighting the cold war, but the Soviet invasion was an act of the utmost brutality and oppression, and was responsible for many of the problems that we are fighting today. It was one more terrible legacy of the 1917 revolution, which led to many of the evils that have since visited the international community.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/2">On strategy, we want to take out the terrorist training bases and build up the society. My hon. Friend the Member for Newark talked about the danger of having a war on two fronts; I suggest that we are in danger of fighting a war on three fronts, the first two being Iraq and Afghanistan and the third being a narco-war. I do not accept&mdash;here I agree with the hon. Member for Newport, West and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase>, among others&mdash;that it is one and the same thing to eradicate the poppy trade using military means and to achieve our strategic objectives of securing Afghanistan both against terrorism and for democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/3">This matter came up in Foreign Affairs questions, in which the Minister for the Middle East said that there is a risk of the Taliban joining forces with warlords. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/4" class="indent">&quot;There is a risk of that happening&mdash;there is no question about that&mdash;but we have no choice but to try to take it on.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-02-07.728"><i>Official Report</i>, 7 February 2006; Vol. 442, c. 728</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/5">That is precisely the mindset that the shadow Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1938" name="Liam Fox">the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)</phrase>, has said all along that we must avoid. It is true that no action is not an option, but that does not mean that we must take inadequate or counterproductive action. Our actions must be efficacious.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/6">In answer to questions from the shadow defence team, the Minister for the Middle East admitted that, historically, the overwhelming majority of the warlords were opposed to the Taliban. He also admitted that he was not sure to what extent warlords and those involved in the drugs trade are also involved in the Government of Afghanistan, who are trying to function.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/7">Other people have been more outspoken. The Afghan Minister of Counter Narcotics, Habibullah Qaderi, stated that he does not deny the fact that corruption is linked to the drugs trade, going right up to the level of the Cabinet. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/8" class="indent">&quot;We are seeing links between the Taliban and the drug smugglers for the first time in southern Afghanistan. The Taliban has been distributing leaflets saying people who do not support the growing of poppy will be killed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/9">It is clear that our enemies are seeking to form an alliance with the indigenous poppy growing population and they will succeed if we use military force for the third war&mdash;the eradication of the poppy trade by military physical means&mdash;rather than for the second war, which is the eradication of the enemy that is fighting to overthrow the delicate democratic structures that are being erected in Afghanistan. We have to ask ourselves who that enemy is, because it is insufficiently clear. Is the enemy the al-Qaeda internationally inspired Islamist terrorist movement, or is it the internal Taliban movement, which gave that international movement succour? There have been a number of statements to suggest that the enemy is primarily coming in the form of insurgents who are being trained in neighbouring Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/10">It is a matter of considerable concern&mdash;we have advanced this theme time and again in such debates&mdash;that not enough is being done to win the information and propaganda war in all these conflicts. It is a matter of the greatest significance, when suicide bombings occur in Afghanistan, to know the origins of the suicide bombers and whether they are indigenous Afghanis, external people from the Islamofascist international terrorist movement, or people specifically being trained and coming into the area from neighbouring Pakistan. It may well be that people close to the conflict have good ideas about this and think that the rest of the world fully understands it. However, the reality is that far too little effort is being made to get the information into the public domain. Without understanding the enemies we face, we cannot expect public support for the battles that we have to fight.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/11">We are told that the British remit in this operation is to protect the reconstruction teams that are building roads, schools and clinics, improve security and assist the Government's drug eradication efforts without becoming involved in destroying poppy fields. We are told time and again about the distinction to be made between counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> for pointing out the absurdity of playing with such definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/12">I am concerned that if we are taking over an area where the Americans were previously involved in what is now called counter-terrorism and sending a signal to our opponents that we will be involved in something that is only called counter-insurgency, we will send a message to those who would attack our forces, saying, &quot;There used to be a strategy in southern Afghanistan that basically told people: 'Keep well clear of our forces because we are coming out to get you.' However, you don't have to worry about that any more, because the strategy that is now being put in place in south Afghanistan means that we will build up society and have troops to protect the rebuilding process who will largely fire back only when you choose to attack them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/13">Saying that is, perhaps, to repeat the parallel with Vietnam. Hon. Members shuddered a little when the hon. Member for Newport, West brought that up, but I do not share his counsel of despair. There is no reason why this campaign should fail. There is, however, a parallel with Vietnam because when insurgencies were taking place there, the campaign was fought in such a way that restrictive rules did not enable the counter-insurgency techniques that had been pursued successfully in other campaigns&mdash;such as the Malayan campaign&mdash;to be applied sensibly.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.4/14">Is the Minister satisfied that the force that is being sent out&mdash;of which only a small proportion are combat troops&mdash;will be able to be active, instead of being passive and waiting to be shot at? Is it true that the designated commander of that force has asked for many more troops than he has been allocated? Do the Government have flexible arrangements in mind to ensure that when that force runs into difficulties&mdash;when it is engaged in combat&mdash;and it needs reinforcement, those reinforcements will be immediately forthcoming? Can the Minister be sure that by making a spurious distinction between counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism, the signals that he sends out to those who wish to wage a campaign of terrorism against everything that we stand for and hope to build in Afghanistan are not counter-productive?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.410.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" colnum="410"  time="012:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060214/halltext/60214h02.htm#60214h02_spnew29">
	<p pid="a.410.2/1">No, I really do not have a lot of time. The hon. Gentleman may want to raise the matter with me at some other point.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> asked about the role of the Department for International Development. I cannot command a Secretary of State for another Department to answer. I do not accept the criticism that the Government have not been clear. If the hon. Gentleman had followed what happened at the international conference, he would have seen that the UK Government have committed in the region of &pound;500 million over the next three years. I understand that &pound;330 million will be DFID-led. Significantly, &pound;20 million will be dedicated to Helmand, and it is a matter for the Department how it distributes the allocation. I do not accept the criticism that we have not been describing what we propose to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/3">The subject is important. Our task in Afghanistan is fundamental to NATO's mission, under a United Nations mandate, to establish a secure, stable, democratic and free country. We have made it clear from the outset&mdash;the language has not changed&mdash;that this will not be an easy task; it will certainly not be risk free. Even when we are undertaking a peacekeeping mission, that type of phraseology can and does apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/4">I want to deal with some of the logic advanced by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1726" name="Patrick Mercer">the hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase> and others who say that they support this mission and the concept, but question whether we have sufficient resources, in depth and over time, to achieve the objectives that we share. I genuinely like the hon. Gentleman, but, not to put too fine a point on it, I believe that he is guilty of opportunism, and I honestly and genuinely think that he is adopting a politically dishonest posture.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/5">I accept completely the right of Opposition parties and, indeed, Members of my party, to question, criticise, probe and seek clarity about all that we are doing, but I differ with the hon. Member for Newark, who says that he agrees with the concept, but that we should not do something unless it is done his way. He believes that our armed forces are overstretched, that there is insufficient strength on the ground, thereby putting our people at greater risk, and that our air support is too light and unsustainable. He also questions NATO's overall commitment and command and control arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/6">If all those criticisms were well founded&mdash;I do not accept that they are&mdash;they would not be fixable within the current time frame or over the medium or longer term. If they stacked up, the hon. Gentleman and his party should be saying that we should not commit ourselves to the mission. I regret that there is a difference between us on that. It is not appropriate for him to say that he supports the concept but that if someone had produced this strategic plan&mdash;I shall come to some of the detail about what we are seeking to deliver&mdash;when he was instructing, he would have failed them. In effect, he is saying that all our senior military planners and chiefs of staff and all the NATO planners got it wrong. That is a significant condemnation, but it does not stack up, and I shall set out the reasons why.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/7">It is important to explain why we are in Afghanistan in the first place, what we seek to do, and what we, as part of NATO, will contribute to achieving the essential objectives. We all know why we are in Afghanistan: the terrible events of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase> in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania led to a greater knowledge and understanding of what was happening in that troubled country. That backdrop of profound evil is why we are playing a major role in Afghanistan and why the international effort is so deep, determined and committed.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/8">It is right and proper that we show the people of Afghanistan that we support them. We need to show them that when people stand up for democracy and reject terrorism, as they are, we will give them our help. By helping them bolster stability, we counter extremism in this country and so help ourselves. By assisting the Afghans to rebuild their society and legitimate economy, we help end the flow of opium that floods our streets.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/9">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> said that alternative uses can be made of the opium poppy. That is unquestionably the case, but time and again he has asked the question and been given an answer, which he may not wish to accept. The suggestion has been analysed, as it could well have been a way forward&mdash;and it may be part of the answer at some time further down the line&mdash;but it is wrong to think that there is a simple solution to the problem. Our assessment is that Afghanistan can try to create a legal trade based on poppies, but it could easily be diverted to illegality. It is very well saying that that would not happen, but, if it does, we would be adding to the manifest problem on the street.</p>

	<p pid="a.412.1/1">No, I must make progress. I have much more to say. As ever, there is a wide territory to cover and many specifics to deal with, and I will not get there in time if I give way.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.1/2">The structure of the PRT will be the same as the structure we and other nations developed for the north and the west. The PRT will involve personnel from the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and other agencies and non-governmental organisations, and it will have a single, coherent mission.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.1/3">Questions have been asked about the PRT: how many people, what will it do, how will it deliver on the ground? It cannot be defined at present, as it must have the capacity to deal with the reality at the time. To be too prescriptive from the outset could lead to mission failure. We must identify the problem&mdash;that has been one of the key issues&mdash;but the solution will not be military only. All the other agencies will be needed on the ground to deliver it.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.1/4">We have spent months examining, planning and reviewing best intelligence&mdash;as hon. Members are aware, there is no such thing as perfect intelligence. Much effort has gone into trying to define the threat that we face, but it could well change over time. It may become less or greater, and we need the flexibility to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.1/5">Meanwhile, we seek to do what we did in Mazar-e-Sharif and elsewhere. We want to deliver engagement with civil society, or normal society, and be imaginative about alternative livelihoods. As I understand it&mdash;I have not been in Helmand, but I have been in Kandahar&mdash;extensive infrastructure is already in place. The Americans put in much of it in the 1950s and 1960s, and it could be the core of the solution. The area once was the bread-basket of Afghanistan. Can we get that back? We must because it will be the source of an economic future, not just for that part of Afghanistan but for the whole country.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.1/6">On the comprehensive manner in which we went about the analysis, we spent a great deal of time dealing with senior military planners. The plan did not simply come out of the head of a senior politician who said, &quot;Let us now do this.&quot; The objectives are clear for not just the UK Government but for NATO and, I believe, the international community. There seems to be an assumption that this country will provide all the people on the ground. It will not. Eight nations will be in the south. There will be extensive force packages from the Americans, the Dutch and the Canadians, and they will have considerable air support. The Harriers, which were mentioned, were in action yesterday to good effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.1/7">Whatever threat manifests itself will be dealt with, and there is no contradiction between the missions in the east and the rest. If that were the case, it would have been the case all along, but we have not failed. We have achieved measures of success in the north and the west. We now face a bigger challenge. That is why we need&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.414.1/1">It is a particular delight to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Pope. You were to have served as Chairman of a Standing Committee on which I served earlier in the year, but we dispatched the business so swiftly that, unfortunately, you were unable to chair any of the sittings&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]&mdash;</i>which just shows that the Conservatives, whose Members are now leaving the Room, sometimes overestimate the amount of time that they need to waffle in debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.1/2">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise again an issue that I have raised several times in the House. I am also grateful that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform is present, not least because she visited the Rhondda late last year to see precisely what had been happening in our pathways to work pilot project, which covers the Rhondda, Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taff. Many hon. Members, if they chose to think about it, would probably regard that area as a deprived area. It has faced historical problems and long-term decline, from the days in the 1920s and '30s, when the Rhondda had 170,000 men working in the pits, to 1991, when the last pit closed in Maerdy. That period of steady and debilitating decline has affected the culture of work and the possibilities of work for many people.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.1/3">No Opposition Members are present, which is perhaps not surprising, but few Government Members would disagree with the proposition that when the mines were closed, and particularly at the time when the Government were facing trouble over their unemployment statistics, many men were actively encouraged to go on to incapacity benefit or some form of sickness benefit rather than appear in the unemployment statistics, because those figures embarrassed the Government. The long-term legacy of decline for constituencies such as mine and those of my hon. Friends the Members for Caerphilly (Mr. David) and for Newport, West (Paul Flynn), where there has been one predominant industry, whether steel or the mines, has been the creation of a complex culture around work, unemployment and sickness benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.1/4">I start from certain fundamental principles. First, everyone should be guaranteed security and dignity, especially those who, because of what they were dealt at birth or incapacity that they have developed later in life, have no opportunity to fend for themselves. It is a sign of a civilised nation that we are magnanimous to those who can least afford to defend themselves. The Green Paper &quot;A new deal for welfare: Empowering people to work&quot; is a splendid document, although I doubt that that it took the Government a great deal of time to devise the title, because it is remarkably similar to the title of every other document that they have ever produced. I particularly welcome the idea that we will be more generous to those who most need support. We have, at times, been parsimonious and we should be more magnanimous.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.1/5">My second principle is that no disabled person should be discarded. I believe that everyone should be given the chance to work. Time and again when disabled people come to my constituency surgeries, they tell me that they want an opportunity to work but that it is very difficult for them to do so. Travelling to work may be complex: valleys communities were built for people who would be working within 15 minutes of their home; traversing them is much more difficult for someone whose job is not within five or 10-minutes' walk of their home. Some people's journey to work may involve two complicated bus journeys.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.1/6">People also tell me that many employers look askance at someone who has had a medical problem. Despite the fact that nearly 50 per cent. of those on incapacity benefit in the Rhondda have mental health problems of various kinds, and despite the fact that the vast majority of people with mental health problems have every chance of returning to full mental health, many employers&mdash;including, depressingly, employers in the public sector&mdash;look askance at someone who has had a mental health problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.1/7">It is important that we give opportunities to those people, many of whom are desperate for opportunities. In part, that means improving the swiftness with which the national health service can deal with complaints, so that people do not languish with a medical problem that could be sorted out and so that they can get back into work. We also need to ensure that some of the cultural problems that make the process of getting back into work so complex are overcome.</p>

	<p pid="a.415.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the most encouraging changes that we have seen in recent years has been the widening of access for people with disabilities&mdash;even those with severe disabilities&mdash;to workplaces that were not accessible before? Is that not part of an encouraging trend whereby people with disabilities, both severe and mild, will receive not only economic benefits, but the enormous boost of having a fulfilling job, because work is by far the best medicine?</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.416.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14b.416.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.416.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" speakername="Chris Bryant" colnum="416"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060214/halltext/60214h03.htm#60214h03_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.416.0/1">As my hon. Friend often does, given his mastery of the language, he ends on exactly the right point, which is that for the vast majority of people work is the best medicine. The counter to that is that living on benefit and not having a sense of purpose, which is sometimes the result, means that many people who are on incapacity benefit for more than six months develop a serious mental health problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/2">I do not underestimate the problems of depression and stress, which can be very acute. Often in areas such as those represented by the hon. Members present this afternoon, some of the talking therapies are hardly available. The people who train to be counsellors, advisers and so on are predominantly from the middle classes, and they train and practise in their middle-class areas. with the result that it is virtually impossible to access decent cognitive behavioural therapy or even ordinary counselling in areas such as ours. That means that when Mrs. Jones at No. 32 has a mental health problem&mdash;when she is suffering from stress or depression for whatever set of complicated reasons&mdash;she ends up popping pills, because her GP does not have time to give her the support that she needs. People in Wales pop 19 per cent. more barbiturates and other forms of antidepressant per head than is the case in England. When that type of problem is mixed in with a high level of people on incapacity benefit in a particular area, it results in a very complex and important challenge for us to overcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/3">I very much hope that the trial being started in St. Andrew's surgery in Tonypandy will make a difference. There will be a work adviser based in the GP's surgery to whom people can be referred by the GP. That will be at the GP's suggestion&mdash;the medical route will not be circumvented&mdash;and it will make a difference by providing a new route out of depression and stress and into work. I hope that we can create a virtuous circle out of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/4">The pathways to work pilot in Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taff has been based on some fundamental concepts. Everyone making a new claim for incapacity benefit will have a work-focused interview. They will have a personal adviser who will treat them as an individual rather than a statistic. The project is operating in the new Jobcentre Plus environment. As the Minister knows, we have a brand new building in Porth, and completely refurbished offices in Tonypandy and Treorchy, and the atmosphere has changed as a result. Now that job centres are no longer like fortresses and there is a much more personal service&mdash;one that is focused on the individual, instead of one that tries to prevent people from having access to benefits, which is what the process used to feel like. That, too, has also contributed to the change of culture.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/5">I have already mentioned the return to work credit and the &pound;40 extra. When my right hon. Friend the Minister was in the Rhondda, she asked quite a lot of the advisers, &quot;Does the &pound;40 make a difference?&quot; Perhaps she was wondering whether it did make a vast difference and whether we should necessarily stick with it. I think that she would admit that many advisers said that it does make a difference. It is part of the juggling act that people undertake when they are trying to decide whether it is in their family's interest to pursue the avenue of going to work. I hope that the Government will stick with the credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/6">Another part of the project has been the NHS condition management programme. My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West referred to that in the context of trying to find individual routes to enable people to manage conditions with which they could work if they were given the opportunity. All too often employers' arrangements, personal environment or travel to work problems have made it impossible for such people to consider work a possibility, given their condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/7">Another important part of the programme, which the Government have transformed during the last few years, is making allowance for people to do voluntary work. The first route into paid employment for a large number of people in my constituency has been through voluntary work, because it got them used to the business of turning up to an office on time, doing their work, being part of a team and so on. That is very important. Obviously, charities should not start to consider people who are on incapacity benefit as a source of free labour paid for by the state. If someone has been engaged in such work for a period of time&mdash;perhaps 18 months or two years&mdash;the state can properly intervene to see whether there are ways of helping them into paid employment. Nevertheless, the voluntary sector in the Rhondda benefits from people taking that route, as do the people themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/8">The original pilot was aimed at new and repeat claimants. Across the whole of Bridgend and RCT, 24,330 people were seen. There were 8,330 initial work-focused interviews throughout the whole of RCT, of which 823 were in the Rhondda. From last April, the project began to consider people who had been on incapacity benefit for up to two years. Now, it is considering the cadre of people who came on to incapacity benefit between 1997 and 2001. Of course, the task is becoming progressively far more complex because people have more established conditions and more established ways of living their lives. We know the pressures that that can create: people are almost institutionalised into a life on incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/9">There have been a further 572 work-focused interviews in the Rhondda, dealing with people in their first two years of benefit. When that process started, many Labour Members were concerned that people would be very anxious and they would get lots of phone calls from constituents saying, &quot;Oh my God, I'm about to lose my incapacity benefit and the state is waving this massive stick at me.&quot; However, all the feedback that I have had in my constituency has been entirely positive. It has been positive at both ends&mdash;from people who have been helped through the process, treated as an individual and ended up getting jobs, and from the staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/10">When my right hon. Friend the Minister was in the Rhondda, one of the most moving moments occurred when she was talking to one of the personal advisers. The adviser said that she had worked for the Department for Work and Pensions and its predecessors for many years and that it was the first time she had come into work looking forward to it, because she knew she was really making a difference to people's lives. Rather than just doling out cheques week by week, she felt that she was making people's lives ones of possibility. She almost had tears in her eyes. That is not an uncommon experience among many staff working on the programme. I pay enormous tribute to them and the senior management who have enabled those people to have a really fulfilling job.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/11">The statistics are pretty impressive and for me, this is a socialist project. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] It enables people to live their lives to the fullest. I worry that the way in which incapacity benefit has played out has been the biggest cause of poverty, poverty of aspiration and poverty of opportunity in my constituency in the past 40 years. If we can tackle that, I will be more than grateful.</p>

	<p pid="a.418.2/1">I share the pleasure of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" name="Chris Bryant">the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> in participating in a debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Pope. I hope that this will be the first of many such debates. I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. Throughout his time in the House, he has always shown an interest in welfare policy. Someone cleverly found his maiden speech for me, which I am sure he will not mind me quoting. He said</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/2" class="indent">&quot;The people of the Rhondda are not looking for handouts. People simply want a chance to stand on their own two feet, to build a decent life for their family and to retire in dignity. These are honourable aspirations, and my constituents still look to politicians to make a real difference by waging an all-out assault on the . . . causes of poverty.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2001-06-25.427"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 June 2001; Vol. 370, c. 427&ndash;428</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/3">That is what our policy is all about.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/4">My hon. Friend alluded to the letter he received from the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on the concentration of people on incapacity benefit in his constituency. I will come back to him to try to sort out which figures are right, but I have the same figures as my right hon. Friend&mdash;so that means a slight sigh of relief. As he said, they put the Rhondda 12th in the country in terms of the absolute number&mdash;not the percentage&mdash;of people on incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/5">The Rhondda was one of the first areas in which we launched a pathways to work pilot. The launch took place just over two years ago, at the end of October 2003. My hon. Friend quoted the statistics in one way. I prefer to say that there are more than 3,500 people in work who were not in work before we started the introduction of pathways to work pilot. Like him, I pay tribute to the staff, who work in a very committed way, as I was fortunate enough to see when I visited the constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/6">I shall comment on the elements of the programme that my hon. Friend said worked so well. I am interested to hear that he believes that the return to work credit is an important element of the pathways to work intervention. Clearly, want to learn what works best from the pilots as we roll out the pathways programme across the country. We are now committed&mdash;we have identified the resources&mdash;to ensuring that pathways to work is rolled out across the country by 2008, at least for new claimants and we hope increasingly for existing claimants, too. We are talking about an integral part of our programme, but we want to ensure that we get the best value for the massive investment of resources into that client group. I hope that my hon. Friend accepts that we must constantly reflect on what the most effective parts of the programme are.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/7">I share my hon. Friend's passion about the condition management element of the programme. One thing we know from incapacity benefit claimants is that if there is no early intervention to provide support to individuals once they start on the trajectory or escalator of dependency on incapacity benefit, they quickly get locked in for the long term. We know that people who have been on the benefit for two years are more likely to die or retire without coming off it. Early condition management helps to deal with the early signs of mental illness and some of the musculoskeletal conditions that so often take people out of the labour market. That early intervention&mdash;getting access to the appropriate cognitive behavioural therapy or to a physiotherapist&mdash;is an essential component of the pathways to work intervention and has proved popular and effective in the pilots.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/8">Equally important has been a role that my hon. Friend did not talk about in his contribution: the role of the job brokers, who link individuals' capabilities, competences and skills to the employers who need them. The job-broking role that we have defined has been important, as has the role of personal advisers in Jobcentre Plus offices. It is important that people have somebody to talk to and to work through all their problems with when they are feeling insecure and lack confidence in themselves, but want to take steps to get back into the labour market. If they build a good relationship with that personal adviser, that unlocks a lot of potential and helps to secure huge benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/9">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1470" name="Wayne David">the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David)</phrase> and my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda talked about the linking rules and trying to make the move from dependency on benefits into work easier. We have done a lot in that area. Later in this calendar year, we will introduce an automatic right to link back to one's previous level of incapacity benefit for anybody who comes off the benefit and into work over a two-year period. As we proposed in our Green Paper, we are working through what else we can do on issues such as housing benefit and council tax benefit to ensure a quick return to those benefits for those who try to shift themselves from benefit dependency, but for whom work does not work out. We are doing all we can to support individuals in making those difficult transitions in their lives and to ease their fears of poverty and destitution, which so often mean that they do not take the leap off benefits back into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/10">I am pleased that pathways to work is consistently demonstrating an 8 per cent. increase in the number of people who come off benefit within the first six months of being on that benefit. We have trawled the world looking at what other countries are doing in relation to disabled people or people with a long-term illness who are locked into benefit dependency, and we believe that the combination of interventions that we have christened &quot;pathways to work&quot; is the most successful way that anybody has found of providing opportunities for work.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/11">The whole of our welfare reform agenda, as set out in the Green Paper and symbolised by pathways to work, brings old Labour and new Labour very close together. The agenda is not about cutting benefits. It is entirely about making real the value that is at the heart of everything we believe&mdash;people's right to have the opportunity to work. We all know that work is the route out of poverty for those who can work. It provides a means by which one can support oneself and one's family and it provides one with a position in society that gives one self-esteem and a sense of value, purpose and belonging. It also provides important things, such as a network of friends, that enable people to participate and get the most out of their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/12">For far too long, people on incapacity benefit in particular have been left totally unsupported to spend their lives dependent on benefit, without seeing any hope for the future. As one comes to understand more about the sort of people who get locked into incapacity benefit, one of the interesting things that one observes is that four out of 10 people coming on to the benefit demonstrate a mental health condition, but six months, a year, or two years into their life on benefits, eight out of 10 say that they have a mental health condition, possibly in addition to other physical or mental conditions that prevent them from working. That makes sense&mdash;we all know that the longer someone is out of work, the more they lose confidence, so what starts off as mild anxiety can quickly become long-term depression.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/13">Our reforms are not about cutting benefits but about providing opportunity. The Government have been successful in tackling unemployment. Now, we have to move our attention to providing intervention. Our strategy is both to prevent people moving on to incapacity benefit and to support people as they come off that benefit through programmes such as pathways to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.2/14">I was pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda mentioned the GP pilots, because they are part of the structure that we are trying to put in place to provide that early intervention. The first person that people go to see when they fall ill is their general practitioner. The general practitioner usually has only 10 minutes per person and the easiest thing is to write a sick note. We want to transform their culture and the culture of employers, families and individuals so that people see work as a route out of poverty into good health and well-being.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.422.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="422"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060214/halltext/60214h04.htm#60214h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.422.1/1">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the importance of microfinance. I have had a great deal of correspondence on this subject with the Minister since he took up his position in the Department for International Development, and I am confident that he shares my high regard for microfinance and for the organisations involved in it, both in the United Kingdom and in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/2">I established the all-party group on microfinance/microcredit way back in the summer of 2002, having been approached at one of my local surgeries by a constituent who was an active local member of RESULTS UK, a national charity with a particular interest in microfinance. The all-party group has developed relationships with a number of national and international organisations that have been involved in promoting and raising awareness of microfinance in Parliament and nationally, and I should like to use this occasion to thank them for their ongoing support. They include Opportunity International and PlaNet Finance and individuals such as the chief executive of Cobra Beer and the actress Natalie Portman.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/3">The United Nations designated 2005 the international year of microcredit. Its aim was to increase awareness of microfinance among individuals and international development organisations and to increase interest in microfinance throughout the banking and corporate sector, not to mention Government. The United Kingdom national committee developed out of that partnership between the all-party group, non-governmental organisations, corporates and DFID. As the Minister knows, in September 2004, the United Kingdom national committee received official recognition from the Secretary of State for International Development, with the request that it widen its membership in the corporate sector. By October 2005, the committee's membership included six NGOs, eight corporates, representatives from DFID and myself as the chair of the all-party group. The corporates included Clifford Chance, Citigroup and HSBC. The UK national committee represents a unique partnership, focusing on advocacy and tackling specific projects to improve the profile of microfinance and its role in assisting the achievement of the millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/4">I should like to mention just some of the initiatives undertaken by the UK national committee during the past year. Professor Muhammad Yunus spoke to corporate representatives and Government and NGO leaders in London in a call to action in the United Kingdom for the 2005 year of microcredit. The launch of the Microfinance Club of London was followed by six events in 2005 and two events by a microfinance student society; more than 60 individuals attended each event. The opening of the London Stock Exchange by Alice Jere was a memorable occasion: Alice is a chicken farmer who started her business with a loan and purchased 20 chickens, and there she was, alongside the chairman of the LSE.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/5">The UK national committee made its own submission to the Commission for Africa. It was involved in a major consultation of more than 50 stakeholders at HSBC's group headquarters, and it went on to make a submission to the United Nation's blue book on financial inclusion. Our committee was the only national committee of a northern country to make a presentation of its stakeholders' consultation to the United Nations conference on microfinance and financial inclusion in Geneva in May 2005. We have also arranged a briefing for NGOs at the House of Commons. In summary, the United Kingdom national committee has used a variety of methods to reveal the lack of awareness among opinion formers and the wider public about microfinance as a sustainable tool for development.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/6">There can be no doubt that the events of 2005 have served to raise awareness of microfinance and to bring together stakeholders. We have plans to take forward the excellent work that has been accomplished through a new collaboration of NGOs, corporates and government. The year culminated in the committee receiving an award for excellence from the United Nations and CGAP&mdash;the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor. I sincerely hope that ongoing consultation with national committee members will form a longer term organisation for the development of a national strategy beyond 2005, through 2006 and onward. That will need ongoing support from DIFD. Much of the energy, passion and commitment needed to organise and arrange the committee came from its co-ordinator, Dr. Phyllis Santa-Maria, whom I thank for all her effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/7">The importance of microfinance was recognised last year in the Commission for Africa report, which was published in March. In chapter seven, there were many references to enterprise and access to finance. For example, the report pointed out that</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Access to credit and other financial services is important to growth and investment, yet few small businesses or individuals are able to get the access they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/9" class="indent">Poverty reduction through growth requires a focus on the indigenous private sector, which in sub-Saharan Africa is composed of a myriad of micro, small and medium enterprises . . . they are the primary source of jobs and economic opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/10" class="indent">Micro-finance institutions (MFIs) . . . have grown under the pioneering work of non-government organisations. But much more needs to be done in this area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/11">The report also says:</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Levels of financial exclusion&mdash;the number of people without access to bank accounts&mdash;can run as high as 90 per cent in some African countries.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/13">That is indeed a daunting figure. Governments should encourage the development of a variety of financial intermediaries that serve poor people with diverse financial services, not just loans.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/14">Following on from the Commission for Africa report, and with Britain placing Africa at the top of the agenda for its chairmanship of the G8, the importance of microfinance was also recognised in the communiqu&eacute; published after the summit of G8 leaders at Gleneagles in July 2005, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/15" class="indent">&quot;African countries need to build a much stronger investment climate: we will continue to help them do so . . . through the promotion of a stable, efficient and harmonised legal business framework . . . and increased access to finance including strong support for the development of micro-finance in Africa.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/16">The communiqu&eacute; concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/17" class="indent">&quot;Partnership between the public and private sectors is crucial.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/18">At the United Nations General Assembly in September last year, 151 Heads of State from around the world gathered. The summit was the first opportunity for world leaders to review the progress in reaching the millennium development goals, whose primary aim is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2015. I was pleased that microfinance was prominent on the agenda of that historic gathering. Significantly, the importance of microfinance was recognised in the summit's outcome document, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/19" class="indent">&quot;We recognize the need for access to financial services, in particular for the poor, including through microfinance and microcredit.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/20">The links between microfinance and the millennium development goals are very important. The impact on hunger and poverty&mdash;goal No. 1&mdash;is perhaps strongest of all, but microfinance has also been shown to widen access to education, improve women's and children's health and empower individuals, particularly women. Microfinance contributes directly to the achievement of at least half of the goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/21">I wish to stress the impact on women. The timing of this debate is not quite perfect; it would have been nice to have had it closer to international women's day on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March</phrase>, but it is close enough to make these points. The ability to borrow a small amount of money to take advantage of a business opportunity, to pay for school fees, or to bridge a cash-flow gap can be a first step in breaking the cycle of poverty which helps toward the achievement of millennium development goal No. 1. There are just so many examples of this, and I love them because they remind me of the colour and activity that I have seen when visiting projects. They sound rather dry just going through them, but I shall touch on a few.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/22">A study of borrowers on the island of Lombok in Indonesia reports that the average incomes of clients increased by 112 per cent., and that 90 per cent. of households moved out of poverty. Millennium development goal No. 2 deals with education. All over the world, one of the first things that poor people do with new income from micro-enterprise is invest in their children's education. That might be because a high proportion of women are involved in educating children and it is one of their highest priorities. Studies show that children of microcredit clients are more likely to go to school and to stay there longer than other children&mdash;student dropout rates are much lower in microcredit households. A study of a BRAC&mdash;formerly the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee&mdash;area in Bangladesh found that basic competency in reading, writing and arithmetic among 11 to 14-year-olds in member households had increased from 12 per cent. at the start of the programme in 1992 to 24 per cent. in 1995, and there are many other stories about the tremendous rate of progress in such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/23">I turn now to the impact on gender equality and female empowerment. Microcredit programmes have generally targeted women as clients because women's performance on repayment often proves to be better than men's. They are also more likely to invest increased income in the household and in the family's well-being. Most important, microcredit can empower women to become more assertive, which is a good thing. Women are then more likely to be participate in family and community decisions. The women's empowerment programme in Nepal found that 68 per cent. of its members were making decisions on buying and selling property, sending their daughters to school, negotiating their children's marriages and planning their families&mdash;all decisions that have traditionally been made by husbands.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/24">Millennium development goal No. 4 relates to the impact on child health and mortality rates. Microcredit clients' households appear to have better nutrition, health practices and health outcomes than non-client households. Increased earnings allow clients to treat health problems promptly, rather than wait for conditions to deteriorate. A study in Ghana found that Freedom from Hunger clients had better breast-feeding practices and that their one-year-old children were healthier than non-client children in terms of weight for age and height for age.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/25">That list of achievements is quite impressive, but there is so much more to do. We need to focus on the importance of microfinance in alleviating poverty and meeting the millennium development goals. There is still a significant belief among NGOs that Governments are not supporting microfinance to the extent that they could. DFID is increasingly moving away from direct support for microfinance institutions toward budget support for national Governments, and there might be moves to focus more on the formal banking sector than on microfinance institutions in extending financial services to the very poor. I have a real concern about that. Will such a move have a negative impact on the grass-roots organisations that deliver microfinance projects through specialist MFIs with local and country expertise? Surely, we need an holistic approach, with specialised microfinance programmes that work, that make use of local expertise and that have strong records of success running alongside the work that is done directly with national Governments. My own visits to a project set up by an NGO illustrated the importance not only of banking, but of the training that goes alongside that. There is real fear about what will happen to the training that NGOs traditionally provide, which deals not only with business issues, but with the wider health aspects and other issues that are important for the individual's and the community's quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/26">DFID's own paper &quot;Meeting the challenge of poverty in urban areas&quot; recognises the role that NGOs and the private sector play in providing pro-poor services. In particular, it recognises NGOs' comparative advantage in reaching poor people and their capacity to work at micro-level. Clearly, DFID is saying the right things, but I still have concerns. There is a discernible move by DFID and other international agencies to invest almost exclusively in strengthening and widening the financial sector in developing countries, and that is a worry. Although the need for an holistic approach to poverty reduction and access to financial services is recognised, I do not want that to be to the detriment of the world's poorest people or to result in their exclusion. My first question to the Minister, therefore, is: why is DFID concentrating solely on widening the financial sector in developing countries, to the exclusion of targeting the very poorest?</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/27">There are concerns about commercialisation. The move towards strengthening the financial sector as a whole increasingly brings international and commercial banks into microfinance. That move must be commended, and I do not criticise it, but we must ask whether commercial banks will target the very poorest. Indeed, microfinance institutions such as the Grameen bank in Bangladesh, Opportunity International and the Foundation for International Community Assistance came into existence to meet the needs of clients whom commercial banks were unwilling or unable to assist. How will DFID ensure that a move towards commercial banking does not equate with a move away from providing access to microfinance to the poorest&mdash;those who live on less than $1 a day?</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/28">By maintaining a focus on the poorest, DFID and other donors can have a tangible impact on reducing poverty and, in particular, on meeting MDG No. 1&mdash;to halve extreme poverty and hunger by 2015. However, if we do not measure the number of people living in or graduating from poverty, the effectiveness of any investment will remain opaque. We need poverty measurement tools so that an agency can measure clients' poverty before they enter a microfinance programme and then monitor their progress towards leaving extreme poverty, which is defined as living on less than $1 a day. Why is DFID not part of the effort to develop cost-effective poverty measurement tools to monitor $1-a-day poverty? Surely, the Department must recognise that we need to target microfinance at the poor and to measure their poverty and their progress out of poverty if we are to know whether we are achieving MDG No. 1, which is surely our greatest objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.422.1/29">My main question is this: is the potential role of microfinance in meeting the millennium development goals being undermined by DFID's current focus? My fear is that we will fail to prioritise the world's poorest people. To ensure that we make real progress towards reaching them, DFID needs to do a number of things, and the Minister will not be surprised that the first one is to increase funding for microfinance programmes. The Department also needs to increase its involvement in capacity-building in respect of MFIs, and UK organisations could perhaps work in the field. DFID must also dedicate at least 50 per cent. of resources to the poorest clients and invest in and use cost-effective poverty-measurement tools. Finally, I would like an annual report on progress, which could perhaps be laid before Parliament. In particular, it could set out the percentage of the poorest people who are being reached. So much has been achieved, but we all know that there is so much more to do.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.426.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development"  colnum="426"  time="013:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060214/halltext/60214h04.htm#60214h04_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.426.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> on securing this valuable debate. I welcome the opportunity to discuss microfinance with her again. I also congratulate her on the leadership that she has shown. I pay tribute to the many organisations that she listed that helped to make the UK national committee's work during the United Nation's international year of microcredit so successful, and I congratulate the committee on its excellent work last year and on its well deserved reward from the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/2">I was particularly delighted to hear the hon. Lady refer to Professor Muhammad Yunus from the Grameen bank. He is one of the great microfinance innovators and his inspiration led to the bank's creation. I am also grateful to the excellent Dr. Ian Haynes from Birkbeck college for bringing my attention to the work of Professor Yunus two years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/3">Let me begin with a word of reassurance to the hon. Lady. We recognise the need to do more in relation to microfinance. The development of the financial sector is not the sole focus; there is clearly a role for dedicated microfinance institutions. Expanding and helping to develop the role of the financial sector and supporting microfinance institutions go hand in hand, as I shall demonstrate in the course of my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/4">On the annual report, the hon. Lady will be aware of the private Member's Bill that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> is taking through the House, which will provide much more information for hon. Members and the NGOs that campaign on development issues. I hope that that will be a powerful way of checking on the progress of efforts to help the poorest people.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/5">The hon. Lady might be aware of the final statement of the UN year of microcredit, which underlined her fundamental point that much more work needs to be done. In particular, it mentioned the need to gather good data about the poor people's access to financial services, so that inadequate data will soon cease to be a factor in the slowness of the spread of microfinance. My Department and the World Bank have taken a lead in this area, working to agree on headline indicators for access to finance, as well as the methods used to generate those indicators. Last year, high-level consultations were organised in Paris and London with representatives of civil society, governments and regulators by the Department and the World Bank. We now plan to roll out those indicators, encouraging uptake in developing countries to help with the more general take-up of microfinance. I hope that I have provided reassurance on that point. I shall come to the hon. Lady's other points in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/6">The hon. Lady is absolutely right to highlight the important role that microfinance can play in helping to reduce poverty, its importance in the G8 discussions last year, and the way in which poor households use microfinance to raise their income and build up their assets so as to protect themselves against the unexpected. She is right to say that microfinance is about much more than loans. Poor households use a variety of other financial services, such as savings and remittances. She is also right about the central importance of microfinance to the empowerment of women. It has been estimated that eight out of every 10 microfinance clients are women. One of the microfinance programmes that my Department has been delighted to support has given funding to the Kashf foundation in Pakistan, which will help it to increase its outreach from some 75,000 to some 300,000 poor women over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/7">I do not take issue with the main thrust of the hon. Lady's speech&mdash;the need to scale up access to microfinance more dramatically. She is absolutely right. She is also right to highlight the excellent role that microfinance NGOs have played in demonstrating what is possible. In particular, they have shown that poor people are good credit risks and that cost-effective techniques to provide financial services can be developed to offer them long-term sustainable growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/8">CGAP, a World Bank-hosted, multi-donor initiative to increase access to financial services to poor people, has estimated that some 2 billion low-income people in the developing world still do not have access to bank accounts or financial services, and as much as 90 per cent. of the population in many African countries has no access to banking services. Microfinance NGOs cover only a fraction of the total number of low-income people who need financial services: it is estimated that about 2 billion clients need access to microfinance but only 80 million are covered&mdash;again underlining the hon. Lady's point that all of us need to do much more.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/9">Whether we should broaden and develop the financial sector or support microfinance institutions is not an either/or question, as both have a role to play in increasing access for the poorest to financial services. I assure the hon. Lady that many of our country programmes still support NGOs&mdash;for example, six of our country offices have funding programmes for both NGOs and for banks, to encourage them to enter the field. Some banks&mdash;Citigroup for example, and ICICI in India&mdash;are also financing NGOs to help them to develop relevant products. The two sectors can come together.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/10">The country that stands out as a beacon in terms of access to microfinance and that demonstrates its potential is Bangladesh. Perhaps that is because of the power and inspiration of Professor Yunus and the Grameen bank. We need to continue to remind people of the success that has been achieved in Bangladesh and to urge all donors, not just the UK, to do more than has been done so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/11">Let me try to give the hon. Lady some additional reassurance by highlighting some of the support that the UK offers through the Department for International Development and its country programmes. We contribute some &pound;30 million a year directly to microfinance or financial sector development programmes. We also support various international microfinance funds and we have funded microfinance institutions, most recently in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Uganda. The hon. Lady mentioned the excellent work of BRAC, which is one of the microfinance institutions that we have supported. With some 4 million members, BRAC has disbursed some $350 million in loans in the past year and provides a powerful example of the success of microfinance institutions. We are delighted by its recent decision to extend its operations into Afghanistan. That is an exciting innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/12">We have financial sector programmes in six African and two Asian countries that provide direct funding to microfinance and give technical and policy assistance to governments and regulators to help them to take advantage of the opportunities that microfinance provides. Our financial deepening challenge fund has provided some &pound;15 million in grants to financial sector organisations, helping to catalyse some &pound;24 million in new private sector investment directed at the poor.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/13">The hon. Lady will be aware of the importance of remittances as another key form of microfinance. Last November, with my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and representatives of the private sector, I was delighted to host the launch of a private-public sector working group report on how we can extend access to microfinance. We have remittance country partnerships with Nigeria, Ghana and Bangladesh, and another is being developed in Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.426.0/14">I hope that I have helped to give the hon. Lady some reassurance that the progress that we made last year through the G8 in terms of the attention that is given to microfinance will not be lost. Microfinance continues to be of huge importance to my Department. I have no doubt that the hon. Lady will continue to champion its cause in this House, and I look forward to her doing so.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.430.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14b.430.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-14a.430.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="430"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060214/halltext/60214h05.htm#60214h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.430.1/1">I have never been a witness in a criminal case, either at the magistrates court or Crown court, though in a previous incarnation I have cross-examined a large number of witnesses. I was very nearly a witness in Crown court once. My house was burgled and the witness statement I gave as a matter of routine to say what was lost, which was not a great deal, inadvertently had at the top, &quot;Vera Baird, aged 21.&quot; Usually it says &quot;aged over 21&quot; and one of my colleagues, who was defending the miscreant, threatened to call me to give evidence with a head start on challenging my credibility on the basis of that obvious lie. All I had to give evidence of, however, was the value of two tins of John West salmon that had been taken from my kitchen.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/2">I was primarily a defence barrister. There was a tendency among defence barristers and defendants to hope that witnesses would not turn up. I am aware of many cases in which the papers showed that there was no alternative other than to plead guilty, but in which the game plan was to wait and see whether the key witness turned up. If they did not, there was no case. If they did, a guilty plea was entered, but not until the witness had come to court, perhaps at some personal inconvenience and trouble. They were often nervous at the prospect of being cross-examined by somebody like me or at being faced with a hostile experience, head to head with someone they saw as a criminal, in an unfriendly environment in which they felt likely to understand little about the process and how it would work.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/3">It is odd that historically we have not taken much care of witnesses. They are the key people in ensuring that the criminal justice system brings the guilty to book and frees the innocent. As I say, in many cases they are the difference between conviction and acquittal. They are the players without whom all our thousands of criminal statutes, the Crown Prosecution Service as represented by my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General, the magistracy, the Sentencing Guidelines Council and the judges are fairly purposeless. The document that launched the witness care units is called, &quot;No Witness, No Justice.&quot; How right that is.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/4">We have not been aware of the needs of witnesses because many people do come to court to testify because they regard it as their duty as a citizen. However, it is notable that, before the witness care scheme was launched, surveys showed that the people who had least faith in the criminal justice system were the very people who had had contact with it in the previous year. They thought the least of the criminal justice system&mdash;they were not impressed by the contact that they had.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/5">In the past if witnesses were unsure whether they wanted to come to court, our method of getting them to court was pretty simple. If they raised an issue relating to their attendance, such as child care, the distance they would have to travel, or family responsibilities, they were threatened with a witness summons, backed by an arrest warrant. That was that. It was assumed that their inconvenience was outbalanced by their duty to come to court, their concerns were given little credence and they were brought to court.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/6">It is extraordinary that a person, either a victim of crime or a witness to a crime for whom attendance was not really in their interest, would be threatened with the sort of penalty that they thought the defendant ought to get as a result of their witness if perfectly ordinary incidences in their life had led to their expressing doubt about whether they should come. Full use of the court's time was all, and any slight murmur of discontent was met with such treatment. The people who make the system go round were not treated very well.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/7">The courts are full of stories of witnesses who have been inconvenienced. There are stories of victims of highly traumatic offences, such as rape, being brought to court by police on the first day of the trial, as used to be the procedure. The court's time being at a premium, everybody had to turn up, notwithstanding the fact that counsel might want to take up a couple of points of law that might take three quarters of a day to sort out, resulting in the judge saying, &quot;At this hour of night it's no good swearing in a jury, we'll come back tomorrow.&quot; The witness would be brought back the next day, only to find that there was some other delay, so they would have to wait a little longer. That was all to the disadvantage not only of the public but of criminal justice. People get a certain amount of adrenalin running when they come to court to give evidence, and they gear themselves up to it. Hanging around in the waiting room for day after day makes the whole thing go flat, and they lose the resilience to resist cross-examination simply because they have been inconvenienced. We would pay people loss of earnings and travel costs, but that was all the help that we gave.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/8">Then came &quot;No Witness, No Justice&quot;, which set up five pilots of a scheme to require the CPS and the police to set up witness care units to give support to witnesses&mdash;to give them a little attention, to knock the bugs out of their progress from seeing to testifying, and to make them feel wanted. The scheme has been a success, as I shall describe. It has now been rolled out nationally and properly funded, and so on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-13">13 January</phrase> I opened the Teesside witness care unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/9">When an incident occurs, police officers assess the prosecution victims' and witnesses' needs when they take a statement from them. That assessment now forms part of the standard witness form. Dedicated witness care officers employed jointly by the CPS and the police work separately in their own office; they are dedicated to taking care of witnesses. They are a single point of contact from the point of charge and they keep victims and witnesses informed about the progress of their case via the witnesses' preferred means of contact.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/10">The process goes like this. The assessment is made by the officer at the scene. If a charge is preferred, the witness gets a letter from the witness care unit saying, &quot;Mr. Z has been charged with offence Y. There will be a hearing in a week's time, but you needn't come. That will sort out the process of the trial thereafter and we will get in touch with you again.&quot; I say &quot;sort out&quot; deliberately, because lots of letters from the CPS and many public authorities are not phrased in a reader-friendly way for a public who do not understand the criminal justice system, but these letters, as I saw for myself in Teesside, deliberately employ terms like, &quot;this hearing will sort out the progress of the case.&quot; That is understandable, ordinary language, realistically put.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/11">If the witness is required to attend, a proper needs assessment is compiled by the witness care officer. The officer will ask: is there a child that needs care? If so, can the witness's sister, mother or brother be brought in to help? If so, we will pay for that out of the public purse. They tell me in Teesside that they have never had a difficulty. If there is no relative available, it must be problematic to get a child into a nursery for half a day when they have not been going there as a rule. I threatened my senior prosecutor, Mr. Goldman, with the idea that he would have to get himself a bunch of toys, because in the end the children would be in the CPS office. That has not yet occurred, but the service will certainly pay for child care.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/12">If the person lives in east Cleveland, which is a rural area well away from the Crown court, and there is not a bus in time, they will be brought in either in a police car or in a taxi from an official taxi firm picked for its reliability. If they have a problem telling their boss what is going on and explaining it, that can be dealt with by the witness care officer. If the witness is self-employed, witness care officers will see what they can do to help with covering the business for that short time.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/13">The witness care officer compiles a list of whole range of needs and does everything possible to meet them. Victim Support and the witness service at court are less well-placed to help with all that and to pass information between the court and the witness. After all, the CPS and the police are participants in the case with leverage to understand at each stage what is going on and to transmit it directly. Victim Support and the witness service are excellent at giving comfort and support at court, but I have often come across cases in which witness support thought that a message had been received from a police officer involved in the case telling the witness to come back tomorrow when in fact that was quite wrong, and the police officer went round and gave a conflicting message that night. Such cases are very unhelpful. It is important that witness care is carried out by people in the middle of the case, as the CPS and the police are.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/14">More can be done to help. Sometimes witnesses need special measures in court to enable them to give their evidence with confidence. If they are afraid of a defendant, they might ask to give evidence from behind a screen so that they do not have to look in his face and he cannot stare them out. If the witness is vulnerable or young and the case is in the Crown court, counsel&mdash;perish the thought&mdash;might take off their wigs and gowns to try to look like ordinary human beings and not to be so intimidating. It is possible in certain circumstances to give evidence over a video link. The witness care unit will check that all out and deal with it at the earliest possible opportunity, then tell the witness what to expect. Those are hugely important steps forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/15">Intimidation, whether actual or the fear of it, is a key issue for witnesses. Responsibility will fall on witness care units to deal with it, clearly buttressed by police resources. We recently saw a little intimidation close to home when the Secretary of State for Education had an egg broken forcefully on the back of her head by someone from Real Fathers for Justice, as the group now calls itself. That was disgraceful and action should be taken about it. Although there is an argument for not prosecuting the person for such action because it will give the group undue publicity, the contrary argument is that, if someone were willing to do that to the Secretary of State when she was giving evidence in a very small case, what is a more serious criminal likely to do to me if I gave evidence?</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/16">The first witness care unit opened in Teesside in 2005, and I formally opened it on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-13">13 January</phrase>. After three months, it was reviewed and praised. It had handled more than 500 cases and ensured that more than 900 witnesses had been contacted within 24 hours of the court hearing with the result of that hearing. It is important to keep the public involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/17">There are some direct good news stories. A lady at the witness care unit, Miss Andrews, dealt with a burglary case that involved a 72-year-old, wheelchair-bound man. Under the old system, he would more or less have had to fend for himself in getting to the court, although the police would have done what they could. He was willing to give evidence, but physically getting him there was a challenge until Miss Andrews found A &amp; S Wheelchairs, a specialist taxi firm, to take him to court, collect him after he gave evidence and take him home. There was then a retrial, at which time he was collected again. The defendant entered a late plea&mdash;I guess because the witness had turned up&mdash;and the elderly gentleman was disappointed that he did not have the opportunity to speak in court a second time. That was a transformation of the usual attitude that would have prevailed if, without the witness care unit, the man had been fetched and carried to court a couple of times or, even worse, had had to make his own way there.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/18">Rape trials are dear to my heart. In one such case in Teesside, the injured person had given evidence at a trial in August last year, but there had to be a retrial in Teesside Crown court in December. She was willing to come back in December, having formed a good professional relationship with the witness care officer who had supported her throughout the process. The man was convicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Arrangements had had to be made to organise taxis, child care and to bring the witness's mother from work so that she could be with her daughter.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/19">Inconvenienced witnesses are a statistic these days. In 2003, there were 924 inconvenienced civilian witnesses in Teesside. By the end of 2005, only three months after the witness care unit had opened, the number was down to 754&mdash;marked progress, indeed. There were effective trials&mdash;the case is listed for trial and runs its course&mdash;in 25 per cent. of cases in 2002. By the end of 2005 and three months into the scheme, there were effective trials in 48.5 per cent of cases. Consequently, the statistics for ineffective trials have reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/20">Results from the British crime survey show that the percentage of people who believed that criminal justice agencies are effective in reducing crime increased from 26 per cent. in 2003 to almost 42 per cent. by the turn of this year. The number of people who have confidence in the system bringing people to justice also showed a big increase from a little more than 30 per cent. to almost 40 per cent. during the same period. Bad news about the way in which courts treat witnesses travels fast, but so does good news. That confidence is an indicator that good news is being promoted by the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/21">I want my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General to have regard to some worries that I shall now explain. My senior Crown prosecutor in Teesside, Martin Goldman, who is an excellent officer, is worried that there is a risk of too much contact. There are witness care units, but there are also slightly different obligations under the victims code that concern many agencies. There is consultation in respect of the victims charter and the charter and code in respect of children. There are other obligations under different regimes that the police and the CPS have in respect of victim and witness care. Almost as much damage could result from overkill of contact between the authorities and witnesses, especially if it were conflicting contact, as could result if there were none. Are too many initiatives being established in such an area? Is it time to back off and let things just roll along under &quot;No Witness, No Justice&quot; for a while before any complications mess matters about?</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/22">How will police reform have an impact on the availability of local witness care units when the police are reorganised regionally? I repeat my interest in victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. The worry outside the CPS is that vulnerable witnesses especially should have specialist support, which witness care units are not geared to provide. How can we weave that in? Previously, the idea was that such victims would have a specialist officer who would be with them from start to finish; however, the witness care unit is to process them through its usual system in the ordinary way. Teesside has a directory of available support services, but there has been a complaint from Women's Aid that it has tried to contact the Teesside witness care unit to ensure that it is not being ousted. It would be terrible if specialist advice were being ousted for the sake of a system that rolls along very well for ordinary witnesses. Women's Aid is worried about that, or at least about the possibility that it may be involved with cases in which the witness care unit is also involved but that conflicting information may be given because of the lack of liaison.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/23">How can we mesh together the work of a specialist police officer dealing with vulnerable witnesses from start to finish, the work of a specialist outside organisations that can give trauma counselling and support that is outwith the ability of the police, and the work of the witness care unit that looks after the way in which people get to court and what support they need. Is there a danger of overkill? Will there be conflicting advice? Will one oust the other? Those are concerns for us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/24">Conservatism&mdash;not changing things or improving them&mdash;must have governed the whole area of criminal cases and witness care during the Thatcher and Major years because not one finger was lifted to prevent the situation that I have described and that prevailed throughout my early career at the Bar. It was hoped with a good deal of optimism that witnesses would not turn up because no one was looking after them. By contrast, through simple measures such as witness care units and other good schemes based on a radical shift and the perception of who is important in a criminal case, we have&mdash;without disadvantaging the defendant, who remains the important focus of a criminal case&mdash;brought increasing public satisfaction and enabled the courts to provide much better value for money and more people to be brought to justice. My concern centres on the imperative to make the schemes inclusive. They must become not colonisers of witnesses. They need to be promoted and publicised, so that witnesses come to court and know from the outset that they take no risks if they perform their public duty, that they will be minimally inconvenienced, that they will be properly compensated, and that due care will be taken of their interests.</p>
