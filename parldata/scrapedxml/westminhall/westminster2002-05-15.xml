<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.245.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="245"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew0">
	<p pid=".245.3/1">I am pleased to start this debate on a topical subject that is of great importance to our constituents and the national health service. I am glad to see the Minister in her place, and I hope that she will respond to some of my points. I am also glad to see the Opposition spokesmen: the hon. Members for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) and for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris).</p>
	<p pid=".245.3/2">It is necessary to put the debate into the context of the record extra Government investment that the Chancellor of the Exchequer recently announced. I should also mention reform and the Government's commitment to ensuring a modernised, responsive and patient-centred health service. I propose that reform should also apply to clinical negligence and the way in which the NHS deals with those instances, which are inevitable even in the best-run services, where the standard of care is less than we can usually expect from the medical profession. Those instances are sometimes referred to in the jargon, somewhat euphemistically, as adverse health care events or medical mishaps. Newspapers sometimes refer to them as medical gaffes. However, they all come under the rubric &quot;clinical negligence&quot;, which is a broader term in common usage, rather than the narrower term &quot;medical negligence&quot;. Our law provides a remedy for the injured party through the tort of negligence, where it can be established that a doctor, a member of a medical team or a paramedic has been negligent and in breach of duty, and where that negligence has caused injury.</p>
	<p pid=".245.3/3">It is important to refer to the scale of the problem. Clinical negligence has received much comment from the press who, with some members of the medical profession, would have us believe that the problem is out of control. In recent years, clinical negligence claims have increased substantially to worrying levels, but the statistics are not presented clearly. The Minister will have the figures to hand, but I will quote from &quot;NHS (England) summarised accounts 2000&ndash;2001&quot;, which shows that the NHS in England&mdash;I shall come to Wales in a moment&mdash;faced accumulated claims for clinical negligence of no less than &pound;4.4 billion as at <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase>. On any view, that is a substantial figure.</p>

	<p pid=".245.4/1">Our paths have crossed on a number of occasions. I believe&mdash;the hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that they crossed in the Committee considering the Access to Justice Bill. Does he agree that the huge growth in clinical negligence cases was foretold by some during the debate on the widening of conditional fee agreements?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.245.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="245"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew2">
	<p pid=".245.5/1">There are many reasons for the growth in clinical negligence claims. The Access to Justice Act 1999 is one reason; higher awards by the courts are another. However, I shall return to that important point later, because I want to deal with the accounting methods used by the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".245.5/2">That figure of &pound;4.4 billion represents accumulated claims. It is the provision that the Comptroller and Auditor General has said should apply for outstanding claims. It can be regarded as a misleading figure, because it does not represent what is paid year on year to finance clinical negligence awards. I know that the Minister will have the figures. For the year 1999&ndash;2000, for instance, the figure was &pound;373 million. We must not over-dramatise the figures, but the position is serious.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.246.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/948" speakername="Oliver Heald" colnum="246"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew3">
	<p pid=".246.0/1">I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman can help, but is it not right that when insurance companies make provisions they take account of the amounts that are likely to be paid to claimants? They make a risk analysis in relation to the overall claims that will end up being made, whereas I believe that the provision that the Comptroller and Auditor General makes is simply the value of the claims that have been made, which is a different valuation. Is that correct?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.246.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="246"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew4">
	<p pid=".246.1/1">The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on an important point, which I hope the Minister will be able to answer. I am not sure what the provision represents. Is it the worst-case scenario or is it more in line with the system that operates in Wales? I speak as a Welsh Member, but these issues are common to both England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".246.1/2">The figures show that for the period up to <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase> the NHS in Wales provided for a total liability for clinical negligence of &pound;126.7 million. The accounts describe that figure as representing claims</p>
	<p pid=".246.1/3" class="indent">&quot;where there was a probable chance of the claim being settled&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".246.1/4">Can the Minister clarify whether the English figures represent provision in respect of all claims that have been made, or is there a risk assessment as to which claims are likely to be paid out?</p>

	<p pid=".246.2/1">Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the National Audit Office's figures for April this year state fairly clearly that &pound;4 billion is the worst-case scenario?</p>

	<p pid=".246.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. One of the purposes of the debate is to tease out these issues. We need to clarify the accounting basis.</p>
	<p pid=".246.3/2">I want to refer to the views of the lawyers. I express a peripheral interest as a lawyer, although I have not had any experience of clinical negligence cases, at least in the recent past. Lawyers involved in that specialist field of litigation take a dim view of what is sometimes said by those who represent the medical profession, and say that clinical negligence claims should not necessarily be seen as a sinister feature of the health service. They think that rather than foster a culture of cover-up, which has been suggested by some doctors, clinical negligence litigation has been a spur to higher standards, better clinical governance and more openness in the medical profession.</p>
	<p pid=".246.3/3">I shall quote from Mr. Russell Levy, who is a partner in the specialist clinical negligence firm, Leigh, Day and Co. He takes exception to the way in which the National Audit Office expressed the figures on negligence. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-26">26 April</phrase>, he wrote in <i>The Guardian</i>:</p>
	<p pid=".246.3/4" class="indent">&quot;One can't help but wonder whether the national audit office . . . is more interested in grabbing headlines than watching the public purse. Every year, it estimates the total cost of clinical negligence claims against the NHS using a method described by independent health economists, insurance experts and accountants in an article written in the British Medical Journal in June 2000 as 'a grossly misleading indicator of the impending cost of clinical negligence to the NHS'.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.247.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/765" speakername="John Burnett" colnum="247"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew7">
	<p pid=".247.0/1">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will address not only the level of damages, but the huge legal costs that often dwarf the damages provided to the claimant.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.247.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="247"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew8">
	<p pid=".247.1/1">I agree. There is a disproportion between the level of award and the costs that accompany awards, particularly for small claims. That is worthy of serious attention. Some interesting figures in the chief medical officer's report in 2000 suggested the scale of the problem. It indicated that no less than 10 per cent. of admissions to hospitals resulted in some adverse event. I suspect that some of those adverse events were minor, but some were serious. There were 850,000 incidents a year. Many claims are modest, but they clog up the system and take up a lot of time. They also cause considerable anxiety and heartache to patients who have suffered medical mishaps, however modest. Accidents happen even in the best-run systems.</p>
	<p pid=".247.1/2">The cost of additional hospital stays and treatments from adverse incidents must also be taken into account. In 2000, that was estimated at &pound;2 billion. Can the Minister give an indication of the number of small claims as a percentage of the number of total claims? There is a crying need to speed up the process that deals with smaller claims.</p>
	<p pid=".247.1/3">Before I deal with worrying local examples, I should say that the rate of growth of clinical negligence has declined. That may be a reflection of the steps that the Government have taken to manage risk. I shall say more about that later because prevention will clearly always be better than damage limitation.</p>
	<p pid=".247.1/4">I know of two examples from my constituency experience, and I shall refer to them as an indication of the cost of medical mishaps not just in economic, but in human terms. I have a 57-year-old constituent who, a matter of weeks ago, received a settlement of just over &pound;2 million for brain damage that she had sustained during childbirth no fewer than 15 years previously. The solicitor representing her, Mr. Alun Thomas&mdash;no relation&mdash;told me that it had been a titanic struggle. It took no fewer than four years for the health authority to admit liability, which it did suddenly after fighting tooth and nail.</p>
	<p pid=".247.1/5">There was then a protracted argument as to whether my constituent should remain in institutional care, which would have been cheaper for the health authority's insurers, or whether steps should be taken to ensure that she had an independent mode of living. The difference in the cost was no less than &pound;1 million. A compromise was reached, but only after the family fought very hard with lawyers to secure a fair settlement. The costs involved were considerable. In the words of the family:</p>
	<p pid=".247.1/6" class="indent">&quot;What should have been a joyous family event&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".247.1/7">the birth of a child&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".247.1/8" class="indent">&quot;was turned into a living nightmare made even worse by having to fight all the way for every penny of compensation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".247.1/9">Clearly, it should not take so long for such a case to be settled, but it is not unusual. I understand that the average time in which a clinical negligence case is disposed of is five years, but perhaps the Minister will give up-to-date figures.</p>
	<p pid=".247.1/10">My other constituency example relates to Mrs. Maureen Roberts. Her husband was suffering from lung cancer, which was misdiagnosed as arthritis. He was not given appropriate X-rays&mdash;he was given an X-ray of the front of his chest instead of the back and even then not for several months after it should have been taken. Mrs. Roberts had the tenacity to pursue a complaint through the internal NHS complaints system. She was unimpressed because it was slow, cumbersome, difficult to access and an obstacle course. She was put off at every corner and believes that if she had not been strong willed she would not have pursued an internal complaint. She told me that her main motive for making the complaint was not to obtain an apology&mdash;the Minister and other hon. Members in the Chamber will accept that that is the usual priority for patients who suffer low-level clinical negligence injuries&mdash;but to obtain an explanation that would prevent what happened to her husband happening to others. In her view, patients who go through the complaints system represent the tip of the iceberg because many people are put off.</p>
	<p pid=".247.1/11">The Minister was aware that I would be raising my concerns, which I am sure are shared by others, about the complaints system. I do not expect her to comment on those individual cases, but can she give an indication of the Government's thinking on the need to reform the complaints system? It is complex, riven with delay, not independent and seems to favour the medical establishment. My view, which the Minister may share, is that a more streamlined and effective complaints system, perhaps adopting what a recent National Audit Office report referred to as a package system, or a tribunal with the power to award modest compensation quickly, might deal with a large element of clinical negligence cases.</p>
	<p pid=".247.1/12">While dealing with the inadequacies of the complaints system, will the Minister explain how the Government propose to deal with an issue that is continually raised by people who have been involved in clinical negligence cases: the culture of the NHS and the medical profession? I know that I must talk carefully here because members of the medical profession are present.</p>
	<p pid=".247.1/13">Being on the wrong side of a clinical negligence case must cause extreme anxiety to hard-working professionals. It is surely in the interests not only of patients but of the medical profession that we undertake reform. Is there a clear policy on how medical professionals should respond in the case of an adverse incident, where something has gone wrong? Time and again, I hear people saying that nobody gave them an explanation or said sorry. I can understand why it is sometimes not appropriate to say sorry, but can we have some clarity on that? I know that the Government are reviewing the complaints system and that others will have thoughts on the matter, but there seems to be an unwillingness to open up and a lack of candour on the part of medical professionals, which causes great anxiety to patients at large.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.249.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" speakername="Evan Harris" colnum="249"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew9">
	<p pid=".249.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a valid and important point. Not only is what he describes a natural human reaction, but it is the direct consequence of what has been called the culture of blame. It has been described as such by the Secretary of State for Health and, even more tellingly, by Professor Ian Kennedy in the Bristol inquiry report. He specifically said that it is the blame culture&mdash;the fact that the clinical negligence system is blame-oriented and fault-oriented&mdash;that gives doctors an incentive to cover up their errors and those of their colleagues. There is much to be gleaned from Kennedy's recommendations on that matter.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.249.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="249"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew10">
	<p pid=".249.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing attention to what I believe is the fundamental issue. I must part company with him, because I do not share the views of Professor Ian Kennedy. I do not take the view that clinical negligence litigation should be scrapped and that it is itself responsible for an epidemic of secrecy and a cover-up culture. I would say the reverse. As I said earlier, clinical negligence litigation has opened up the medical profession and made it more responsive. It is very important that people who fall victim to negligence, which can happen in the best-organised systems and professions, should have redress.</p>
	<p pid=".249.1/2">With the greatest respect, I think that Professor Kennedy was wrong. That view is shared by the majority of lawyers involved in the case. I do not want this debate to degenerate into a battle royal between doctors and lawyers, but my objective view, coming to it with a fairly open mind, is that the learned professor was wrong.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.249.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/948" speakername="Oliver Heald" colnum="249"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew11">
	<p pid=".249.2/1">Of course, the hon. Gentleman and I are both lawyers. Does he accept that one of the points made by the Royal College of General Practitioners in its response to our consultation document was that many doctors are so shocked and stressed by the experience of the complaints system and clinical negligence process that they retire through ill health? We all want doctors to be held to account when things go wrong, but does he agree that it is worth considering a more informal procedure that gets on with the process more quickly, so that the agony, for patients and the medical profession, is shorter and the formality of the process less frightening?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.249.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="249"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew12">
	<p pid=".249.3/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It would be difficult for anyone to disagree that there must be a speeding up of the process, especially for smaller claims.</p>
	<p pid=".249.3/2">The Government are taking steps to deal with the problem. As I have said, there is greater emphasis on risk management, better clinical governance and prevention. I welcome the advent of the NHS Litigation Authority, which now administers the clinical negligence scheme for trusts. In Wales, the Welsh Risk Pool is a similar scheme. It is clear that through education, systems to prevent accidents happening in the first place and steps to promote best practice, we can learn a lot from mistakes and bring the figures for clinical negligence under control, which is what we all want.</p>
	<p pid=".249.3/3">The Government have said in their NHS 10-year plan that they want reform in relation to clinical negligence and the way in which such cases are dealt with.</p>

	<p pid=".250.0/1">I believe that the hon. Gentleman said that the level of damages and claims in the United States was falling.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.250.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="250"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew14">
	<p pid=".250.1/1">I said that the level of growth in clinical negligence claims has declined. The figures are rising, but the rate of increase has declined. I did not refer to the United States. I think that the hon. Gentleman misheard me.</p>
	<p pid=".250.1/2">The NHS plan calls for reform and, in an important initiative, the Government set up the chief medical officer's committee on clinical negligence in July 2001. The committee has a broad brief, including consideration of a no-fault system of liability. It recently called for ideas, and many organisations have submitted representations.</p>
	<p pid=".250.1/3">I share the views of the Claimant Clinical Negligence Practitioners Group and the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers that there is no such thing as a no-fault system. Even in New Zealand, Finland and Sweden, where such a system has been established, it is necessary to prove causation. In any event, the schemes are very expensive and take money away from front-line services. They do not deal sufficiently with risk management, and eligibility criteria have constantly been cut, particularly in New Zealand. Therefore, I do not accept that a no-fault system is the answer, even for discrete categories of clinical negligence such as accidents during childbirth.</p>
	<p pid=".250.1/4">Reversing the burden of proof for causation would be a far-reaching reform of the law on clinical negligence. Those who are involved in the area know that proving breach of duty is difficult. The law provides for a very demanding test of the medical profession, but the test is qualified by the Bolam decision, which presupposes that it is a defence if the doctor adopted a course that a responsible body of opinion would have taken, even though it may not have been a majority view to do so. The decision has been discussed in various cases, but I do not want to deal with that. I want to discuss reversing the burden of proof.</p>
	<p pid=".250.1/5">Proving fault is one thing, but proving causation can be technically very difficult and can take up a lot of court time. It can result in many experts arguing for years about an issue and a mushrooming of costs that, in many cases, are already out of control.</p>

	<p pid=".250.2/1">Will the hon. Gentleman clarify his point about Bolam? I hope that he is not suggesting that medical decision making should be based on a majority view.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.250.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="250"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew16">
	<p pid=".250.3/1">In relation to negligence cases, the medical profession is in a favoured position&mdash;I do not say that in a critical way&mdash;because the law has accepted that an element of judgment always needs to be exercised. There are circumstances in which one doctor may carry out a particular procedure in one way, and another doctor may undertake it in a different way, or go about the problem differently. The question of judgment is enshrined in the Bolam decision. Doctors can use that as a defence.</p>
	<p pid=".250.3/2">Reversing the burden of proof for causation would help. It would cut delay and mitigate some of the worst aspects of our adversarial system. On small claims, there is scope for a streamlined system, quick explanations, modest recompense given to patients quickly and an integrated complaints and compensation system. The Lord Chancellor's Department has recently issued a consultation paper on damages for future loss. Some of its proposals would help considerably, giving courts the power to order periodic payments and looking again at structured settlements, rather than putting all the emphasis on the need to arrive at a final, definitive lump sum. That might go some way towards relieving the burden on the NHS and mitigating some of the delay inherent in the present system.</p>

	<p pid=".251.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a strong case for guaranteeing NHS care for people with long-term disabilities as a result of clinical negligence, rather than awarding staged payments or, as we have at the moment, large lump sums for private purchase? A guarantee of NHS care, and the funding going into that care, will work both ways: it will provide the care that is needed as well as some financial compensation, and it will improve care generally in the health service.</p>

	<p pid=".251.1/1">I think that there is scope for considering rehabilitation, and perhaps providing, effectively, an indemnity to those who suffer medical accidents, so that they will be looked after. Of course, there is an issue concerning the current legislation because, as the Minister will know, the measure of damages in clinical negligence cases assumes that the cost of future care will be obtained from the private sector. I do not advocate that that should be amended, but the hon. Gentleman's point is a good one.</p>

	<p pid=".251.2/1">Is it not necessary to take account of the fact that the NHS would have to provide those facilities, and there would be a cost? It would be necessary to decide whether it was better on balance for the NHS to provide those facilities at that cost rather than retain the present system, in which they are provided by the private sector. It may be quite a fine judgment in terms of cost.</p>

	<p pid=".251.3/1">That is worthy of close attention and I take the point. It will be interesting to hear what the Minister says about that.</p>
	<p pid=".251.3/2">I take the view that clinical negligence litigation has begun to open up the medical profession. I believe that people need an effective means of redress. There are problems with the complexity and delays of the present system. We should go about reform. I know that the Government are committed not only to investment in the health service, but reform in all areas, including those of clinical negligence.</p>

	<p pid=".252.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" name="Gareth Thomas">The hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Gareth Thomas)</phrase> is to be congratulated on raising this issue for debate. He is also to be congratulated on styling it as &quot;clinical&quot; and not &quot;medical&quot; negligence because we are talking about negligence generally, not confining the debate to doctors. It has to be admitted, however, that most cases are brought against members of the medical profession.</p>
	<p pid=".252.0/2">I shall declare an interest: I am a doctor and, like all medical practitioners, am potentially on the receiving end of the sort of actions that are the subject of today's debate. I regret that claims for negligence against my medical colleagues are becoming more and more common. Indeed, I would probably rank myself in a minority in not having been subject to the threat, suggestion or realisation of such an action. It is important to understand that the overwhelming majority of practitioners do their level best for their patients. That did not come across particularly well during the hon. Gentleman's speech, although I am sure that he intended it to do so. It is important to pay tribute to the hard work of people across the board in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".252.1/1">I have made the point consistently that, even in the best-run systems with the most committed and dedicated doctors and medical teams, accidents will happen. It should not necessarily be regarded as an indictment of doctors or the medical profession that accidents happen.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.252.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="252"  time="010:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew23">
	<p pid=".252.2/1">I am grateful for that clarification because the point is important. Before we become too censorious, which is the general impression that I got from the hon. Gentleman, it is important to recognise that people working in the health service are doing their level best, often under adverse circumstances. It is also important to recognise that it is necessary to build a spirit of mutual trust between all sorts of practitioners and their patients. I recognise that he is a lawyer by profession, as indeed is my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/948" name="Oliver Heald">the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase>, but the ways in which medical practitioners and lawyers operate are very different. Lawyers are very adversarial and deal with tort, which cuts across the general modus operandi of the national health service. It is important to recognise that a threat of legal action can result in a practitioner being pole-axed. Although I have not directly experienced that, I know colleagues who have. Having the sword of Damocles hanging over one's head is truly a devastating experience.</p>
	<p pid=".252.2/2">I take issue with the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that practice might be improved by the threat of action for clinical negligence. I suspect that that is not the case. I recall many occasions on which such a threat was a problem in terms of a person's ability to carry out their day-to-day work.</p>

	<p pid=".252.3/1">As a doctor, will the hon. Gentleman explain, perhaps with one or two examples, the problem for the medical profession of practising what I gather is called defensive medicine, and the problems that that causes for patients?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.252.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="252"  time="010:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew25">
	<p pid=".252.4/1">I am grateful for the intervention. As the hon. Gentleman will know, defensive medicine is a blight on the way in which medicine is practised because it takes a practitioner's eye off the ball. Of course, one should focus on an individual patient's needs with one thing in mind&mdash;how to benefit them, not how to get off the hook in the event of a patient questioning in law what one is doing. One hidden cost of the culture of defensive medicine is the expense to the health service caused by practitioners doing every last test&mdash;it is perhaps the example that the hon. Gentleman seeks&mdash;to make sure that every last eventuality is covered. That involves a huge opportunity cost that has not been recognised in the NAO figures.</p>

	<p pid=".253.0/1">I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but is that not an example of steps being taken to prevent accidents? Sometimes, it is very difficult to draw a distinction between what he describes as defensive medicine and reasonable precautions or preventive measures. In any case, does he not accept that the argument sometimes advanced that the use of defensive medicine is widespread is somewhat overstated? If one asks doctors to give examples of defensive medicine, they find it difficult to cite specific examples.</p>

	<p pid=".253.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention. I think that I gave an example of defensive medicine: the number of tests that might be done unnecessarily and at great cost to the NHS. Such tests therefore involve an opportunity cost for patients.</p>
	<p pid=".253.1/2">It may be useful to reflect on the situation in the United States. Many of us have been quite surprised at the great wave of negligence litigation that has overtaken practice there. This country has not been engulfed in the same way. Indeed, there has been quite a long delay between events in the US and those in the UK with regard to negligence litigation. However, if we consider the way in which patients are treated in the US, and the huge welter of defensive medicine that pervades every aspect of medical care in that country, we can imagine the problems that may lie in store for the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".253.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one difference between the US legal system and ours is that the US has a contingent fee system? A lawyer acting for a plaintiff in the US will receive a percentage cut of the damages if the plaintiff is successful. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if we introduced such a system in the UK&mdash;that is the way in which the pressure on the Lord Chancellor's Department is going&mdash;it would lead to an even greater growth in claims?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.253.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="253"  time="010:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew29">
	<p pid=".253.3/1">The hon. Gentleman may have a good point. I am concerned about the advent of no win, no fee ways of operating for lawyers who specialise in this area. One must at least suspect that that has resulted in an increase in the number of medical negligence claims.</p>
	<p pid=".253.3/2">Many of us worry that the Chancellor's recently announced largesse will be consumed without much in the way of improved clinical outcomes. Part of that concern is derived from the belief that the mounting cost of negligence claims will swallow up an increasingly large amount of the NHS budget. The hon. Member for Clwyd, West referred to various figures that I believe are derived chiefly from the National Audit Office. I share his confusion at the way in which those figures have been represented, and like him I should appreciate clarification from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".253.3/3">The take-home message is that the level of claims in this country is increasing. The figure of &pound;4.4 billion is a projected figure. I understand that it is predicated on claims that we expect in future. Some of those will be very large claims, because they relate to conditions such as cerebral palsy, and the eventual settlements that people receive in such cases are very expensive. Can the Minister shed any light on what the figure of &pound;4.4 billion represents?</p>
	<p pid=".253.3/4">One telling figure from the NAO is that 65 per cent. of settlements below &pound;50,000 had associated costs that exceeded the damages awarded. That is obviously a bean feast for lawyers, but I am not sure that it is terribly good for the NHS and I am absolutely sure that it is not good for practitioners or, ultimately, patients. There must be a better way.</p>
	<p pid=".253.3/5">We understand that, in 1999&ndash;2000, the NHS paid &pound;400 million in clinical negligence costs. Again, I seek clarification, because that seems to tie in poorly with the NAO figures. Expenditure by medical defence organisations in respect of non-vicarious items is not included, so I suspect that the real figure for the whole arena is rather greater than that given by the NAO.</p>
	<p pid=".253.3/6">Patients will continue to lose out hugely from the tort-based system. I do not share the view of the hon. Member for Clwyd, West that it has, on balance, been beneficial and that it is the only way to proceed. There must be more imaginative solutions that do not involve a vast cost to the health service, to practitioners and, ultimately, to the national health system. Patients will lose out collectively through the opportunity cost of the projected &pound;4.4 billion, which I believe relates to outstanding anticipated claims, and individually through the system, which is capricious, slow, bureaucratic and for some impossibly expensive.</p>
	<p pid=".253.3/7">A problem with the current system is that despite obvious harm, litigants may have difficulty pinpointing a specific act of negligence and if they cannot do so their action falls at the first fence. For the great majority of the remainder, the legal process is alien, drawn out and disagreeable. The system is increasingly tilted towards the assumption of monetary compensation, when an apology or explanation may be the desired way to achieve closure. An unhelpful compensation culture has been encouraged by ambulance-chasing law firms wishing to attract instruction in medical negligence cases. No win, no fee specialists use brazen television advertisements to suggest that if a person has suffered in any way someone must be to blame and there is a financial remedy to be had. Some outfits have even set up shop in the foyers of major hospitals. What kind of message does that send out?</p>
	<p pid=".253.3/8">The final report of the Bristol Royal Infirmary inquiry called for an overhaul of the way in which the NHS handles clinical negligence. Some of Kennedy's recommendations&mdash;those on open reporting, sentinel event reporting and governance, for example&mdash;are laudable and within the Government's power to grant. Others, such as a shift to an alternative funding system for compensation, will have to be sufficiently attractive to potential litigants and their legal advisers. However, Ministers cannot assume that changes would result in savings to the NHS in the longer term. No-fault compensation may be helpful to patients and practitioners but despite the view of organisations such as the British Medical Association it may open up a new cost ledger for the health service.</p>
	<p pid=".253.3/9">I broadly welcome the Department of Health's stated desire for better communication and attention to non-monetary remedies and I welcome its resolve to deal with the spiralling cost of claims. However, I want to know what assessment the Minister has made of the effects of the implementation of Lord Woolf's recommendations and of the impact of the NHS Litigation Authority.</p>

	<p pid=".255.0/1">I shall be brief. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" name="Gareth Thomas">the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Gareth Thomas)</phrase> on securing this important debate. He made some valuable and worthwhile points. I, too, declare an interest: I am a lawyer, although I have not practised for about four years. My specialisation was taxation, as will be apparent from the thrust of my remarks.</p>
	<p pid=".255.0/2">It is imperative to find a more sensible system of dealing with claims for clinical negligence; the existing system could be significantly improved. It is important to have the statistics, to see the level of damages and the huge amounts being paid out, involving not only plaintiffs but health authorities. The important National Audit Office document &quot;Handling Clinical Negligence Claims in England&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-03">3 May 2001</phrase>, goes into detail about the costs and huge expenses. I want to tease out from the Minister how the Department of Health is working with the Lord Chancellor's Department to come up with a sensible scheme and to find a solution to an intractable problem. It is unacceptable that billions of pounds go annually not to successful plaintiffs&mdash;sometimes known as victims&mdash;but into the pockets of the legal profession for formulating and pursuing claims.</p>
	<p pid=".255.0/3">I presume that the Minister and the Lord Chancellor's Department are considering some form of early option: openness, discussion, apology and perhaps a scale of damages to be agreed between plaintiff and health authority. An early option system should never be mandatory, but it should be incumbent on the legal advisor to ensure that the benefits and disadvantages of not accepting early settlement are made clear to the plaintiff. The legal profession owes a duty both to the court and to the individuals whom it advises. The advisor should be under a duty to explain at an early stage the benefits and drawbacks of taking early a settled sum in a more formal, less adversarial procedure.</p>
	<p pid=".255.0/4">I hope that the Minister will set out the steps being taken to simplify the legal processes dealing with clinical negligence.</p>

	<p pid=".256.1/1">As a scientist you dine with us, if I may speak for the members of the medical profession present.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/2">I declare an interest as a General Medical Council registered doctor. I am also a member of the British Medical Association, which is lobbying for a change in policy. I sit on its medical ethics committee, although it has no remit in this area. I have never been sued for medical negligence, although many of my friends and family members who are doctors, have been. The threat of future action against them is unavoidably high on the agenda of members of the medical profession, as is the stress and time taken defending or settling existing actions.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/3">We owe a debt of gratitude to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" name="Gareth Thomas">the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Gareth Thomas)</phrase> for bringing up the subject for debate and for his clear exposition of the issues. He was right to point out that those who use the complaints procedure are only the tip of the iceberg of the number who feel fit enough to make a complaint and who have the tenacity to complain about one aspect of their care. Such people are often happy with other aspects of their care and may be afraid that any complaint will be seen as a criticism of the hard work either of those against whom they are complaining, or of others.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/4">Whatever changes are made to the complaints procedure, we need to make it easier for patients to complain and for them to be given support in doing so. The number of people who make claims for clinical negligence is a minority of those who could make claims. As the number of claims increases, the proportion of those that are well founded, which may be different from those that are settled as it can be easier to settle a case than to define it as well founded, may drop. However, that does not mean that people who are not currently applying would not qualify for compensation.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/5">It is important to recognise that the medical profession, like other health care professions, has traditionally had a culture of believing that any complaint or question is an affront to its professionalism. That attitude is changing; it must change. If we want to have not only happier patients but correct management choices, decisions must be made jointly by the clinician, other health care professionals involved, the patient and, with the patient's permission, any friends or relatives whom they wish to involve.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/6">We must deal with the broad policy issues. Whether one agrees with them or not, the Liberal Democrats have clearly defined policy positions. In both an admirable contribution and in his interventions, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/765" name="John Burnett">the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett)</phrase> asked how we could change the existing system in which complaints go to law; specific questions about a no-fault scheme for most claims; and what we could do about the escalating cost of settlements.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/7">I understand that the Government are conducting a review, which is why I hinted that the Minister would probably express few opinions today, as she would not want to pre-empt it. I suspect that we shall hear nothing specific, although even before the review it was difficult to get any specific views from the Government. Although they said that they supported the existing scheme, the fact that a review has been established and that, post-Kennedy, it has been asked specifically to examine no-fault schemes gives us hope that we may have an open review of the issues.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/8">Our first suggestion is that, rather than give lump sums to people to pay for parcels of care from the private sector, we should find a way of providing a guarantee of adequate NHS care, particularly with the increased resources going to the NHS, which should enable new services to be set up. We could invest that money in accessible NHS provision&mdash;not just a national centre&mdash;so that people who have been affected, often tragically, by medical negligence, such as those with cerebral palsy, could benefit from care that was also open to other people.</p>
	<p pid=".256.1/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/948" name="Oliver Heald">The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase> asked the fair question of whether setting up bespoke NHS provision in a local area was any cheaper than individually purchased private provision. That may be relevant in some cases, but in the context of expanding NHS provision, and because care is inadequate for people who do not receive large lump-sum compensation for damage, NHS provision would give us extra value for money. The care from an NHS scheme will be available to people who do not have the resources to purchase the care because they have not been able to get, or do not qualify for, compensation.</p>

	<p pid=".257.1/1">I shall in a moment. The case is predicated on the argument not simply that it would be cheaper to provide NHS care&mdash;the hon. Member for Clwyd, West made a fair point&mdash;but that one would get extra value for money in an expanding NHS, given the extra resources that the Government are putting in, to enable those who are unfortunate enough not to qualify for compensation to access free care on the NHS. I give way to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

	<p pid=".257.5/1">Of course. It is a human right to have access to justice. Indeed, our party has campaigned in this and the previous Parliament to ensure that that is as wide as possible. I was going to come to the no-fault compensation scheme. The key point is to make it attractive enough to dissuade people from recourse to a more expensive, more legally involved and much longer system of NHS care. I can read out Liberal Democrat policy on this at length, but it is well stated by Professor Kennedy in his report. Paragraph 86 states:</p>
	<p pid=".257.5/2" class="indent">&quot;The culture of blame is a major barrier to the openness required if sentinel events are to be reported, lessons learned and safety improved. The system of clinical negligence&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".257.5/3">that is, the existing tort system&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".257.5/4" class="indent">&quot;is part of this culture of blame. It should be abolished.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".257.5/5">Professor Kennedy could not be clearer. The hon. Member for Clwyd, West has been good enough to confirm that he disagrees with Professor Kennedy. It is worth while bearing in mind that even important reports such as that are not unchallengeable. I admire the hon. Gentleman for openly saying that he disagrees strongly with the independent view of a high-profile inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".257.5/6">The Government have draped themselves in the Kennedy report in many areas where we support their policy. They must recognise that if they say that they back the report almost in its entirety and, indeed, take on board the remark about clinical negligence, people will have their expectations raised that they accept the report's conclusions.</p>
	<p pid=".257.5/7">The report continues that the system of clinical negligence</p>
	<p pid=".257.5/8" class="indent">&quot;should be replaced by effective systems for identifying, analysing, learning from and preventing errors and other sentinel events. An expert group should consider alternatives to clinical negligence,&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".257.5/9">that has been set up&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".257.5/10" class="indent">&quot;including an alternative administrative system of compensating those who suffer harm arising from medical care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".257.5/11">Professor Kennedy repeats that in the recommendations on page 451, at paragraph 119. He sets out in some detail why he believes that the blame-based system will, with the best will in the world and despite the quality initiatives that have been introduced, still lead to an under-reporting and under-admission of significant adverse events, even where there has been negligence.</p>
	<p pid=".257.5/12">I should like to deal with a separate question: the quintuple jeopardy that faces the medical profession&mdash;other people may face one or two trials&mdash;which adds to the culture of fear and an unwillingness to own up to errors. If a doctor makes a mistake, he or she faces real trials and ordeals. The first is disciplinary action from his or her employer. Then there is the threat of criminal charges following a police investigation, as happened to a number of my former colleagues. That is extremely stressful and usually does not lead to the bringing of charges. Nevertheless, it means that the matter cannot be settled in other ways. There can be a coroner's inquest, which is a trial-like approach. General Medical Council action can be taken against the doctor. There can be a suit for clinical negligence. There can be trial by media. That is sometimes added to by being sacked on &quot;Newsnight&quot; by a Secretary of State for Health in less than full possession of the facts. It is a major concern that puts many people off going into medicine. The Government should give some thought to streamlining, if not reducing, these processes to prevent prolonged suspension of medical staff who are later cleared on all counts. We have time to touch on only some of the relevant matters in this debate.</p>
	<p pid=".257.5/13">I have one final point for the Minister, who has heard me say it before. We will not drive out errors and negligence from clinical practice unless we ensure that at the riskiest time for patients&mdash;out of hours&mdash;it is the most senior health care professionals, whether doctors or others, and not juniors who deliver care. Those delivering care must also be the most fresh, not the most tired. The proportion of claims in relation to maternity services points to the shortage of consultants in obstetrics at hand to deliver the out-of-hours care in obstetric emergencies that is required. I hope that the Minister will give urgent thought to the need to expand consultant numbers, particularly in high-risk specialties.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.259.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/948" speakername="Oliver Heald" colnum="259"  time="010:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew40">
	<p pid=".259.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" name="Gareth Thomas">the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Gareth Thomas)</phrase> on securing the debate on this important subject. The Conservative party recently concluded a consultation exercise on clinical negligence, which was launched by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/899" name="Liam Fox">the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)</phrase> in December. It is clear from the responses&mdash;I am not going to reveal the final outcome of our deliberations&mdash;that human rights, particularly the right of the patient to redress, have to be counterbalanced by fairness to practitioners. It is a difficult balancing exercise.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/2">Great dissatisfaction exists about the current handling of clinical negligence. That is clear in the Woolf report of 1996, and Professor Kennedy's and the National Audit Office reports of 2001. Reforming the system is not easy. In a wide-ranging speech, the hon. Member for Clwyd, West raised many of the issues on which we consulted: reversing the burden of proof, although we have a different formula for achieving it; having a more streamlined system to deal with small claims; and using periodic payments as a better way of dealing with future loss for claimants. Some of the conclusions emerging from consultation will be of considerable interest.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" name="Andrew Murrison">the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> made the important point that the majority of medical practitioners&mdash;indeed, almost all&mdash;do their best and work to a high standard. We should all pay tribute to that. Many claims are, in the event, not justified. On the latest figures from the NHS Litigation Authority's website, outstanding claims amount to &pound;4.1 billion, yet 75 per cent. of publicly funded cases fail; there has been a sevenfold increase in settlements since 1995&ndash;96; and in 65 per cent. of settlements of less than &pound;50,000, the legal costs exceed the damages recovered.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/4">It is easy to conclude, and I agree, that lawyers are making a fine living out of all this and that something must be done about it. Much can be said for speeding up procedures and aiming for a more informal settlement process. However, it takes two to tango. I should be interested to know whether the Minister is satisfied that people dealing with such cases for the state have always had the ability to settle cases as promptly as they would have wished, had they had the resources available to respond quickly. Have they, as public servants, felt able to take the risk of settling a case as quickly as they should? Does anything need to be done, or is it being done, to change the culture on the NHS side as well as the claimant's side, and to settle cases promptly? A balance should be struck throughout.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/5">The picture is not static. Does the Minister agree that, when valuing claims, it is necessary to take account of a point that has been made today and was made during our consultation by Professor Dingwall of Nottingham university? He said that</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/6" class="indent">&quot;the estimate of outstanding claims is not based on conventional insurance principles. When a commercial insurer receives a claim, this is not entered onto the books at its claimed value. The company makes a judgement about the likely probability of success and discounts the value of the claim by the value of that probability. This estimate may be revised . . . as the case develops and the evidence emerges. The NHS enters claims straight onto the books at the value asserted by the claimant.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/7">Can the Minister tell us the real, discounted, risk-assessed value of outstanding claims? If she does not know, why not?</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/8">The NHS Litigation Authority is a relatively new body. It took on responsibility for pre-1995 cases only in April 2001. Although 1995 may seem a long time ago, there is a substantial body of cases. Can the Minister give any idea of what progress the NHS Litigation Authority has made as it has gradually taken on cases from an earlier period? Is it leading to a more efficient, more prompt settlement of cases? The authority also has an important role in risk management and tries to enforce best practice in health authorities. Can the Minister tell us how the authority is getting on with that?</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/9">The pre-action protocols that were introduced following the Woolf reforms are also relatively new. Many believe that they are leading to quicker settlements, but that was not the purpose of the reforms. Their purpose was to have a more expeditious and sensible course for cases to follow to reach a conclusion in court. Have the Woolf reforms resulted in more cases being settled more quickly? If the Minister does not know, will she commission research into that? The Medical Protection Society, which has a key role, wants to know what effect the pre-action protocol for clinical negligence claims has had. I also want to know.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/10">Does the Minister agree that even if the value of claims outstanding is less than we believe, there is still a case for further reform? Many people who responded to our consultation, including the Consumers Association, InterMediation and not surprisingly, the Academy of Experts, the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Radiologists and many others, were enthusiastic about mediation or at least an independent, neutral evaluation to help parties at any early stage, before a case is started, to try to reach a settlement or to clarify ideas. Does the Minister believe that that has further mileage?</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/11">There was a great deal of support for a package of remedies. The NAO mentioned apologies, explanations, remedial treatment counselling, meetings with medical staff to find out what went wrong, how that can be prevented and other support mechanisms for patients. That package of measures may be as important as the money. Can the Minister tell us her view and what conclusions are emerging from the chief medical officer's call for ideas?</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/12">Can the Minister give us some idea of how she now evaluates the pilot undertaken into mediation? The Mulcahy pilot, which took place following a decision in 1995, took two years and suffered from a low number of cases being brought before the mediators. It was also very expensive. Does the Minister feel that, in terms of policy structure and judicial thinking, the climate has now changed sufficiently for mediation to work better than it did in the Mulcahy pilot?</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/13">Does the Minister have any views on the ideas on which we consulted, such as having a tribunal system to deal with claims for less than a certain amount&mdash;we suggested &pound;50,000? There seemed to be some support for that more informal procedure in our consultation. Does she agree that it may be necessary to consider changes in the law and to have a simpler and more readily understandable definition of what we mean by clinical negligence, perhaps using the model of unacceptable clinical practice?</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/14">We suggested that it should be possible to give compensation through the complaints system in far more cases, perhaps in those likely to be worth less than &pound;10,000. Does the Minister support that idea? Does she agree with some of the ideas that we, the Lord Chancellor's Department and others have discussed on improving the damages regime? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/765" name="John Burnett">The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett)</phrase>, in his very measured speech, talked about having a scale of damages for clinical negligence and about early resolution procedures, and said that the legal profession owed a duty in that area. Does the Minister feel that the present damages structure, which is widely known and laid down by the Court of Appeal, could usefully become a more formal tariff of damages? Again, we examined that in our paper.</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/15"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" name="Evan Harris">The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> mentioned no-fault compensation. One understands the attraction of that, especially in terms of populist rhetoric, but many of those who replied to our consultation suggested that that would be a very expensive scheme, which would not necessarily mean that the people most wronged received the level of compensation that they should, and that it would put an artificial cap on the level of damages. What is the Minister's view on that?</p>
	<p pid=".259.0/16">We have had a very good debate. We have not yet reached all the conclusions that we want to, and the Minister may be in the same position. However, it would be helpful if she shared her emerging thinking with us.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.261.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" speakername="Yvette Cooper" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="261"  time="010:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spmin0">
	<p pid=".261.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" name="Gareth Thomas">the Member for Clwyd, West (Gareth Thomas)</phrase> on securing this important debate on clinical negligence and on initiating such a thoughtful debate on an extremely complex subject.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/2">We all know that the NHS treats hundreds of thousands of patients every day. As several hon. Members have made clear, with so many patients being treated, it is inevitable that clinical errors and mistakes will sometimes occur. When things go wrong, it is important to ensure, first, that there is a process for learning from those mistakes, for responding properly to them and for making all possible efforts to prevent such errors reoccurring and, secondly, that patients receive an appropriate and fair response transparently, clearly, quickly and effectively, and with the minimum trauma.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/3">Under the current system, compensation for harm or injuries suffered as a result of clinical negligence is generally paid only where legal liability can be established. The underlying principles for establishing negligence are enshrined in common law. Compensation is payable where it can be shown that there has been a breach of the duty of care by act or omission, where there has been harm and where the harm was caused by the breach of duty. Each claim for compensation must be considered on its merits. Where agreement is not reached, the issues must be addressed through the civil justice system.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/4">The Government's policy has been that NHS patients who have been harmed or injured as a result of clinical negligence should be able to obtain appropriate compensation. That is as true for NHS patients treated in the independent sector or overseas as for those treated in NHS hospitals.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/5">Concerns have been raised in debates and in many of the reports to which hon. Members have referred about the current system of dealing with clinical negligence cases. Those concerns were highlighted recently in the NAO report entitled &quot;Handling Clinical Negligence Claims in England&quot; and in the response of the inquiry into events in Bristol. The NAO report highlighted the increasing number and cost of claims, the length of time it takes to settle them and the problems caused by the existing separation of the complaints and compensation systems in providing the remedies that claimants say they want.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/6">Several hon. Members have asked questions about the costs and the way in which the figures are assessed. Hon. Members are right that the NAO summarised accounts of 2000&ndash;01 include a figure of &pound;4.4 billion. That is not the NHS's annual expenditure on clinical negligence claims. It is the figure quoted in the NAO summarised accounts for the total provision to cover the possible cost of all existing claims that are likely to succeed, as well as potential clinical negligence claims. It bears no relation to the date of the incidents, nor is it linked to the amount spent in that year. In 1999&ndash;2000, as my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West and other hon. Members have said, the NHS spent &pound;373 million on costs and damages in settling clinical negligence claims.</p>
	<p pid=".261.0/7">Hon. Members have asked about the accounting procedures used. Those procedures are clearly a matter for the NAO. However, I am happy to pursue with the NAO the rationale behind its use of the figures and to write to hon. Members on that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.262.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="262"  time="010:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew41">
	<p pid=".262.0/1">Just for clarity, are we to take it that the figure of &pound;4.4 billion is based on the value of claims that the NHS has received? As we have heard, if they are settled in favour of the litigant, most of them will be settled for a figure lower than the claimed figure. Can we take it, therefore, that that is the absolute maximum and that the figure is likely to be a long way short of that? If so, by how much will it be short?</p>

	<p pid=".262.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right that not all claims are settled straight away. Some may be settled many years later, some at less than their estimated value, and some may not succeed at all. However, as I understand it, the figure is not for all claims ever entered against the NHS. It includes an estimate of those that are likely to succeed, and an estimate on the basis of events that have taken place where a claim may arise in future. However, I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman further after consulting the NAO on the rationale behind its accounting measures.</p>

	<p pid=".263.0/1">Why does the NHS Litigation Authority website today say</p>
	<p pid=".263.0/2" class="indent">&quot;we have potential liabilities for clinical negligence of &pound;4.1 billion&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".263.0/3">when the accounts to which the Minister is referring say &pound;4.4 billion? Professor Dingwall says in his evidence to us that no analysis of risk management is involved: all the claims are included in the &pound;4 billion figure.</p>

	<p pid=".263.1/1">As I have said, I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman on the matter. The figure from the NAO's summarised accounts for the NHS for 2000&ndash;01 is &pound;4.4 billion. That is the figure that I have used in the response.</p>

	<p pid=".263.2/1">The Minister is right in her understanding of the figures. However, we should be worried not about the fact that &pound;375 million&mdash;the last known expenditure on medical negligence&mdash;is somewhat less than the &pound;4 billion-odd being provided for likely successful claims, but about the rate of increase of that expenditure, which seems to be increasing inexorably.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.263.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="263"  time="010:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h01.htm#20515h01_spnew46">
	<p pid=".263.3/1">There is a series of concerns. One relates to what is happening to the resources for clinical negligence; another relates to the response to patients; the third is the way in which the medical profession and the NHS are able to respond by providing clinical care and to learn from experience.</p>
	<p pid=".263.3/2">I am running short of time to respond to all hon. Members' points. Considerable work has already been done to try to speed up claims in the existing system, including work by the NHS Litigation Authority to require panel solicitors to examine every case for mediation suitability, and work to link clinical negligence claims with the wider quality agenda. Work is under way to change the culture and reduce adverse health care incidents following the report entitled, &quot;An Organisation with a Memory&quot;, by the chief medical officer, which aims to promote a culture of openness and learning. That work established the national patient safety agency last summer, which runs a new national system for reporting, analysing and learning from adverse events and near misses involving NHS patients. It is important that we learn properly and prevent future adverse errors. Other improvements have been made in clinical governance and the role of the Commission for Health Improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".263.3/3">Hon. Members have concentrated on the issues of clinical negligence and work by the chief medical officer's committee. It was asked to consider a wide range of options for handling clinical negligence claims more effectively. It has not yet reported, and I do not want to pre-empt its analysis or conclusions. However, I shall set out some of the options that it is considering.</p>
	<p pid=".263.3/4">The most high-profile reform is no-fault compensation. Such a system exists in other countries, and its success has varied. Some of the advantages are that it can speed up the legal process and resolve cases to prevent the need to go to court where only liability in dispute. Some of the disadvantages are that disputes can still occur over the level of compensation, the system may still not deal with the need to receive an adequate explanation of the events leading to injury, and there may also be cost implications.</p>
	<p pid=".263.3/5">In light of the Bristol Royal Infirmary report and the work of the chief medical officer, we have asked the chief medical officer's committee to reconsider the merits of the no-fault compensation option. We have also asked it to consider the interface between the system for complaints and that for claims against the NHS. Those are separate processes, as several hon. Members have said, and a poorly handled complaint can result in a claim. The NAO has recommended a package-based approach for dealing with clinical negligence claims. The chief medical officer is considering whether a more flexible, responsive, patient-focused approach could provide a more tailored response to individual claims.</p>
	<p pid=".263.3/6">The issue of small claims is important and has been raised by several hon. Members. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West, small claims comprised about 26 per cent. of claims received in 2000&ndash;01. There were approximately 2,000 claims for less than &pound;20,000, which remained a low proportion of the overall value of claims. The committee is looking at whether there is a fast-track way of responding to small claims, and at ways in which mediation and structured settlements could be better used.</p>
	<p pid=".263.3/7">The chief medical officer's report is drawing to its conclusion. We will need to publish proposals and consider the way forward, but I will ensure that the issues raised in this debate are fed into the process of deliberations. I think that many useful points have been raised.</p>

	<p pid=".265.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate and I am pleased that it has been fortuitously timed to coincide with the publication of the recent White Paper, on which I must congratulate the Government. The main theme of my contribution to the debate is taken from that paper, which is entitled &quot;Your Region, Your Choice: Revitalising the English Regions&quot;. The theme that I want to draw out is whose region and whose choice is at stake. I want to look at what a region is and how to make it work, rather than looking particularly at the proposed functions. I notified the Minister of several questions that I would be raising.</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/2">First, and perhaps most appropriately of all, I warmly congratulate the Government on what they have achieved so far with devolution for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Greater London Assembly. All are significant achievements and although we may argue about the powers and the processes, they are achievements and a movement in the right direction. Those changes are very welcome to Liberal Democrats and many people in other parties.</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/3">It is easier to deliver devolution to places that self-evidently exist than to other places that may not. Although the White Paper was welcome, it was a long time in coming. There were many false dawns for the White Paper. I am pleased that it has come, although I am concerned that it may be a house built on sand because it skirts over any definition of what a region is and how it has arrived at its conclusions. The paper does not deal with what a region is. A region implies internal integrity and something more than an occasional shared interest because communities happen to be adjacent to each other. Are such areas regions or are they government zones, and should we not call them government zones rather than regions? Such government zones could be designed for bureaucratic convenience and administrative ease.</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/4">In the paper, I was looking for emphasis and the basis on which regional differences were demonstrated. Chapter 1 gave a rather charming emphasis on regional differences and one could easily come to the conclusion that regional identity may be created by a better innate understanding of bodily functions&mdash;as if health inequalities were a product of geography rather than pure economics. The fact is that where there are inequalities in health provision, heart disease or other problems, they are more likely to be a function of economics than geography. The economics of an area determine the health of people in that area. I consider the argument in the paper to be rather flimsy.</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/5">I remember asking zealous regionalists who were concerned about when, how and what functions would be devolved what we would do if the region did not actually exist. The question was met with stunned incomprehension. It was as if I had asked whether we could redefine the boundaries of God.</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/6">I acknowledge that the people of Yorkshire and the north-east are, arguably, lucky. The government zone for their area appears more or less to coincide with a region with its own recognisable identity&mdash;possibly more for some than for others. However, the government administrative zone for many areas is the equivalent of a Soviet-style construct for those who are happy to be dragooned into a soulless bureaucracy without a shred of identity.</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/7">A few general questions arise from the White Paper itself. It is full of references to regions and sub-regions. How does the Minister define them? What principles underlie the Government's policy towards devolution? For example, if the Government believe that decisions should be taken at the lowest possible level, how is that achieved by their approach? The White Paper chose some interesting examples of devolved or provincial structures of government in appendix E, but pretty well all of them point to asymmetric devolution&mdash;not just variable geometry but variable size and geography. Why include the appendix when the Government appear to have dismissed or ignored the lessons learned in many other countries? Have the Government abandoned asymmetric devolution for good?</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/8">For many people, it will be a shock that I have managed to speak for six minutes without mentioning Cornwall. It is because I am interested in the principle of devolution, as well as the potential effect on my own area, that I have concentrated on trying to find the principle in the White Paper. I must congratulate the Minister and the Government on achieving a headline in our local newspaper that I have been trying to achieve for some time: &quot;Cornish home rule denied.&quot; I cannot count the number of times that I have tried to deal with the misapprehensions that arise when we talk about the modest devolution of certain powers. Some people think of border checkpoints and absurd nonsense about home rule. The Government have sent a clear message to the populace in Cornwall that that is not what we are talking about or ever have talked about. It is not what those in the Cornish Constitutional Convention have ever talked about. Therefore, I congratulate the Government on their achievement. Campaigners in Cornwall are interested in cutting Cornwall into the celebration of diversity, not cutting it off.</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/9">The Cornish campaign is an interesting one and a challenge to the Government. Arguably, it is the most popular such campaign. Fifty thousand or more people, from not only Cornwall but outside the area, have signed declaration sheets. A well-argued manifesto was published only a few months ago&mdash;the campaign is coherent as well as popular. It also provides Cornwall with an opportunity to build on the success of achieving objective 1 status, in which the Government played a significant part. The people of Cornwall played a significant part as well and Cornwall's poverty, overlooked for decades, was at last acknowledged. The statistical separation was made and Cornwall achieved objective 1 status.</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/10">We should learn lessons from the process, because we are given now the same arguments that we were given when we were arguing for the statistical split between Cornwall and the rest of the south-west region. We were told that that was an insular move, it could be offensive to our neighbours and it would give succour to nationalists. As we have found in the delivery of objective 1, although we need an administrative split, all those arguments have been proven to be entirely fallacious.</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/11">A lot of people, of course, look at the case of Cornwall, which is, after all, a small place with only 500,000 people, and argue that one cannot devolve government to a place of that size. Sometimes, the arguments are the usual tiresome prejudices of which small communities are often on the receiving end, but when one considers the alternatives it is the only serious option.</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/12">One of the main arguments thrown against the Cornwall case is that Cornwall is too small, but one has only to lift one's eyes above the insular and parochial horizon of the United Kingdom to the wider world and to provincial and regional government in other places. I have visited Canada, for example, and have met the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, which has a population roughly the same size as that of Cornwall. Those provinces are relaxed about their capability to deliver government functions to their people. When they do not achieve the necessary economies of scale on, for example, clinical governance and other such matters, they simply establish strategic partnerships with their neighbours or other provinces.</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/13">I am assuming that we are talking about grown-up devolution rather than a bunch of juveniles being in control. Perhaps, there is something in the English psyche&mdash;perhaps it is just English men&mdash;that leads them to become obsessed with size. We need to challenge the cosy assumptions that we always need a certain size to deliver certain functions.</p>
	<p pid=".265.1/14">The &quot;can of worms&quot; argument is well worth exploring. It concerns questions such as where devolution would leave everyone else, what it would mean for other boundaries, whether it would make a mess and whether it would result in other places with smaller populations making absurd claims for regional status. We may want to take into account the fact that no places with small populations have made such claims. We need to accept&mdash;the Government have accepted this in bravely pursuing the devolution agenda&mdash;that devolution can be messy. To do it properly, one cannot do it tidily. In conversations that I have had with the Minister, he has recognised that.</p>

	<p pid=".267.0/1">The hon. Gentleman may be interested in a quote from the Secretary of State for Wales, who reacted to the White Paper by saying:</p>
	<p pid=".267.0/2" class="indent">&quot;This is the right approach and it reflects the different historical, legal and political practices in every region of the UK.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".267.0/3">Surely that quote supports the hon. Gentleman's case for Cornwall.</p>

	<p pid=".267.1/1">Absolutely. If we are looking for historical, cultural and other reasons to draw boundaries for regions, the hon. Gentleman is right.</p>
	<p pid=".267.1/2">On top of everything else, Cornwall has a distinct history and its own language and Celtic culture, which could provide the bedrock for what many people in Cornwall see as its economic salvation. Cornwall can trade on its distinctiveness and strong brand and use them for not only strategic, but economic, purposes. That case is cogently made in the manifesto and has been made by many other people. For me, however, the process through which we are going is equally important. It is equally important for people in the north-east to go through the process of achieving the devolution of power through debate, and the co-ordination of their campaign is strengthening.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.268.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/805" speakername="David Clelland" colnum="268"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h02.htm#20515h02_spnew3">
	<p pid=".268.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that although communities are important, it is geography that formed them? It is a matter of geography where coal and the major rivers are, which was what formed the communities in the north-east of England. Those communities can be diverse&mdash;for example, there are differences between Tyneside and Teesside. However, we recognise that size is important. Some argue that the north-east is too small to have its own regional government. I come from that area, but have some sympathy with that idea. We would like Cumbria to be included and to expand the north-east for reasons of community, as Cumbria has more of a connection with the north-east than the north-west.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.268.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/907" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="268"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h02.htm#20515h02_spnew4">
	<p pid=".268.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes the point well that the dynamics and geography in different parts of the country operate differently. Many people believe that strategic transport cannot be planned in too small a region anywhere. That assumes that the boundaries between regions are frontiers. I do not believe that they are, nor do the Government intend them to be. Much transport infrastructure&mdash;road and rail&mdash;goes through the government zone of the south-west. Cornwall may be concerned about the development of the Ilminster bypass over the border in Somerset, but it is equally concerned about the A303 further up the road across Salisbury plain and Hampshire. We cannot assume that boundaries are frontiers, whether we are talking about transport or other matters. There is therefore a need for dialogue and strategic partnerships. The argument about a unilateral declaration of independence and home rule is nonsense. It is deflecting all in the north-east and elsewhere from pursuing a proper agenda. That does not help us to propose sensible solutions to the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".268.1/2">I was trying to make a point about the process, which I would enjoy as I like challenging tiresome metropolitan prejudices about small, and especially rural, areas. It would drive many of us forward. It has the capacity to galvanise the local community, as it would help us to promote our own brand and distinctiveness. It would also give us the opportunity to tell people in the wider world what we are about and why the place is so special. It would build the self-confidence of a place that has lacked it for generations.</p>
	<p pid=".268.1/3">I am disappointed that many older councillors are not especially enthusiastic about the campaign for a Cornish assembly. However, young people in Cornwall are strongly in favour of it: a recent youth manifesto made it one of their top priorities. It is interesting that it motivates young people. I wanted to ask the Minister several questions, but I do not want to detain the debate unnecessarily, as others wish to speak.</p>

	<p pid=".269.3/1">I apologise for not being here at the start of the debate. Will the hon. Gentleman give us his views on unitary status? We should focus on that in Cornwall, as it is a prerequisite if we want to consider a Cornish assembly after we have a regional assembly in the wider south-west.</p>

	<p pid=".269.4/1">That is a cart and horse issue. I represent a constituency with a unitary authority on the Isles of Scilly and I appreciate the importance of configuring local government in a way that does not confuse people. The Government are right not to lay another tier of government on top of what already amounts to the confusion of parishes, districts and counties. We need a debate, and I am encouraged by the process that is beginning in Cornwall. We should make progress in a consensual way rather than take snatch decisions that we have to argue about and justify. It is important to get the regional structure right before proceeding to unitary structures below it.</p>

	<p pid=".269.5/1">That poses an interesting question. Is the hon. Gentleman in favour of the retention of Cornwall as an entity in the form of a county council? Under the White Paper, Cornwall will go. In that case, does he view Cornwall as a unitary authority, or will it be carved up?</p>

	<p pid=".269.6/1">Questions of governance and administration are relevant. Local authorities largely administer Government policy. I am seeking to achieve the highest level of governance for the entity of Cornwall&mdash;and for the Isles of Scilly, if it wishes to share in aspects of its governance. My view and my confident prediction is that on the current level of popular support for a south-west regional assembly, Government policy will not succeed. The Government will have to revisit the issue of regional government in much of the south of England. I am pleased and optimistic about making progress in the north. I have demonstrated that the entity of Cornwall receives great popular support and that it makes sense to retain the highest possible governance of that region.</p>

	<p pid=".269.7/1">Time has passed since I wanted to intervene, but I am glad to hear the hon. Gentleman refer to the absence of support for a south-west regional assembly. There is certainly no support for a south-eastern one. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the enthusiasm of youth for a regional solution for Cornwall and the lack of such enthusiasm among older people. I do not know where the division arises: I suspect that youth ends two or three years older than the person who is speaking about the subject. Is it not customary for young people to be more enthusiastic about all sorts of political solutions and for older people, frankly, to be more grounded in realities?</p>

	<p pid=".270.0/1">That is an odd thesis. On another occasion, we could explore some of the underlying thinking and assumptions about youth and age in politics.</p>
	<p pid=".270.0/2">Last Thursday, we heard hyperbole from the Deputy Prime Minister, about trusting people and flexibility. My question to the Minister is this: how much trust are the Government prepared to place in people? If we have witnessed the largest and most popular demonstration of support for a regional assembly in Cornwall, with 50,000 people signing a declaration, how much trust will the Government place in that? If they are prepared to allow 27,000 people in Gibraltar to have a referendum to determine the constitutional outcome for that place, how much flexibility are they prepared to show in their approach to devolution?</p>
	<p pid=".270.0/3">In paragraph 6.5 of the White Paper, the Government say that, in the long term, they are prepared to revisit the issue of boundaries. What will trigger that? Will popular campaigns increase that chink of light and enable places such as Cornwall to revisit the issue?</p>
	<p pid=".270.0/4">The Deputy Prime Minister said</p>
	<p pid=".270.0/5" class="indent">&quot;by embracing diversity we can strengthen the United Kingdom&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2002-05-09.278"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 May 2002; Vol. 385, c. 278</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".270.0/6">I entirely agree, but does the Minister agree that diversity could be greatly embraced by giving regional powers to those small regions that have a strong and diverse identity and culture, rather than submerging them into a wider region? The White Paper claims that the Government want to</p>
	<p pid=".270.0/7" class="indent">&quot;encourage diversity of the English regions&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".270.0/8">but what examples can the Minister give to show that any of their agencies or quangos have in any way encouraged greater diversity than might be possible if the regions were configured to reflect diversity? Paragraph 9.4 refers to &quot;relevant factors&quot; that would trigger a decision by the Government to hold a referendum. An explanation of those relevant factors would be helpful.</p>
	<p pid=".270.0/9">The White Paper constitutes a brave and honourable attempt to provide regional devolution. It is not for me to say, but I am told that people in the north-east, the north-west and Yorkshire are supportive. Given that support, I hope that it will succeed, but if the agenda of consequential devolution is based on envy and people saying, &quot;Well, they've got devolution, so we want it, too,&quot; that will not be a sufficiently motivating factor. If there is a lack of support and enthusiasm for the idea throughout the rest of the country, what will the Government do? Will they, as the Minister and I have discussed, allow those government zones where there is a settled will on the issue to consider other boundaries and make proposals for regional government on the basis of boundaries that the Government do not currently recognise?</p>
	<p pid=".270.0/10">The Government must answer those questions. The challenge for them is to show that they have learned to let go a little, because a control-freak version of regional devolution is destined to fail. The Government's policy of creating city mayors on their terms has made a monkey of them and it would be unwise not to learn the lessons from that.</p>

	<p pid=".271.0/1">First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/907" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing the debate. The lessons of devolution in Wales have a role to play and a real relevance in the debate that is taking place in England. The people of Wales regard the people of Cornwall very much as the western Welsh. Indeed, they sometimes feel that there but for the grace of history goes Wales, so I have great sympathy for the hon. Gentleman's arguments.</p>
	<p pid=".271.0/2">It is, of course, for the people of England to decide whether they want regional assemblies and, importantly, for the people in the regions to decide what the regions should be. However, there is no doubt that following devolution to Wales and Scotland, something must be done in England, and I believe that there are only two options. The first is an English Parliament, working alongside the Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Parliament. The second option is regional assemblies in England. The Government have introduced proposals for regional assemblies, and Wales and Plaid Cymru will follow the developments with a great deal of interest. I hope that we will be able to share our experiences with hon. Members in England.</p>
	<p pid=".271.0/3">The hon. Member for St. Ives made an important point that the choice must be made at that local level. It is vital for the Government to recognise and support any region that is a clearly distinct entity, has a strong historical identity and wants to move forward, in association with the Government, on regional devolution. I must confess that although I am not Cornish, I am one of the 50,000 who signed the declaration&mdash;the hon. Gentleman admitted that it included people from outside Cornwall. I received the publication about the Cornish Constitutional Convention and read it with interest. The fact that an area in England is so proactive in seeking regional devolution should dovetail with the Government's priorities and I hope that the Minister will listen to the hon. Gentleman's comments.</p>
	<p pid=".271.0/4">One of the lessons of the European experience of regional government is that we cannot and should not impose artificial areas. It was most recently tried in Italy, where Umberto Bossi of the Lega Nord tried to make out that northern Italy had a regional or independent status. He failed to convince even the Italian regions and I am afraid that the Government will fail to convince the people of England&mdash;whose decision it is&mdash;that artificial regions can deliver the benefits of devolution.</p>
	<p pid=".271.0/5">It is also interesting to note that regional government is happening within Wales. Having had national devolution, the Assembly has looked to devolve internally. For example, it has met in north Wales and established regional committees for north Wales and other regions. That is another interesting experience that could be brought to bear in England.</p>
	<p pid=".271.0/6">There can be no doubt that there will be huge benefits for regions in England if they accept regionalisation and regional assemblies. Interestingly, the Government deal for the English regions is in some respects better than what was on the table for Wales. Like the Scottish Parliament, regional assemblies will be able to raise tax, which the National Assembly for Wales cannot do. They will also be able to borrow, which the Assembly cannot do, although we would like to. The White Paper made it clear that borrowing and a tax-raising regime within a capping limit was important for local accountability and democracy. I agree and I hope that a similar process will come to Wales in good time.</p>
	<p pid=".271.0/7">How will the regional assemblies be funded? The Minister will know that whatever formula is used will surely have an impact on the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament. Will it be a Barnett-based funding formula? Barnett is totally discredited&mdash;even by Lord Barnett himself and by all independent economists&mdash;and the need now is for a truly needs-based formula to fund the regional assemblies in England and, as long as we have the present situation, the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".271.0/8">It is also interesting to note that regional assemblies are seen in England as a vehicle for delivering economic development. There is huge potential and I welcome the Government's move, but regional government does not deliver economic development if it is not allied to the right policies. Paragraph 4 on page 9 of the White Paper says clearly:</p>
	<p pid=".271.0/9" class="indent">&quot;A key task of government is to ensure that all regions share in the nation's wealth and prosperity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".271.0/10">Unfortunately, under the Wales Office and now the National Assembly for Wales, the Welsh share of gross domestic product has droped from 88 per cent. of the UK level to 80 per cent. Therefore, we want to watch the experience of areas such as the north-east of England with a great deal of caution. Simply setting up regional assemblies will not deliver economic development. Co-operation between them is needed to overcome regional disparities.</p>

	<p pid=".272.0/1">If, for example, the north-east voted in a referendum for a regional assembly but the south-west voted against, how should the funding be decided? The costs of the reorganisation for the north-east would be huge. The running costs for a regional assembly would be an additional burden on the taxpayer and the figures for other associated reorganisations would be high. Should the south-west be compensated for not going off on this hare-brained route or should it be penalised by not having equal money provided as compensation for staying with its shire status?</p>

	<p pid=".272.1/1">I confess that I have not considered that matter. I would imagine that the key would lie in a truly needs-based formula that delivered to all regions of England their share of the nation's prosperity, whether or not they chose to have a regional assembly.</p>
	<p pid=".272.1/2">My final point is a key one. The White Paper accepts the words of the former hon. Member for Caerphilly, Ron Davies, who told the National Assembly for Wales that devolution was a process not an event. Paragraph 4.5 of the White Paper says clearly that there are likely to be further proposals for the decentralisation of responsibilities to assemblies as time goes on. I do not know whether that also applies to the National Assembly for Wales, but I understand that this is a process in England. It is also a process in Wales. We will seek to work with the experience in England and hope to benefit from it. We also hope that we can bring our experience to enrich it too.</p>

	<p pid=".273.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/907" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is significant that the two contributions that follow his speech should come from a Member from Wales and one from Scotland. It emphasises how regional government in England is of importance not just to people in England, but to those of us elsewhere in the UK who already enjoy the benefits of devolved government.</p>
	<p pid=".273.0/2">Regional government in England is a way of completing the devolution process and ensuring that it spreads to all parts of the UK. Any potential instability in the current devolution arrangements for the UK as a whole lies in the imbalance between the large and effectively unitary geographical entity of England, and Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which have devolved assemblies. Regional government in England could rectify that and the one-sided relationship between England and the other nations of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".273.0/3">I am pleased that the example of devolution in Scotland and Wales has encouraged movement towards devolution and regional government in England. It has been the experience in states where regional government started gradually that the regions that originally opposed devolution learned from the examples where it was granted and were anxious to follow those regions that had moved ahead faster. I think of Spain in particular.</p>

	<p pid=".273.1/1">I am surprised that a Member from Scotland or one from Wales can compare regional devolution in England with devolution to the nations of Scotland and Wales. Those are two entirely different concepts, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman would agree. He refers to the imbalance between England and the nations of Scotland and Wales, and Northern Ireland, which I appreciate is neither a nation nor a region. In what way does he, as a Scottish Member, think that that imbalance works?</p>

	<p pid=".273.2/1">I agree that one cannot compare the nations of Scotland and Wales or the community in Northern Ireland with the English regions. The beauty of the Government's approach is that it recognises the differences between areas in England, and that devolution takes different forms in different parts of the UK. That is the way to move forward.</p>
	<p pid=".273.2/2">One cannot say that under devolution, one part of the UK benefits at the expense of another. There is potential instability where one large part of the UK has no regional government, while other parts have their own national assembly or parliament or regional government.</p>

	<p pid=".273.3/1">In the light of the question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1291" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase>, does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the lessons to learn from the unfinished business of devolution in Wales and Scotland is that devolution is most successful in areas that have a strong sense of identity? Scotland and Wales are nations and there is no question where the boundaries should fall. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we should build our regions on strong communities with strong identities?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.274.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="274"  time="011:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h02.htm#20515h02_spnew21">
	<p pid=".274.0/1">That lesson can be drawn to an extent, but I will not be drawn down the same road as the hon. Gentleman. In making decisions on the most appropriate form of government structure, geographical realities and economic structure cannot be ignored. One must find the best arrangement to meet popular needs within an area, region or nation, and to reflect the economic, social and political realities. No solution will fit all. That is what is attractive about the Government's proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".274.0/2">I praise the Deputy Prime Minister for bringing forward, with other Ministers, radical proposals for regional government. I say that not as a loyal member of the Government's party wishing to praise the Deputy Prime Minister, but because he genuinely deserves praise from across the political spectrum for pressing the case for regional government. I pay tribute also to the hon. Member for St. Ives for welcoming the Government's proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".274.0/3">Devolution and regional government in Wales and Scotland are good not only as a democratic principle, but because they lead to improved government. One of the problems in our state is government over-centralisation. Moving away from that will benefit people throughout the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".274.0/4">Some in Scotland have suggested that we could lose from the establishment of a regional assembly in north-east England&mdash;that it could rival Scotland for the allocation of resources or the attraction of inward investment. That may be the case, but different regions will be rivals in some cases and partners in others. Clear economic interests unite Scotland and north-east England, for example, in food and transport, where regional governments and assemblies or national Parliaments and Governments could work together to provide a focus to address problems in a way that a centralised Government could not do effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".274.0/5">I issue one warning to the hon. Member for St. Ives and some of his hon. Friends in Cornwall. I do not want to interfere in the internal politics of another part of the United Kingdom, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".274.1/1">As the hon. Gentleman does not wish to interfere in other regions, or zones, of the United Kingdom, does that mean that when the Bill comes before the House he and his hon. Friends in Scotland will play no part in its deliberation?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.274.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="274"  time="011:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h02.htm#20515h02_spnew23">
	<p pid=".274.2/1">It does not. I shall be happy to debate that point with the hon. Gentleman on another occasion if he so wishes, as we have no time to do so today.</p>
	<p pid=".274.2/2">I do not want to interfere in the internal political debate. I merely observe that almost 25 years ago, when the first referendums were held on whether there should be a Scottish Assembly, some took the position that they were not against Scottish devolution or a Scottish assembly per se, but against the type of devolution on offer then. That was the argument advanced at the time by a former Conservative Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. One reason why the result in that referendum was so close was that the various parties and interests in favour of some type of devolution fell out among themselves. Twenty-odd years later there was resounding support for the establishment of a Scottish Parliament precisely because the various interests and political and social groupings that wanted devolution, including the nationalist party, the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats, had the same agenda and worked together.</p>
	<p pid=".274.2/3">The hon. Member for St. Ives is in danger of losing the entire show and setting back the cause of any form of regional government in south-west England for a long time to come&mdash;which would be extremely unfortunate for those who want regional government in England as part of the wider UK settlement&mdash;because he is unhappy about the type of structure that the Government propose. I make that point not only in respect of the debate in the south-west of England, but because some elsewhere in England may want a form of regional government, but not with the boundary proposed, or not at this time.</p>

	<p pid=".275.0/1">As I recollect, the result of the original referendum in Scotland was gerrymandered. There was a clear &quot;yes&quot; vote; it was the interpretation that resulted in the referendum being lost. If the hon. Gentleman's advice is that we in Cornwall should ensure that the campaign is cross-party, I assure him that the Cornish Constitutional Convention is all-party; it has representatives of all parties and of none.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.275.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="275"  time="011:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h02.htm#20515h02_spnew25">
	<p pid=".275.1/1">As a matter of historical fact, in the referendum in Scotland in the 1970s there was indeed a majority for a Scottish assembly, but a majority of only about 2 per cent. I was against the 40 per cent. rule, which meant that the majority in favour did not result in the introduction of a Scottish assembly. However, a proportion of 33 per cent. in favour and 31 per cent. against was not a resounding victory for the forces that supported devolution, compared with 75 per cent. in favour and 25 per cent. against 20 years later. That is what the hon. Gentleman should bear in mind.</p>
	<p pid=".275.1/2">The hon. Gentleman should concentrate his campaigning in support of the Government's proposals. He can suggest ways of representing what he considers to be the special Cornish interests in the south-west regional assembly, just as in Wales there are regional committees whose structures have been set up to take account of a particular interest or of different parts of Wales. I do not want to contribute further to the internal debate in Cornwall and other parts of England about what form of regional government to support. Again, however, I emphasise that those who support it should be wary of playing into the hands of those who are against any type of regional government whatsoever.</p>
	<p pid=".275.1/3">From the experience of Scotland, I can tell hon. Members that devolution works. It brings improved government to the people and provides an opportunity to focus on the real issues and concerns of the community, which cannot be addressed by an over-centralised form of government. However, there are lessons to be learned from the Scottish experience. One is to be careful of new buildings, a lesson which I hope is taken on board by those who bring forward proposals in England. Nevertheless, devolution is popular. Hon. Members from outside Scotland might not realise that from some of the one-sided press reports that sometimes appear in the UK media. All the opinion polls since devolution have shown that the number of people who support the Scottish Parliament is as high as ever. In the latest opinion poll, the number supporting a Scottish Parliament had increased by 4 per cent. since its establishment in 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".275.1/4">When I say that devolution and the Scottish Parliament are popular, I am not suggesting that Members of the Scottish Parliament are feted in the streets. That is not in the nature of the Edinburgh character. What is special about the Scottish Parliament is that, whatever its faults&mdash;it has made mistakes, like any democratic institution&mdash;it is seen as the Parliament of the people of Scotland, as our Parliament. It may do things that the people do not like but, at the end of the day, just as before 1707, if we do not like what the Members of Parliament do we can &quot;aye peeble them wi' stanes&quot;, as was said then. We can certainly express our dissatisfaction, as well as our satisfaction, with that Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".275.1/5">Once again, I congratulate the hon. Member for St. Ives on initiating the debate. I congratulate the Government on bringing forward proposals for regional government and urge them to implement them and put them before the people and regions of England at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.276.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1291" speakername="Andrew Turner" colnum="276"  time="011:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h02.htm#20515h02_spnew26">
	<p pid=".276.0/1">I, too, am pleased that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/907" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> was able to secure the debate. As the first representative of a constituency that is incontrovertibly part of England to speak in the debate, may I say that I agree with him on several issues to which he referred? The first and most important is the sense of locality and community. I am by no means convinced that the Isle of Wight is part of the south-east of England. I am not convinced that the south-east of England exists as a geographical entity, other than in terms of lines drawn on maps by various Government bodies at various times and adopted subsequently, not least by our European masters, to ensure convenience for some of their purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".276.0/2">Were we to look at the regions in the south-east and along the south coast of England, it is extremely unlikely that we would unite Margate and Milton Keynes, yet that is what the Government propose in their White Paper. I find it astonishing that Bournemouth&mdash;which for centuries, until the intervention of Sir Edward Heath, was part of Hampshire&mdash;should be regarded as so detached from the New Forest, Southampton and the Isle of Wight as to form part of a different government region, and that it might in the future form part of a different sub-regional government.</p>
	<p pid=".276.0/3">Before there is any question of a referendum, the regions should be defined in consultation with local people, at least where there is any chance of the regional boundaries not being agreed and broadly accepted. I speak as someone born in Coventry. Coventry knows pretty well where it is&mdash;in Warwickshire, in the west midlands, in the midlands of England. That is a matter of no dispute, but there is a good deal of dispute about whether Swindon, for instance, is part of the south-west, and certainly whether Swindon and the Scillies are part of the same region. Therefore, I ask the Minister, when he responds, to reflect carefully on whether we should break up existing bodies such as Southern Arts and Southern Tourism, amalgamating them with their counterparts in what is now defined by those bodies as the south-east, simply for the sake of having a regional ballot on a region that may not exist. That is a sure way to lose what the Government want.</p>
	<p pid=".276.0/4">The second point that concerns me is that, according to the White Paper, there will be a maximum of only 35 members on each regional assembly. I am not one to elect more politicians; I would not elect those 35 politicians, given the chance; but the Minister will stand no chance of obtaining support for a regional assembly from the people of the Isle of Wight if they believe that their representative will be shared with people in Portsmouth and Southampton, or Winchester, Basingstoke or Aldershot. That is a totally unsatisfactory arrangement. I am proud to represent the Isle of Wight and pleased that it is still a single constituency. I hope that it remains so for many years to come. I am sure that the people of the island would look for separate representation on any regional assembly that is set up. I should be surprised if people in other regions with their own identity did not feel the same.</p>
	<p pid=".276.0/5">The hon. Member for St. Ives, speaking of Cornwall's aspirations, says that the fact that no other areas have come forward with similar aspirations for their area to be a region strengthens the aspirations of the people of Cornwall. I in no way diminish the aspirations of the people of Cornwall when I say that others have come up with such aspirations. Indeed, the Liberal Democrats in my own constituency did so when they minted their own coins and when they imprint on their county council writing paper, amid the garland of ghastly stars, &quot;A region of Europe&quot;. We are not a region of Europe; we are part of England. I have had run-ins in the past with the Liberals because they feel differently, although I do not expect to do so in the future, as they have learned their lesson.</p>
	<p pid=".276.0/6">The hon. Member for St. Ives said that the process of regionalisation galvanised local communities. He explained why when he said that local authorities are largely bodies that administer government policy. Because of the dissatisfaction with the role of local authorities as bodies that largely administer Government policy, an enthusiasm for regionalisation has emerged in some parts of the country. It is precisely because Governments have for too long been bodies for administering national policy, instead of representing the aspirations, desires, wishes, aims and ambitions of their local people&mdash;I accept that a Government whom I supported did that, but to nothing like the same extent as the current Government&mdash;that regionalisation becomes a possible option. People are seeking a form of self-governance, which I would hope they could achieve as successfully through Cornwall county council, Isle of Wight council or Dorset county council as through regionalisation or by throwing their lot in with Swindon, if they are in the Scillies, or with Woking and Winchester, if they are on the island.</p>
	<p pid=".276.0/7">There are two further matters on which I seek reassurance from the Minister in his reply. The first is that the strengthening of regional institutions such as development agencies, regional chambers and so on will not proceed regardless of the desires of local people. That is the implication of the White Paper, which seems to be saying, &quot;All right, people can vote on an elected regional assembly, but we, the Government, will power ahead with our regional development agencies and our regional chambers, regardless of the fact that they do not represent regions to which people relate and that people may not have voted for, or may even have voted against, a regional elected assembly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".276.0/8">The second matter on which I seek reassurance is that Government funding will not discriminate against areas that choose not to elect a regional assembly. The costs of the regional assembly and reorganisation of local government that may be necessary should be met not by national taxpayers, whether in the United Kingdom or England, but from within the regions that vote for that form of upheaval and additional expense, as they would no doubt benefit from any claimed savings that may follow.</p>
	<p pid=".276.0/9">Will the Minister confirm that no unitary authority, however small&mdash;whether the Isle of Wight or the Scilly isles&mdash;will be abolished following the introduction of regional government?</p>

	<p pid=".278.0/1">The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that a similar debate took place in Wales on whether the establishment of the National Assembly for Wales would lead to a diminution of local government relevance and powers. A recent independent report concluded that the Assembly had strengthened local government in Wales.</p>

	<p pid=".278.1/1">I am pleased to hear that.</p>
	<p pid=".278.1/2">There are three players in the argument about regional and local powers. The third player is the individual. If regions or counties are sucking up power from the individual, that is a form of removal of individual power, albeit accreted to local government rather than the region, which I would not be so confident of supporting. I accept that there is an imbalance in the current arrangements. To a great extent, English people&mdash;perhaps not in the north, but elsewhere in the country&mdash;have learned to live with that. We do not envy Scotland its Parliament, although we are glad that the Scots are satisfied with it. We worry sometimes when Scottish Members of this House try to intervene in English affairs, but the solution to that imbalance is not to introduce regional assemblies that would balkanise England. England is a nation. If we are to solve the problem of the imbalance, let us do so by establishing in the House an English Grand Committee to which legislation that affects only England could be referred.</p>

	<p pid=".278.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/907" name="Andrew George">the Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing the debate. He asked two questions which have not been answered, and I hope that the Minister will pay attention to them. The document does not say which region we are discussing and whose the choice will be. The unitary answer given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/702" name="Candy Atherton">the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton)</phrase> would not devolve power, but centralise it, without adding power to a given area. It would merely centralise local government administration within the area. The unitary answer does not address the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives.</p>
	<p pid=".278.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" name="Simon Thomas">The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas)</phrase> referred to a process, not an event. I hope that he is right and that the White Paper is part of a process and not the end of the line in the Government's thinking.</p>
	<p pid=".278.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" name="Mark Lazarowicz">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz)</phrase> referred to the potential instability arising from the imbalance that exists in the United Kingdom between a centralised English area of some 45 million or 50 million people and the devolved assemblies of the nations and other regions. That is an important point that everyone in England should consider.</p>
	<p pid=".278.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1291" name="Andrew Turner">The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> made an important point about the Government's proposal that regional assemblies should have a maximum of 35 members. He said that that is too small a number to represent fully the diversity of the regions.</p>
	<p pid=".278.2/5">Why is there a need to devolve power? It is necessary because the decision-making process in this country has become too centralised and many powers have been taken away from local areas, partly as a result of internal Government machinations to centralise power, and also because of the external influences of globalisation. The different needs of the many diverse communities throughout the country cannot be reflected in that central decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid=".278.2/6">The Liberal Democrats bring to the debate the clear philosophy of the &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach to government, or to put it more clearly, the &quot;bubbling-up&quot; theory of government, rather than the &quot;top-down&quot; approach. Liberal Democrat principles include accountability and democracy, and the &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach is about allowing a local community to determine its own needs and government, while passing up to the next tier matters with which it feels it cannot deal. The opportunity to conduct root-and-branch reform of decision making in the United Kingdom has been missed. In particular, the opportunity to rationalise tiers of government, rather than add to them, has been neglected.</p>
	<p pid=".278.2/7">Some hon. Members have mentioned quangos, and I should like to spend a little time discussing them. The quangos that exist in our society spend more than local government. They are unelected and their members, who take decisions on the appointed panels, receive payments. A recent parliamentary answer mentioned three types of quango that take decisions in our regions&mdash;health authorities, regional arts boards and regional development agencies. The cost of members' remuneration is more than &pound;51 million for health authorities, nearly &pound;23 million for regional arts boards and &pound;1.3 million for regional development agencies. Any fear that regional assemblies would cost money would be knocked on the head if those three functions were put under the control of regional assemblies, which would pay for themselves over and over again.</p>
	<p pid=".278.2/8">Whitehall does not know best; local communities are better placed to meet local needs. Non-statutory bodies are often better able to deliver services than Whitehall, yet such voluntary bodies and charities often have to look to central Government, rather than to their region, for funding. The Government booklet on the funding of voluntary and community organisations by central Government lists bodies that are active in the regions and which take decisions on behalf of people to whom they are not accountable. The Arts Council, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, English Heritage, the English tourist board, Sport England, the Basic Skills Agency, the Equal Opportunities Commission, the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education, the Countryside Agency, English Nature, English Partnerships, the housing action trusts, the National Forest Company, the regional development agencies and the Rural Development Commission are a tiny proportion of the near-500 bodies that are spending taxpayers' money on behalf of people in the regions to whom they are not answerable.</p>
	<p pid=".278.2/9">The White Paper misses the point about regional government, and the opportunity has been missed to redefine government from the grass roots up and to take under democratic and accountable control those quangos that effectively are the democratic deficit at the heart of our unwritten constitution, which was once described as not being worth the paper that it was not written on.</p>

Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing the debate, which, as he said, fortuitously coincides with the publication of the White Paper. The debate has centred on the contents of that document. The White Paper is so accurate that the map on the front page, which purports to show England, includes the Scottish uplands, but I am sure that the Minister had nothing to do with that inaccuracy.</p>
	<p pid=".280.2/2">The document is ill thought out and confusing. It is more of a sop to the Deputy Prime Minister and the north-east region than anything else. The idea put forward by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz)</phrase> that that is comparable to devolution in either Scotland or Wales is total nonsense. The power that will be given to regional assemblies is tiny in comparison with that given to either of those examples. The powers set out in the document will actually take power away from existing local councils. Public services will not improve because a new tier of regional politicians has been created. New talking shops and extra regional red tape will not boost economic growth or help the vulnerable. The policy of the Conservative party is to get power closer to the people.</p>

	<p pid=".281.1/2">Genuine decentralisation should be to local government, not to regional quangos and bureaucrats. Conservatives want to save counties such as Cornwall, Durham and Kent. We oppose regional government because it will dilute political representation and it is based on arbitrary regional definitions. In his opening remarks, the hon. Member for St. Ives found it difficult to use the word &quot;region&quot; and instead used the expression &quot;government zones&quot;. He has a valid point. The boundaries do not mark natural regions but are just arbitrary lines drawn on a map.</p>
	<p pid=".281.1/3">An interesting article by Christopher Booker in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> included a map that was drawn in 1971 by a Brussels official. The regions set out by the Government are nearly identical to those set out by that Brussels bureaucrat. I shall not go into the European dimension; the evidence is there for all to see, without it being necessary to draw the obvious conclusion.</p>

	<p pid=".281.3/1">No, I shall continue.</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/2">Labour's plans for regional government will mean less, not more, power for local communities. Labour has said that the formation of regional assemblies will require the abolition of the county councils. It flagged that up some time ago in its 1997 manifesto and again in its 2001 manifesto. We should not be surprised that part of the reorganisation will, in fact, destroy the county councils. I have done some quick calculations. If the counties and shire districts in eastern England, which I know fairly well, were replaced with sensibly sized unitaries, the number of elected members within the whole of eastern England would be reduced by about 38 per cent. That is a huge reduction in the number of representatives, at all levels of local government. The idea that the proposal will bring democracy and local councillors closer to the people is nonsense. There will be fewer representatives for the population of East Anglia and I believe that those figures and that analysis will be easily replicated for all the regions.</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/3">I picked up on an inaccuracy in the document. The Minister may care to comment on it today or write to me about it. A table on page 66, on the organisation of local government in the regions, states that the east of England has four unitary authorities out of a total of 54. However, the reference under the map on page 71 is to 20 unitary councils&mdash;a total inaccuracy in the space of a few pages. Is the number four or is it 20? I know for a fact that it is four, so why are the Minister and his Department putting 20 unitary councils down for the east of England?</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/4">We are also opposed to regional government because of the cost. Restructuring costs will be involved in reorganising the local authorities. The last reorganisation, which was of Humberside county council in, I believe, 1998, cost &pound;53 million in one-off reorganisation administrative costs. If that is replicated throughout all 34 remaining councils in England, the total bill will approach about &pound;2 billion.</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/5">We then have the running costs of the regional assemblies. By calculating the costs for the Greater London Authority and apportioning them on a pro rata population basis, the Local Government Association has come up with an annual cost of &pound;300 million a year for administration alone for the eight regional government authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/6">There will also be costs associated with the government assembly buildings. The cost for the Scottish Parliament is huge&mdash;&pound;300 million and rising. The Welsh Assembly building cost &pound;50 million, and the Greater London Authority building will cost &pound;120 million. If we take a reasonably low figure of &pound;50 million for each of the regional authorities, that is another &pound;400 million just to construct offices to house the assemblies.</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/7">On set-up costs, the White Paper blithely mentions that it will cost only &pound;20 million to set up the north-east regional government, but &pound;20 million is a huge amount of money and, replicated in eight regions, the total comes to &pound;160 million. Huge costs will be involved and the Government have not yet told us how the scheme is to be funded. Perhaps the Minister will tell us, in the short time that he has to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" name="Simon Thomas">The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas)</phrase> mentioned the Barnett formula. There have been moves, certainly by the Deputy Prime Minister, to revisit the Barnett formula and perhaps money will be taken from Scotland and Wales to fund this scheme. That would not go down too well, I am sure, but it is a possibility. We have not heard a peep so far on how the Government are going to find the money and in what time scale. It is important that we learn the Government's intentions.</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/9">The White Paper suggests that going down the road of regional government will iron out regional disparities in wealth and income. There is no evidence to suggest that elected regional assemblies will provide a panacea for the problems of regional wealth and income differences. In fact, there is considerable evidence to suggest that regional assemblies will only increase regional disparities. While the present centralised system of government might not achieve economic equality across England, it is probable that the creation of regional assemblies, each pursuing its own agenda and competing with the others, will only add to existing regional inequalities.</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/10">What is the evidence from the rest of Europe, where there is regional government? It is not helpful. France and Germany possess a strong and clear structure of regional government but regional variations in income are just as great as in the United Kingdom. For example, average income in the Paris region is almost double that in the south and east of France. The economic argument that regional assemblies will act to lessen economic disparities between the regions and counter the north-south divide, as the White Paper purports, is deeply problematic.</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/11">The Government have not thought through their proposals on regional government. On the one hand, they are saying that it is a good idea, for all the reasons given in the White Paper, but on the other they are allowing local regions to decide for themselves. Coupled with the referendums on regional government will be the requirement for fairly substantial reorganisation and restructuring at district and county level. It is unclear how the Government will approach that and, again, a huge cost will be involved. The paper talks about the Minister taking soundings. Can the Minister tell us what soundings he and his colleagues are preparing to take? How can taking soundings be measured, in any terms, as a democratic input into finding out what the regions want? That will happen long before the matter is put to the ballot.</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/12">On the referendum ballot, do the Government intend to couple both questions so that as people vote for regional government they vote for a structure of unitary authorities in the same box, or will they vote in preference for both? I think that the Minister is nodding to the former. However, the new boundaries for unitary authorities will be determined, we are told, by the boundary committees. What consultation will they undertake? The last time that we attempted such a scheme, it was incredibly difficult to achieve agreement and, as a result, only a small proportion of authorities went into unitary status. In East Anglia, there are only four unitary authorities among 54, so the costs there will be enormous.</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/13">What worries me, in terms of democratic accountability, is who will control the outcome of the boundary committees. How will they arrive at a consensus for reorganising and redistributing boundaries? That is an incredibly difficult task and I think that the Government have completely overlooked the fact that it will hold up the whole proceedings. We will have piecemeal development on an ad hoc basis.</p>
	<p pid=".281.3/14">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1291" name="Andrew Turner">the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> raised an important question. If some regions go ahead with assemblies, and every expectation is that the north-east wants to and will do so first, will they attract additional money? Will the Government make it more attractive to go down that road because additional grant moneys are available? The Government ought to come clean. If it is such a good idea, why are they not going down the road of making sure that it happens quickly instead of having a piecemeal and ad hoc arrangement that will lead to confusion and instability in local authorities? Already in the north-east, local district councils are saying that they cannot get people to reply to job adverts&mdash;people are not prepared to work for authorities that may disappear in the next three or four years. There is a distraction and hiatus in ensuring that the normal services provided at that level work effectively.</p>

	<p pid=".283.0/1">I regret that I have very little time to respond to several important points that were raised. I would like to join other hon. Members in thanking <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/907" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> for proposing the debate. It is a very good time to debate the topic.</p>
	<p pid=".283.0/2">The White Paper &quot;Your Region, Your Choice: Revitalising the English Regions&quot; has just been published. I note and appreciate the support that the hon. Member for St. Ives gave to that White Paper and many things in it. I believe that it sets out our policy clearly. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister said that he believes that Britain cannot achieve its full potential unless all its regions share in success and drive that success. The proposals in our White Paper will give the regions of England new choices, new powers, and a new voice. That sums up the purpose of the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid=".283.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1124" name="Malcolm Moss">The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss)</phrase> has opposed that proposal root and branch. Hon. Members will remember that during the last debate on the subject it was pointed out that regional chambers are now full of Conservatives taking part in the activities of those chambers. I recall that the Conservatives opposed the Scottish Parliament, in which they are now taking part. It is a similar situation in the National Assembly for Wales and the Greater London Assembly. I anticipate that when elected regional assemblies are up and running, there will be Conservatives present, taking full part in the proceedings.</p>
	<p pid=".283.0/4">In addition to that Canute-like opposition, the hon. Gentleman appeared to set his face against regional assemblies because he really wanted to ensure that community government was alive and well, and therefore he wanted to preserve counties, the well-known vanguards of community government throughout the country. He also opposed the whole idea of the White Paper because it would not produce a perfect outcome. That appears to be a rather strange method of opposition. Of course things will not be perfect. As hon. Members have said, the White Paper sets out a process, which will change further. The opportunity that the White Paper presents to the regions is to allow them to play a much greater role in their own strategic decision making&mdash;in how money is deployed and used in the regions. Although that is not a perfect endpoint, it is a great step forward in terms of how the regions can function best in their own interest.</p>
	<p pid=".283.0/5">The White Paper therefore sets out a series of measures to develop and extend regional policy in England and that should be welcomed throughout the whole country. Indeed, hon. Members have pointed out that it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The regions are in the best position to address their own particular needs. Those needs will be different and the assemblies may well work in different ways. The solution that is suggested in the White Paper is different from the solutions in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London. There are different circumstances and ideas for how the regions might move forward in England.</p>
	<p pid=".283.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1279" name="Simon Thomas">The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas)</phrase> talked about the way in which assemblies might be funded. Assemblies will have a strategic role, which is their purpose. A needs-based formula that resembles that for local government would therefore be inappropriate. The hon. Gentleman will have seen from the White Paper that essentially the money will be provided by a transfer of the funds that are already deployed in the regions, but at present they are deployed without democratic accountability. He will see on page 45 an exemplification of how that transfer of funds might work in a particular region, which was the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1210" name="Adrian Sanders">the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders)</phrase>. The cost of running the assemblies will largely come from a transfer of money that is already being spent by people who are taking those decisions but are not doing so on an accountable basis.</p>
	<p pid=".283.0/7">As hon. Members pointed out, assemblies will have the opportunity to issue precepts and to borrow. The cost of running the assemblies will therefore be absorbed from within the total sum of money available and the savings from transferring officials from the Government offices of the regions to the regional assemblies. I confirm for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1291" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> that there would be no intention of discriminating on funding against regions without an elected regional assembly. The distribution of funding in the regions would remain the same. The fundamental difference would be that an elected regional assembly would have the right to determine how the funding was being used in its region through a block grant.</p>
	<p pid=".283.0/8">The White Paper builds on the successes that have already been achieved and puts the regions at the heart of policies to create a more prosperous and inclusive society. It is relevant to all English regions. Regional chambers will have new responsibilities as regional planning bodies. They will help to integrate regional strategies and improve regional co-ordination. They will enhance accountability in the regions. They will work closely with Government offices and other Government-funded bodies in the region and will be given extra responsibilities to strengthen regional decision making.</p>
	<p pid=".283.0/9">Hon. Members asked how elected assemblies would be formed. Regional assemblies are all about choice. If there is popular demand in a region for an elected assembly and most voters are in favour, it will become a reality. If not, that will not happen. The Government are not imposing regional assemblies on the regions. As with many other important regional decisions, each region must decide. We are giving people the chance to make up their own mind and to help to decide their regional future. There is no secret timetable for referendums. A decision to hold a referendum would be based on the groundswell of interest in the region and the representations made. I agree with the hon. Member for St. Ives that that is a process. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight will see what the word &quot;process&quot; means if he reads paragraph 4.5 of the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid=".283.0/10">Those hon. Members who opposed the White Paper's proposals mentioned several times that they wanted to preserve counties. As hon. Members know, the Government do not have an agenda to abolish counties. The boundary committee would consider a process of local government in that region before any referendum was held. People will vote with their eyes open.</p>

	<p pid=".287.1/1">I am delighted to have secured a debate on this important subject. I am pleased, too, that the Minister for Transport will reply to the debate as last month he visited the project, which, as he knows, is based in my home town, Grimethorpe, and handed over the keys to a 16-seater and a 25-seater minibus, which are both wheelchair accessible and worth a total of &pound;140,000.</p>
	<p pid=".287.1/2">The project is managed by the local rural coalfield transport partnership, which is chaired by my good friend Robin Bates. Before I speak about coalfield community transport, which I shall refer to as CCT, I want to remind the House of my constituency's background, as it is especially relevant to the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".287.1/3">Barnsley, East and Mexborough has the lowest gross domestic product per capita of any constituency in the UK, which is why it is part of the South Yorkshire objective 1 area. It has the highest level of disability, which is a direct legacy of the former mining industry; one in three households in the constituency has at least one disabled person. It has one of the lowest levels of car ownership of any constituency in the country.</p>
	<p pid=".287.1/4">The hinterland of the constituency comprises a pepperpot of scattered former mining communities, most of which have a population of between 2,000 and 6,000 and are located between Barnsley and Doncaster. In terms of transport infrastructure they are quite isolated. Serious economic and social problems arose after the collapse of the local mining industry in the early 1990s. No new work was available locally and people found it hard to get employment outside the area. There was a drive, especially by local youth projects, to enable young people to travel out of the area for personal development and recreation.</p>
	<p pid=".287.1/5">Since 1997, the Government have recognised the need to improve the transport infrastructure in places such as Barnsley and Doncaster. In Doncaster in the current year, a further &pound;10 million is being made available to complete the important Doncaster north road bridge scheme, the total cost of which is about &pound;46.5 million. This year, too, &pound;2.9 million is being made available to complete the Denaby road crossing scheme adjacent to Mexborough, at a total cost of &pound;9 million. Since 1997 in Barnsley, the Dearne towns link road, and phase 1 of the coalfields link road have been completed. In the current year, phases 2 and 3 of the coalfields link road will be completed and provisional funding for the Cudworth and West Green bypass and the Barnsley interchange has been agreed.</p>
	<p pid=".287.1/6">One of the major clarion calls of this Government has, rightly, been social inclusion and CCT is a classic example of what we are trying to achieve nationally in terms of public transport and social inclusion. CCT has its origins in a regeneration strategy that was drawn up for Grimethorpe in the mid-1990s. Community transport was highlighted as a particular matter of concern in the report. A follow-up report, entitled &quot;Grimethorpe Transport and Mobility Feasibility Study&quot; and produced in January 1998, highlighted the need for better public transport provision. A pilot project was started, and one minibus was loaned by Barnsley dial-a-ride to provide accessible transport journeys for youth and community groups in the local area. One trip a week was operated to a local supermarket, and group hire facilities were offered to a range of community groups. The pilot project lasted for six months from November 1998 to March 1999, and the main output was to introduce community-based transport solutions and train local volunteers in minibus operation.</p>
	<p pid=".287.1/7">At this point, I should like to pay tribute to one individual in particular. Local parish councillor Beryl Sargesson has been the main driving force behind the project from day one. The Minister met Beryl when he visited Grimethorpe, and she has asked me to thank him for the time that he took to speak to local people about the project.</p>
	<p pid=".287.1/8">The pilot aimed to enhance the local community's capacity to develop its own transport solution and increase people's employability through training. It trained volunteers in driving and customer care, and operational experience was gained by providing a one-day-a-week service to leisure and social opportunities. A core group of 12 volunteers were involved, three of whom were able to move on to secure full-time employment as a result of their work in the project. A group hire service was offered, but with only one minibus available for the pilot, it was not always possible to meet local demand.</p>
	<p pid=".287.1/9">The project experienced difficulties in securing more volunteers, especially when incapacity benefit rules excluded people from offering more than the occasional hour. It was concluded that the project needed to be developed more professionally and involve a number of paid staff who could deliver services not suited to provision by volunteers. The next period was devoted to acquiring resources and funding to implement the development plan. Funding was secured and the project became operational in June 2000. The main elements of its funding package of more than &pound;500,000 came from three main sources: the Countryside Agency, via its rural transport fund; European regional development fund objective 2 priority 5 funding; and Coalfields Regeneration Trust money.</p>
	<p pid=".287.1/10">The project initially provided transport for community services in the Brierley and Darfield wards, but it was always planned to extend the area covered to include the Dearne to the south and to become a cross-boundary project by extending into the coalfield areas of south-east Wakefield. I am thinking particularly of what we call the SESKU villages, and I am glad to see my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1288" name="Jon Trickett">the Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)</phrase> in his place because they are in his constituency. SESKU stands for South Elmsall, South Kirkby and Upton, which are three mining communities that are very similar to those in my constituency.</p>

	<p pid=".288.0/1">My hon. Friend is a great fighter for coalfield communities, and I pay tribute to him for securing this debate. He mentioned some villages in my constituency, and he will know that deprivation in mining villages does not stop at the Barnsley boundary. Many of the villages that I represent suffer from the same problems of lack of access to work, leisure and education. I pay tribute to the work that he has done, with the Minister and the other people involved, in bringing the project to the area and we look forward to its extension into my constituency.</p>

	<p pid=".289.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for those comments, and I shall refer later to a specific problem with extending the project into his area. I am sure that both he and the Minister will be interested to hear about it.</p>
	<p pid=".289.0/2">The proposals for a revised cross-boundary coalfield rural transport partnership are supported by Barnsley metropolitan borough council and City of Wakefield metropolitan district council and are now being implemented. Countryside Agency funding for a rural transport partnership officer has also been secured. The project management is based on a partnership that involves local authorities, passenger transport executives, Barnsley dial-a-ride, the Countryside Agency and, most importantly, the community, which has representation on the rural transport partnership. Barnsley metropolitan borough council acts as the lead authority.</p>
	<p pid=".289.0/3">The rural transport partnership determines the types and patterns of services to be provided. To date, 700 individuals are registered to travel with CCT. By the end of December 2001, more than 30,000 passenger journeys had been made by CCT services, including almost 4,500 for travel to work and training purposes. Assistance with travel to work and training opportunities are a vital ingredient of CCT, and are much appreciated by local businesses. Evidence of such appreciation can be seen in a letter from a large textile producer in South and West Yorkshire, SR Gent International, which has factory units in Barnsley, Doncaster and Wakefield. It is signed by the head of personnel and is addressed to CCT:</p>
	<p pid=".289.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Dear Madam, I am writing to tell you how invaluable is the transport that your organisation has provided over the past twelve months to our SR Gent site at South Kirkby . . . I am afraid that we would have lost some of our employees if the transport was not available. It is difficult to get to work from Grimethorpe at the time that the unit starts and finishes. It has also encouraged people from the Grimethorpe and Brierley area to apply for employment at the South Kirkby site that would not have done so if this transport was not available. I do hope that the organisation will go from strength to strength enabling it to help other areas similar to Grimethorpe to bring jobs to the people who are seeking employment in areas that would normally be beyond their reach.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".289.0/5">That provides direct evidence of the good job that the partnership is doing and that CCT is providing.</p>
	<p pid=".289.0/6">Altogether, CCT has created 10 new jobs; 32 drivers&mdash;nine staff and 23 volunteers&mdash;have been trained; and six trainees have gone on to paid employment. Although the number of trainees moving into jobs was lower than expected, CCT has assisted the junction project in Grimethorpe, which deals mainly with young people with problems. It provided transport that enabled 20 youngsters to access job search facilities and visit potential employers. Those young people have not usually availed themselves of the more traditional routes into work via the Employment Service. The partnership and CCT are both viewed by Barnsley council as making a substantial and vital contribution to the social inclusion aims and objectives of the Barnsley community plan and the South Yorkshire local transport plan.</p>
	<p pid=".289.0/7">What does the future hold for CCT? I hope that it will be bright. The partnership is extending into west Yorkshire villages similar to my mining communities. The Government must acknowledge that community transport plays a vital role in recognising and providing for gaps in the local public transport network that are not usually met by commercial operators.</p>
	<p pid=".289.0/8">Sustainability is a complex issue. Affordability means that a subsidy is required to provide services. However, a window of opportunity is presented by the Employment Service via jobcentre clubs&mdash;as subsidy can be provided alongside potential sponsorship from employers&mdash;as well as the Countryside Agency, objective 1 funding and, I hope, passenger transport executives.</p>
	<p pid=".289.0/9">It is worth noting that in the Government's challenge fund, community transport is identified as an area to which funding agencies should look to enhance and sustain existing operations rather than to reinvent the wheel. We must ensure that future funding regimes have sufficient flexibility to cope with local community demands and that we avoid too much bureaucracy. The current expansion into West Yorkshire provides a classic example. South Yorkshire is an objective 1 area, but the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth qualifies only for objective 2 priority 5 funding, which can create problems. We need greater flexibility between the two funding regimes. Generally speaking, the provision of objective 1 funding can be very bureaucratic. I acknowledge that accountability is important when it comes to spending public money, but the bureaucracy should not be over-burdensome. I am not convinced that the balance is right for objective 1 funding.</p>
	<p pid=".289.0/10">There can sometimes be a conflict with the need for traffic-calming measures whose specification prevents low-floor vehicles from accessing kerb-to-kerb services. That issue requires much thought and attention from the local highways authority and the local partnership. My right hon. Friend the Minister may have some words of wisdom on that extremely difficult subject that I could pass on to my local highways authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".289.0/11">CCT was designed as a pilot to highlight some of the barriers identified in the coalfields taskforce report; to provide information on the potential changes needed in funding regimes, legislation and regeneration processes, both at a community and economic level; and to focus on residents who were suffering social exclusion and did not have access to a car.</p>
	<p pid=".289.0/12">During the period of operation, CCT has moved from an isolated cul-de-sac in the deprived mining community of Grimethorpe, Shafton and Brierley to being the fulcrum of a best practice project. It is not only achieving its core objectives on travel to work, but adding value to social and self-help community activities that had been stifled by affordability and availability issues. It is widely seen as one of the most successful partnership projects in the delivery of travel to training and work.</p>
	<p pid=".289.0/13">The project involves a continuous search for improvement and excellence as well as community accountability. That is achieved by liaison with communities at varying times of day and periods; passenger surveys, which check the relevance and effectiveness of the services; liaison with strategic bodies; and links with the Employment Service, employers and potential inward investors. I have watched the project grow and mature and I thoroughly recommend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid=".291.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Hurst. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/876" name="Jeff Ennis">the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> knows that I wish to contribute, and my right hon. Friend the Minister has indicated that I have his consent to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".291.2/2">I wish only to emphasise one point that my hon. Friend made. The boundary for objective 1 status goes right through the middle of the coalfield communities, and the pit villages straddle both sides of it. The boundary is in fact a stream, which with my long legs it is possible to straddle. The fields on my hon. Friend's side are worth millions in terms of the money that is available; the fields on my side are rather barren.</p>
	<p pid=".291.2/3">There is the principle of contiguity, however. I understand that, where the boundary is contiguous with an objective 1 area, it is possible for funds to cross it to help to deal with deprivation, because clearly that does not end at a particular stream. Will the Minister ensure that his officials operate with some flexibility when they consider that matter? People travel from Barnsley to my constituency for jobs, and in the reverse direction.</p>
	<p pid=".291.2/4">Finally, I apologise if I infringed the protocol of Westminster Hall, Mr. Hurst. I shall ensure that I do not do so again.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.291.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1242" speakername="John Spellar" speakeroffice="The Minister for Transport"  colnum="291"  time="012:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h03.htm#20515h03_spmin0">
	<p pid=".291.3/1">First, I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/876" name="Jeff Ennis">the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate. I also welcome the comments made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1288" name="Jon Trickett">the Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)</phrase>. Both raised a number of valuable points, which also have a wider relevance.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/2">Transport is at the heart of the Government's agenda for a prosperous and just society. A modern transport system is not just about getting people from A to B; it must also support the Government's wider objectives of rebuilding communities and tackling social exclusion. That is particularly relevant in areas such as Barnsley, Hemsworth and Mexborough.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/3">As we increasingly understand, good transport links and services are vital to achieving regional economic prosperity and stimulating regeneration. They encourage new businesses, allow established businesses to expand and bring potential markets closer. They also facilitate better access to jobs and services, helping to ensure that communities do not become isolated and disadvantaged.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/4">That is why the Government are determined to improve transport throughout the country. We have made it clear that transport is one of our key priorities, alongside education, health and crime. Thanks to the 10-year plan for transport, we have made a step change in investment across all modes and introduced more certainty into transport funding.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/5">Perhaps nowhere is the need for better transport links and services more important than in the former coalfield areas, such as Barnsley, which have suffered tremendous social and economic upheavals over the last thirty years. Many of those communities are predominantly rural in character, typically consisting of small settlements located some distance away from major urban centres. Access to transport is, therefore, vital for residents, many of whom face severe deprivation and isolation. Lack of access, particularly to cars, is one of the major causes of social exclusion in those areas. That fact was recognised by the Government back in 1998 when our coalfields taskforce reported.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/6">Since then, we have agreed to fund, through the local transport plan process, all five of the recommended new road schemes identified by the taskforce and for which bids for financial support have been submitted. That included two new roads to improve access to the Barnsley coalfield regeneration area, and my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough provided the details of those schemes. We have also accepted in the last two local transport settlements the case for a further four major local transport schemes in locations identified by the Coalfield Communities Campaign. The potential regeneration benefits of those schemes were one of the key factors in our decision to give them the green light. We want to see more such schemes coming forward from local authorities in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/7">Important though it is, we do not only need investment in the road infrastructure to stimulate the regeneration of coalfield communities. Public transport improvements are also essential, especially to tackle social exclusion, as we recognise that not everyone can or wants to have access to a car. We are therefore keen to encourage better bus and community transport services in coalfield communities.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/8">The Government recognise that community transport in particular has an important role to play. It can offer a flexible door-to-door service in a way that conventional bus services, which may have a greater relevance in urban areas, cannot. That is particularly important for dispersed communities like the former coalfield areas. Community transport by its very nature also involves the wider community, which is essential if we want more local participation in coalfield regeneration.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/9">Decisions must ultimately be made at a local level by people who understand the needs of that community, working in partnership with local authorities, bus operators, local businesses and interest groups. Partnership working is the cornerstone of our approach to delivering improvements in transport and I am pleased by how that is developing across the country. The success of the partnership approach is very much in evidence in the Barnsley coalfields rural transport partnership. As my hon. Friend said, I saw that in action when I visited his constituency recently. I saw the success of that programme and was delighted to participate in it and to talk to the users and those who have been so active in bringing it about. I am delighted that it is making further progress.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/10">Our role must be to establish the right regulatory and financial framework to enable better public transport services to be delivered to coalfield areas and rural communities generally. That is what we have done. The coalfield communities have received a 54 per cent. increase in funding in the three years following the publication of the rural White Paper, compared with the period 1998 to 2001. The rural bus subsidy grant given to local authorities since 1998 has established more than 1,800 new or enhanced bus services across rural England. South Yorkshire passenger transport executive itself will receive nearly &pound;500,000 this year.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/11">The rural bus challenge has successfully funded a wide range of innovative door-to-door and demand-responsive services, including taxi-buses, dial-a-ride and other community transport services. Several former coalfield areas have benefited from challenge funds and guidance to local authorities on the next challenge round should be published next month. I hope that local authorities representing coalfield communities will come forward with further innovative and well thought out proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/12">As my hon. Friend mentioned, the Countryside Agency is also supporting community-based rural transport projects through its rural transport partnership initiative. That programme has already made a significant contribution to the funding of the Barnsley coalfields rural transport partnership. I understand that the agency has recently agreed to provide further funding for the partnership&mdash;as my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth said&mdash;in order to extend community transport provision north towards Wakefield. That is also important in linking the areas to try to increase access to the Wakefield-Leeds conurbation and its employment opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/13">The Barnsley partnership has also been supported by regeneration funding, particularly from Yorkshire and Humber objective 2 money&mdash;although I take on board my hon. Friends' concerns. Such regeneration programmes offer a valuable source of funding for community-based transport projects in former coalfield areas. It is crucial that local stakeholders work in partnership to secure the funding available, as the Barnsley partnership demonstrates.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/14">I understand concerns about the longer-term future of specific schemes, given that funding is usually only guaranteed for up to three years. We cannot give open-ended commitments to fund schemes requiring significant revenue support in the long term. Each scheme must continually prove its value in meeting the transport needs of the local community, in an efficient, timely and relevant manner.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/15">In terms of individual programmes such as the rural transport partnership programme, it is also crucial to review regularly each programme and evaluate the progress that has been achieved before deciding on the future level of funding. That will help to ensure that we take account of new developments and have the most cost-effective and efficient means of delivering the improvements that we want in rural transport services.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/16">We are not only providing the investment. We are looking to transform the regulatory framework for community transport so that this sector can grow and thrive. Dial-a-ride services such as those supported by the Barnsley partnership are now benefiting from the recent extension of bus fuel duty rebate to community transport operators. That has been widely welcomed across the country. The extension, from May 2002, should slash fuel costs for many section 19 community transport operators, saving them hundreds of pounds each year. Many have welcomed that development, which will create a more level playing field with commercial bus services.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/17">We remain committed to consulting on possible changes to the current regulatory framework to reduce any unnecessary barriers to further expansion of the community transport sector. Consultation has been under way for some time. We want to consider routes and timetables on registered services especially, to make it easier to run flexibly routed bus services, which may serve areas such as Barnsley and Hemsworth more effectively than the conventional pattern. That will benefit both mainstream bus services and those provided under a community bus permit, which provide vital services to the general public.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/18">Once the consultation is under way, we will look at the scope to relax the rules on voluntary sector transport. However, that is a difficult issue, as we must strike the right balance between providing useful freedoms and ensuring the proper level of vehicle safety checks, as well as the right balance between operators.</p>
	<p pid=".291.3/19">I acknowledge the concerns expressed so effectively by my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough on behalf of his community. We remain committed to the regeneration of former coalfield areas such as Barnsley, and determined that transport should play its part in that regeneration. Better public transport to meet the community's needs is essential if we are to tackle social exclusion. Community transport, from dial-a-ride to shared taxis, has a valuable role to play, as the Barnsley coalfields rural transport partnership demonstrates. The Government have an important role in setting the right regulatory and financial framework, but the local community working in partnership can also help to deliver better public transport. Barnsley coalfields rural transport partnership shows the way forward for other coalfield communities, and we hope that it will continue to flourish.</p>

	Somerset Levels
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.295.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1048" speakername="Ian Liddell-Grainger" colnum="295"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h04.htm#20515h04_spnew0">
	<p pid=".295.1/1">I am delighted to hold a debate on the Somerset Levels.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/2">The Somerset Levels are a unique feature in the United Kingdom. If you will cast your mind back, Mr. Hurst, to prehistoric times, the Levels began as an alluvial flood plain, and have, over the years, seen enormous change. At the time of floating villages across the Mendip hills and near Street, the area was built up by alluvial flooding and the destruction of forests. Over the years, the change has been the change of man. Avalon is at the heart of the Somerset Levels; one can imagine Arthur being taken off to Avalon, and ultimately to Glastonbury, to be buried. It is said that there was an inland waterway or lake, which was really a sea that ran from Bridgwater, around Glastonbury, and then covered the area surrounding what is now the Somerset Levels.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/3">Since that time, man's intervention has created the Levels that we see now. We, as prehistoric man and his successors, decided to drain the Levels because we needed them for high-quality grassland and to keep back the flood water. By doing that, however, we created an artificial area. The Dutch are way ahead of us on that. In relation to the Levels, we have created a flood plain held back by walls of mud.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/4">The problem, of which the Under-Secretary is fully aware, is that global warming is upon us. The water is rising by millimetres a year; that may not seem a great deal, but if it continues for 50 to 75 years, the entire area could suddenly become an alluvial flood plain once again. In the past, one year in 60 was the average frequency of a major flood, so it could be guaranteed that nothing would probably happen for 59 years; a little water might come, but the dam walls could hold it back.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/5">The past five years have seen three major floods. That flooding has not just come over the banks; it has brought Bridgwater, Taunton, Langport and others under a direct threat. If that continues, the area could be cut off not only from the M5, but from the two railways that service London and Bristol, and from the A303 into Yeovil, although that does not quite come under the Levels.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/6">I have just printed off two maps from the Environment Agency's website. The first shows the flooding area over the years. I am delighted that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/951" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase>, whose constituency is the other side of the Somerset Levels, has just joined me. The map is interesting because it includes a considerable amount of Bridgwater, much of Illminster and a considerable portion of my right hon. Friend's constituency in Wells.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/7">The second map is the flood plan, which shows a completely different situation. One sees a waft of blue that would leave Glastonbury, Street, Bridgwater, Langport and Yeovil under serious threat in a major flood. The agency is not being alarmist, but showing where it believes there could be a major flood in future. If we go by what happened two years ago, when there was enormous pressure on dam walls throughout the levels, it is clear that the agency is not scaremongering, but suggesting a possibility. The agency is now rightly saying, through the Under-Secretary, that building on flood plains must be seriously questioned. I shall return to that point, but I urge him to stick to what he has said because our worry is not simply to do with insurance. If there were a major problem, we would not be able to reach people because of the speed of the water coming in. Having seen it, I know that it is positively frightening.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/8">What is the role of the Environment Agency? The Environment Agency was a slightly hybrid organisation, set up to administer the rivers and waterways, and it has now taken on flooding as one of its major areas of work. It has done sterling work in the Somerset Levels&mdash;I have no problem with that&mdash;but what backing does it receive from the Department for an area that faces a direct threat?</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/9">The Environment Agency's problem is that the flood defence banks in the Levels are not in good shape. A massive amount of money needs to be spent on them. Over the past few years, when the walls have shifted, the Environment Agency has spent money on them. But when we ask the agency how much more money it needs to spend on what is a difficult plain to defend, the figure runs into many millions. The Environment Agency needs the backing of the Department to do the job that it is charged to do, which is to defend the Levels from wholesale flooding.</p>
	<p pid=".295.1/10">Over the past few years, a problem has arisen between the drainage boards and the Environment Agency, of which I know the Under-Secretary is aware. The problem is that there are two competing organisations. The drainage board is charged with looking at the reans&mdash;or streams&mdash;and cleaning them out and keeping them clear, with the Environment Agency overseeing the work. However, because the precepts have not always been paid to the Environment Agency by the drainage boards, as the Under-Secretary is aware, the bodies have been at loggerheads for some time. I urge him&mdash;I have no easy answer&mdash;to bring them together somehow. If the two bodies&mdash;one established for many generations and the other comparatively new&mdash;remain at loggerheads, that will cause problems for the future.</p>

	<p pid=".296.0/1">As my hon. Friend knows, we share the Somerset Levels and I am delighted that he is raising this important issue. He has put his finger on the nub of the problem. The Environment Agency and many other environmental bodies seem to regard the rivers and drainage reans of the Levels primarily as environmental assets, when they were put in there in the middle ages for drainage purposes to protect agriculture and those who live and work there. Is there not a case for reorienting our efforts by recognising the utilitarian and industrial purposes of these assets, instead of treating them simply as environmental assets?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.296.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1048" speakername="Ian Liddell-Grainger" colnum="296"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h04.htm#20515h04_spnew2">
	<p pid=".296.1/1">I agree, and I shall come to that point. The Levels have three facets; industry, tourism and a thriving farming community that has been there for generations.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/2">As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, the drainage boards were set up to deal with drainage, but the problem is that there are an enormous number of them. The Under-Secretary is aware how many there are. I am not sure that I know myself, because they cover a vast area. If we could find a way to bring all the bodies together so that there were no conflicts of interest&mdash;as a result of which precepts are not always not paid because of ongoing disputes&mdash;we could produce a much better overall strategy in the Parrett catchment area. The problem has been going on for a long time, but it worries me that it is continuing, because the moment a disaster occurs, the finger of blame is always pointed, and it is a fickle finger.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/3">The Parrett catchment area project, in which the Under-Secretary was heavily involved, was set up to manage the water and the future of a highly floodable area. The Department has now put &pound;61.5 million into the Environment Agency, rising to &pound;65 million, and ultimately the allocation will be &pound;114 million in 2003&ndash;04. I am delighted about that. Will he consider how we structure that money? My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells made a valuable point about the environment. The environment is marvellous and we must protect it, but we must also take a broader view. The Levels have an enormous industrial base, going back centuries, including Clarks in my right hon. Friend's constituency, British Cellophane in mine, Royal Ordnance and many other organisations. If they went under water, it would be catastrophic for the area. Will the Under-Secretary comment on that?</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/4">How can we approach the problem? The Under-Secretary knows what I am going to say. I want to refer to the Parrett barrage and the Parrett sluice, which is a way of controlling the Parrett. From Bridgwater to the sea, for eight miles, there is only a 4 ft drop; that is very little to play with. The Environment Agency&mdash;with the Parrett project, under Humphrey Temperley&mdash;has looked at putting a barrage or sluice at that point. If Hinckley C power station had been built, that would have helped to pay for it; but it is not on the agenda at the moment. Between &pound;15 million and &pound;20 million is needed. I accept that it must be seen as a long-term project, but I hope that the Under-Secretary will agree that it deserves serious attention, even if money is made available only for a detailed study to demonstrate whether it is a viable operation. If it is, we need to build it; if it is not, we still have to address the problem of flooding in the area.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/5">There is nothing clever about the sluice; it controls the water up to 4 ft or 5 ft, the water builds up behind it, the tide goes out and the water goes out. That is straightforward. However, what it allows is a stop-gap between the backing-up of the Tone through Taunton and the Parrett through Bridgwater. If we can stop the water from coming back up at high tide, we will save the homes of a great number of people.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/6">To give an example, there has been talk of managed retreat on the Steart peninsula, which is a marvellous area for bird watching. I do not accept the concept of managed retreat. We are not in a position to do it because we cannot control the power of water; we know that. If we try to control the power of nature, we do it at our cost. In that example, we would spend an enormous amount of money on few homes. However, if we did not, there would be serious repercussions for the environment, and the confidence of my constituents and those of my right hon. Friend the member for Wells&mdash;certainly in Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge&mdash;would be fatally undermined.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/7">How, then, can we proceed? Two inland seas projects have been considered, involving low-level water-holding catchment areas, one covering 4,000 sq m, at the cost of &pound;23,000, and the other covering some 75,000 sq m. If we cannot control water, I agree with the idea of inland seas. I put it to the Under-Secretary that such projects will cost millions of pounds. That is not a lot, relatively, but I worry about the effect that they will have on local economics, on the local and surrounding landowners and on the people who live nearby.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/8">We can create the seas, but how will the compensation for this environmentally sensitive area be put in place, given the existing constraints of the common agricultural policy, which I hope will be reformed? I do not believe that the two can be balanced. The studies are ongoing, but I worry about the aspiration to move 3,500 m of soil out to allow a sea to move in. I have grave worries, and constituents who have written to me&mdash;it does not affect my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells' area, but the principle is the same&mdash;are concerned about the consequences for their homes in the long term.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/9">We must keep the Levels vibrant, so what else can we consider? Tourism is massively important; the M5, two railway lines and the A303 come through the area, but people do not stop there. They go to Glastonbury to climb the tor and to enjoy festivals, but they do not naturally come to the Levels because we have no attraction that automatically brings them in. The battle of Sedgemoor took place in the area; had that had a different result, we might not all be here. If we want to have a thriving community, we must encourage tourism.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/10">The Government have looked at a lot of ways to attract tourists to the south-west. The regional development agency&mdash;not an organisation with which I always agree&mdash;is charged with that and promotes the whole area. There are more sites of special scientific interest on the Levels than anywhere else in the United Kingdom. It is a unique area. I do not say that it should be a world heritage site, but it is at that sort of level. If we want a thriving community there, people need to brought in to enjoy the area.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/11">What about the wildlife? That is a subject close to the Under-Secretary's heart. For instance, Berwick swans, golden plover, teal, widgeon and other water fowl live on the levels&mdash;as many as 20,000 of them. That is stunning. I am an ornithologist, and I find it a beautiful place. Can we not encourage more people to come and enjoy it?</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/12">In its latest advertising campaign, the regional development agency showed the Clifton suspension bridge at Bristol with giraffes on it. The Under-Secretary knows that we do not have many giraffes on the Levels. We need to bring people to the area; if we can bring money to the area, we can do more to secure it. What about making it a special area of conservation? I know that that is being considered. If it were achieved, would more money be available? Could money be made available from Europe, through whatever mechanism we can find? I have already touched on the need to increase tourism. We have had cider growers and a vineyard in Somerset, and many people visited the area. However, many left because farming changed.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/13">People are reluctant to set up business on the Levels. The recent opening of the catchment project offices is Middlezoy is a fine example, but it is unusual. People do not want to move down there because of the flooding problems. If we want to encourage people to do that, we should not just emphasise the Bridgwater area. As the House is well aware, the area has problems in finding industrial land that is not on the flood plain. The last industrial land to be created had to be raised by 4 ft.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/14">Building homes on flood plains is a thorny problem. The Environment Agency has set down firm guidelines. However, Sedgemore has been asked by the Government to build about 2,000 houses&mdash;an enormous number. However, houses cannot be built on the escarpments; the Levels are difficult to build on; homes cannot be built on much of the Quantocks; the coastline is somewhat erodeable. So where do we put the homes? The Government may say that we must build those houses without the land being available. We are going through the planning inquiry now, and the targets are difficult to achieve. I hope that the Under-Secretary will tell his colleagues that it is not always easy.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/15">The Curry report mentioned three things that would be especially useful in our area. The first was modulation. I am not a great fan of it, but if we had modulation in farming, could it be used for only one part of an area? Could the modulation of 10 per cent. of an area be more useful in helping the environment than if it were applied collectively? I do not know the answer to that. Secondly, Curry mentions rural enterprise schemes and talks about a substantial increase, with a mid-term review, for rural enterprise. What is available to help rural enterprise in areas that are important to the well being of an area as vital as the Somerset Levels?</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/16">Lastly, Curry spoke of encouraging co-operatives. Rather like badgers, the subject seems to come round every two weeks. Is any mechanism available to the Under-Secretary to consider co-operation? That happens with cider to an extent, and with farmers markets and so on, but the Levels are unique. Many farms there are organic farms, which produce extremely high-quality produce in an area that comes under the category &quot;special&quot;. I hope that he will respond to that.</p>
	<p pid=".296.1/17">I assure the Under-Secretary that I shall keep going on; indeed, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and I will continue to push for the future of an area of outstanding beauty. The west country would be badly depleted if anything happened to that area. Along with the Environment Agency and other organisations&mdash;including the Department&mdash;we will work together to ensure a future for the Levels. I hope that, in 50 years' time&mdash;we will probably be pushing ourselves around in wheelchairs by then&mdash;we can look back and say that we did a good job. If we do not do a good job, I worry for the future.</p>

	<p pid=".299.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1048" name="Ian Liddell-Grainger">the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger)</phrase> on securing a further Adjournment debate, following that of <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-25">25 March</phrase> on the subject of farming in Somerset. I understand the points that he raises, which he made in a reasonable, articulate and reasoned way. As he is aware, I know the area well. I have been involved in discussions about it for some years, and I am pleased to see the progress that has been made, especially through people coming together to tackle the problems. There was tension in years gone by, and people took polarised positions, and I am glad to see that change.</p>
	<p pid=".299.0/2">The hon. Gentlemen touched on the major issue of flood management, and I understand the point. We must take global warming into account, but I assure him that it is taken into account in our investment programmes, engineering standards and projections. The potential impact of global warming&mdash;rising sea levels and changing weather patterns&mdash;has been built into our long-term projections. We are working on the worst-case scenario, as that is the most sensible way to act. The projections may turn out to be worse than reality, but it is better to be on the safe side than to put people at risk.</p>
	<p pid=".299.0/3">The flood risk maps were a good innovation by the Environment Agency, as they gave people an idea of where there was flood risk. However, they do not quantify the level of risk. People need not panic if they see their areas within the maps; the maps need to be more sophisticated, but that will come over time. The agency is considering the issue, and hopes to give people a clearer idea of what the maps mean.</p>
	<p pid=".299.0/4">I also understand the hon. Gentleman's point about drainage boards. I declare an interest in that I am the honorary vice-president of the Association of Drainage Authorities, so I have a close connection to those authorities. I have a long interest in the subject, as much of my constituency in north Lincolnshire is low-lying and relies heavily on drainage boards to keep it from going under water. I have followed the progress of drainage authorities with some interest.</p>
	<p pid=".299.0/5">DEFRA and the Environment Agency support the production of water level management plans. Every drainage board will have to produce such a plan, which will provide an opportunity to talk to the agency and other interested parties in the Somerset Levels about ways of tackling points such as those made by the hon. Gentleman. There would not necessarily be a conflict in terms of a pattern of drainage between environmental interests and the interests of agriculture or the wider community. The important issue is management.</p>

	<p pid=".300.0/1">I know that the Under-Secretary knows a good deal about the subject, but will he acknowledge that the reluctance of the Environment Agency to dredge reans and drainage rivers is a problem? Dredging can disturb wildlife and fauna, but the water needs to keep flowing for drainage purposes, which requires dredging. There can be a conflict&mdash;as was well articulated by my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater&mdash;with the balance shifting too far in favour of conservation to the detriment of the primary duty, which is to drain areas in our constituencies.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.300.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1122" speakername="Elliot Morley" colnum="300"  time="013:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h04.htm#20515h04_spnew4">
	<p pid=".300.1/1">Yes, I can see when that balance&mdash;that is the key word&mdash;between conservation interests and those of the agricultural community is needed on occasion. Sometimes there is a role for dredging and keeping drains clear, and that is the principle responsibility of the drainage authorities and boards. However, dredging can sometimes have marginal benefits, depending on the circumstances of where it is done and what it is for. As the right hon. Gentleman will know, the agency is obliged to take the relevant legislation on wildlife protection into account, especially in areas of special scientific importance. It must consider certain European Union directives as well, such as the habitats directive. The question is one of balance, and that balance can be struck.</p>
	<p pid=".300.1/2">Specific points were made about the Parrett sluice, in which there is plenty of interest. I acknowledge the work that has been done to try to identify a more sustainable approach to flood management in the Somerset Levels. As the hon. Member for Bridgwater will know, I met with Humphrey Temperley and discussed the options for future flood management in the catchment area. The report is an important step towards a solution. Everyone involved should be congratulated on that.</p>
	<p pid=".300.1/3">Much remains to be done on the report because many more technical assessments must be made, including investigating the role of a sluice and whether it would be effective. That work is under way, and DEFRA is funding a catchment area study, which is complementary to the work being done by the catchment area project study.</p>
	<p pid=".300.1/4">In addition, DEFRA is providing some &pound;3 million in grant to the Environment Agency for strengthening flood defences on the lower River Tone at Baltmoor wall and Stanmoor bank. The Stanmoor bank reduces the risk of flooding to residential and commercial properties, a main line rail track and agricultural land in Stanmoor. The Baltmoor wall retains floodwaters within Currymoor and Haymoor, thereby defending Northmoor and Saltmoor, which also protects residential and commercial properties and a main trunk road.</p>
	<p pid=".300.1/5">In response to the autumn 2000 floods, grant-eligible expenditure for Somerset's local flood defence committee has increased from &pound;3.5 million in 2001&ndash;02 to &pound;4.4 million in 2002&ndash;03. The grant rate has increased from 65 per cent. to 75 per cent. in Somerset, in recognition of its particular needs.</p>
	<p pid=".300.1/6">The possibility of a sluice is being considered, with the normal technical, economic and environmental criteria being taken into account. However, big engineering projects that seem to represent the solution to a problem may not, in fact, be the solution. With periods of high river flow, backing up may occur even with a sluice, and if the water could not then escape there could still be a flood risk. That solution must be examined, as the Environment Agency is doing.</p>
	<p pid=".300.1/7">I accept, too, that there is an issue of structural funding. An advantage of DEFRA, which brings together environmental and flood defence funding, is that it can take a holistic approach. I do not rule out the possibility that we could give support through our agri-environment programmes to landowners who deliberately flood their land as part of an overall project. We should draw a distinction between land that floods regularly and land that is deliberately flooded, as a strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".300.1/8">I ask the hon. Member for Bridgwater to consider issues such as managed retreats on their merits, as they are a sustainable form of flood defence. We must consider each area on its individual merits. We do not take a blanket approach to the idea of managed retreats, as there may be different solutions for different areas, with different management and engineering options.</p>
	<p pid=".300.1/9">I accept the hon. Gentleman's point about the tourist potential of the Levels, which is an internationally important wildlife centre. Many people go there for that reason. On my visits, I have seen farming businesses that have diversified, with on-farm shops selling produce and providing facilities for visitors, which has been good for the farms, for the area and for tourism. There may be more potential for such moves, and the regional development agency will consider that possibility along with the local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".300.1/10">The area has some fantastic attractions and is internationally important. We recognise that it is also an environmentally sensitive area, and put considerable sums into the area through ESA&mdash;environmentally sensitive area&mdash;agreements. Farmers in the Somerset Levels received &pound;3.3 million of direct support to maintain landscape and wildlife last year. Some 70 per cent. of the area and 65 per cent. of the SSSI land fall within the ESA boundary. The ESA is well established, and we are devoting considerable resources to it.</p>
	<p pid=".300.1/11">With regard to the hon. Gentleman's final three points, we are considering the Curry report and the question of modulation. Ring-fencing for an area is a double-edged sword, because the east of England would be keen on that, too, which would distort the amount of money available nationally. We will consider that issue, although it is difficult.</p>
	<p pid=".300.1/12">I discussed the rural enterprise scheme this morning with the Minister for Rural Affairs, and we are looking to see whether we can simplify and extend it.</p>
	<p pid=".300.1/13">On co-ops, there is potential support through the Farm Business Advice Service and the Rural Development Service. We also fund and provide planning advice, which I hope that farmers will take up. We are only too happy to give them that support.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.303.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="303"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h05.htm#20515h05_spnew0">
	<p pid=".303.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this short debate on the problem of the erroneous transfer of gas and electricity customers. This is by no means the first time that the issue has been raised in the House; there have been debates and parliamentary questions, and two early-day motions have been tabled in this Session alone. The fact that I am raising the issue again is an indication of the way in which the problem has persisted and, indeed, spread.</p>
	<p pid=".303.1/2">In many ways, erroneous transfer is too polite a term for the totally unacceptable behaviour of several major power suppliers. In some cases, I am afraid, terms such as scam and fraud come to mind. Erroneous transfer refers to the problem of customers being transferred against their will from one power company to another. They then find themselves entrapped in a morass of bureaucracy, administrative chaos and Kafkaesque resistance to efforts to sort the problem out. At best&mdash;if one can put it like that&mdash;the problem arises from incompetence. At worst, however, it often arises from selling techniques that vary from heavy-handed to fraudulent. I want to describe in a little detail some of the ways in which erroneous transfer manifests itself.</p>
	<p pid=".303.1/3">Consumers sometimes find that they have been transferred from one energy supplier to another on the basis of a signature on a contract or some other indication of consent, such as a verbal agreement. It turns out later, however, that they never signed the document in question or, if they did, they did not realise that it was meant to be a contract to transfer to another energy supplier.</p>
	<p pid=".303.1/4">I have come across several such examples in my constituency, and the consumer watchdog Energywatch details many cases in its recent report. It tells, for example, of a customer in Dundee who received a welcome letter from Virgin Energy, which was addressed to her husband. It claimed that a verbal agreement had been made, but her husband had died some years previously. A 92-year-old registered blind woman in London was tidying the balcony of her flat when she was approached by a British Gas sales agent. Her son found out later that she had been persuaded to sign a contract, even though she could not see what she was signing.</p>
	<p pid=".303.1/5">One of the worst cases that I came across was from the west midlands. A British Gas sales representative told a woman who did not have a good knowledge of English that her electricity supplier would soon go bankrupt, steal her money and leave her without power all winter. The woman, who had a disabled baby, was panicked into signing a form to change suppliers and issue the necessary direct debit instruction to the bank. As it happened, however, the bank account was in her husband's name, and when he returned home later that day, the sales reps were waiting for him, demanding that he sign the direct debit instruction. He refused, and they tried to pressure him into signing. They then physically prevented him from returning the form. He later found that the British Gas direct debit department had tried to set up a direct debit from his account.</p>
	<p pid=".303.1/6">Often, cases of erroneous transfer reveal incompetence, rather than heavy-handed selling techniques. My constituents Sarah Shepherd and Stephen Watson actually wanted to transfer their electricity and gas supplies from ScottishPower to Scottish Gas. They signed the forms, but nothing happened. After lots of telephone calls and correspondence, Scottish Gas told them that they had not taken over as their new energy suppliers. Not surprisingly, my constituents got fed up with being given the run-around by Scottish Gas. You can imagine what happened next, Mr. Hurst. Having told their energy supplier that they no longer wanted to transfer to Scottish Gas, after several months they began to receive letters from Scottish Gas saying that the company had after all taken over their gas supply.</p>
	<p pid=".303.1/7">The problem for my constituents is that they were in the process of moving house and, to cut a long and complicated story short, they then received an incorrect bill and final demands for hundreds of pounds, which after months of correspondence and phone calls were cancelled only when I was able to intervene in the case.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.304.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/775" speakername="David Cairns" colnum="304"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h05.htm#20515h05_spnew1">
	<p pid=".304.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that, in this day and age, it is extraordinary that companies such as ScottishPower and Scottish Gas take so long to let people know whether they are supplying electricity or gas to a particular resident? One thing that I have found frustrating, as I am sure he has, is the length of time that it takes for the companies to verify whether they are providing a service. From his extensive experience, does he know of any other company or organisation that does not appear to know whether it is providing a service to an individual?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2002-05-15.304.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="304"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020515/halltext/20515h05.htm#20515h05_spnew2">
	<p pid=".304.1/1">One would be hard pressed to find a similar example. My hon. Friend's point is illustrated by yet another example from my constituency. The case was not one of erroneous transfer but of erroneous failure to transfer. In this case, the company concerned, Spidacom Ltd., wanted to transfer its electricity supply from ScottishPower to npower. The supply was taken over by npower but the company failed to install the necessary meter for the off-peak tariff, which was the reason why the business had transferred in the first place.</p>
	<p pid=".304.1/2">It was claimed by npower that ScottishPower was making it difficult to install the off-peak meter. Mr. Hansen, the director of Spidacom, cannot say whose account is correct&mdash;npower's or ScottishPower's&mdash;but it is certainly true that, for almost nine months, all his electricity was being charged at the day rate and he was unable to get the off-peak meter that he had sought in the first place. Again, I was able to take the case up and, by a strange coincidence, his off-peak meter was installed just six days ago.</p>
	<p pid=".304.1/3">Those cases are just a few among many. I have had many more in my constituency and I know from comments from other hon. Members since the topic of this debate was announced that practically every other Member of this House has experience of similar problems. There have been various reports in the media and I particularly want to pay tribute to the excellent work of Sean Coughlan of <i>The</i> <i>Guardian</i> in exposing some of the problems with energy mis-selling.</p>
	<p pid=".304.1/4">What worries me is that I am sure that, as MPs, we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg. Intervention by the MP normally helps to resolve the problem eventually, and I was amused that, as late as yesterday afternoon, I received a faxed letter in my House of Commons office from London Electricity relating to a case that I had taken up on behalf of one of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".304.1/5">However, how many people are out there who have not gone to an MP or to Energywatch but are suffering in silence? I am particularly worried about elderly people, those who may not have a good command of English or those who are not familiar with our country's bureaucratic systems. My experience, and that of other MPs, is confirmed by the consumer watchdog Energywatch. It says, in one of its recent reports:</p>
	<p pid=".304.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Unscrupulous sales methods are used by the gas and electricity companies all around Great Britain, often by household names.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".304.1/7">In Scotland alone, Energywatch received 8,500 complaints in a year, of which 25 per cent. concerned erroneous transfers, many of which the watchdog says were caused by cowboy sales agents.</p>
	<p pid=".304.1/8">Although the watchdog names npower as a top offender, it says that the rogues' gallery has many members. Among those whom I have discovered to be the subject of complaint, either in my constituency or elsewhere, are Scottish Gas, Virgin Energy, London Electricity, British Gas and Swalec. That shows clearly that the problem cannot be described in terms of a few sales reps; just a few bad apples in the barrel. It seems more likely that there is a whole orchard full of such apples. The extent of the problem is so bad that it must raise the suspicion of a certain amount of connivance&mdash;or, at best, complacency&mdash;about such practices on the part of some of the energy companies.</p>
	<p pid=".304.1/9">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/758" name="Des Browne">the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne)</phrase> has drawn to my attention the case of Mr. Robert White, aged 70, who was the victim of what was indisputably fraudulent mis-selling by an npower sales representative. My hon. Friend has demanded that npower refers the case to the police, but in spite of his repeated demands, it has simply washed its hands of the matter by saying that the sales representative worked for a third-party agency, whose responsibility it is to take further action.</p>
	<p pid=".304.1/10">I know that the problem of mis-selling worries the Government and my hon. Friend the Minister in particular, and I know that the industry has adopted a voluntary code of practice, but still the examples continue to come. The voluntary code does not yet seem to be working and tougher action is certainly needed. Even Energywatch has been the subject of complaints from some of my constituents because it has not dealt with their complaints effectively. However, in fairness, I should add that other constituents have paid tribute to the effectiveness of intervention by Energywatch, and I have seen the good results of its intervention. I congratulate Energywatch on its &quot;Stop Now!&quot; campaign, which suggests that some action can be taken to try to deal with the problem of erroneous transfer. I endorse the suggestions that Energywatch makes.</p>
	<p pid=".304.1/11">Energywatch wants the industry regulator, Ofgem, to strengthen the conditions in operating licences, which govern the way in which energy companies should behave when selling to consumers. It wants Ofgem to use its fining powers on companies that engage in the sort of scandalous mis-selling that I have described. In my view, a few hefty fines and the loss of an operating licence for the worst offenders would be an excellent way to encourager les autres.</p>
	<p pid=".304.1/12">Energywatch wants the energy companies to set up a rogues register of sales agencies and individuals who fail to meet acceptable standards. It wants gas and electricity companies to pay proper compensation to consumers for the distress and inconvenience caused by the malpractices of their sales representatives, rather than merely refunding the bare minimum for financial loss, as happens all too often. It also favours the introduction of a standard format for energy supply contracts, which would help consumers to understand their contracts and compare them with those of other suppliers. Those seem like eminently sensible steps to deal with a scandal of immense proportions, and I hope that the Government will do what they can to turn them into reality.</p>

	<p pid=".306.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz)</phrase> on securing the debate and thank him for raising an issue that concerns us all. I know that that sounds like a ritualistic introduction, but this is an especially appropriate subject for an Adjournment debate, and I am grateful to have a peg on which to hang a few remarks about the issue. As my hon. Friend was good enough to recognise, there should be no doubt about my personal commitment to resolving the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/2">In my ministerial role, I am inundated with letters from parliamentary colleagues, written on behalf of constituents who have, through no fault of their own and without their prior knowledge, been transferred to another supplier. If the number of letters that I receive is sufficient to make such an impression, it is a clue to the size of the iceberg that lies below the surface, because this is a problem of enormous scale.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/3">So that I would be up to date with the effectiveness of exhortations against such practices, I carried out some checks this morning, and the figures that I found may be of some interest to hon. Members. Yesterday alone, Energywatch logged more than 650 complaints, and last month alone, it received 13,198 complaints. Those figures are extraordinary and totally unacceptable, and I want to give clear notice that if the existing law and its enforcement is insufficient to deal with the problem, the law and its implementation will have to be strengthened.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/4">This might be a good time to highlight some of the main offenders. Unfortunately, the latest available figures for a reasonable period cover September to November last year. There must be a lag to allow a period of reconciling when companies can challenge a complaint. The figures to January this year should be available in the next couple of weeks and I assure my hon. Friend that they will be published and that the statistics will be transparent. When I go through the names from the September to November period last year, one or two names crop up again and again. On an initial reading of the latest figures nothing much seems to have changed in the interim.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/5">The figures show that the three gas companies with the highest number of direct selling complaints per 1,000 transfers were Beacon Gas/Seeboard, npower and Cambridge Gas. The three worst offenders per 1,000 transfers were npower, London Electricity/SWEB/Virgin Energy and Seeboard. Turning to transfer complaints, which include erroneous transfers, the companies with the highest number of complaints about gas per 1,000 transfers were npower, Beacon Gas/Seeboard, and Cambridge Gas. For electricity, they were npower, Yorkshire Electricity and ScottishPower/Manweb. I draw the attention of hon. Members to the fact that npower appears in all four lists, which is a matter of some public interest.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/6">The power to do something about those malpractices already exists. Consumer law and energy regulation provide a firm basis for all those involved&mdash;be they Ofgem, trading standards departments or the police&mdash;to take appropriate action against suppliers and salesmen. It is imperative that those powers are used to good effect before we consider additional powers. Anyone who commits forgery in that context is guilty of a criminal offence. I do not see why any police officer or law enforcement agency should decline, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith suggested, to investigate a prima facie case of forgery.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/7">&quot;Erroneous transfer&quot; is a label that is applied to a range of problems. Essentially, they have two causes. The first is that an error has been made, whether in the information about a consumer's meter or address held by a supplier, or in the transcription of that information. A consumer may then be welcomed to a new supplier, of which he may never have heard. The second is when a salesman has, perhaps on the basis of information acquired in an underhand way, transferred a consumer's supply. Again, the consumer will be welcomed to a new supplier. While the causes of the problem are different, the impact, whether simple inconvenience or actual distress, is very similar. I emphasise that I am referring to erroneous transfers and not the wider problem of high-pressure selling.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/8">I want to go into more detail about the different aspects of erroneous transfers and the responses to them. I shall deal first with transfers that arise from erroneous data or from an administrative mistake by an employee of a supplier. There are millions of gas and electricity meters throughout the country. With that volume of information, which is being called upon extensively, we all accept that errors will occasionally occur. The important point is that when problems arise suppliers should recognise the uncertainty that can be caused to consumers. Erroneous transfer can induce concerns, albeit unfounded, of energy supplies being lost. In such circumstances, companies are obliged to correct the problem quickly and efficiently.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/9">Last year, Ofgem, which regulates supplier performance in this and other areas, took the view that the speed and efficiency that companies were showing was insufficient. That prompted it and Energywatch, the statutory gas and electricity consumer body, to broker a new erroneous transfer customer charter. The charter is designed to enable customers transferred in error to return to their chosen supplier as quickly as possible, with the minimum of inconvenience, and without the companies concerned passing the problem between them. The process should be largely invisible to the consumer, who will be able to obtain, on request, details of the compensation available from those who have caused the inconvenience. I wholeheartedly endorse the charter's objective and content. Time will tell whether the industry will live up the aims of the charter, which came into effect in January. Ofgem will review performance under the charter in the coming months, with a full review taking place in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/10">If the industry's performance is unsatisfactory despite the erroneous transfer customer charter, Ofgem will have the option of moving beyond what is in effect a voluntary code and imposing standards of performance on suppliers. Among other things, those could carry requirements for automatic compensation payments to consumers in the event of supplier error. Ofgem could also modify supply licence conditions. The demands made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith will be very much in the frame if we find that the terms of the erroneous transfer customer charter&mdash;the voluntary code&mdash;are not being met.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/11">I understand that, from <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-31">31 December 2002</phrase>, in addition to the charter, the electricity distribution companies will be implementing a standard address format, which should reduce the incidence of erroneous transfers resulting from the use of inconsistent address formats. That should deal with some of the problems of erroneous transfers at source.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/12">I turn from erroneous transfers arising from reasons that we can all understand to sales malpractice and consumers who find themselves transferred against their wishes through the tactics of sales staff. I am not talking here about high-pressure selling in a more general sense, however distasteful some of us may find that. I am referring to the individuals who ask for information and find that they have agreed a contract, quite without their knowledge and understanding&mdash;whether on a form or via the telephone&mdash;to those who are, unfortunately, unable to understand what they are being sold, and, in the worst cases, to those whose signatures have been forged. The erroneous transfer charter may help in returning consumers who have been transferred as the result of sales malpractice to their chosen supplier. However, that is not and cannot be the main method of dealing with mis-selling, because it was not designed to address that core problem. It was designed to address the problem of inadvertent and genuinely erroneous transfer, not transfer that is, not to mince words, fraudulent.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/13">Understandably, erroneous transfers arising from mis-selling make individuals very angry. They also make those who represent them&mdash;including me&mdash;very angry. In such circumstances, there is a tendency to demand more and more legislation to deal with every potential problem that might arise. That is not necessarily the right way to address the problem, because legislation is in place. Sometimes we require emergency legislation, but the circumstances in which that is the case are somewhat removed from those involved in gas and electricity supply. I am not convinced that new legislation would be needed if the existing legislation were implemented, but, again, I leave the door open for that because the statistics that I quoted at the outset are, to me, totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/14">If what we have at present does not do the job, we must look for something else. The existing instruments are to be found in general consumer law and, I stress, in the specific powers available to Ofgem. They are complemented by the scope for Ofgem and Energywatch to broker arrangements with the industry and to spread best practice. Let us be in no doubt that there are a lot of measures at the disposal of Ofgem and in the wider existing law. If those measures do not do the job, however, and if in the future we still see 13,000-plus cases a month giving rise to complaint, I will not countenance that or be held responsible for it.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/15">I am often asked why salesmen cannot be prosecuted for fraud. As I have said, they can be. Under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, a person is guilty of forgery if&mdash;I make no apology for using legalese here&mdash;he makes a false instrument, intending it to be used to induce another to accept it as genuine and to do some act to another's prejudice.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/16">My understanding is that, for the police or a trading standards department to bring a successful prosecution, it must be shown that the agent has gained a financial advantage at the customer's expense. In the case of energy supply, that is often not the case, because a customer transferring, albeit involuntarily, from an incumbent supplier will ordinarily be better off. In some cases, he or she will not, and that appears to offer scope for prosecution. Similarly, if a supplier has been defrauded by a salesman, it may seek a prosecution; in other words, in cases where a particular provider is the loser when the supply is taken away.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/17">Again, I make the point that there is a range of general consumer law that can be brought to bear against rogue salesmen. In addition, there are further regulations specific to gas and electricity supply. Those take the form of conditions in supply licences and govern sales and marketing of gas and electricity on the doorstep, in the shopping centre and over the telephone. Among other things, they include rules on the selection, training and control of sales staff and the auditing of sales.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/18">We were instrumental in the introduction of protections, known as marketing licence conditions, into gas supply licences, following the problems that accompanied the introduction of domestic gas competition in 1996. They were duly incorporated into electricity supply licences when the domestic electricity market was opened to competition. In 2000, Ofgem extended the conditions for a further two years, and took the opportunity to enhance them during that period, extending them to cover high street and shopping centre sales. Last month, following consultation, it extended them for a further two years.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/19">In the light of responses to that consultation, Ofgem is currently considering how the conditions might be enhanced to make them operate more effectively for consumers. I understand that, for example, Ofgem is considering the practicality of developing a doorstep preference scheme along the lines of the telephone preference service overseen by Oftel. The conditions have two roles; the first is to allow Ofgem to undertake formal action against suppliers, and it has used them in this way. Last month, Ofgem acquired the right to levy financial penalties on companies breaching licence conditions. That will be another weapon in its armoury, and will give the marketing conditions added weight. Away from the glare of public, formal action, the conditions also provide an invaluable, informal method of improving the behaviour of suppliers. Once again, I emphasise the statistics that I quoted from the outset; that behaviour has not improved to a sufficient degree.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/20">In addition to our encouragement of Ofgem to develop the marketing conditions, we underlined our commitment to assisting energy consumers by using the Utilities Act 2000 to create Energywatch as a vigorous advocate for gas and electricity consumers, and to give Ofgem the new principal objective of protecting consumers.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/21">In tandem with this, we must remember what we as consumers can do to help ourselves. Of course, salesmen should not mislead, but we do not expect a tied salesman to do anything other than sell his product. People have to be on the look out for that. Let us not be surprised if he does not tell us about the range of offers in the market. If we were buying most goods or services, we would do a little research. We would not take the word of a salesman.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/22">One of our objectives in establishing Energywatch was to create an organisation that would not only protect consumers and fight their corner against the industry, but help consumers help themselves, by educating them about the market and making them more demanding of the suppliers. Energywatch can provide comparative data on prices. It can also provide links to websites that make calculations for the individual. We live in an active market. It is important to say that, although the problems are huge, cause a great deal of individual distress&mdash;I have no doubt about that&mdash;and discredit the workings of the market as a whole, it is important to give perspective to the benefits of the market that operates.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/23">In the period since 1996, that market has become extraordinarily active. About 6.7 million domestic gas consumers&mdash;34 per cent. of the total&mdash;are no longer with British Gas. About 7.5 million electricity consumers&mdash;31 per cent.&mdash;are no longer with their local supplier. In the last quarter of 2001, domestic gas and electricity transfers were running at 940,000 per month. That is an astonishing rate of activity, and it shows an astonishing recognition of the benefits that individuals can gain from competition. It puts in perspective, although in no way diminishes, the figure of 13,000-plus complaints that I cited at the outset.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/24">During 2001, Energywatch received 39,000 gas complaints. A total of 43 per cent.&mdash;17,000&mdash;related to transfers, but not necessarily erroneous transfers. Moreover, 7 per cent.&mdash;3,000&mdash;related to sales practices. In the case of electricity, there were 37,000 complaints, of which 38 per cent.&mdash;14,000&mdash;related to transfers and 12 per cent.&mdash;4,000&mdash;to sales practices. Again, I emphasise recognition of the numerical scale of the problem. To carry out a quick piece of arithmetic, the idea of 13,000 complaints in one month does not imply to me that the problem is diminishing. It is increasing, and I recognise that.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/25">Earlier this year, Energywatch launched its &quot;Stop Now!&quot; campaign, directed at mis-selling. One result of that will be that, next week, the suppliers will be coming together with Energywatch, Ofgem and the Department of Trade and Industry to discuss the problems of mis-selling and to identify solutions. The debate has been very helpful in focusing attention on the issues and statistics that underlie the discussions.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/26">I end as I began; I believe the figures quoted at the outset to be totally unacceptable. I believe that the individual distress underlying those activities is totally unacceptable. I call particularly on the companies that I mentioned earlier to clean up their act before they bring the whole industry into disrepute.</p>
	<p pid=".306.0/27" class="indent">It being Two o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the sitting lapsed, without Question put.</p>
