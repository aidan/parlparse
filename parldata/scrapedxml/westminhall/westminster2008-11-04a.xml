<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-04a.7.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" speakername="Andrew Pelling" colnum="7"  time="009:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081104/halltext/81104h0002.htm#08110450000506">
	<p pid="a.7.1/1">I have declared my interests in the register, but we all have additional personal interests. I currently enjoy the pleasure of a NatWest overdraft and mortgage, and I hope that the credit crunch will not immediately impact on those. I am also prospectively a Royal Bank of Scotland pensioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" name="James Plaskitt">the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt)</phrase> on securing the debate. His speech was an example of Parliament at its best&mdash;pre-scrutiny work on the challenges that the Government will face in upcoming meetings, during which how to deal with the medium-term implications of the current credit famine will be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/3">The hon. Gentleman emphasised particular issues that are worthy of consideration. He said that additional state support for the banking system might be necessary further down the line, and he rightly emphasised how we need to bear in mind that there are many national interests in the debate about the altered regulation that might be introduced. We must be aware of and cautious about the implications of change to regulation, because that will impact on our country's interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/4">I should declare an additional interest: the World Bank has been and is a client of mine, and I know people at that organisation. For those who have not been to Washington, it is notable that it is only a two-minute walk from the White House to the World Bank headquarters buildings on I street. The closeness of that institution to the Washington consensus is important. Crucially, the hon. Gentleman mentioned how there is a real debate about what the new regulatory regime will be like; will it be unipolar or will it be diverse? I wish to take this opportunity to caution strongly against the dangers of adopting one overall system of regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/5">Following the theme of globalisation in relation to regulation, we must recognise that one issue connected to the financial crisis is that of financial contagion. If one goes down the route of ensuring that there is similarity in terms of regulation across financial markets and the globe, that contagion is more likely to be enhanced in any future crisis. To some extent, the degree of semi-detachment of the Asian financial markets from the rest of the financial global system means that they benefit from having some protection from the current problems. I wish to press upon the Government that when they seek to protect our interests during international debates on regulation, they should be aware that there is an argument for what might be described as regionalised circuit breakers and that there is an advantage in having some difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/6">We must also bear in mind that if there is complete similarity in terms of regulation, it is possible that, geographically, businesses will find it easy to move from one place to another within the international financial system. Clearly, we have an interest in defending the concerns of the City of London. That is particularly important because, in terms of employment in Greater London as a whole, the financial industry has become dominant in our capital city&mdash;almost to the extent that it is the cuckoo in the nest.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/7">There is a danger in following one solution to rescue the international banking system. There is no doubt that the Government have shown real leadership&mdash;even just in terms of installing confidence in financial markets&mdash;by taking vigorous and rigorous action. They have created an economic value by ensuring that they are seen to take quick and speedy action. However, I have some doubts about the medium-term efficacy of the equity capitalisation that has taken place. Unfortunately, there is a great danger that such an approach is badly flawed. In my constituency, the south London economy is dominated by small businesses, which are being crushed by the credit famine. As Members of Parliament, we all complain and rail at Ministers from the Treasury and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform about why the banks cannot deliver on providing 2007 levels of credit. However, it is quite unreasonable of us to complain in that way to Ministers. We are saying, &quot;We own the banks; why can't they deliver?&quot; However, the reality is that the banks cannot do so because they are badly wounded institutions, as the hon. Gentleman has mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/8">Prospectively, up to &pound;1 trillion of additional damage and risk might have to be considered for coverage. I earnestly believe that in their desire to be seen to act as quickly and responsibly as possible, the Government have alighted on the wrong solution. We should have followed what happened in 1992 in Sweden in terms of trying to remove the bad debts that exist on bank balance sheets and transferring that into a bad bank. That is the same model recently employed by the Swiss National Bank regarding UBS. The crisis in Sweden in 1992 was especially severe. The overall private sector bank defaulted debts were the equivalent of 15 per cent. of gross domestic product. On the basis of the figures in the hon. Gentleman's speech, our crisis could prospectively be even more significant. I cannot speak with the same clarity as him, but I shall try to bring the matter down to a simple comparison: the Government's policy is like someone saying, &quot;I will buy your house because you're in trouble,&quot; when in reality the patient is bleeding to death and needs to go to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/9">In many ways, the current level of confidence in financial markets is dependent on the credibility of the Government's actions. I fear that if the Government are driven to make a second round of bail-outs, their credibility will be greatly damaged and we will all suffer as a result. The Government made a good announcement yesterday about the creation of the new UK Financial Investments Ltd. That institution will be well positioned to form the new bad bank structure that has operated so successfully elsewhere&mdash;it was greatly successful in Sweden and proved to be profitable for the Swedish taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/10">In terms of the proposals for a singular global regulation, I fear that we might unknowingly end up successfully proselytising the unfettered free market style of markets that has brought us into this mess. I know that I am well away from the political consensus when I say this, but there is always a danger that as politicians, we will try to cling on to one or two items of consensus in a storm. We have to recognise that the free market fashion of central bank independence has failed. Central banks have shown an incapacity to deal with the issues of asset price inflation, which the hon. Gentleman so rightly emphasised in his speech. The Bank of England's performance has not exactly been stellar, so it amazes me that in the process of blaming the Financial Services Authority, people suggest that we should transfer powers to the Bank of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/11">The hon. Gentleman rightly emphasised the issue of transparency. I am also worried about that to some extent.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.0/1">This debate is timely and important, as others have said. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" name="James Plaskitt">the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt)</phrase> on securing it and on his speech. He is undoubtedly right on the scale of the challenge and the urgent need for action. He set out with characteristic thoughtfulness and clarity the key issues and options.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/2">On the question of what went wrong, we have to ask, along with all the other questions, what executives, boards and auditors were doing signing off balance sheets loaded with financial instruments, many of which they evidently did not fully understand and whose value or lack thereof they clearly had not properly appraised. One issue that certainly has to be examined more closely is the penalties for those who fall short on that scrutiny, both internally and externally.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/3">In the spectrum of options that my hon. Friend set out, from light-touch regulation to micro-management, we need to establish clear rules. I take the interesting point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" name="Andrew Pelling">the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling)</phrase> made about regional circuit breakers. That is a valuable concept, but we need some clear, objective and enforceable rules on the issues that my hon. Friend went through, on capital thresholds, the integrity of balance sheets, exposure to risk and transparency, as well as the points about reform of the IMF that he mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/4">My hon. Friend invited us to add to his list of things that were wanted, and I propose to do just that because I want to focus my remarks on another aspect of international banking regulation, which has not received much mainstream attention but which is vital to many of the poorest people on our planet. My attention was drawn to it by an article in <i>The Guardian</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-07">7 October</phrase> written by Paul Collier, who is director of the centre for the study of African economies at Oxford university. In it, after an amusing but telling analysis&mdash;I will not repeat it now, but I recommend it to others&mdash;of why crooks can more or less safely be left in charge of fish and chip shops but not banks, he homes in on the crucial issue of how well banks have done out of banking secrecy and how that aids and abets the looting of enormous sums of money from Africa and other poor areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/5">The article states:</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The loot-seeking elites that control parts of Africa illicitly send capital out of the region to the tune of $20 to &pound;28bn per year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/7">Paul Collier bases that on a new study undertaken by Raymond Baker of the non-governmental organisation Global Financial Integrity. He then points out that a capital flow of that size is more or less equivalent to the total overseas aid to the region, so if it could be closed off, that would give rise to a similar amount of money as the doubling of overseas aid. Obviously, one would have to get the money out of the hands of the corrupt elites and used for the benefit of the people, but it is an essential step in getting that enormous resource back where it belongs.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/8">It is clear that current rules on banking transparency and supervision are unequal to the task of keeping track of, exposing and returning money taken from Africa and shifted around the global banking system and in and out of offshore accounts. The world has started to address the need for better scrutiny and accountability in the wake of 9/11, when the need to combat the financing of international terrorism became evident. However, as the article points out, some banks resisted even that. It is right to ask whether the same scrutiny should not now be extended to the salting away of the products of corruption, bribery and extortion from poor countries&mdash;and those countries that ought not to be so poor&mdash;that are governed by corrupt political and business elites.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/9">The banks, not only here but around the world, now need Governments to use their citizens' money effectively to give retrospective guarantees, bailing them out in respect of practices that, as we have heard, should never have been allowed to grow in the first place. In return, should we not insist that the global financial system stops facilitating the exploitation of poor people in Africa and elsewhere? Now that the banks are over a barrel, is it not time to force greater transparency upon them?</p>
	<p pid="a.11.0/10">I therefore ask my hon. Friend the Minister to say first whether she agrees that that is a serious and pressing issue. Secondly, will she undertake to look further into that aspect of international financial regulation? Thirdly, will she let me know what the Government are doing to put it on the international agenda, at the forthcoming G20 meeting and more generally? We cannot allow banking secrecy to collude in the looting of wealth from the world's poorest, and I very much hope that the Government will do something about it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-04a.12.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1514" speakername="Colin Breed" colnum="12"  time="010:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081104/halltext/81104h0002.htm#08110450000510">
	<p pid="a.12.0/1">I add my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" name="James Plaskitt">the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt)</phrase>, not only on securing the debate but on giving us such an excellent r&eacute;sum&eacute; on its context. I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" name="Andrew Pelling">the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling)</phrase> on his interesting comments. I entirely agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> that it is timely to consider the fact that banks have clearly facilitated corrupt Governments and businesses putting money beyond the people that they should serve. That aspect is just as urgent as the others, and it should not be lost in the mix.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/2">We all agree that urgent regulatory reform is necessary. It is salutary to realise that the tightening of rules usually follows a failure. I remember all too well the BCCI scandal. The question is why we do not seem to be able to get ahead of the curve. Why do we have to go through failures, large and small, before getting a grip on what needs to happen? Then, of course, circumstances change, the whole situation goes full circle&mdash;and again we find ourselves seeking to regulate something that has already happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/3">There is a lively debate between Europe and America over rules-based and principles-based regulation. I doubt whether there will be much meeting of minds. We believe that principles-based regulation seems to be the way forward, although it may have contributed somewhat to the problems. However, the Americans clearly want to insist on a rules-based system, although in many respects that does not seem to have worked well either.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/4">Everybody is blaming everyone else, but it seems that there has been a collective group think between regulators, banks and auditors and that they are standing behind each, or beside each other, supporting each other in saying that everything is okay and that no one has been shouting out that the emperor has no clothes. It seems that no one has been waving a flag, saying that something is wrong that needs to be dealt with quickly. A combination of complex instruments, probably faulty accounting standards, a reliance on credit ratings agencies, substantial leveraging, off-balance-sheet items and internationalisation&mdash;the way in which banks now straddle the globe and therefore straddle individual regulatory authorities&mdash;has given rise to the problems that we are seeing today.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/5">However, even after yesterday's Treasury Select Committee, with the Chancellor, the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chairman of the Financial Services Authority giving evidence, we cannot say that there were no warning signals. Although everyone could see them in hindsight&mdash;that is easy&mdash;I believe that the signals were clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/6">Those signals should have been picked up by those charged with the responsibility. Initially, that was the banks themselves&mdash;and not only the boards of the banks but the risk committees. Then there are the internal auditors. The external auditors rely significantly on internal auditing. I suspect that some internal auditors had been waving the flag, but they were drowned out by the need to push on&mdash;partly because of the structures that rewarded people and partly because of the share prices and the fact that everything was looking well. None the less, I suspect that there were some who should have been listened to. I do not believe no one was flagging up the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/7">The current situation is indeed dire. Getting back to prudent levels of capital ratios will be extremely painful. If we are not careful, the so-called nice decade will be followed by a very nasty decade, and heading it off will be difficult. Although international regulation is clearly important, domestic regulation is vital. I suspect that it may be much more difficult to get international agreement, but each country ought to be clear that it is important to get its own regulations in place. The Banking Bill now being debated in Committee is a good attempt to get some of these changes on board, but I do not believe that it is necessarily be the final solution. As I said, the warning signals were there in Northern Rock, Bradford and Bingley, Lloyds TSB, and HBOS and RBS. However, they were not heeded, not picked up, not acted upon.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/8">There seems to be a sort of paralysis, with each country doing its own thing domestically unless it fits in with some international regulation. I fear that if we wait for some sort of international consensus we will not be able to put our as much of own house in order as we should. Delay is dangerous. Although international co-operation and regulation are important in harmonising our efforts, we should not divert our attention from putting our own regulatory structures in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/9">Urgency is the key, and the forthcoming meeting in Washington will be extremely important. Examination of the roles of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will put the system under pressure. There appears to be a need for fundamental change. I will be interested to discover what approach the Government are taking and what their solutions may be, as they join those discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/10">I believe that two major issues must be tackled&mdash;those things that have changed so significantly in recent years. The first is the international operation of banks generally; their enormous size enables them to straddle all sorts of markets, and we need to regulate them effectively across the globe. The second is the variety of activities that those global institutions now undertake, of which banking is only a part. For instance, they deal in insurance and have all sorts of financial departments and sections. In a way, it is that combination of relatively recent factors that have exposed the current regulatory system to failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/11">We have not grasped the significance of the increased internationalisation of banks, and we have not grasped the importance of their expansion into all sorts of new areas and the creation of all sorts of instruments. Things have reached the point where we are floundering around trying to find a way to regulate and supervise the system. That prompts the question&mdash;and this is the other side of the coin&mdash;about whether the regulators should try to grab hold of the banks' coat tails as they move out into new areas of financial instruments and global operations, or whether we require the banks to reorganise themselves so that they can be more effectively regulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/12">We recognise that banks are not the same as any other sort of commercial operation; they are clearly important for the world economy and we require them to act in a certain way. However, if they have constructed themselves into entities that are almost impossible to regulate and supervise, should we not seek ways in which they can be de-aggregated or split apart rather than centralised, so that we can look more clearly at the differing requirements of their individual activities?</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/13">Basic banking on the high street is significantly different to the derivatives market in capital terms. However, 99 per cent. of people in this country who require an ordinary, basic banking service from their high street bank, perhaps with a mortgage attached, have great difficulty in securing a new mortgage or obtaining loans for a small business. That is purely because of the activities in another part of that large bank, which have caused these failures. Is it time to look at such mega-institutions and realise that effective supervision, control and regulation is simply not possible under their current construction?</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/14">If the international community is going to be the lender of last resort and the bail-out of the taxpayer, it should require banks to change the way that they operate and de-aggregate some of their activities. We need a fundamental reassessment of the way that current banking operations work internationally. If we look at the current size of enormous banks and their range of activities across many different countries and regulatory systems, I severely doubt that we can be sure that we will not encounter a similar situation in around a decade's time. It is time for a new approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. That is exactly what I was suggesting. What we have allowed to happen so quickly and over such a range of different issues means that our somewhat shaky regulation is now totally out of place. I wonder whether we should be looking at some of the older models.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/2">The Financial Services Compensation Scheme was never designed to bail out a huge high street bank. It was intended for smaller operations that might fail due to poor lending decisions or a structural problem&mdash;the big banks would put their hands in their collective pocket and bail such operations out, as they did not want a systemic failure. Can we consider a financial compensation scheme that will require pre-funding for the sort of potential problems that might occur with another RBS? It is almost unthinkable. Investment banks have been allowed to leverage up to such an enormous extent that it has put under pressure their normal banking business, which affects so many of us. The irony is that those who have supported their local bank with their business are the very people who have to put their hands in their pockets through their taxes and bail out the other part of the bank. It is untenable, and we must revisit the idea of separation rather than continuing with the current aggregation.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.0/1">I should like first of all to congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1909" name="James Plaskitt">the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt)</phrase> on his great foresight and timing in managing to get a debate on this crucially important topic. We have had a fascinating glimpse in the debate of the complexities of the issues with which we are dealing. That gives a great deal of credit to my hon. Friend and to everyone who has contributed.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/2">Current international financial conditions are unprecedented. In addition to the work that the Government are doing domestically to restore faith in the banking system, there must be a global response to what is a global economic crisis. My hon. Friend mentioned Bretton Woods and Basel, and I will deal with both, but he was right to bring them to the attention of the Chamber. The Bretton Woods framework of 1944 reflected the determination of leaders and economists such as J. M. Keynes to avoid the disastrous economic nationalism that led to the great depression and which helped lay the groundwork for the rise of fascism and ultimately the calamity of the second world war. In the decades since, the Bretton Woods institutions have been a key element both in supporting international co-operation and countries that have been hit by negative shocks, and in providing the long-term financing and assistance necessary for sustainable growth. At the same time, the way in which the institutions work has certain drawbacks. As my hon. Friend pointed out, they are anachronistic in many ways and reflect a different world. If I have time, I will outline how the Government intend to approach the reform of such institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/3">Over the years, we have added to the Bretton Woods framework. In the mid-1970s, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was created to set common standards for financial regulation around the world. Following the Asian financial crisis, we created what is now known as the G20 to bring together emerging markets and developed countries to address the serious economic problems of the time. In the late 1990s, we created the Financial Stability Forum, which has improved the quality of banking regulation and promoted a more international approach to financial market developments. Nevertheless, recent events have confirmed that the world economy has changed irrevocably. The Bretton Woods framework was created for a world of 50 relatively sheltered states. We must now consider whether it is time for another wave of reform&mdash;I think that the case for that is overwhelming&mdash;to create a global financial system that is fit for a modern and more interconnected, globalised, IT-driven world. We must do so while we continue to address the immediate effects of the ongoing financial crisis at home and abroad. Effectively need to do both things in parallel, and that approach has been reflected in all of the comments in our debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/4">The turbulence in international financial markets has the potential to affect every country around the world, so a co-ordinated international response is required. We need national action, but that will not solve the problem on its own. National systems of supervision are simply not in an adequate position to respond to the huge cross-continental flows of capital in this different, more open, more globally interdependent world. The first step has been taken to stabilise market conditions. The British Government, as part of a co-ordinated international effort, have taken rapid and well-targeted action to recapitalise the banking system. The Bank of England has doubled the amount of liquidity that it provides to banks, and we have guaranteed new lending between the banks so that we can get lending working again. That action has strengthened confidence in the banking system, put financial institutions on a firmer footing and provided support for the real economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/5">Britain's fast action has been widely applauded, and many other countries have followed our lead and taken similar action. The G7 action plan, which took a lead from the UK plan, has provided a framework for effective co-ordinated international action, which has resulted in more than &pound;300 billion being approved from public funds to recapitalise banks worldwide. We remain committed to taking all action necessary to restore confidence and stability in the financial system. International co-ordination is a central part of the Government's response and we will continue to work with international partners going forward. My hon. Friend is right to say that international financial institutions, too, have a role to play&mdash;I am not just referring to stabilisation, but I do not wish to talk too much about that in the time that I have left.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/6">I want to move on to the points that my hon. Friend made about how we can reform the system so that it is more fit for purpose. After initial stabilisation, the next step is to achieve a global financial system that is fit to meet the challenges of the future. As many hon. Members have said, the financial crisis has revealed problems at the heart of the international financial and regulatory system that we must rectify. That means addressing not only reforms to the supervision and regulation of financial markets but global governance arrangements. The Prime Minister has stated that the reforms must be guided by five principles: transparency, integrity, responsibility, sound banking practice and global governance with co-ordination across borders.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/7">Strengthening of the supervision and regulation of the banking sector is essential. Significant steps have been taken that build on the recommendations of the FSF and that are in line with the road map agreed with European Union partners. For example, the FSF recommended strengthening Basel II capital requirements for banks using off-balance sheet vehicles. We should move forward with that proposal as it represents an important step towards restoring faith in the banking system. Beyond those immediate challenges, more progress is needed to establish globally applied standards of financial regulation and supervision for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/8">We have made a number of proposals to international partners, including improving incentives in financial institutions to manage risk; improving transparency in financial markets; ensuring appropriate regulation of all financial institutions and markets; and ensuring that the financial system supports economic stability. Better supervision and regulation need to be coupled with better global governance. Events have shown that global financial markets present challenges that no one nation can solve in isolation. We have to strengthen global co-operation and build a new global financial architecture for the years ahead. The new global governance should deliver a global early warning system so that future risk to global economic and financial stability is identified and mitigating action is taken early. There should be effective cross-border supervision of global firms, including through international colleges of supervisors, globally accepted standards of supervision and regulation applied consistently across countries, and mechanisms for co-operation and concerted action in a crisis through international cross-border stability.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.3/1">I did, as well as quoting Sir Ken's positive remarks, say that he acknowledged that there had been problems. My contention is that the way to deal with those is not to remove the very good locally-based systems, throw them away and set up something new and untested, but to build on what we have. In Gloucestershire, for example, we benefit from a tri-service centre at Quedgeley, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Gloucester, with the police, fire and ambulance services co-located next door to the police headquarters, which, together, operated as Gold Command during the emergency last year. The tri-service centre was set up in 2003 at a cost of &pound;3 million and it enabled the emergency services and county council, and other bodies, to provide a co-ordinated response. Following last year's events, Gloucestershire's deputy chief fire officer Chris Griffin said in response to Sir Ken Knight's comments:</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/2" class="indent">&quot;The arrangements between the three emergency services worked well during the summer's flooding crisis and the working relationship was strengthened and enhanced by their close proximity.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/3" class="indent">It's always been my view that emergency services work better when they train together and are co-located together.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/4">The chief constable of Gloucestershire, Dr. Tim Brain, who was the Gold Commander last year, defended the service and the tri-service control centre by saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/5" class="indent">&quot;To lose the close inter-agency working which the centre affords the county can only have a detrimental impact upon our collective ability to effectively deal with crises affecting residents and visitors to the county.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/6">That does not, of course, mean that there are no improvements that can be made. However, it would be more sensible to build on what works well in what we have. I shall come back to that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/7">It could only be the present Government who would choose to put the south-west fire control centre&mdash;something that is supposed to improve resilience&mdash;on a site on a flood plain that is at high risk of flooding. That was pointed out and there has been a bit of jerry-rigging on the site, putting defences around the fire control centre to protect it from flooding; but it is only the present Government who would put such a fire control centre on a flood plain when only last year we had to protect ourselves from a major flood. If we had another major flood the new fire control centre would be one of the first places to flood, and even if protections were built around it, instead of pictures of Tewkesbury abbey as an island in the middle of a flood, we would have pictures of the south-west fire control centre in exactly the same position.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.0/1">I do not want to turn the debate into a dialogue, and I shall try not to intervene on the hon. Gentleman again&mdash;I shall make my own points later; but that myth has been kicking about for more than a year. The site is not in an area of flood risk. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the word &quot;jerry&quot;; well, there is a Jerry who is a key figure in the debate&mdash;a Conservative councillor called Jerry Willmott, in Wiltshire where there is also a tri-service centre. He made it clear that we need FiRe Control to save people's lives. It is all very well co-locating a command centre, which is something that can continue to happen&mdash;it would happen again in the city of Gloucester if a major event were to occur&mdash;but at the same time Jerry Willmott makes it clear that we must put other measures in place to save lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for intervening to put the record straight on behalf of Councillor Willmott.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/2">There is also discontent within the fire service itself about the Government's plans. A leaked letter from the head of the new south-west regional fire control to the former Minister, the hon. Member for Gloucester, revealed widespread discontent about the Government's plans. The head of the fire control warned that local fire and rescue services would not voluntarily submit to the Government's regionalisation and criticised delays in the project that led to &quot;immense frustration&quot; and &quot;profound disappointment&quot;. Ministers were told that</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/3" class="indent">&quot;confidence amongst the company directors, our hard working officers and, we suspect, fire authorities is now rock bottom.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/4">The cross-party Select Committee on Communities and Local Government has already sounded the alarm, saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/5" class="indent">&quot;there is no evidence to suggest any overall saving...we are unconvinced that the Government can offer the assurance of maintained or improved service quality resulting from the FiReControl project&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/6">Another worrying sign, apart from the lack of evidence that service to the public will improve, is the escalating cost of the project. The Government belatedly published a new regional business case in July, and an updated national business case has yet to be published. Last year's business case admitted that the costs of the project were &pound;400 million over its original &pound;1 billion budget. By any measure, such an escalation in cost is significant, and it indicates that the project has been poorly managed, at least financially.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/7">The Fire Brigades Union commissioned an independent report from the Institute of Public Finance on the business case for the FiReControl project. The report forecast that between October 2006 and June 2007, the total invested in the project by the Department for Communities and Local Government would have risen &pound;180 million from &pound;160 million to &pound;340 million, a rise of 112 per cent. Annual efficiency savings were forecast to fall 80 per cent., from &pound;115 million to &pound;23 million. The costs are rising considerably, and the forecast financial savings are falling at almost the same rate. That is incredibly worrying for taxpayers in general and for local taxpayers in Gloucestershire and the south-west specifically.</p>

	<p pid="a.26.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is welcome to look at the record of Gloucestershire's fire and rescue services, which is very good and has continued to improve. They have worked incredibly closely as part of the county council to deliver excellent services. He posits a false choice. The SNP Government in Scotland, in a move largely unnoticed south of the border, has cancelled the regionalisation of Scottish fire control centres, but Scotland is still going ahead with improvements to IT, infrastructure improvements such as digital radios and GPS and interoperability with other emergency services, demonstrating that improvements in technology for resilience can still be achieved without flawed regionalisation plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.3/2">Perhaps the UK Government might take a lesson from the SNP Government. I know that they find that painful, and sometimes the arguments in Scotland between the two parties are painful to watch, but perhaps they could accept that the SNP Government have made a sensible decision in that particular case.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-04a.26.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="26"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081104/halltext/81104h0005.htm#08110450000542">
	<p pid="a.26.5/1">Indeed. My hon. Friend is absolutely right for two reasons. First, a parliamentary answer given to Lord Hanningfield in the other place about why the costs of the FiReControl project had escalated stated that a significant amount of the extra cost was due to certainty on costs arriving once the Government had awarded the IT contract. Clearly, IT and the failure to manage it properly is one of the key drivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/2">The other significant reason, given the Prime Minister's admission yesterday that the Government simply cannot be trusted not to lose personal data and information, is that we cannot trust the Government to manage large-scale IT projects or have confidence that they will be under budget and well managed. That confidence is deservedly low, and my hon. Friend is right to be sceptical about huge projects. More sensibly scaled projects are much more likely to be successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/3">To return to the costs, as I said in answering the intervention by the hon. Member for Gloucester, although the Government have pledged to fund centrally the increased running costs of the regional control centres, they have pledged to do so for only three years. After that, local fire authorities are likely to have to pick up the bill. In the case of Gloucestershire, where fire services are part of the county council, other services will have to be cut to fund them or the precept on the council tax payer will have to rise. Neither of those choices will be welcome to council tax payers in Gloucestershire or elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/4">July's regional business case admits that</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/5" class="indent">&quot;additional efficiencies and/or revenue generating&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/6">will be needed. One need not look very hard to notice extra taxes in there, which are not welcome at any time, particularly in the straitened financial circumstances that we face.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/7">Indeed, in May the Government instructed the new regional management board to deliver more sharing of functions at a regional or sub-regional level, in order to deliver efficiencies. That raises the prospect that local fire stations will face cuts that are imposed at a regional level and outside the democratic accountability of our local councillors, to pay for this flawed process.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/8">It is not just myself and other colleagues here today that have concerns about this process. The Communities and Local Government Committee said in its 2006 report, <i>The </i><i>Fire and Rescue Service</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/9" class="indent">&quot;We are unconvinced that the Government can offer the assurance of maintained or improved service quality resulting from the Fire Control project...and there is clearly widespread doubt across the FRS&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/10">that is, across the fire and rescue services. That is very worrying. The hon. Member for Gloucester drew attention to the importance of saving lives. However, if there is no benefit of improved service quality from these changes, it is even worse if the Government cannot offer the assurance of maintained service quality. If current service quality deteriorates, that would put lives at risk. The Communities and Local Government Committee also said in the same report:</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/11" class="indent">&quot;There is no evidence to suggest any overall saving. As a result we, like many within the FRS, do have not full confidence in the Government's claim that Fire Control will achieve enhanced efficiency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/12">As I say, that report is very worrying. The Communities and Local Government Committee obviously undertook a thorough investigation into this process and its report should cause us to pause and think again.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/13">My final point is to examine what an alternative system might look like. Coming from Gloucestershire myself, I think that we should look at the option of having more tri-service centres to improve resilience; I am surprised that the hon. Member for Gloucester, who is a former Minister in the Department for Communities and Local Government, did not pay more attention to this option. As I have already mentioned, in Gloucestershire we have a tri-service centre that links all the emergency services and it played a crucial role in co-ordinating the response to last year's floods. Such service centres could do a lot more to enhance local resilience than distant regional fire control centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/14">The Government's business case has never properly examined the merits of such joint working between emergency services. Indeed, the Government's full business case simply says that</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/15" class="indent">&quot;tri-service controls may remain an option for the long term&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.26.5/16">However it seems to me that in those parts of the country that already have a tri-service centre, such as Gloucestershire&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.29.0/1">Order. Before I call the next speaker, I would like to point out to hon. Members that this debate only lasts for an hour and a half. A lot of hon. Members have indicated that they wish to speak. Obviously, I will do my best to get everybody in and to let them speak. However, as I have said, the debate is only one and a half hours' long, so I appeal to hon. Members to try to keep their remarks as brief as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> on securing this important and timely debate. The Minister recently visited the new fire station at Marshes End in my constituency, and I suspect that he might already have heard some of the points that I shall make today, but they are so important that they are worth reiterating.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/2">First, I have a few comments to make on the fire control project, which is expected to offer enhanced physical and operational resilience, but the costs and savings are highly questionable, as we have heard. We have also heard that the timing of delivery is problematic. Dorset disputes several of the current assumptions, and predicts that there will be a net cost to the authority from moving to the regional control centre. Even if the Department for Communities and Local Government could meet in full the deficit between steady-state RCC costs and current costs on a regional basis, the vagaries of the regional cost apportionment model, based on council tax base, have led Dorset to believe that it would still face additional costs of &pound;125,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.0/3">The Dorset authority is concerned about cost apportionment across the south-west, and does not see how it can possibly end up not being a net loser unless protection is built in, or unless more attention is paid to each authority. Its members are concerned that the costs for out-of-scope activities and data management have been underestimated. The capping of regional resilience payments to three years is absolutely unacceptable.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.1/1">I am aware of that, which is one reason why the FBU has serious misgivings about the move. However, I shall not pursue that because of the shortage of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/2">As someone who has been a consistent critic of regionalisation, I think that I can speak with some authority on the issue. I do not know whether any Opposition Member would like to confirm this, but I was concerned that in the last meeting the cabinet member for Gloucestershire either signed off the agreement on the regional centre or was about to sign it off. I gather that the Liberal Democrats also are protesting but still signing it off. I would like to think that that is not happening, but perhaps it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/3">I am a critic not only of regionalisation but of the fire control project. It has merits, and I have always argued that we need regional back-up. Anyone who was around during the floods will know that what happened was of such a scale that no control centre would have been able to cope, and we have a very good tri-service centre. One of the things that the Minister might like to dwell on is why Mott MacDonald, the wonderful consultants who have underlined all the things that have happened, has never published its investigation into the tri-service arrangements. It has published many other reports, which have cost millions of pounds. I do not know whether those reports have saved any lives, but they have certainly cost millions. I would like to know what Mott MacDonald says about the tri-service arrangements in Gloucestershire.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/4">I hope that the Government will have another look at their proposals. I do not have any problem with regional back-up&mdash;we need it. The scale of possible disasters&mdash;whether floods or, dare I say it, a big security issue&mdash;means that we need the best available provision for our fire and rescue service. I still believe that that should be provided locally, and that we should listen to the people who work in the service and, indeed, the chief fire officer in Gloucestershire, who has been put in a difficult position.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/5">However, we have to go from where we are, and that is the regional centre in Taunton. It is not working yet, but it has cost rather a lot of money. I worry about who, if anyone, will relocate, but, more than anything, I think that that centre should be the back-up to front-line local services, which have worked very well. I hope that that the Government will consider that, despite the money that has been spent and, obviously, despite some loss of face. We can always learn from our experiences.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.1/6">It is not helpful if people say one thing in public and do other things in private. The person who has been most trenchant, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" name="Roger Berry">the Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry)</phrase> knows, is Terry Walker, one of his predecessors on Avon county council, who spent his life&mdash;and I mean his life&mdash;as the chairman of the Avon fire authority. He still has strong opinions not only on whether the centre is the right thing but on whether it will work. I hope that the Minister will listen to such comments. Other people will have views that are slightly different from mine, but it is important that we hear from those who work in the service as well as those who represent or manage it.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.5/1">Similarly, our settlement, which is exactly the same as that described by the hon. Member for Kingswood, is 1 per cent. for next year, 0.5 per cent. after that and then 1 per cent. after that. It is extremely low, and I sympathise with his council having to manage with it, because Dorset has to do the same. Without the floor, our grant would have been cut by 1.8 per cent.&mdash;nearly 2 per cent. Again, that is rather difficult to justify.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.5/2">The consequences for Dorset are dire indeed. I have been told by Darren Gunter that it is necessary to abolish whole-time crewing and go back to day-time crewing only. Since many fires occur at night, particularly those involving the elderly, that is a worrying situation. The service has to combine whole-time stations, so the time that it will take to get to fire incidents will be longer, and it has to close retained stations. Again, cover is being reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.5/3">There are also impacts on community safety activity. I have been told by our chief fire officer that the service will have to reduce safety events in schools, and funding for Streetwise, which is dear to my heart. I am a trustee of Streetwise. It is a safety centre that has been built and financed by Dorset county council, Bournemouth borough council and Poole borough council. It provides training for schoolchildren who come at two stages during their school career to see where the dangers lie in an urban situation. It has been extremely effective and is now being rolled out around the country. It is supported by the Government, thankfully, but not through this funding. If funding disappears from the fire and rescue service, there will be severe complications for Streetwise. Streetwise also has groups of elderly people come around the centre to learn about risks in the home in an effort to prevent terrible fires.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.5/4">Frankly all of this is inexplicable. Other support services that will be affected are training and development, including fire safety courses, welfare provision, recruitment, fleet and equipment maintenance&mdash;we will not have such well-maintained equipment&mdash;and property maintenance. Dorset is now being cut to the bone, and there will be a real impact on the ability to save lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.0/1">I warmly welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase>, to his place as the fire Minister. Whatever else he does in government, being the Minister with responsibility for the fire and rescue service is a true honour and something that he will enjoy, regardless of the fact that it can sometimes feel like a bed of nails. He will find that firefighters are unique people of whom we should all be proud, wherever we live in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/2">The number of fire deaths is actually down to its lowest level since 1958, and the recent advances are the result of some of the investment in the past 11 years. We have seen a complete restructuring of the way in which the fire service does its work. The advent of the regulatory reform order and the local risk management plans has made a real difference and has allowed the fire service to look outward to local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/3">We see far more of the kind of important work done by Streetwise, for example, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1438" name="John Butterfill">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill)</phrase> has mentioned. I join the hon. Gentleman in saying that people such as Darren Gunter do a terrific job. When I tried to intervene on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase>, I was going to make that point and mention something that has not been mentioned by Dorset colleagues. Although I appreciate that the settlement was tight this year, when Dorset Members came to see me, I mentioned that the extra money&mdash;the &pound;250,000 for the Olympics&mdash;would make a real difference. Darren has made that point clearly as well. I understand that that money has arrived, which is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/4">We have never seen the like of the investment over the past decade. We live in a new world now. The &pound;200 million of &quot;New Dimension&quot; investment&mdash;the high volume pumps, the urban search and rescue equipment and the decontamination units&mdash;are there to cope with the new threats, whether in the south-west of England or anywhere else. Yes, we are having an in-depth debate about fire control, but that is part of the new and emerging&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.39.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right, and I am glad that he has made that point. Jerry Willmott supports fire control, not because he is chair of the company, but because he is a man of real integrity who understands the fire service and the risks better than most people in this Chamber, including, I am afraid to say, the hon. Members for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) and for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper). It is interesting to note that when the Front-Bench spokesmen had the opportunity to debate this matter in July in Committee&mdash;we did so in some depth&mdash;neither the Tories nor the Liberals voted against this measure. At that point, we had the opportunity to flesh out the arguments.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/2">Before speaking about fire control, I wish to add to a point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" name="Roger Berry">the Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry)</phrase> about the importance of having a diverse fire and rescue service. I went out of my way in my time as fire Minister to congratulate Avon on the work that it has done in this regard. I am sure that, because this subject is a passion of my hon. Friend the Minister, he will continue this work on diversity in the fire and rescue service.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/3">We are working with the unions and other stakeholders to push the barriers and to call for representation to increase from 2 per cent. to 5 per cent. of the local minority population to be recruited into the fire service with an incentive grant, and we are also calling for women to be brought into the fire service at operational levels so that they comprise 18 per cent. at that level. That can only be good for the fire service and, ultimately, good for our local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/4">There are hon. Members in this Chamber who will never agree with me about fire control. Some will not agree for the right reasons and some, I fear, will disagree for the wrong reasons, knowing that this is an easy cheap shot in terms of frightening the electorate and winning good headlines with newspaper editors. It is not the newspaper editors' job to understand the detail; it is their job to make good headlines. I accept that this makes good copy, but there are far more important issues here.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/5">I went to Sweden to see the changes made there, which involved reducing the number of control rooms from 120 to around 20. That rationalisation was introduced not only to make savings but because a single network to improve resilience was wanted. We have 46 control rooms, many on different networks. That is why, when the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East talks about resilience and the tri-service centre, he needs to understand that the tri-service provision is incredibly good and would remain as our gold command. However, resilience is about networks and systems. That is why we had more than 1,000 calls when the flooding was serious. I know about that. I did not just pop into gold command and say hello; I was there. I had a seat at the table, and I was in there every day. I know that people's lives can be put at risk if they cannot get through and speak to an operator when they dial 999. Having a single resilient system where all parts back each other up will make a huge difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/6">I ask hon. Members to put politics aside for a moment and think about themselves and their families. If their child or partner were caught in a burning wreck on the M5, what would be the key thing? They would want a fire service that mobilises the engine nearest the scene. When that engine arrived on the scene, they would want systems in the cab&mdash;the technology&mdash;to say where to cut into a particular type of vehicle to avoid air bags, rescue a person and get them out in one piece.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.1/7">I urge hon. Members&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.42.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson. In the few minutes available to me, I shall try to develop some of the points that have been made, and which I was hoping to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/2">First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> on securing this debate. It is evident from the number of hon. Members from the south-west, including Labour Members, that there are strong feelings on many of the issues, including regional control centres, which is the topic of most discussion, and, crucially, funding. He was absolutely right to raise inconsistencies between what was promised for regionalisation and what will be delivered in savings and improvements to service. If neither of those boxes are ticked, we must call the policy into question, as my party and his have done ever since it was first posited.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" name="Roger Berry">The hon. Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry)</phrase> rightly referred to diversity and important work on that issue, as well as to the funding problems that affect his authority, as did my hon. Friends the Members for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams) and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke). My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole also raised some important demographic issues, which are particularly acute in her constituency and throughout the whole south-west, where there is a huge amount of inward migration . Demographic changes in the age spectrum will present challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/4">I want to focus on the fantastic job that the fire service does. Information from people on the ground, whether through the Fire Brigades Union or people in fire authorities who are concerned about the programmes towards which the Government are pushing them, suggests that they are achieving fantastic results with the available resources and focusing very much on preventive work. At a recent open day at the fire station in Bodmin, I heard more about the fire service's work with young people to encourage them to play a more active role in ensuring that communities are safe, as well as their work with smoke detectors, local businesses and the Flashpoint Lifeskills Centre, which is similar to the street light facility in the constituency of the hon. Member for Bristol, West&mdash;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1438" name="John Butterfill">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill)</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.1/1">Absolutely. I have in fact referred to my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West, and I am sure that he will continue to be the MP there.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/2">Full-time and retained fire services offer a valuable whole service in many of the rural communities that we serve, and it is important to recognise the challenges facing the retained service. Local authorities that have retained services are considering ways of improving their responsiveness and ensuring that they are efficient, as well as providing the technology to people who do a wonderful job in addition to what they do in their ordinary lives to ensure that their communities are safe. There are sometimes challenges in recruitment and affordability in rural communities, and we need a bigger steer from the Government on how areas such as the south-west, which have many rural communities, can be supported.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.1/3">My party is not convinced, and never has been, that regionalisation will be effective or deliver the savings that have been promised. The former Minister, the hon. Member for Gloucester, both in robust interventions and his own contribution, was keen to point out his belief that that is the only way of delivering new technology. However, if it is clear that regionalisation will not deliver savings, that calls into question the whole premise of delivering the new technologies. In fact, the Government should consider other ways of delivering improvements without going down the regionalisation route. I want to put on the record the fact that during a Standing Committee debate on fire and rescue services in which I participated, my party did not call for a vote on the national framework&mdash;we were debating many other issues and not just regionalisation&mdash;but I made it clear that my party remains opposed to it. I thank you, Mrs. Anderson for the opportunity to speak, and I am sure that those who are listening outside the Chamber will focus on the fact that the former Minister's position does not seem to have moved in line with business models and the evidence from people on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson. I warmly congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> on securing this vital and timely debate. I pay tribute to him and to my hon. Friends in the south-west for their campaigns over past months and years against fire control centres and the underfunding of local fire and rescue services, which will have such a big impact on their constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/2">I also welcome the new Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase>, to his post, which is something of a hospital pass, as the former Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1595" name="Parmjit Dhanda">the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda)</phrase>, had intended to discuss the wider issue of funding as well as the fire control project. I must be circumspect in my comments. My colleagues are concerned about the discrepancies and massive disparities in funding in the comprehensive spending review period, such as those between Avon and Dorset, which received 2 per cent. in revenue support grant in this CSR period, and Humberside, which received 12 per cent., Derbyshire, which received 15 per cent., or Nottinghamshire, which received almost 18 per cent. Additionally, there are big variations in grant per head of population during that period. Devon, Somerset, Wiltshire and Dorset will receive less than &pound;20 per capita compared with other local authorities, while the average is &pound;19.64. The Government should consider factors affecting grant allocation, such as relative resources based on the tax base of population and tax base per head, which militate against authorities in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.2/3">It is as well to step back a little and consider the issues raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" name="Roger Berry">the hon. Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry)</phrase>. It is all very well for him to say in his little homily how much was spent<i>&mdash;[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i><i>&mdash;</i>or not under a Conservative Government, but his Government have been in office for 11 years. Terry Walker and the Avon fire authority feel that they have been unfairly treated by his Government as a result of the floors and ceilings mechanism and the transitional grant repayment in Avon.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.1/1">I am happy that the hon. Gentleman confirms that that is the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/2">I do not have time to discuss the review that the Department will undertake on the formula spending share by 2010, but many authorities believe that it must be speeded up as a matter of urgency. The floors and ceilings mechanism has led to major problems in the south-west, as we have heard. In the wider context, during the CSR period, south-west fire and rescue services must deal with inaccurate data on inflation, and above-inflation pay awards. Local initiatives that need discrete funding, such as civil contingencies, community fire safety and new dimensions funding, will be a significant burden.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/3">It is important to mention Fireguard, which is an ongoing issue for fire and rescue authorities. At its board meeting last Monday, it collapsed, so local fire and rescue authorities have no means of dealing with fire cover in the event of a pandemic, national firefighters strike and so on. They will therefore fail in their legislative duty under section 7 of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 and section 4 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2002. The reality is that most fire and rescue services are faced with real-term cuts in their funding. They have been forced to view the integrated management plans as a fig leaf for real cuts in services, job losses and the removal of appliances.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a sound and accurate point. I do not recognise the picture that the hon. Member for Gloucester paints of widespread support for the project&mdash;not least because it is not true. Even if people such as Councillor Willmott in Wiltshire support it, they do so only because of the threat that the Government will use reserved powers under the 2004 Act. It is hardly surprising that they support the project when they are faced with that difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.0/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean has comprehensively demolished the case for a fire control project. All we heard from the hon. Member for Gloucester were platitudinous comments and vacuous sound bites that show that there is no empirical data to back up his comments about, for instance, the number of calls received during the floods.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.2/1">The case has not been made, either in terms of cost savings or resilience. The project is not only opposed by the Fire Brigades Union, but by ordinary firefighters and councillors on local fire authorities. The Government need to look again at two pertinent issues: the funding formula and the need to scrap the fire control project. The project will be a disaster and will encumber local fire authorities and council tax payers in the future. The Government need to be honest about that and scrap the project.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.3/1">It is a pleasure to respond to the many points that have been raised. The comments of hon. Members deserve respect, and I will deal with as many points as I can as swiftly as I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> on securing the debate. Aside from his congratulations to me, I did not agree with anything else in his speech. However, it is important to thank him for initiating this debate, because it gives me the chance to put on the record something with which I am sure we all agree: through their commitment and professionalism, the fire and rescue services play a crucial role in keeping our community safe. Indeed, the timing of today's debate is a powerful reminder of the bravery and dedication that firefighters persistently demonstrate when fulfilling their duties. Today is the anniversary of the warehouse fire in Warwickshire in which four firefighters lost their lives. I beg the indulgence of hon. Members, as I shall name them: Ashley Stephens, John Averis, Darren Yates-Bradley and Ian Reid&mdash;the youngest was 20 and the oldest was 44.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/3">It is appropriate that the hon. Gentleman secured this debate&mdash;and I am pleased he did so&mdash;which has provided an opportunity for hon. Friends and members of the Opposition to raise important points. I want to do those points justice in the short time I have. On my first outing as the Minister responsible for fire, I visited the fire station referred to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>. It is an excellent station with excellent facilities and is proof, if it is needed, of our investment during the past 11 years. The station is the first building in Dorset to be completed through the private finance initiative as part of the joint police and fire service initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/4">I shall make a swift passage through some of the investment we have made, because people have short memories. For example, during recent years, we have invested more than &pound;400 million in a PFI programme to help to deliver 21st-century stations. Fire and rescue authorities will benefit from a further &pound;130 million in PFI credits. In fact, Dorset is receiving nearly &pound;28 million in PFI funding to support new building projects, and other fire and rescue authorities in the south-west have benefited from PFI. Much has been made of Gloucestershire and Avon, both of which, with Somerset, were part of the collaborative PFI project to provide joint training in Avonmouth. Nearly &pound;17 million of investment has been made through PFI. Gloucestershire has also received &pound;40 million for new community fire stations&mdash;not for one, two or three stations, but for four of them&mdash;and a community life skills centre. I respectfully advise those who have amnesia to try to recollect what life was like before the improvements that have been made during the past 11 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/5">Much was made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1663" name="Roger Berry">the Member for Kingswood (Roger Berry)</phrase> and others about the three-year settlement for fire and rescue services. The architect of the next Conservative manifesto, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase>, is here, and I am happy to take an intervention from him if he will make spending commitments in relation to what his party will do over the next period. The Opposition are not willing to make commitments for the next few weeks and months, let alone for three years' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/6">Let us be clear that under the three-year local government settlement, which was announced at the beginning of this year, single-purpose fire and rescue authorities will receive an average increase in formula grant of 2.4 per cent., 1.4 per cent. and 1.4 per cent. during the three spending review years. No fire and rescue authority will receive&mdash;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I can hear chuntering. I am not sure if Opposition Members wish to make an intervention; I am happy to take one if that is the case. No fire and rescue authority will receive an increase of less than 1 per cent., 0.5 per cent. and 0.5 per cent. It is worth emphasising that over the comprehensive spending review 2007 period, councils will receive an additional &pound;8.91 billion. The factors and criteria by which the grant is allocated are well publicised and we know about them. We heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1438" name="John Butterfill">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill)</phrase>, who is involved with Streetwise, that there are benefits to having a floor, as otherwise there would be a loss, so I am glad that we have heard an endorsement of the need to have floor.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/7">The intention of our financial policy in relation to local government has always been to provide fairness and stability. Our goal is to ensure that the three-year settlement is a three-year settlement; not a settlement that changes each year because we are lobbied to change the data or methodology that is used. The Government and I believe that it is important to provide stability for local government, so that they can have more time for planning their income and expenditure. That creates a greater degree of certainty and that is our goal.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.0/1">If the Minister is so concerned about transparency and clear planning, why has he disaggregated the national business case to regional fire control boards and delayed the publication of that case? As a result, local fire authorities are not in a position to make proper planning past the comprehensive spending review period post-2011, which will put them in a difficult financial position.</p>

	<p pid="a.48.1/1">I do not accept those figures. In the time I have left, there are two things worth saying. The capital grant, which is new money for which Dorset will receive the fruits, is &pound;35 million next year and &pound;45 million the following year. That can be used to buy fire engines, which should deal with the scaremongering comment blurted out by someone in relation to the inability to buy fire engines. An important issue I have had not had the chance to address is that of fire control, and the fire and resilience programme. There is no better argument and justification for that than the comments made by my hon.

	<p pid="a.49.1/1">I am especially pleased to be here with my hon. Friend the Minister. This is my first chance to see him in action and it gives me particular pleasure to be doing that today. I am aware that quite significant parts of the UK skills agenda have been devolved, so although I will mention Scotland's policies, I shall try to err on the right side of the rules and avoid straying into the tricky territory that is devolved policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/2">The skills agenda is perhaps the most important single area of public policy today. The Government in many respects set the terms of progress by commissioning the Leitch review of 2006. The resulting report, &quot;Prosperity for all in the global economy&mdash;world class skills&quot;, was a practical piece of work that stated fairly orthodox facts of life about the future of our economy in the world and our need for a more highly skilled population. It also made a series of recommendations about how our education and training structures should be developed to meet the challenges at hand. That report has been followed through by the Government pretty much lock, stock and barrel, most notably through the creation of the UK Commission for Employment and Skills&mdash;the UKCES.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/3">From my perspective as the Member for Falkirk, a Scottish constituency, the UK element of the UKCES needs a bit of unpacking. It is clear that the imperatives of the Leitch report apply across the UK and, indeed, much more widely in many respects&mdash;in the widest sense, they apply to any developed economy in the world today&mdash;but devolution means that different parts of the UK are carrying forward the ideas and philosophy central to Leitch in their own ways. Certain strands apply across the UK equally. The sector skills councils apply across the UK, which is very important. The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills leads on those matters. However, there are also significant parts of the agenda on which it is for the devolved Administrations to make their own decisions and policies. As I said, I will refer to Scotland, but I shall endeavour to stay on the right side of the rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/4">I shall examine the issue of skills through the prism of my own constituency. Falkirk sits in the central belt of Scotland between Edinburgh and Glasgow. Historically, it provided labour for the iron industry, which in turn served the shipbuilding industry on the Clyde and elsewhere in Scotland. Employment, skills and human capital in general revolved around a number of fairly simple assumptions about how a working life would normally pan out. Women tended not to work and men tended to be trained on the job. People tended to enter employment on leaving school, often staying with the same employer, in the same location, for their entire working lives. There was a tradition in Falkirk of skilled employment for some, as the iron industry required skilled artisans and engineers at one end of the spectrum, but much of the employment was semi-skilled and quite a lot of it was unskilled, even though people did it for their entire working lives. The schools turned out many kids who expected to enter similar employment to that of their parents, and the college sector, as it was then, often provided day release for them once they entered the foundries and associated employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/5">Employment was available but, despite the fact that people often look back through rose-tinted lenses, it was not plentiful. Unemployment was much higher, employment was much lower and women tended not to work. Unemployment was a feature of life for greater numbers of people then than it is today, and working lives were often cut short by ailments caused by the industrial conditions in which people worked.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/6">There is a danger here of presenting a monochrome, over-simplistic version of the local economy at the time. It is nevertheless fair to say that the essential nature of the local economy and people's working lives can be understood only against the backdrop of the foundries and the industrial landscape that they formed.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/7">Interestingly&mdash;I think it is interesting anyway, because I did it&mdash;I sent 10,000 questionnaires to local households. I should have said that I and my massively capable staff did that&mdash;they did it and I take credit for it. We asked various questions about life in the Falkirk area, and many of the norms and figures that we got were pretty much the same as those that people would get not only across Scotland, but across the whole of the UK. From a policy point of view, Falkirk is in many respects a typical place that we can generalise from outwards to the whole of the UK&mdash;I like to think so, anyway. People can see the results of the survey on FKUK.net.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/8">My predecessor in the House, Harry Ewing, who subsequently became Lord Ewing of Kirkford, said in his maiden speech that Falkirk was &quot;solely an iron town&quot;. That was in 1971. He pointed out that there had been recent investment in the industry and that it was well equipped for the tail end of the 20th century. However, within about 10 years of that speech, most of the foundries were either closing or had closed, and by the time I came on the scene, just over 10 years after that, they were all gone. There was one left, but it has now gone as well, which shows just how quickly the nature of employment has changed in my part of Scotland and, indeed, across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/9">Let us fast forward to today. All those foundries are now closed and on the sites of the old foundries are new build housing estates. Indeed, it sometimes seems that if planning permission permitted, pretty much every available square inch in Falkirk would have a house built on it. That is because Edinburgh and Glasgow are only half an hour away and Falkirk sits in the middle of three motorways, so people live there and travel to work. Clearly, there are still many jobs in Falkirk&mdash;including those at Alexander Dennis, which builds the red London buses, one of which we saw at the Beijing Olympics&mdash;but there is far more commuting and there is a far greater flow of people moving into the new build houses than moving on elsewhere. That impacts on the local economy, and I will come to the skills base.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/10">Employment in Scotland is relatively high. The number of people of working age who are not on incapacity benefit and are in employment is slightly higher than it is across the UK as a whole, but working lives are characterised by far more uncertainty than they were in the days of the iron industry. The patterns of increased mobility and reduced time horizons in terms of how long someone might expect to stay in a job, a particular appointment or even a particular industry have, in common with a range of other features of life in the 21st-century global economy, placed the value of human capital&mdash;I believe this and I think that the Government do&mdash;at the top of the political agenda, and this is where the skills agenda comes into play.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/11">It is more or less an article of faith within the skills agenda that higher levels of skills lead to higher levels of individual and collective productivity, yet as the UKCES has noted, Scotland apparently has higher levels of skills per capita but lower levels of productivity than the UK as a whole. Quite a lot of work needs doing to get to the root of why that should be the case, but it seems to me quite likely that there are important differences in the nature of available jobs. If people are upskilled and highly educated but fail to find jobs that suit their level of skills and education, they will be less productive by definition and perhaps even in terms of their own motivation. In addition, some OECD comparisons and some productivity measures, particularly those directed at the public sector, seem to me to need quite a lot more work before they can be considered properly valid and reliable. I know that the UKCES has commented on that and has made a pretty good start in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/12">Another important variable is capital investment. New equipment virtually by definition drives productivity improvement, so older industries or service industries that have relatively low levels of investment in state-of-the art equipment will show lower levels of productivity even if the people who work in them are more highly trained and educated.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/13">That point was made to me by Wendy Livingstone, the associate principal of business and innovation at Forth Valley college. Wendy is responsible for a new development in vocational education, which I think has implications across the whole UK. Often we speak of parity of esteem in relation to education and training, yet esteem is not really something that can be ascribed by politicians. It is essentially up to the &quot;esteemers&quot;, if I can put it that way&mdash;young people, employees and employers and what they think of particular qualifications. We cannot really define it; they have to decide what they value themselves. Vocational education can be a hard sell when it comes to people with considerable academic potential. Sometimes even the Government and hon. Members are guilty of over-emphasising academic qualifications and the importance of people entering higher education at the expense of a more vocational route. Wendy and Forth Valley college are running an innovative scheme in conjunction with INEOS, the large chemicals company that is a major employer in the Falkirk area and sits just outside my constituency, in that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" name="Michael Connarty">the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/14">Ineos has noticed that graduate trainees often lack physical skills and practical orientation in their early years. It has also noted that many skilled people in the oil gas and chemicals industries are very smart, like my brothers; they have not had a formal higher education but it could easily be thought that they had been educated to that level. Indeed, their salaries are commensurate with that belief.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/15">Forth Valley college and Ineos have designed a regime that will see local school leavers being recruited directly into jobs that will lead them to Master of Engineering status within six years. That is a year more than through the traditional higher education route, but crucially it includes six years of applied industrial experience. That is at the top end of the vocational market, but is shows that there can be a significant overlap between the vocational and the academic routes. That is particularly important.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/16">The Forth Valley College and Ineos initiative needs to be seen in the context of skills development across the UK. As I said, the UKCES has a UK-wide role, although it is technically only advisory in Scotland. Nevertheless, I am struck by how Scotland's principals are seized of the whole agenda, and all those to whom I have spoken seem very well acquainted with the work of Chris Humphries and his team at UKCES.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/17">It is worth mentioning the fact that many things are done differently in Scotland. Some initiatives are precisely the same&mdash;for instance, the Catalyst series applies across the UK; and the sector and skills councils, too, cover the UK. Scotland can sometimes be guilty of the &quot;not invented here&quot; syndrome, but I wonder whether these things sometimes apply the other way around. Essentially, we have two systems; but each should learn from the other. That may sound hackneyed, but in this case it is true.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/18">The Scottish Credit and Qualification Framework is a case in point. It is widely recognised by employers' colleges&mdash;and, to a fair degree, by parents and schoolchildren. However, its corollary in England has yet to be embedded to the same degree. I wonder, when looking back to 2006, if it was necessary for England to change the structure; it seems to me that it could have used the SCQF system, which was already in place, was recognised and which now seems to work well. That is important, because people need to understand that a number of Government objectives impact upon the higher national certificate level on the vocational side when it comes to funding, and in how they measure its success. My hon. Friend the Minister may have a word or two to say about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/19">England can clearly learn from a number of things that are going on in Scotland. I have spoken to a number of principals over the past few months, both in preparation for the debate and for other reasons, and in the broadest sense they believe that they have more room for lateral movement and local decision-making than their English counterparts. That enables them to have a stronger relationship with local employers. Indeed, initiatives such as that between Forth Valley college and Ineos are a case in point. I cannot back that up, but that is certainly their opinion, and it is probably worth further examination.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/20">I have mentioned the role of the Scottish Government. I would not wish, knowingly, to be too enthusiastic about an SNP Administration, but the reality is that the party has many capable and competent officials, who are doing a really good job. Many of the structures work really well. I do not have a quibble with officials over the professionals, who are virtually all of an extremely high grade, but I sometimes have a quibble about the funding. I have one or two concerns in that respect. However, it is not for me to criticise Scottish funding for something that is devolved. Indeed, I would prefer to do the opposite.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/21">For example, Train to Gain is a good initiative; it is directed through employers, and its focus is up to level 2, on literacy and numeracy; it is basic stuff, but it is important to get everyone up to that standard. Train to Gain does not exist in Scotland; instead, it has individual learning accounts, which are means tested. Without wishing to confuse matters by referring to the two qualification frameworks, the higher awards are directed towards the HNC level. It seems that the English regime is much better in respect to its commitment to funding. It is also clear that the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills is fully committed to funding apprenticeships&mdash;essentially making them available to anyone who wants one. Scotland does not. Unfortunately, in Scotland it has been cut. The impact will be seen in several years in workplace productivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/22">In conclusion, I shall mention one other organisation. I have received advice about the subject from a large number of people and organisations, and it would be good to mention them all. It would be more fair to reel them all off. However, one organisation with which I have had contact over the last couple of years is the Edge Foundation, of which the Minister is aware. The Edge Foundation places an emphasis on applied skills and entrepreneurship, and it has an especially close relationship with the all-party group on skills, chaired by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase>, the National Skills Forum and a number of other leading skills organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/23">I have had the privilege of being briefed by a wide range of skills-related organisations, and it seems to me that the Edge Foundation has been in just the right place when it comes to taking an intelligent and highly enthusiastic approach to the skill agenda. The Government can lay the foundations for a skills agenda, but it has to be taken forward by all sectors&mdash;both the public and private sectors and what I would call the third sector. The foundation is a fine example. I have read its comments on the Apprenticeships Bill, and the Government would usefully take note of many of their comments in one way or other.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/24">I have tried to present the UK skills agenda from the perspective of Falkirk and I have tried to emphasise how important the agenda is across the UK. I now leave the subject for my hon. Friend the Minister.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-04a.53.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1412" speakername="Sin Simon" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills"  colnum="53"  time="012:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081104/halltext/81104h0009.htm#08110450000609">
	<p pid="a.53.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">the Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> on securing this debate. He is an outstanding Member of Parliament with a broad range of interests. We are talking today about skills, but it could have been defence or even foreign affairs. In every area that he touches upon, he displays an exemplary depth of knowledge and commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/2">I agree with much of what my hon. Friend said. I share his admiration for organisations such as the Edge Foundation. The project that he described between Forth Valley college, an outstanding college in his constituency, and Ineos is interesting and innovative. It is a cutting-edge way of doing things.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/3">Having spoken to people in this sector over the past few weeks, I realise that there is clearly a demand from the business community for even more Government resources, not only for level 3 but for level 4 and above. Questions of parity and esteem, and the snobbery that sometimes afflicts the vocational sector, can be addressed by exactly the kind of project that my hon. Friend has mentioned. I am certainly be keen to find out more, and to see whether the Department could learn from what is going on in Falkirk.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/4">As my hon. Friend says, they are devolved matters, but I am clear that we in England can sometimes learn from Scotland. Perhaps on qualifications structures&mdash;although perhaps not&mdash;but certainly on forging local agreements on those matters in which college principals in Scotland believe that they have more flexibility than their counterparts in England, I am keen to learn more. My hon. Friend and I have had separate discussions about setting up a forum to discuss and investigate the matter, and if Scotland's practice is better and more flexible, we in England must certainly learn from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/5">The rest of my remarks today will necessarily relate more to England, but we should indeed be clear that the broader skills challenges are nationwide, covering the entire United Kingdom. When Lord Leitch issued his report on skills in December 2006, he noted that for the UK as a whole changes to the global economy had significantly increased the importance of skills; that skills levels in the UK had been improving, but still lagged behind other countries; and that UK productivity levels had also improved, but not as much as elsewhere. Compared to the UK, output per hour worked was 17 per cent. higher in France and Germany, and 19 per cent. higher in the US. Up to one fifth of the UK's productivity gap with France and Germany can be attributed to poorer skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/6">In his report, Lord Leitch set out the number of people whose skill levels must improve&mdash;and by how much&mdash;if we are to be in the world-class bracket for skills by 2020. He highlighted the potential benefits of raising our game and growing our economy by at least &pound;80 billion over 30 years, and he recommended that we as a nation focus our help on those who can least afford and are least likely to pay for their own training. He was also clear that the training system would not work unless it was genuinely responsive to both employers and individuals. The thrust of what we have been doing over the last two years has been about making the system more flexible, demand-led and responsive. We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/7">Government funding is big and getting bigger. It will rise from &pound;4.6 billion in 2007-08 to &pound;5.3 billion in 2010-11. That is a 7 per cent. increase in real terms and it will apply to more than three million learners. We have shifted resources towards those courses that have proven, sharp end, work-related benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/8">My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk was delicate and sensitive when he touched, very elliptically, on whether our ambition in this Parliament is matched by that of the Scottish National party in its area of responsibility. I cannot fail to note that it has been reported that funding for apprenticeships in Scotland has been cut by the SNP Government from &pound;52.8 million to &pound;50 million, that adult apprenticeships have been refocused into three sectors and that apprenticeships outside those areas have been abandoned.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/9">My hon. Friend will know that Labour colleagues in Scotland&mdash;not least John Park MSP&mdash;have been trying to do something about that situation, and an Apprenticeships Bill has been introduced that mirrors that of the UK Parliament. It has been well received in Scotland by employers, trade unions and colleagues in the Scottish Parliament. As we hope to do in England, the Bill will give apprentices in Scotland rights that currently do not exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/10">At a time when there is a call throughout the UK for public procurers to support apprenticeships, Glasgow city council&mdash;a Labour council&mdash;is leading the way with plans to offer 30,000 apprenticeships to young people in the city. That is a tremendous aspiration and we wish those involved luck and support. In England, as my hon. Friend said, we are expanding and improving Train to Gain so that it is more accessible, responsive and flexible for small and medium-sized enterprises. We try to put employers at the heart of skills provision and by 2010-11, the budget for Train to Gain will rise to more than &pound;1 billion. As my hon. Friend could not help noting, subtly but sadly, there is no Train to Gain in Scotland, and its lack is acutely felt by employers and organisations north of the border.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/11">In the current climate, all those needs and challenges are more pressing. During previous downturns, training has too often been one of the first budget lines to be cut. However, evidence shows overwhelmingly that we cannot reserve investment in skills for periods of growth. The research evidence is unequivocal: firms that cut training during downturns are two and a half times more likely to fail than those that do not. Firms that invest are demonstrably more likely to pick up more quickly in subsequent upturns. We must get that crucial message out.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/12">Much of the response to the current economic situation must come from the UK perspective. Businesses across the whole of the UK that do not invest in staff will suffer. The economic downturn is a global problem, not a devolved issue. Above all, that message must come from business itself. Companies invest vastly more in skills and training than the Government do. Last year, we estimate&mdash;although it is not easy to count&mdash;that employers invested about &pound;38 billion in training their staff. That compares to &pound;5 billion from the Government for adult skills and &pound;5 billion for universities. That is why we wish to make the support for small and medium-sized businesses under Train to Gain available now, so that it is flexible whenever and wherever it is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/13">The reforms tie in with the support for small and medium-sized enterprises that was part of last month's financial restructuring in the banking sector. UK banks using the recapitalisation scheme have committed to market and maintain competitively-priced lending to small businesses and home owners at 2007 levels for the next three years. My hon. Friend was right to highlight the UK commission for employment and skills, and I wish to associate myself with his commendation of it. As he mentioned, it is led Sir Mike Rake and Chris Humphries and it has already had a positive impact and plays a major part in delivering skills strategy in England. As far as I know, there is no such strategy in Scotland. The strategy brought forward in September 2007 as a response to Lord Leitch's report was overwhelmingly rejected by the Scottish Parliament. It was brought back to the Parliament the following May and rejected again, leaving Scotland waiting&mdash;even now&mdash;for a skills strategy in response to the 2006 report.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/14">Meanwhile, the UK commission has produced an important report on simplification. It is a key piece of work with strong ministerial support. It will encourage greater collaboration between employers and between Government and employers on addressing skills needs. That is crucial in raising skills levels at the right place and the right time. It is not something that the Government or any one player will be able to do alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/15">My hon. Friend pointed out that the Scottish economy has higher skills levels but lower levels of productivity. That is an interesting phenomenon about which he made some interesting points. The skills utilisation study underway now by the UK commission might be exactly what is needed to shed some light on that matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/16">I hope it is clear that the Government share my hon. Friend's belief that skills are a top priority and are at the forefront of our efforts to ride out the present global challenges, generate long-term economic success and promote opportunity for all. I agree with him that skills are a devolved matter but the challenge is for the whole UK to raise its game and respond appropriately and effectively to current economic conditions. Again, I congratulate my hon. Friend.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> on securing the debate. I also congratulate him&mdash;I say this in a non-patronising way and hope that he accepts it in the spirit in which it is intended&mdash;on the tenor and manner of a speech that was made in difficult and emotional circumstances. The hon. Gentleman has conducted himself with a huge amount of dignity, and I congratulate him on his contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/2">I am grateful to have the opportunity to discuss the work of the board and the role that it plays in maintaining high standards of conduct. The debate also gives me the opportunity to address the issue of investigations into alleged misconduct. You will agree with me, Mrs. Anderson, that when councillors need to be investigated, the investigation should be done in a fair, thorough and impartial manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/3">I shall make it clear from the outset that I cannot intervene in individual cases. It is right that I should not be able to do so, because that guarantees the impartiality of the conduct regime and the investigation process. In addition, although I am happy to discuss the process of a board investigation in general terms, I will not comment on, make reference to or engage in debate about any specific ongoing investigation. I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands why it would be inappropriate and unwise for me to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/4">Will the hon. Gentleman convey my condolences to the bereaved family of Councillor Brian Mosdell? Moreover, I want to assure him that two very senior members of the board are listening to this debate and that they will have heard his comments. The hon. Gentleman referred to the letter that he received from the chief executive of the board in which she said that the ethical standards officer is committed to completing the investigation and reaching a final conclusion as soon as possible. He also referred to the review. Without prejudice to the investigation, I undertake to take a personal interest in the review to ensure that it is not of the standard to which he alluded&mdash;not that I am saying anything about the previous review.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/5">I want to do four things during my speech&mdash;promote high standards, address the issue of the conduct regime, consider the role of the board and consider investigations and their time lag, which relates to a specific point made by the hon. Gentleman. Almost a month ago today, on my first outing as a Minister, I discussed the conduct regime. As someone who served on the planning committee of a council for 12 years&mdash;I know that the hon. Gentleman was a councillor, too&mdash;I can say that the vast majority of people who are elected to serve as councillors observe the highest standards of conduct, as do the officials who support them. Trust in our local authority members is one of the cornerstones of healthy local democracy. Voters expect that the members who have been elected to represent their interests will behave with honesty and integrity. Many men and women devote their time and energy to the service of their communities as local authority members, as stated in the recent White Paper &quot;Communities in control: real people, real power&quot;. We want more people to take on civic roles and stand for office for their local authority, thus ensuring that local authority members are an able, enthusiastic and diverse group and that local representatives reflect the communities which they serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/6">In this country, we have high standards of probity, accountability and objectivity, both as natural expectations of those we vote for and enshrined in the conduct regime. However, we cannot ignore the fact that failings occur from time to time and that there have been cases, albeit rare, in which the conduct of local authority members has fallen short of the expectations placed on them. When it occurs, such misconduct damages the community that the local authority members were elected to serve and also damages the wider reputation of local government, thus undermining the public's trust and confidence in the democratic system as a whole. We should, and do, take allegations of misconduct seriously. That is why we have put in place a robust conduct regime, which is supported by local authorities and the board.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/7">I want to touch on the conduct regime. People expect a conduct regime that is serious, reasonable, robust and fair. The regime has to be fair to the public and to local authority members. It is worth reminding ourselves that the regime was introduced in the Local Government Act 2000 to promote high standards of ethical behaviour by local authority members. It gave a clear ethical framework for local authority members to work within, and clarified for the electorate the standards of behaviour that they can expect from those they vote into office. It gave clarity about what constituted acceptable standards of behaviour; it introduced an independent, robust, efficient, fair and effective means of investigating allegations of misconduct; and it gave a proportionate regime&mdash;proportionality is the key word&mdash;for dealing with those who had fallen short of those acceptable standards of behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/8">A revised code of conduct for local authority members was issued last year. The idea was to provide a clear, simple and more proportionate code for members. The code removed barriers to members speaking up for those whom they represent on issues such as planning and licensing, and it has been well received by the local government world. It is that code by which all local authority members must abide. In May this year&mdash;I appreciate that the complaint that the hon. Gentleman has discussed was generated in September 2007&mdash;the Government fulfilled their White Paper commitment to introduce a more locally based conduct regime for members and co-opted members of local authorities in England. Devolving responsibility for conduct issues to local authorities provides them with greater ownership of the conduct regime and local conduct issues, and it boosts their role in promoting and maintaining a culture of high standards of behaviour in local authorities. That belief is shared by the local government world.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/9">The Standards Board, which until this point was responsible, as in the current case, for investigating alleged breaches of the code of conduct, assumed its new responsibility as the strategic regulator of local authority standards committees, responsible for monitoring their performance and issuing guidance on the conduct regime. Under the devolved conduct regime, allegations that a member of an authority has failed to comply with the code of conduct are initially assessed by the local authority's own standards committee. That assessment is in essence a filtering stage. No decision is taken about whether a member has or has not failed to comply with the code of conduct. Any decision on whether there has been a failure to comply with the code&mdash;in other words a decision about guilt or innocence&mdash;is determined by a hearing of the standards committee after a full investigation of the allegation has been undertaken by the authority's monitoring officer.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/10">It was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> who secured last month's debate, which I referred to earlier. During that debate on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-07">7 October</phrase>, at column 60WH, he made a colourful reference to an incident in a local authority when one councillor threatened to &quot;rip the arm&quot; from another. I hasten to add that neither was a Labour councillor&mdash;I will let the hon. Member for Isle of Wight guess to which parties the maker of the threat, and the person on the receiving end, belonged. Thankfully the threat did not turn into action, but I think that we can agree that the cut and thrust of debate should be free of threats of dismemberment, even partial. Simply put, misconduct by local councillors and officials is not acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/11">To address unreasonable behaviour we have the conduct regime, underpinned by the code of conduct and enforced through standards committees and regulated by the Standards Board. One of the roles of the board is to offer advice and guidance about the conduct regime to local authority standards committees. That is an important part of its work, but it is by no means the limit of its scope. The Standards Board still investigates the most serious allegations of misconduct. That is not to say that local authority monitoring officers lack the will, ability or experience to conduct a fair and thorough investigation into a serious allegation; it is simply that the Standards Board has people who are willing and able to investigate serious allegations of misconduct and who are experienced at doing so. In addition, the Standards Board has powers, should it ever need to use them, to compel witnesses to give evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/12">The Standards Board has investigated more than 4,000 cases since it was established and, while in its new role as a regulator it passes on its knowledge and experience through training courses and guidance, it remains ready to investigate when required. The hon. Gentleman may be interested to hear that at the beginning of October&mdash;during my second week in my present job&mdash;I was pleased to be invited to give the opening address at the Standards Board's annual assembly in Birmingham. Speaking with officials of the Standards Board, I was struck by their professionalism and enthusiasm. I believe that those attending the assembly&mdash;more than 700 councillors, standards committee members and monitoring officers&mdash;found it informative, useful and even enjoyable. That is because as well as holding seminars, plenary sessions and breakout sessions, the Standards Board brought together more than 700 members of the conduct regime community, which provided an ideal opportunity to share knowledge and best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/13">The Standards Board has the challenging target of completing 90 per cent. of its cases within six months. Last year, the board not only met but exceeded that target, completing 96 per cent. of cases on target within six months. My officials meet members of the Standards Board monthly, to discuss, among other things, its performance against its targets. The hon. Gentleman will have heard my commitment to take an active interest in the review that I mentioned earlier. I realise that for those who are the subject of an allegation awaiting the outcome of an investigation can be a stressful time. Performance against targets is, as the hon. Gentleman said, of little comfort to those who fall into the small minority of investigations that take longer than six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/14">Investigations can become protracted for a number of reasons. Some cases are complex. There are investigations where an allegation is made against a member about an incident; that is about as simple as it gets and under the devolved conduct regime we would expect such an investigation to be conducted by a local authority's monitoring officer. However, investigations can involve multiple allegations and counter-allegations involving up to half a dozen councillors. It takes time to be thorough and fair. The availability of witnesses, for instance, may be a problem, especially in large and complex cases. Of course, the Standards Board recognises that a protracted process can be stressful, but haste is not an option.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/15">We must also, consider, unfortunately, that the process of investigation can be protracted by malicious behaviour by the subject or subjects of the allegation, who perhaps have reason to fear the outcome. Findings of guilt can be damaging not just to individuals but to the political parties they are associated with. Delaying tactics, such as not attending scheduled meetings for interview, can push back the conclusion of an investigation, and it is all too easy to understand why a finding of guilt might be better for certain parties after a local election than before it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-11-04a.65.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1843" speakername="Robert Flello" colnum="65"  time="013:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081104/halltext/81104h0011.htm#08110450000614">
	<p pid="a.65.1/1">It is a great pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mrs. Anderson. I applied for this debate amid great sadness, and it is a tragedy that it is necessary&mdash;a &pound;250 million tragedy, to be precise.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/2">When I rose in Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-24">24 November 2005</phrase> to ask the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills about the huge investment in education in Stoke-on-Trent, hon. Members on the Government Benches turned in amazement on hearing that so much money was being made available to my city. Looks of jealousy were all around me, but now we are in a sorry state. Stoke-on-Trent council, Serco and, sadly, even the Department for Children, Schools and Families have turned that good news into disaster. Why? Because the council thinks that it knows best and does not trust residents with a genuine say in how Building Schools for the Future funds are used. In that question three long years ago, I asked that the council engage with local people in spending BSF money. Those three years have passed with a lamentable absence of engagement, as I will illustrate in the time available to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/3">We had three or more false starts with laughable activity, such as the council issuing draft plans only to withdraw them quickly and pretend that nothing had been issued. In July last year, the city's Members of Parliament discovered by chance that the council had briefed the local media that it intended to close all 17 high schools in Stoke-on-Trent, as well as&mdash;almost as an afterthought&mdash;the special schools. I found out about the closure of schools in my constituency during a chance conversation in the Library corridor. At that point, the council said that it would open just 12 new high schools, with a reduced number of co-located special schools. After a speedy intervention, we managed to buy time last summer for the council to engage in proper dialogue not only with city residents but with specialists, educationalists and health professionals&mdash;indeed, with all who have a stake in the future of our great city.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/4">Despite that, we had a summer of inactivity. A token event held on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-12">12 October</phrase> last year was nothing more than a sham. It was to some extent a gathering of interested stakeholders, but it by no means included all of them. Ironically, we witnessed a presentation about the importance of engaging with all stakeholders that gave no opportunity to hear the views of those gathered, let alone those not invited.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/5">I will not detain those present with a blow-by-blow account, but suffice it to say that at every turn, fellow Members of Parliament and I were told one thing while the council did another. We were told that discussions with head teachers would take place at the start of this year, but we then found out that those meetings were held without our input and that head teachers were simply told what was happening to them, with no dialogue taking place. As a result, Stoke-on-Trent, South, which currently has five non-faith schools, will have just two if these hare-brained plans go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/6">Let us look at what is planned for my constituents. The council, aided and abetted by its henchmen from Serco&mdash;I will turn my attention to that lot in a moment&mdash; plans to close Edensor, Longton, and Trentham high schools. Blurton high school is to be rebuilt, which is good news. Sandon has been rebuilt and, at my invitation, was formally opened last week by Lord Mandelson. That school is to be extended to take even more pupils. A new school in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1841" name="Mark Fisher">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mark Fisher)</phrase> is planned for the Park Hall site. Incredibly, the Park Hall site is currently occupied by the hulking mass of an old gasometer. It is on a busy traffic island and opposite a main bus garage, with buses pulling on to and off a busy main road. So much for safe routes to school.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/7">Pupils from the Meir North or Weston Coyney areas of my constituency will now have a choice. They can travel to Sandon high, which is a good school, but the journey will involve crossing the very busy A50, which has an average of one serious accident every week just in the stretch that runs through my constituency. Or they can journey some miles to the Park Hall site, with all the problems that I have mentioned. Why? Because local Longton high, which head teacher Jan Webber has successfully brought out of special measures to be a nationally recognised specialist arts college, is reckoned to be surplus to requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/8">Pupils from Sandford Hill and Meir Hay will have to travel along the narrow, congested, dangerous Anchor road, which has a narrow pavement on one side and no pavement at all on the other to the aforementioned Park Hall site. Alternatively, they can travel through Longton town centre, avoiding all the traffic, cross the A50 as I have mentioned and go down into Blurton to their new school. Pupils in Trentham or Hanford will have to travel along Longton road, over the west coast main line railway track, over a canal and on to the bottom of the Trentham Lakes industrial park. There, no doubt, they will have to compete with the lorries that use Sir Stanley Matthews way to access the major distribution warehouses on that site.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/9">Those listening to this debate may be wondering by now how the council chose the sites. That is a good question, especially considering that Serco and the council did not even bother to visit at least half the schools before announcing their plans. The next thought might be, &quot;Why reduce five non-faith schools in Stoke-on-Trent, South to just two?&quot; The council has projected that the city will have about 12,000 pupils by 2014. That is an easy equation&mdash;12,000 pupils divided by, let us say, 1,000 is 12 schools&mdash;but it is supposed to be a plan for our children's future, not a primary school maths lesson.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/10">Let me unpick those figures a little. According to the BSF guidance for pupil place planning, the council should be using the number of pupils forecast for 10 years in the future, so we should be looking at the number of one-year-olds in the city, as they will be the pupils entering high school at age 11. According to Stoke-on-Trent primary care trust, there were 3,181 one-year-olds in the city last year, and in the first nine months of 2008, 2,852 babies were delivered. That suggests about 3,000 children each year or, for a five-year high school, 15,000 children aged 11 to 16.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/11">According to the House of Commons Library, Office for National Statistics figures show that this year there are around 14,100 under-fives in the city. It is projected that by 2018&mdash;that, not 2014, is 10 years' time&mdash;that may have fallen to 13,000, so between 13,000 and 15,000 children in Stoke-on-Trent will need a high school place in 10 years' time. But the council is looking at 2014, which is not in 10 years' time, and it has not taken account of the increased birth rate in Stoke-on-Trent, which even it admits has risen noticeably.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/12">The BSF funding guidance for pupil planning goes on to say that where rolls will have fallen at the 10-year projection point but a BSF school opens in advance of that, BSF will fund the extra places up to 5 per cent. Even if we take the lowest figure of 13,000 and add 5 per cent., that still gives us 13,650 pupils compared with current pupil numbers of about 15,000. The council in its gross simplicity said, &quot;Okay, let's call it 13 schools,&quot; without any rational thought. We should have places for at least 13,650 pupils, or more likely 15,000, based on current birth rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/13">Let us turn our attention to the other part of the Mickey Mouse equation, the 1,000-pupil schools. Where does that magic number come from? Put bluntly, the figure was come up with simply to maximise the funds available to individual schools, without any regard for the effect on pupil well-being and the challenges faced by my city. It also ignores collaborative working, which even the council, with its travel to learn partnerships, suggests that it wants to engage in. A pupil in an intake of 250 can never be an individual, but must be an element of a teeming mass. So much for Every Child Matters. Again, the council has ignored Government guidance that local authorities should use local needs when modelling projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/14">All the way along, Serco and the council have said that the programme is not about buildings but about improving education, but all their attention so far has been on buildings. All that we have heard from them is closure, closure, closure. To look more closely at Serco, the company says on its website that it designs innovative solutions. Really? Serco told parents of pupils at Longton high that to get children to activities outside the normal school day, it would provide taxis or buses. Well, that is innovative.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/15">Serco states that</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/16" class="indent">&quot;our vision is to deliver shared success by understanding the needs and challenges faced by every school, teacher, learner and parent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/17">So why has it run a programme of misinformation, division and information control? Why has it failed singularly to engage with schools, parents or teachers in any other way than by taking an arrogant &quot;We know what's best for you&quot; approach? Perhaps it is because Serco also runs everything from the Atomic Weapons Establishment to the Woolwich ferry.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/18">Serco's website also says that if</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/19" class="indent">&quot;you haven't heard of Serco&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/20">in the context of BSF, it might be</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/21" class="indent">&quot;because we just get on and do it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/22">Those of us in Stoke-on-Trent, South know that that is true&mdash;Serco just gets on and does it&mdash;because it certainly has not listened to the needs and wishes of local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/23">There is no dispute that we in Stoke-on-Trent, South, like the rest of the city, need to improve how our young people are educated&mdash;no one has ever disputed that&mdash;but let us not pretend that it is a complete disaster at the moment. Longton high used to be a failing school, but instead of being helped, it has been cut down at every opportunity. It has been said that the Department's role, through the national challenge programme, is to support the efforts of schools that are improving from a low starting point. Who said that? It was my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/24">Jan Webber and her team at Longton high have done a fabulous job of improving the school, despite the death sentence that has hung over it for the past three years or so. Longton high had a proud history, but council bully boys have seen an end to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/25">Trentham high school is the second best performing school in Stoke-on-Trent and the best performing non-faith school. The head teacher, Sue Chesterton, was brought in by the local authority to bring the school out of special measures. The results that she has achieved speak volumes about how effectively she has done that. But how are she, her team and her pupils rewarded? Well, the school serving the Trentham and Hanford communities is to close. How pathetic.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/26">Because of schools such as Trentham high and Longton high, Stoke-on-Trent is now in the top 20 most improved school authorities. My right hon. Friend the Minister will know that there have already been demonstrations, a walk to Westminster and numerous fundraising activities to fight the madcap ideas that I have described. In his letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-20">20 October</phrase>, the Minister asked me whether I will now support Stoke-on-Trent authority with their plans for reshaping their schools under BSF. I must say to my right hon. Friend that the answer is no. Those are not the authority's schools; they are the parents' and pupils' schools; they are future generations' schools; and I will only support plans that are in the best interests of current and future generations, not plans that serve the convenience of Serco or council officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/27">I facilitated an alternative proposal for Stoke-on-Trent schools. It involved a plan drawn up by teachers and parents based on educational needs rather than mathematical simplicity. I did what Serco and the council should have done, but in their ignorance failed to do. I am not an education expert, but as a local MP my role is to pick up the pieces when people are let down by those who are paid to serve them. That alternative proposal could have formed the basis of a more sensible plan to improve education in my city, but it was dismissed out of hand. I then had copious meetings to find compromises to find a way through our difficulties, but of course Serco and the council were never interested in anything other than their supposedly innovative bulldozing schools for the future plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/28">Indeed, I have a copy of a glossy booklet produced by the city council, which is called &quot;Our Vision for a Learning City&quot;. It is fascinating reading. In the introduction, it says:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/29" class="indent">&quot;This is not a short-term vision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/30">Well, I agree with that. Instead, it says that it is a vision that has been</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/31" class="indent">&quot;developed by councillors and officers within the local authority who ... have been working over the past five years with a wide range of stakeholders&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/32">I do not know whether the Trade Descriptions Act applies to a document such as this, but if it does then the document will be kicked out.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/33">The council's &quot;vision&quot; goes on to outline key principles. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/34" class="indent">&quot;Our aim is to create a family of schools.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/35">It talks about &quot;'travel to learn partnership'&quot; and also, amazingly, about:</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/36" class="indent">&quot;Placing the school at the heart of the community&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/37">If that were true&mdash;sadly, it is not&mdash;why not have a ranger of smaller schools, or a school that is spread over several sites?</p>

	<p pid="a.69.1/1">I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for those words.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2">Moving on through the so-called document&mdash;I can think of better uses for it&mdash;it states that</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/3" class="indent">&quot;the transfer to new schools and academies will be carefully planned and properly managed. We will work closely with school staff and their unions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/4">So far, I have seen no evidence whatsoever of that happening. In fact, I have seen quite the opposite; I have seen places such as Longton high being abandoned just to get on with things.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/5">The document goes on to talk about</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Ensuring that young people's access to learning is not limited by the length of a school day or access to facilities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/7">That is a further joke in this supposedly serious document. It continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The new schools and academies will be located on sites to serve communities throughout the city with safe and accessible routes and at reasonable travel distances.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/9">Quite how the Park Hall site or the site at the bottom of an industrial location can be considered to be &quot;safe and accessible&quot; beggars belief.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/10">The document continues on the subject of parent choice, talking about</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/11" class="indent">&quot;increasing diversity of provision to meet parental choice&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/12">What parental choice? How can there be parental choice when a popular, well-performing school, one of the best schools in the city, is closing and one of the most improved schools in the city is closing? I fail to see how parental choice comes into that context.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/13">The Trentham parents action group is now pursuing the excellent idea of forming Trentham high school into a co-operative school. After all:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Engaging parents is, of course, important - and it was this government which helped set up the first parent-promoted school last year and will now fund 100 co-operative trust schools.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/15">Those are not my words; they are the words of my right hon. Friend the Minister in his article in <i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-24">24 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/16">I say to my right hon. Friend the Minister that the time for warm words is over and that the game of ping-pong is over. No longer can the council say that its hands are tied as the Government are dictating the number of schools, and no longer can the Minister say that the matter is all in the hands of the local authority. We now have a newly appointed, very excellent and capable acting chief executive officer at the council, who I hope will see the sense in our proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/17">In conclusion, I would like to ask my right hon. Friend the Minister a question. If the council proposes allowing Trentham to become a co-operative, parent-promoted school, will he allow them to do so? Furthermore, if proposals come forward for a school to serve Longton, Meir North and Weston Coyney, will he allow that too? A simple yes will suffice.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.1/1">If I heard correctly, my hon. Friend just said that the PCT's figures are more accurate because they are more up to date. According to those figures, we should expect there to be about 15,000 11 to 16 year olds at the 10-year projection point, which is the point for BSF. Is he saying that the funding going to schools in the area outside Stoke-on-Trent will be increased because they are getting pupils who should be being educated in Stoke-on-Trent? He is obviously acknowledging that 15,000 young people will require schooling in 10 years' time, at the age of 11.</p>
