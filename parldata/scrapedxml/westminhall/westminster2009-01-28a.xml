<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-28a.73.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="73"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090128/halltext/90128h0001.htm#09012858000532">
	<p pid="a.73.1/1">It is also particularly bad in the north for other reasons that I shall explain later. Thames Valley police has sought to address the movement of police officers to the Met by slightly increasing pay&mdash;from its own resources&mdash;to officers in the south. However, officers in the north of the area, such as in Milton Keynes or in north Oxfordshire in my constituency, feel that that is somewhat unfair. It reflects the general pressure that so many officers transfer out.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/2">As the interventions from my hon. Friends show, lower police numbers becomes a self-reinforcing problem. Having proportionately fewer police officers can make officers feel rather alone when on patrol, which can increase the attraction of the Met area, where there are a lot more officers to give support. Moreover, as Maurice Collins, chair of the Thames Valley Police Federation, noted:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The other reality which concerns me is that the core shifts, which are the bread and butter of policing, used to be driven by officers with four to seven years' service. That is not the case any more. Those core shift officers have now, typically, two-and-a-half to three years' service, and some of them are in probation. Often their sergeant in Thames Valley has only three to four years' service in total. That is not good for Thames Valley; it is not good for our community. We need to do something about it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/4">He went on to observe:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/5" class="indent">&quot;There simply are not enough police officers to go around.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/6">That is a fundamental concern for all of us who represent constituencies in the Thames valley. It is not our judgment; it is the judgment of the Police Federation, which represents police officers out there on the beat.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/7">For all of us living in the Thames valley, and for those of us who represent Thames valley constituencies, this is a serious issue. Moreover, if there are not enough police officers to go round, those we have tend to be allocated to larger towns such as Oxford, Reading and Slough, and constituencies such as mine, and those of my hon. Friends who are present, sometimes feel very stretched for police resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/8">The loss of officers is further exacerbated by what is known as the Edmund-Davies bubble. In the Thames valley, we have a significant number of officers who will retire in the next few years&mdash;139 in 2009-10, and 172 in 2010-11. That means that the Thames Valley police force is getting close to capacity in terms of taking in recruits. The problem is not capacity at the training school, but coping with the large number of newly recruited officers on patrol, having sufficient tutor constables and needing to take people away from front-line policing to support probationers.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/9">The Thames valley has become a training ground for the Metropolitan police. This year, the Met plans to recruit 550 transfers; it actually has a plan to do that. That means that its budget&mdash;I hope that the new commissioner will think seriously about the morality of this&mdash;works on the basis that it will be able to recruit more than 500 trained police officers from other forces. The Met is therefore relying on other police forces to train and provide it with 550 officers this year alone, many of whom are specialist officers. That is unfair and unsustainable, and it is likely to get worse as we approach the 2012 Olympics and the expansion of Heathrow. We are talking about a police force that is not as experienced as it could be if it had not lost experienced officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/10">Not only are we losing experience, but the Thames Valley force is incurring training costs, which will be reflected in the grant funding formula. The force has calculated that the cost of training is &pound;55,000 for a normal constable, rising to &pound;77,000 for a firearms officer. Therefore, if only 20 officers transfer, even at a cost of &pound;55,000 each to train, that is &pound;1 million. Our concern is that local people in the areas around London&mdash;our council tax payers&mdash;are paying to train their local police while the benefit is being felt in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/11">A south-east allowance was introduced a few years ago, but it has remained frozen, whereas the Metropolitan police's London weighting allowance has continued to rise, so the pay gap has become wider. The Thames Valley police force has done what it can within its resources. It is now using 3 per cent. of its pay budget, which is a considerable amount of money for the force, to try to give officers in the south of its area, who are more likely to find it easier to work in London, a bit more money, but that is a stretch on its budget. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">the Member for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase> has shown, it also creates tension within Thames Valley police. The force has helped more than 700 of its officers on to housing schemes, so 15 per cent. of its officers are being helped in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/12">The force is doing what it can, within its resources, to assist retention, but that still leaves the main issue: the difference between pay and conditions in Thames Valley police and in the Metropolitan police, and the free travel afforded to officers in the Met. As the local Police Federation representation has made clear:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/13" class="indent">&quot;For that reason, for the health and wealth of the Thames Valley and its community, the Thames Valley Federation think it is the right thing to do to support the Chief Constable, to break away from the national agreement&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/14">The Home Affairs Committee, of which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1774" name="Martin Salter">the hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter)</phrase> is a member, reached a unanimous conclusion in last year's report on 21st century policing. It made two relevant recommendations: differential pay between the Metropolitan police and surrounding forces should be reduced, and the Metropolitan Police Service should negotiate a protocol with surrounding forces on the recruitment of staff. I note that although the Met has made noises about such a protocol, nothing has really happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/15">My submission to the Minister is that the south-east allowance should be increased substantially to recognise the cost of living in areas such as Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, including in towns such as Banbury and Bicester in my constituency, because the current situation is simply unfair. He will doubtless jump up and ask how that should be funded, but the question that he should address is how to tell a police officer in Slough that they are worth &pound;6,000 a year less than a police officer 2 or 3 miles down the road in Uxbridge. That is unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/16">The Home Secretary has yet to respond to the Select Committee's unanimous report, but the Committee has made two very straightforward recommendations and we hope that that response will be positive.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-28a.85.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="85"  time="010:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090128/halltext/90128h0003.htm#09012858000542">
	<p pid="a.85.2/1">I agree entirely with the point made by the hon. Gentleman. Experienced officers are needed to crack organised crime in the way that he describes. Many hon. Members referred to what can be characterised as a brain drain of experienced officers from Thames Valley and other forces surrounding the Met area. In the Thames valley, the exodus in the last year has been the largest for six years, with a significant number of specialist officers leaving the force as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">Many hon. Members referred to the pay differential of &pound;5,000 and to the free travel on offer with the Met. I do not want to quibble too much about the free travel. Clearly, there will be officers who have to travel a short distance to their place of work. The argument about people having free travel when they were perhaps paying much less for travel previously is perhaps not so strong in cases such as that, but I do not quibble with the basic principle, which is that if officers work in the Metropolitan police, they are substantially better paid, and for some there will be the attraction of free travel to their place of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/3">Hon. Members referred to the forces around London being a recruitment pool for the Metropolitan police with regard to the expansion of Heathrow due to the new terminal and the London Olympics. The Oxfordshire branch of the Police Federation has expressed concern that officers will be poached over the next four years. I have some specific questions for the Minister. Does he believe that that is a realistic concern in the short term? When the Olympics take place, there will clearly be strong demand for additional officers to supplement the police presence, probably from all over the country. What will be the police profile? How many additional officers will be required to police the Olympics from now on? There will be a slow build up to the Olympics and a need for specialist officers. At what point will that growth in numbers occur?</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/4">A number of Members referred to training costs, which are significant. Indeed, additional training costs for the Thames Valley force since 2002-03 are &pound;10 million, partly because specialist officers are being poached or are moving to work for the Met. Additional training costs will clearly be incurred to train officers in the use of the Taser. I seek clarification. I believe that the Government will pay for the Tasers, but that forces will be required to pay to train officers in their use. I have another specific question for the Minister: what does he expect the average cost of training an officer to be? That cost will clearly have an impact not only for the Thames Valley force, but for many others.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/5">I hope that the Minister can answer some specific questions on what has happened since the meeting between the south-east police forces and the Home Secretary in January 2008. Other Members have already referred to what was promised.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/6">The Metropolitan Police Service was to monitor transfers in from other forces and provide advanced warning to them every month. Will the Minister confirm that that has happened each month since that meeting? The Metropolitan Police Service was to run recruitment campaigns in conjunction with south-east forces. Will he confirm how many such joint recruitment campaigns have taken place? Finally, the Metropolitan Police Service was to work with forces by staging transfers when, for instance, the negative impact in relation to transferees was proving critical to service delivery. Will he confirm how many cases there have been in which a transfer has been delayed due to critical risk to service delivery?</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/7">I am sure that the House will want to know that that meeting resulted in some concrete outcomes. If the Minister cannot answer my questions today, I hope that he will write to Members to specify exactly what has happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/8">An idea that has not been put forward in relation to training is one that other industries have sought to implement. That was certainly the case when I was working in the IT industry 20 or more years ago. The big firms were keen to set up an agreement so that if one firm had a consistent record of poaching staff from other firms it would be fined an amount equivalent to the cost of training the employee. As a result, there was no incentive for firms to do no training because they knew that they could poach staff from others.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/9">Have the Government put that idea to the Metropolitan Police Service or discussed it with police forces? It might be a way forward. The fact that the Met does not have to pay the training costs is clearly one reason why it can offer more money to its officers&mdash;it is saving the training costs. If some sort of fine system was in place, there would be no such incentive. As a result, one might be able to reduce the brain drain, if not completely cut it.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.0/1">It is a genuine pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson. I am sure you will keep me in order during the debate and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1397" name="Nadine Dorries">the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mrs. Dorries)</phrase> on securing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/2">The hon. Lady mentioned in her excellent contribution the fact that it is only a matter of weeks since we were discussing Aspley Guise and, following her strong promotion of the area, I have since had a look at the village's website. I have to agree that it seems an extraordinarily beautiful village. However, it is slightly longer since I have had the opportunity to speak on the matter of eco-towns, so I am grateful to her for securing such a timely and relevant debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/3">There has been a great deal of activity in relation to the Government's programme for eco-towns, not least in the past 24 hours. In responding to the hon. Lady, I would like to do two things: first, provide some context to the programme and, secondly, focus on her specific concerns about the proposed eco-town development at Marston Vale, as well as the wider concept of housing in her area and Bedfordshire as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/4">The hon. Lady will be aware that, as in the immediate post-war era, housing needs are increasing. That has made it necessary to explore options such as new communities and new ways of living in relation to a green and low-carbon economy. Eco-towns give us an interesting, even unique, opportunity to tackle two of the greatest challenges that this country faces: the pressing need to provide housing&mdash;particularly, affordable housing&mdash;and the need to try to tackle and mitigate the effects of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/5">In the current economic climate, that is, of course, more challenging, but I am sure that the hon. Lady agrees that everybody deserves a decent home at an affordable price. That is our aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/6">Throughout consideration of the eco-towns proposal, I have been blunt and said that it is not a magic wand or the sole answer to our questions about housing delivery. However, again, I am sure that the hon. Lady will agree that eco-towns could be exemplars of new ways of living, working and playing in a low-carbon economy and society. They can make an important contribution to the development of new technologies and practices, and we want to encourage that as much as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/7">The nature of the programme means that it is a long-term policy, with a phased approach. The aim is for the first phase of a number of exemplar projects to start in the next couple of years, building on the successes that have occurred in relation to it as a means of moving forward to achieve the 2016 zero-carbon homes target that the hon. Lady mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/8">The hon. Lady mentioned the judicial review. Before I move on to her specific concerns, I am sure that the House would like an update on that, particularly in relation to the judge's summary judgment. I am pleased to report that the judge recognised that the Government have acted properly throughout and has dismissed the review on all grounds. That supports the ongoing nature of our consultation. I shall quote from yesterday's summing up by the judge. In paragraph 13, he states that Better Accessible Responsible Development, the group opposed to the Middle Quinton eco-town proposal,</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/9" class="indent">&quot;submitted that in truth the Eco-towns process was an attempt to outflank the planning system. In my view what is envisaged is a proposed Eco-towns Planning Policy Statement (&quot;the EPPS&quot;), which will include a list of locations that the Government considers meets its criteria. This seeks to deploy planning law so as to require decision-makers to have regard to the EPPS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/10">He goes on to state the following key point:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/11" class="indent">&quot;In so doing the government is using, rather than outflanking, the planning system. This process would not necessarily compel the grant of planning permission for a location on the list.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/12">The hon. Lady will want to reflect on that final sentence, which will naturally be of interest to her.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/13">The underlying theme of the hon. Lady's contribution, having spoken to her about this matter before, seems to be a supposed lack of consultation. Her concern is that the public have not been consulted. I disagree fundamentally with that assessment of the process. She will be aware that, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-04">4 November</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing announced in the House a second round of consultation on eco-towns based on the draft planning policy statement on eco-towns. That was accompanied by a sustainability appraisal being carried out on both the policy and the 12 shortlisted eco-town locations, including Marston Vale. If I have time, I shall quote from the appraisal for Marston Vale, because it is very important to put a balanced view.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/14">As part of the second-stage consultation, we have been running a number of activities to encourage the giving of the public's views. The hon. Lady will be aware of the road shows and stakeholder events in venues close to the sites of potential eco-towns, including Marston Vale, as well as online questionnaires and feedback forums. The road shows were designed to help to provide information to people locally and went beyond required consultation practices. They enabled us to hear from hundreds of local people, both for and against eco-towns. They were never intended to be about the detail of individual schemes for proposed locations, but directed people to information and encouraged them to have their say.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/15">I shall move on to the proposals for Marston Vale and the hon. Lady's concerns. As she is aware, Marston Vale is identified as a priority area for regeneration in the sub-regional strategy, and work on the longer-term growth points towards Marston Vale as the preferred direction for long-term growth. That is acknowledged by local authorities. The proposal for an eco-town at Marston Vale plans to provide about 15,000 homes, with jobs, community infrastructure and open space, which will offer the opportunity for the regeneration being sought. That could have many benefits beyond the building of more homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/16">An eco-town proposal for Marston Vale would draw on existing delivery expertise and make good use of former industrial sites. As well as adding to existing settlements and enhancing their eco-credentials, it would help people to live more sustainably by providing access to a variety of infrastructure. The green infrastructure proposed for this eco-town will build on the excellent work by the Marston Vale Trust in this area. There is also potential to deliver sections of the Bedford and Milton Keynes waterway park, which is identified in the east of England plan as a strategically significant green infrastructure project.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/17">There are also proposals for green rapid public transport routes through Marston Vale helping to connect local communities with Bedford and Milton Keynes. Marston Vale, and all the shortlisted locations, has the potential to deliver vital affordable housing for tens of thousands of young people and families. The hon. Lady will agree that their needs cannot be ignored. Those proposals will also help us to respond to the challenges of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/18">I have mentioned the sustainability appraisal for Marston Vale. Like the majority of the other locations, it has been classed in group B&mdash;locations that might be suitable subject to meeting specific planning and design objectives. We are at one of the earliest stages in the process and issues remain to be worked through, at Marston Vale and elsewhere, and the sustainability appraisal identifies those. I shall be blunt with the hon. Lady: the appraisal identifies a number of weaknesses that we would want to see addressed before moving to the next stages.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/19">According to the appraisal, the weaknesses of the Marston Vale location are that</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/20" class="indent">&quot;the proportion of previously developed land is not known as some of the land may have been restored and is not therefore strictly previously developed land&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/21">and that</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/22" class="indent">&quot;there are features of historic interest within the site that potentially require investment and conservation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/23">The third point, about which the hon. Lady spoke strongly, concerns food security. Another key weakness of the location is that</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/24" class="indent">&quot;there may be a loss of productive arable land&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.0/25">The appraisal discusses other weaknesses of the proposal, including the presence of priority habitats and species, and water supply status.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-28a.112.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" speakername="Julian Brazier" colnum="112"  time="015:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090128/halltext/90128h0007.htm#09012858000591">
	<p pid="a.112.1/1">There are two points to be made about that intervention. First, I shall correct the mistake that the Minister has just made when he told us&mdash;the record will confirm it&mdash;that the Under-Secretary was setting out the view of the British Ports Association, not the Government's. Let us be clear about what he said, because I shall read the text from <i>Hansard</i> again:</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/2" class="indent">&quot;UK Major Ports and the British Ports Association refute the suggestion that the money has gone to them and that they are in some way obliged to pay the money back to businesses in ports. They say categorically that that is not the case, and they have demonstrated that in discussions I have had with them.&quot; &mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-01-27.150"><i>Official Report</i>, 27 January 2009; Vol. 487, c. 150</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/3">The Under-Secretary was making it clear that he shares their view.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/4">The second and more important point is that both Ministers cannot be right. I am not in a position to judge which of them is right, but it is extraordinary that two Ministers are still unable to agree on the matter after the many months that the crisis has been running. However, irrespective of who is right, the key question is, were the various port tenants all warned when this exercise began in 2004, when the first wheels started to turn? In fact, the exercise started late, as the Minister explained&mdash;it did not actually start until 2006. Whatever arguments one might have about the current arrangements, if the tenants were not warned, there can be no moral case whatever for collecting back tax from them, as all three Members who have spoken made clear. If the Government cannot show evidence that the Valuation Office Agency approached the businesses and told them that the exercise was going on, the Government must understand that those businesses were paying rent on the basis that they believed that their landlords were responsible for rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/5">The Minister must know that when a business decides whether to take on premises, one of the factors in the rent negotiations is who is paying the rates&mdash;it has to be. Unless the Minister can show the House evidence that the Valuation Office Agency explained the exercise to the businesses&mdash;he was unable to do so last week&mdash;he has no moral case whatever.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/6">I conclude by making a few general points, because I am conscious that a lot more hon. Members want to speak. Regardless of what the real facts are&mdash;I am not sure, for the reasons that I have mentioned, that Ministers fully understand them&mdash;the situation is dire. We have had a string of examples already, so I will not repeat them.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/7">Ports businesses suggest that some 700 businesses are affected and the Minister himself admitted that an extra 564 properties in England are affected. The worst affected areas appear to be Mersey and Humber, although other examples have been raised today. I am interested to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1550" name="Gwyn Prosser">the hon. Member for Dover (Gwyn Prosser)</phrase> in the Chamber. So far I have had no complaints from Whitstable in my constituency, but I am waiting for the letter.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/8">I remind hon. and right hon. Members that freight rates&mdash;the rates enjoyed by the customers of ports&mdash;are at their lowest in real terms in living memory. I am told that the situation is so bad that ships travelling at the moment are simply being reimbursed for fuel so that companies can keep their vessels on the move. In some areas the freight rates have dropped by more than 95 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/9">Against the background of the Government's seeming to be happy to shell out vast sums to the banks, despite the fact that they are not lending, and to shovel out vast sums to the automotive industry, how can they possibly justify such a grossly unfair impost on businesses that are not asking for subsidies, although they are in a desperate trading position? All these businesses are asking for is fair treatment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-28a.113.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1819" speakername="Derek Wyatt" colnum="113"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090128/halltext/90128h0007.htm#09012858000592">
	<p pid="a.113.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> and hon. Members from all parties. We are representing our communities and our constituents who are faced with serious problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/2">The port of Sheerness is probably the fourth&mdash;sometimes the fifth&mdash;largest in Britain. It is the main importer of cars and is the biggest importer of Cape fruits from South Africa. When running businesses, as some Members have done, people look forward and break the year up into four quarters and try to reach the figures that they have ascertained. In the next year, 2009-10, it will be hard for anybody to guess whether they will reach their figures, but they will try, because that is what being in business means.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/3">The one thing that people do not do is look back to quarters one, two, three and four of 2008, 2007, 2006 or 2005. Why? Because the accounts for those years have been audited and tax paid on them to Customs so, as far as the business is concerned, they are done, sealed and finished&mdash;that is it. The Government should not then undo the law of the land and say, &quot;I am awfully sorry, but although those accounts have been professionally audited and taxed officially and the tax has been paid, we have made a bit of a mistake. P.S. You owe us hundreds of thousands of pounds.&quot; That should not be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/4">I understand that the Minister is in a difficult spot. He is a reasonable man, whom I have met on many occasions in his different portfolios, and he is well respected in the House. This is not his issue, but he has to carry the can today. How can anyone possibly say that the system is fair, decent, practical and honest? If it is for UK plc, what on earth is the sense of it? The system is an appalling mistake and we have to ask the Minister to redress it.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/5">What sort of Government have made such a decision? In due course, I shall press the Minister with the Freedom of Information Act 2000, but he could save me the trouble by putting into the public domain the correspondence, e-mails and telephone calls between his Department and the Treasury, the Secretary of State for Transport and the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. I cannot believe that either of those Secretaries of State could possibly have agreed and signed off such a system. I hope that in his summation the Minister will not tell me that they have. That would make the situation even scarier, because the Government do not understand what they have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/6">Will the Minister tell me what I should tell some of the people from Sheerness dock, whom I saw last Friday? For instance, listen to Mr. Sampson's case. He imports vehicles and is very good at it. In 1998 and 1999, we said we wanted added value. Mr. Sampson adds value to the cars he imports, putting in different stereos, satnavs and different colours of leather, and so on. He is exactly where we want people to be. His rates are &pound;4,438, but now he has to pay &pound; 57,715.97. Please tell me what I should say. If the Minister does not change the situation, those people will be in the receiver's yard within three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/7">Kleerfreight is a small family business employing five people. Things are tight and it is hard running a small business, so what has Kleerfreight just been asked for? The sum of &pound;11,270, which it cannot afford. The owner tells me, rather nicely:</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Someone somewhere is accountable for such gross negligence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/9">Please tell me that there is a principle and value behind the system. We do not understand it.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/10">Mark Holmwood, the managing director of Seatrade says that his business is now faced with a rates assessment of nearly &pound;20,000. The business will not be able to pay that sum&mdash;there is no question about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/11">Worse still is the case of the big companies. Peugeot Citroen and Volkswagen in my constituency will now have to pay back &pound;3 million and &pound;2.8 million each if the measure goes through. As a consequence, that will threaten the future of the dock, because as they say,</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/12" class="indent">&quot;in our case...our UK and Paris offices started to make significant changes on our receipt of this demand in our UK supply chain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/13">They have reduced</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/14" class="indent">&quot;storage capacity and staff in Sheerness, this continues and we have conversely increased storage and facilities in Europe&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/15">that cost less.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/16" class="indent">&quot;50 jobs have gone so far more are anticipated, revenue to the port and investment by us will be down by a number of millions this year and active consideration is being given to whether we remain in Sheerness.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/17">There is an unintentional consequence of the system, which is that we are now giving other ports in Europe a quick opportunity to take the market away from us in the worst trading conditions since 1929. I cannot believe that the Government really want to do that. It is simply beyond the wit of man to understand how that could have been the intention. I also received a letter from John Dowding, of Overland Freight Forwarders, saying exactly the same as the others I have mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/18">The Minister understands our anger, but we do not make business; we do not get up in the morning and serve our communities in that way. However, the people who do have tried to make their businesses work. The measure is not just an own goal; it is 10 own goals. I urge the Minister to consider the total impact of the system on UK plc.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-28a.117.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" speakername="Lorely Burt" colnum="117"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090128/halltext/90128h0008.htm#09012858000598">
	<p pid="a.117.0/1">I add my congratulations to those offered to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>, who made a passionate and detailed case. The story that we have heard is almost unbelievable to the uninitiated. There are no ports in Solihull&mdash;one could not get farther from the sea in England if one tried. Notwithstanding that, I can completely understand the problems and challenges so clearly outlined by hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/2">As I said, this is an almost unbelievable story of backdated demands almost as large as &pound;10 million and of debt having to be reported in annual accounts, which will push a number of companies into insolvency. Whether or not there are eight years of interest-free payments, the repercussions of the backdated amount being suddenly foisted on those companies will be much greater than the Valuation Office Agency could ever have thought possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/3">If a number of companies are pushed into liquidation, the upshot will be the Government not receiving the money anyway. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1819" name="Derek Wyatt">The hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt)</phrase> told us that many accounts will already be closed off, and that seemingly incompetent organisation seems to be flying in the face of every accounting procedure. I wonder what gives it the right to ride roughshod over such commercial practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/4">We heard about the strategic importance of the ports; the hon. Member for Great Grimsby said that they are the gateway to Europe. Our ports are the gateway to the world and vital to our economic prosperity, for exports as well as imports. It seems that the Government are deliberately creating an unfair playing field for United Kingdom ports, particularly when competing with other European ports.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/5">The charges being levied on some firms are higher than last year's turnover. There have been increases of as much as 1,700 per cent. at a time when the Government say that they are trying to protect jobs. The charges will destroy jobs. DFDS Seaways, based at Immingham, has already announced that 71 jobs will be lost, with half those losses being directly attributable to the rates problem. It is facing a demand for almost &pound;10 million. It has been estimated that as many as 150,000 jobs are threatened.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/6">Several hon. Members spoke of the lack of consultation when the charges were introduced, but it is worse than that as no impact assessment has been made. How can one suddenly levy such charges on organisations without working out what their impact will be?</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/7">During a previous debate, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" name="Louise Ellman">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)</phrase> talked about the terrible shock to many companies of seeing bills that were retrospective for the previous three and a half years, especially as they thought that they had already paid. It is a treble whammy. Where is the money that has been paid? The port operator's fees have been reduced by &pound;44 million, so where has the money gone? I hope that the Minister will produce a definitive answer, at some stage if not today.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/8">We are asking for the new assessments to be brought in during 2010, but we have been told that that would require need primary legislation. We have also been told that we have plenty of time, so there is no impediment to the Government enacting those provisions. That would not be a huge burden on the public purse. In fact, it may save money, as otherwise revenue would be lost from companies, and it may save costs, as benefits would need to be paid so that the families of redundant workers could keep going&mdash;and that before we start counting the human cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/9">The traditional pattern of Westminster Hall debates is that an injustice is raised and the Minister replies but does not commit himself to making changes. Indeed, we heard this afternoon that it might be above the Minister's pay grade to make such a decision. Sometimes&mdash;surely not today&mdash;we do not do even get a straight answer. If the Minister cannot commit himself to changing this injustice today, will he commit himself to taking the matter to whichever Minister is at the appropriate pay grade for further reflection?</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/10">The Government have the opportunity to show reasonableness and humanity. Yesterday, it was announced that &pound;2.3 billion will be given to automotive manufacturing industry. Let today be the day when the Government exercise the same but much less costly compassion to help to keep our port companies afloat.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-28a.122.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" speakername="John Healey" colnum="122"  time="015:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090128/halltext/90128h0009.htm#09012858000610">
	<p pid="a.122.5/1">Let me be clear, I was not talking about different ports, but the businesses within ports&mdash;across the country in some places&mdash;all of which have been listed separately as liable for paying business rates with a big backdated liability, and some of them are settling them.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/2">Many hon. Members and some commentators have criticised the VOA for backdating the effect of the ports review to the beginning of the list on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, but that is not its decision. The date of the change is governed by legislation. If the property existed before April 2005, by law, the rates must be backdated to the beginning of that list period. In that way, the system tries to ensure that all rateable property pays its fair amount of rates from the point when the property should be rated, and with all businesses being treated equally.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.5/3">May I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby that although we have discussed port occupiers in this debate, they are not alone in having backdated liabilities as a result of the VOA keeping the ratings list accurate? Some 777 new assessments conducted in a similar way to the ports review were added to the list during the past year, creating liabilities at this point of at least 33 months. In the current financial year, up to the end of October, more than 1,600 new assessments, including most of the port occupiers, were added to the list in the same way. Backdating in such a way is a feature not just of the 2005 ratings list period, but of the 2000 ratings list period. In the last year of that period, more than 3,000 new assessments&mdash;new companies&mdash;were listed for the first time with backdated liabilities. In other words, it is an established feature of the ratings system and the ratings list period, for this period, the last period and the one before. It is also a situation faced by companies other than the ones we have discussed this afternoon&mdash;other than those in ports affected by the ports review. When the Chancellor announced the provision in the pre-Budget report, it was not just for the ports companies, but for all the companies facing pressures from the current economic climate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-28a.123.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" speakername="John Healey" colnum="123"  time="015:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090128/halltext/90128h0009.htm#09012858000614">
	<p pid="a.123.3/1">If my hon. Friend will let me, I will reach that point. In fact, let me deal with it now. I am anxious to deal with the various arguments about the use of prescription and formula, and waiving the tax liability.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.3/2">I have confirmed that the rateable value for some port operators has reduced by a total of &pound;44 million as a result of the ports review. That comes at the same time as 577 businesses in ports in England and 80 in Wales are listed as liable for the first time. Many port occupiers say that their contractual arrangements with the port operator contain a fee, either explicit or implicit, to cover the business rates. My hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes described that as a commercial agreement in which they pay their business rates through the port operator. If that is the case, clearly they need to take it up as a contractual matter with the port operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.3/3">I have not seen clear evidence of how the contracts work. If hon. Members feel that it would be helpful, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>, and I will sit down and discuss the matter with the port operators&mdash;particularly those who have seen a significant drop in their rateable value as a result of the ports review. It is clearly in the interests of commercial port operators to ensure that their facilities in the port are used. They must have some interest in the health of the businesses that operate within their ports. If they fold, the port operator will be left with empty premises, no fee income and, as owners, a liability to empty property rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.3/4">I turn to the question of waiving the liability. We are urged to set aside the liability to tax. None the less, the companies have now been assessed as liable for business rates, including for the period of back payments. We cannot now act as if we do not have the full facts or as if they do not have a liability that is now clearly established in law. Therefore, it is not straightforward or possible simply to undo what has been done, or to hold off until 2010 when the next ratings list comes into effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.3/5">I am trying to avoid groundhog day, but let me return to prescription. Its only effect would be to alter the rating period for the port operator. Prescription and use of the formula allows that to be done. It is true that the Secretary of State still has the power to prescribe rules for establishing rateable values. In theory, she could use such powers to do so for individual businesses at ports, but it would not help them that much for three reasons: they would still be rated separately from the port&mdash;as they should be&mdash;and, in some instances, were before <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April</phrase>; the power is not retrospective and, finally, they would still be faced with three years backdated liability immediately on top of the liability for this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.3/6">On the question of backdated liabilities, the approach to business rates is no different from other business taxes. Ministers simply do not have the discretion or the power to waive or set aside tax liabilities when they have been legally established. Therefore, when a company is assessed as liable for corporation tax or national insurance payroll taxes, it is legally liable to pay by the set statutory date. That date can be nine months after the company's end-of-accounting year. When there is difficulty, HMRC has the scope to negotiate a payment schedule, but it is a matter of months, and not years as we propose for the port companies payments scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.3/7">I will be quite blunt. In effect, my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby is asking me to turn a blind eye to tax that port companies are legally liable to pay. Companies in other sectors are in a similar position&mdash;brought on to the rating list separately some time after the start. Although they may have to compete head to head with businesses based inside and outside ports, they have been paying business rates and carrying overheads over the period&mdash;in some cases, before. We do not do that with other taxes when companies are liable to pay them.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.3/8">We do not have the power to waive tax liabilities, so these companies are asking us to change primary legislation to do so. In effect, they are asking Parliament to turn a blind eye to the tax that the companies are legally liable to pay. Even if the Government accepted that such a case should be put to Parliament, persuading Parliament to give such powers to Ministers sets a serious tax precedent. I say to the hon. Members for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) and for Solihull (Lorely Burt) that I hope they have cleared their lines on the scheme because we do not do it for other business taxes. I regret to have to say to my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby that it is therefore not something that we can do with business rates. None the less, we will do what we can to help both with the schedule of payments and the fast-track system that the VOA has put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.3/9">If there are other steps that hon. Members think we can take, particularly in relation to the port companies and the port operators, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Transport and I are prepared to consider them, but the problem is not faced uniquely by the port operators even though the ports review has created that serious problem.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-28a.132.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1899" speakername="Angela Eagle" colnum="132"  time="016:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090128/halltext/90128h0010.htm#09012858000624">
	<p pid="a.132.1/1">I do not disagree with my hon. Friend's sentiments, but I want to emphasise that we have taken steps to support the banking system not because we support bankers, but because we wish to guarantee the savings of the many millions of people who have their money in retail banking. It is important to remember that retail depositors have not lost a penny, because of Government action. We also want to make certain that companies can access credit. That is vital to the functioning of our economy, if we are not only going to recover from the current circumstances, but aspire to have a resumption of growth and prosperity in the future. That is what we have been doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/2">Over time, my hon. Friend will have seen announcements not only about the recapitalisation of banks, which happened last October, but about the small business package, which was recently announced by my noble Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. That will make hugely increased amounts of money available to small and medium-sized enterprises. There have been further announcements on supporting and insuring banks against their losses. Those measures will enable banks to do the job that they should have been doing and that they were created for: lending to the real economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/3">To partially answer my hon. Friend's question, there has been a contraction in lending not only because we have lost some of the major players that were lending into the UK economy, but because of the huge amounts of uncertainty being caused, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, about the bank balances and assets of various of the large players. They have been unable to price their losses and, therefore, they have hoarded cash.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/4">Unfreezing that cash and making lending available to the real economy is the key to dealing with the challenges that face us now. That is why, earlier this month my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced a package of measures to support the banking system and safeguard the millions of jobs that would be put at risk if the banking system continues to have difficulties lending. These measures are aimed at beginning to replace the lending capacity lost by the withdrawal of foreign banks and other non-bank institutions from this market and addressing the barriers that are preventing UK banks from expanding their own lending, supporting stability and restoring certainty to the banking sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.0/1">I thank the Minister for the fullness of his response, but before he sits down will he address specifically the challenges of the policing pledge? He has talked about increased staff numbers, and I am loath to dispute those figures, but if one considers the workings of the pledge, including the 20-minute response time in rural areas and the requirement for 80 per cent. visibility, and if one compounds that picture with the rurality of Dyfed-Powys, our case for increased resources is vindicated.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/2">I am heartened by the Minister's comments on the role of Dyfed-Powys in the review group that is considering the future of rule 2 grants, but what about the practicalities of providing that visibility, having police officers on the ground and meeting 20-minute response times?</p>
