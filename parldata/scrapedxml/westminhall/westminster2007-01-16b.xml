	<p pid="b.205.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on this debate and on his work with CHANT, which is not a mindlessly partisan organisation&mdash;its website demonstrates that. He referred to the new PCT. The aggregation of PCTs in Leicestershire means that the Charnwood and North-West Leicestershire PCT, with three community hospitals is now part of a mega-doughnut around the city of Leicester, which has two thirds of a million people. Under that new structure and with those inherited deficits, the new PCTs are more likely to take unpopular and unpleasant decisions because they are remote and detached from the areas where facilities will be jeopardised. Does he agree that that has played a part in this problem?</p>

	<p pid="b.206.0/1">My hon. Friend is right and has fought tirelessly on behalf of his constituents. The situationin his constituency is reflected in many rural constituencies throughout the country and the problem particularly affects coastal communities. Perhaps the bureaucrats draw circles around units and use them to determine the viability of an asset. When a circle is drawn around a coastal town, there is an unfortunate tendency for half the circle to be in the sea, which is seen as a reason to remove services from people in what are often sparsely populated coastal areas. From Government downwards, we need to recognise the needs of coastal communities and the fact that they need resources, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.0/2">It is particularly ironic that the services and community hospitals that we are discussing survived post-war economic difficulty and through the economic difficulties of the 1970s, when we last had a Labour Government&mdash;sorry, I was not going to make a partisan point; I withdraw that. It is ironic that the events that we are discussing are happening at a time when the Government have doubled&mdash;in real terms; it is not fiddled&mdash;the expenditure on the NHS. I pay tribute to the Government for hearing the public desire for improved public services. Given that the services have been able to be sustained through all those periods of up and down and of recession and otherwise, how ironic is it that they are to be cut now, just as the money has been doubled? People are genuinely confused. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> mentioned, that is not a partisan point, because it unites people in the areas affected. I pay tribute to Labour party members, councillors and activists in my local area, who are absolutely onside in opposing the cuts.</p>

	<p pid="b.211.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase>, who has again chosen an important topic. I also congratulate him on setting up CHANT, which is an all-party group. We have many common issues, as well as some differences, but those are locality based, rather than party political. I also welcome the topic that he has chosen because it allows me to go wider and talk about what I deem to be community services, which have a community focus, but which may or may not come within the definition of a community hospital. In that respect, one problem&mdash;the Minister heard the hon. Gentleman's question&mdash;is what we now mean by a community hospital, and it would help to clarify the debate if we had some response to explain exactly what we mean by the term.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/2">I take issue with one point. If Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members think that only they are feeling the heat, they should come to Stroud, because we have exactly the same problems. I do not feel victimised and I have a good relationship with my hon. Friend the Minister&mdash;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Well, I should not feel victimised. However, the issue transcends party political debate, and our constituents feel strongly about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/3">I think part of the problem is that the point at which we enter the debate, and the basis on which we conduct it, is sometimes as important as the outcome. People are concerned, and certainly confused, about where we are going. I have two points to make, beginning with a financial issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/4">I have been through the whole process, in Gloucestershire, of a debate that has transcended community hospitals and has gone into maternity and mental health provision. The latter is a very live debate at the moment because of the potential closure of three smaller units for older people with mental health difficulties. An issue to be dealt with is what information is available, and the basis on which the financial decision is taken. Those matters also relate to the second area that I want to discuss: what are the underlying medical priorities or prerogatives? Those, too, are not easy to unpick.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/5">As I have said, the debate is a live one in my constituency, where we face the closure of one community hospital, in Berkeley. One could argue that that makes complete sense, because although we are losing a community hospital we are potentially gaining another in the Cam and Dursley area, which happens to be where the majority of the population in the South Vale live. One could take the view that we are swapping one for another. If things were that simple I should have to say, taking account of the population, and with regard to voting, or whatever, that we should go with the place where most of the population live. Stroud is like many other constituencies, in that it is semi-rural. Parts are very rural, but there are concentrations of population in the market towns. If resources alone are considered, hospital facilities, or even medical facilities, should be where there are the largest populations, and people should be allowed access to those facilities. That is part of the problem: it would be okay if we lived in a world where people could get that access, through good public transport, but things are not as simple as that. If Berkeley is closed, other provision will be made, but I would always start to consider the issue from the other end: why do we not think of other uses that can be made of community hospitals, which may not currently be providing the services we want from them? I hope that that debate will go on.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/6">I begin with the financial picture. Gloucestershire is typical, although, with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1456" name="Doug Naysmith">my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith)</phrase>, I might say that it is somewhat untypical. We in Gloucestershire felt that we had run a reasonably tidy ship with our budget, and because&mdash;I have said this before so I will say it again&mdash;we were in the strategic health authority from hell, with Avon and Wiltshire, which had significant underlying deficits which continue to this day, we felt a bit put upon when we had to find &pound;40-odd million in savings in a year. As things have transpired, most of that money has been found. Whether it has really been found, or whether changes are still to come, we shall have to find out. When I entered the debate about these matters, I wrote to my then primary care trust, which, in the nature of a small PCT, sent my letter on to another PCT. We always had a strange situation in Gloucestershire&mdash;although we had three PCTs, on virtually every issue there was a lead PCT. In the end, therefore, it was not my own PCT that I corresponded with to try to get the information.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/7">I simply asked for the information that would allow me to make a dispassionate decision, as best I could as a local Member of Parliament, on where the money was currently being spent and whether that was in accordance with health priorities. I wrote a letter last September, when the debate was at its height. It was a few weeks into the period in which we had been asked to send consultation responses. I sent responses about the maternity unit in Stroud and also about older persons' mental health provision. I also made general comments on community provision. I am still awaiting a reply. I was at one time very critical of PCTs, because I am expected to make decisions on the basis of good-quality information. I asked only four or five questions. I wanted to know what each individual practice spent and how that related to areas' health needs, because although there has been a debate about unfairness between areas, and the way in which the budget is divvied up, I am fairly certain that there are also instances of unfairness within areas and that the current distribution of spending does not necessarily reflect health needs, whatever we deem them to be. The location of the facilities does not necessarily respond to health priorities. I am still waiting, but I am less critical than I was, because when the figure were completed the new PCT chief executive refused to issue them, saying that they were embarrassingly wrong and that she would not issue them until they were right.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/8">One thing that the current crisis has unearthed, for good or bad, is the dearth of good-quality information on what is being spent and by whom, and whether that spending is being done fairly. I hope that the Government will continue to push primary care trusts so that we receive that information, and so that I can make some proper judgments on the appropriateness of health provision. That really matters for community hospitals, because we need to know the implications as far as who goes to them and whether they receive the right provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/9">My second topic is medical priorities. As we are talking about community hospital services, I shall consider mental health. Aspects of some of the decisions that have been taken worry me. There was an underlying pressure to cut with, in Gloucestershire's case, an attempt to take from the partnership trust 35 per cent. of the budget with regard to older people's services in mental health. That is a dramatic and indefensible cut. With regard to adults of working age we reallocated the money in question, through closing a centre in Cheltenham and concentrating facilities at Wotton Lawn in Gloucester. We took the money and put it into community and crisis teams, which makes sense. That cannot happen with older people's health, so a continuing problem arises in that case.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/10">The medical priorities give rise to difficult issues. The arguments that are always used include risk and the idea that there is, increasingly, a greater risk in providing services in very local, small-scale settings. The obverse of that is increased specialisation. Of course there are also many advantages to having consultants all in one place, even though they always seem to like going out to places such as Stroud hospital to do out-patients clinics&mdash;and, indeed, to Berkeley hospital. No attempt is being made to get rid of Berkeley in relation to out-patients. Those arguments always confuse me, because of the demand for more centralisation and specialisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/11">Besides the fact that I want the Government to explain clearly what we mean by the terms &quot;community hospital&quot; and &quot;community services&quot;, it is important that we should understand that there are non-medical reasons for needing community hospitals. That is certainly true in relation to older persons' mental health. I should like experimentation with intermediate care to take place. I have a vested interest: some hon. Members know that my father is in intermediate care at the moment. In my view, Berkeley hospital is crying out to be turned into an intermediate care facility, which will transcend health and social care and tackle some of the problems of who pays, and how. Community enterprise models could be examined and alternative streams of money could be sought. There is no big-time alternative to the NHS funded by the state, but there are models to consider. I hope that that debate will be taken forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.211.0/12">The problem is that we always end up with the question: &quot;Do we close this?&quot; and, if we are lucky, we may get something instead. That is the wrong debate, and it gets a terribly emotional reaction from constituents. That is understandable, because they love their health facilities and hospitals. However, we must move the debate on to consideration of the two issues of fairness that I outlined, and other ways of providing facilities, including GP facilities. We must make sure, in addition, that the debate is not driven purely by medical priorities. There are other reasons why the facilities in question are important.</p>

	<p pid="b.214.1/1">Thank you, Miss Begg. It is a pleasure to have you in the Chair. I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> on securing the debate. As he said, we have discussed these issues several times in the past 12 months or so. As usual, he vigorously and vociferously championed his area and the cause of community hospitals in general. I also congratulate him on setting up CHANT, of which I am pleased to be a patron.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.1/2">I participated in a similar debate a year ago whenall three community hospitals in my constituency of 600 square miles were threatened with closure. I am pleased to say that the reaction in the community was so strong and vigorous that one of those hospitals is now secure and has managed to reopen the maternity unit, which was then closed, and has completed a redevelopment allowing additional services to be provided in Bridgnorth. The future of the other two remains highly uncertain, however, so I want to concentrate on them today.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.1/3">In Ludlow community hospital, which is at least25 miles from the nearest district general hospital, we suffered the loss of the mental health ward six weeks ago. That has meant a loss of jobs, closure of beds and disruption for patients. There are now no in-patient beds for acute elderly mentally infirm patients in my constituency. The only provision available is in a hospital in Shrewsbury that was built in 1843. I believe that it is the last Victorian asylum in the country that is still being used for mental health patients. The closure was against the preference of the responsible clinicians and happened solely because of the financial straits in which the primary care trust found itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.1/4">We are also threatened with the closure of one of the two rehabilitation wards in Ludlow community hospital. That has been staved off entirely as a result of the vigorous community response: the PCT has agreed to a consultation period to allow the community time to come up with an alternative solution. Also, the minor injuries unit in Ludlow has been saved although the hours of operation have been reduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.1/5">The other community hospital with an uncertain future is in Bishop's Castle. The PCT board is meeting a week today to consider what to do with it. The board had a plan for its reconfiguration which would have involved a nursing home operator taking over management responsibility for the hospital and redeveloping the site. While that plan was seen as controversial in the town, it was at least a plan that the PCT had put forward, consulted on and was keen to progress with, but the plan appears to be doomed to fail almost entirely because of arcane accounting practices in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.1/6">The problem for the PCT is that the community hospital is too small. It sits in the NHS books at an accounting value below the threshold at which opportunities are available for larger hospitals to deal with the problem of impairment, with which the Minister will be familiar. The community hospital is leased from the county council so there is no freehold asset value available. The buildings are in the books at &pound;704,000, which is below the &pound;2 million threshold at which much more flexibility is provided by the NHS. Will the Minister address this issue in his remarks? Where is the logic for that arbitrary threshold? It is entirely within the power of the NHS to relax the threshold at which the NHS bank can be used to provide loans to PCTs to overcome impairment problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.1/7">The PCT has approached Ministers, the finance director of the NHS, the strategic health authority, the Department of Health bank and the county council&mdash;the freeholder and the nursing home operator. It has spent 11 months trying to come up with a solution to a &pound;704,000 impairment problem. If it cannot find a solution by next Tuesday, there are no alternatives. All this is to save &pound;150,000 of operating costs. A small-scale problem poses a threat of there being no hospital provision for a large number of my constituents in a remote area.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.1/8">I deal now with what is happening in Ludlow and a potential way forward for Ludlow community hospital and others. The prospect of salami slicing into the size of activity and the services offered in Ludlow is so worrying to our community that we have been galvanised into trying to find a solution because the PCT is clearly incapable of doing so. At the initiative of the League of Friends, we are working with the local council and the PCT to find a social enterprise solution in which the commissioner-provider role is split and the community takes social responsibility for the provision of health care in the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.214.1/9">Consultants were appointed last week to prepare a business case over the next three months to establish the viability of an independent Ludlow community hospital managed by the community, through a structure yet to be determined, that would fall outwith the PCT's management. The idea is to release the management of the hospital from the shackle of the PCT's financial constraints. Services would continue to be provided by the NHS under contract with the PCT and with nearby acute hospitals, which would provide some rehabilitation cover. The new mental health trust would take responsibility for mental health in Shropshire from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase> and try to restore some of the provision that the PCT has ended. That is an imaginative way forward. We hope that it might be a pathfinder, certainly for our area within the SHA, which was very positive about the development, and might be suitable for other community hospitals. I urge the Minister to do what he can to ensure that that idea succeeds.</p>

	<p pid="b.218.1/1">Thank you, Miss Begg. I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.1/2">I want to reinforce, rather than repeat, what other hon. Members have said. In most communities, community hospitals have had a very long history and tradition. The two in my area were both set up more than 100 years ago by public subscription or by endowment. They are owned by the community and are felt to be part of it, not least because the various leagues of friends have raised tens of thousands of pounds, over many years, to sustain the hospitals. The hospitals belong not to the national health service or to the Government, but to the communities. Those communities are rightly up in arms about seeing any threat whatever to the hospitals, given that the largest amount of money ever is being allocated to health services. Yet, those hospitals remain under threat.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.1/3">I came into this House in 1997, along with other hon. Members, partly because of the threat to community hospitals from the previous Government; there was also what now sounds like a rather hollow promise about having 10 days to save the NHS. Some 10 years later, many people feel that we are in the same position, except for the fact that millions of pounds have been spent. The situation could and should be much better.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.1/4">Community hospitals can provide local services involving less travel, less cost and so on. They can provide day case surgery, and such provision should be increased. More emergency facilities can and should be provided to take the strain off the big accident and emergency centres in the district general hospitals. There are opportunities for more of the following: disease prevention clinics; health promotion; health education and dietary advice; regular health checks; prenatal and post-natal services; and mental health services. All those things are extremely important to people living in communities, particularly in rural areas, yet we seem to back where we were 10 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.1/5">No one really believes that the Government have any great strategy. They seem to be lurching from one crisis to another, and every time that happens people's hospitals and facilities are threatened&mdash;things that people feel that they psychologically and physically own. Nothing else seems to come under threat, least of all large sums of money that are paid to primary care trust directors and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.218.1/6">Community hospitals have a special place in the hearts of people in the community. Hundreds will come to this place and stand outside this building having spent four, five or six hours in a bus and knowing that they will spend the same time returning&mdash;they will do so in their own time; they will not be getting paid for it&mdash;to say how much they support their hospitals and how much they want them to be maintained. I must warn the Government that back in 1997 the previous Government lost the election partly because of this sort of thing. This Government will not be forgiven by anyone if they persist in a policy that will continue to threaten my constituents'&mdash;and my&mdash;community hospital.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16b.221.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" colnum="221"  time="010:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070116/halltext/70116h0003.htm#07011648000485">
	<p pid="b.221.3/1">I will not give way because I have limited time.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/2">I want to speak about the confused, mixed and misleading messages emerging from the Government on their attitude to community hospitals. The hon. Gentleman was right to draw a distinction between stated policy and what is happening on the ground. I shall start with the Labour Manifesto, which talked of</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/3" class="indent">&quot;a new generation of modern NHS community hospitals...These state of the art centres will provide diagnostics, day surgery and outpatients facilities closer to where people live and work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/4">That is a wonderful vision, which we could all sign up to, but the manifesto did not say that at the same time the Government would sanction the closure of many existing community hospitals that provide care close to where people live. People could reasonably conclude that they were misled, but perhaps that is unduly cynical.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/5">Taking the manifesto at its word, it is fair to assume that because it said nothing about closures the grand plan did not involve closing hospitals. If that isthe case, one is led to the inevitable conclusion that the closures are an unplanned knee-jerk reaction to the financial crisis facing the NHS this year. Which is it? Were the closures planned and we were not told, or is it crisis management? It must be one or the other.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/6">The confusion continued in January last year. In a White Paper, the Secretary of State gave a reassurance that decisions on the long-term future of existing community hospitals should not be made solely in response to short-term budgetary pressures. She stated that she had asked strategic health authorities help to police that and to stop PCTs closing hospitals for the wrong reasons. Yet in Norfolk, we understand that the strategic health authority, far from blocking closures, was putting private pressure on the PCT to close community hospitals. That was not very accountable to the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/7">Then in July last year, the Secretary of State was back offering more good news: &pound;750 million was to be made available for public capital investment to realise the vision of creating the new generation of community hospitals. She stressed in her statement to Parliament that judgments on reconfigurations&mdash;the jargon for closures&mdash;were for local decision making. The simple maxim seems to be that dispersal of largesse for the provision of wonderful new state-of-the-art facilities is for the Labour Government, but decisions to close existing, much loved, cottage hospitals are taken locally&mdash;there is no interference from the Government on that. That is highly selective localism, based on saying &quot;Centralise the good news, decentralise the bad news.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/8">The truth, of course, is that the whole programme is being driven from the centre. The chief executive of the NHS announces that there will be reconfigurations&mdash;there is no question of local areas deciding&mdash;and strategic health authorities are then required to apply pressure on local PCTs to force change. The funding comes from Whitehall, where the power lies in our over-centralised health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/9">What has been happening over the past 12 months? We know of at least 16 community hospitals that have closed and, as we heard from the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness, there are reports of a total of 140 being under threat or having already closed. That is a bleak picture.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/10">It is worth restating the case for community hospitals, lest we forget just how important they are. They provide care close to people's homes and the Government seem to support that vision. They provide an essential safety valve for acute hospitals to keep bed-blocking to a minimum. They gain particular value in areas with large elderly populations by offering rehabilitation, general medical care and respite to relieve carers. They offer end-of-life care, which my own family has experienced, and enjoy low infection rates for MRSA, Clostridium difficile and other infections. They are critical in rural areas where public transport is generally poor for people who must get to more remote general hospitals. It also seems to make sense in rural areas to concentrate professionals together rather than compelling them to travel long distances by car from house to house to deliver care in people's homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1514" name="Colin Breed">My hon. Friend the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed)</phrase> made the critical point that if a community hospital is closed, the NHS loses the active support of the local community. Local leagues of friends raise a lot of money, but they do not campaign to raise money for large, acute PFI hospitals. We squander that support at our peril.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/12">Much has been said about the lack of genuine consultation when proposals are put forward for closure of community hospitals. Too often, local people are left with the sense that the process is a total sham. My plea today is for the Government to listen to what people are saying throughout the land. We value our local community facilities and want to retain them. We should have genuine local decisions on our local health services and genuine local accountability.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/13">I want to end on what is hopefully a more positive note. When the Secretary of State announced the&pound;750 million fund for new community hospitals last July, she mentioned an exciting new development at Wells-next-the-Sea in north Norfolk. There, a small community hospital that was faced with closure was saved when a dynamic group of local campaigners developed a plan for the creation of a new community charitable trust to take it over. That has now happened with the support of the Community Hospitals Association, and particularly Helen Tucker&mdash;I am pleased that she is here to listen to this debate. The trust provides services free to NHS patients and is developing a remarkable array of clinics, diagnostic work and physiotherapy&mdash;far more than was on offer when the hospital was run by the PCT. Out of a crisis, something positive and innovative is happening. I hope that that vision survives the dire financial situation in Norfolk, because there is a real risk that it will not.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.3/14">The Liberal Democrats strongly support the development of such public benefit organisations and diversity of provision. They can play a positive role in the future of our health service. However, this debate must be a warning to the Government. We are at risk of losing valued local facilities because of short-term financial pressure and crises. We must not let that happen. If it does, the Government will be guilty of deceit on the British people. My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall said that the last Government lost power in large part because of their record on public services and what was happening around the country. The same could happen to this Government. These services are too precious to lose and the Government must listen to what people are saying.</p>

	<p pid="b.223.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is an important debate, and timely given that today a large number of people are travelling to Westminster to campaign in support of local health care facilities. I congratulate him also on his exceptional work with CHANT. Members from all parties have been impressed by that organisation and by what it has managed to achieve in a short period.</p>
	<p pid="b.223.0/2">We have had a constructive debate so far. It has been one of the more consensual debates in which I have had the privilege of taking part, the only discordant note being set typically by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase>, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats. I gently remind him of our manifesto commitments on funding over the past three general elections. If he were to revisit the Conservative party's manifesto on funding, he might benefit.</p>

	<p pid="b.224.1/1">Miss Begg, you would count me out of order if I were to discuss the patient's passport. All I say is that over three general elections, we have pledged to match Labour's funding. That was the point I hoped to make in order to benefit the hon. Member for North Norfolk.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/2">On Friday I had the privilege of being granted an audience with the new chief executive and chairman of Wiltshire primary care trust. It is important to note what primary care trusts are, because in the current climate I am afraid that despite what they might feel about themselves, they often act as ectopic parts of the Department of Health. It is unfair of us to lay into primary care trusts and their staff, and to pin on them the blame that rests with Ministers. We have had a consensual debate up to now, but I shall destroy the consensus by trying to pin the blame for the closures&mdash;about which I feel strongly&mdash;on the Minister and not on the primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/3">The Minister knows well that there are four community hospitals in my constituency. One has closed, and the other three are threatened with closure. A decision on them will be made on <phrase class="date" code="">30 January</phrase>, and in addition it is likely that the mental health and maternity units in my constituency will also close on the same day. The issue is of profound importance to my constituents, and they are distraught that their hard work and effort to inform the debate has been ignored by those who are empowered with making decisions about the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-30">30 November 2001</phrase>, during one of the first debates in which I took part in the House, the current Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, then a Minister in the Department of Health, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/5" class="indent">&quot;There are no plans to close the hospitals that I have mentioned. They have served the hon. Gentleman's constituents well for many years and are a valuable local component of the NHS in west Wiltshire. On the contrary, the local West Wiltshire primary care trust, which is now responsible for the running of the hospitals, is strongly committed to their future, and is seeking further to develop the services that the hospitals provide.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-30">30 November 2001</phrase>; Vol. 375, c. 1293.]</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/6">My word, things have changed, have they not?</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/7">What has happened in the intervening period? There has been extraordinary pressure from Ministers to sort out financial deficits. Jobs depend on it at the end of the day, and as the Secretary of State for Health has made clear, her job depends on it. That is what has happened between the remarks that the then Minister of State for Health made in 2001 and now, when all community hospitals in my constituency face likely closure.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/8">Before shutting the hospitals we must engage in consultation that will tick a box. Indeed, principle three of the NHS plan says:</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The NHS will shape its services around the needs and preferences of individual patients, their families and their carers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/10">Unfortunately, in many parts of the country the principle has been little short of a charade. It does none of us any good to be seen to be associated with such exercises. They engender in the public a culture of cynicism; politicians encourage the public to take part in consultation, but when decisions are made there is no obvious link between them and the public's input. I fear that that is true in my constituency and in many throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/11">I like to be fair and to give the Government their due when I can, and they have used many fine words about localising health care. In January 2006, &quot;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say: A New Direction for Community Health Services&quot; made some fine statements. They have been touched upon already but bear quoting verbatim. They refer to much thinking in the Departmentof Health, if not to what is happening locally. Paragraph 6.42 says that</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/12" class="indent">&quot;community facilities should not be lost in response to short-term budgetary pressures&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/13">and paragraph 6.43 says that</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/14" class="indent">&quot;PCTs taking current decisions about the future of community hospitals will be required to demonstrate to their SHA that they have consulted locally and have considered options such as developing new pathways, new partnerships and new ownership possibilities,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/15">to which I think the hon. Member for North Norfolk referred.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/16">The Community Hospitals Association points out, however, that on the ground, 80-odd community hospitals face the axe. That is not for want of support for the Labour Government, because the left-leaning think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research only 10 days ago produced a report, &quot;The Future Hospital: The Progressive Case for Change&quot;, which appeared to support community hospitals. The Care Services Improvement Partnership, in which the Department of Health is a partner, appears to agree, according to the partnership's lavish website.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/17">The Government have said that community hospitals should not close for short-term financial expediency, but that is precisely what has happened. We know, because closures correlate largely with areas in deficit, and those areas are disproportionately Conservative and Liberal Democrat seats. They have suffered badly from the Government's rejigging of the funding formula and from their removal of end-of-year arbitrage. However, Ministers cling desperately to the ludicrous notion that somehow, health care managers gravitate towards constituencies with Liberal Democrat or Conservative Members of Parliament. That is at least the logical extension of the Secretary of State's argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/18">The Secretary of State appears to have washed her hands of the problem. However, &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power Within the NHS: Securing Delivery&quot; states:</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/19" class="indent">&quot;PCTs will be accountable...to the Secretary of State through Strategic Health Authorities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/20">Apparently it means that there is accountability upwards but no responsibility downwards, which is a rather despotic state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/21">Let us explode some myths. First, on the cost of community hospitals, it costs &pound;2,500 a week to keep a patient in an acute hospital, and about &pound;900 a week to keep someone in a community hospital. When one achieves the right case mix, community hospitals are cost-effective. Secondly, staff have not been discussed, apart from by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>. He was right to say that consultants may spend a lot of time travelling between hospitals, and that it is dead time. I have been to Berkeley hospital, and it was clear from speaking to doctors there that they love it and that they are energised by practising in community hospitals. I am not convinced that it is all down time; they put in a lot more than is accounted for.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/22">Many people who work in community hospitals would work nowhere else. There is a myth that, somehow, nurses will be redeployed in the community after the closure of a hospital. However, I know many people who work in community hospitals. They are there for special reasons and they are special people. When we close community hospitals, I suspect that many such people will be lost to the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/23">Will the Minister update us on the situation regarding unbundling the tariff? It is vital to the future of community health services, and to community hospitals in particular. What stage has he reached with facilitating changing patterns in community hospital ownership? We have a moral responsibility to understand that although the NHS has owned such hospitals since 1948, they are nevertheless a part of the community. They were often given over by communities, and they are undoubtedly supported all the way along the line by leagues of friends and by others.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/24">Will the Minister also update us on the estate impairment charge, which is an accounting trick? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">My right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> raised that issue in November 2005, and he was right to do so, but we do not seem to be any further forward. Will the Minister comment on the content of new generation community hospitals? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">My hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> inquired about that in November 2005 and got an unsatisfactory response; it would be nice to have an update on it. Will the Minister also describe how the capital fund of &pound;750 million, which was announced for new generation community hospitals, will be deployed? We should know that right now.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/25">This is a bad news story, and I hope that at the end of the day the Minister will be able to pull a few irons from the fire. Will he please listen to local communities? Their views are simply not in doubt. We need a halt to the wholesale closures that are happening for reasons of short-term financial expediency, and which do not take into account the proper design of community health care facilities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16b.230.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" speakername="Frank Cook" colnum="230"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070116/halltext/70116h0005.htm#07011648000499">
	<p pid="b.230.1/1">First of all, Miss Begg, may I ask you to convey my thanks to Mr. Speaker for permitting me the opportunity to raise this issue in the Chamber this morning? On countless occasions, I have occupied the Chair that you occupy now, Miss Begg, as Deputy Speaker here, but this is only the second time that I have availed myself of the opportunity to raise an issue from the Floor. In doing so, I am rather pleased and relieved that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1840" name="Dari Taylor">my hon. Friends the Members for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor)</phrase> and for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright) are in attendance. Hartlepool is my home town. I managed to escape the rope&mdash;I do not know whether he will, but I wish him well. However, I thought that one or two other Members might have attended because although the issues I am raising relate directly to that area in the north-east, I shall make some comments on the general reorganisation of the health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/2">Perhaps the easiest way to achieve my aims this morning is to approach the matter historically&mdash;rather than hysterically, which I am afraid is how far too many comments have been made in the past, without true regard for the facts. I suppose that I have been concerned about the hospitals involved ever since Frank Harsent was rejected as director, which goes back some years. We had some very troublesome exchanges when trying to mollify the acrimony between my home town of Hartlepool and my adopted town of Stockton. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South will remember some of those episodes with tinges of regret, as do I.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/3">The aspect of the saga that concerns us now, however, really started with a phone call that I received when in the USA in the early months of 2004 from Sue Coward who told me that during the by-election, in which my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool was thankfully elected, voters were being terrified by claims from the hyenas of the political savannah&mdash;the Liberal Democrats&mdash;that Hartlepool general hospital was under threat of closure. That was a downright lie, and they knew it, but as ever that did not stop them propagating inaccuracies.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/4">I was so concerned that I phoned the chairman of the primary care trust, the leader of Stockton borough council and my contacts in Hartlepool and alerted them to it. That resulted in the Home Secretary, who was then a Health Minister, and the Prime Minister, issuing statements saying that Hartlepool general hospital was not under threat, which of course was true. Nevertheless, that campaign went ahead, but my hon. Friend won the day and the Liberal Democrats were discredited by their false accusations.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/5">The outcome was that the Tees review conducted by Ken Jerrold under the chairmanship of Tony Waites was put on the shelf and almost allowed to gather dust. Professor Ara Darzi&mdash;a noble man, and I will not hear a word said against him&mdash;was given the task of making sense of it all. His remit was that first he should read Ken Jerrold's review and then recommend measures to preserve Hartlepool general hospital. That was an astonishing instruction bearing in mind the fact that the hospital was not under threat of closure.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/6">Professor Darzi set about his work with a will, and quickly produced a report that could have been submitted, but it was then thought by elders and betters that it might be a bit embarrassing if it was announced before the general election. At that time, my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool was already sitting with us on the green Benches and contributing effectively to our debates. There was a worry, though, because a general election was in the offing, so it was thought that it would be better if the report was published afterwards, but the later publication had to be justified, so the idea was proposed by a gentleman whom I shall not name to extend the terms of reference to include the James Cook university hospital and the Friarage hospital in Northallerton.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/7">That was done, and finally we got the Darzi report, which was a magnificent piece of almost critical path analysis&mdash;it had arrows going left and right, and Departments going here, there, up, down and all around. It was beautiful, and to the uninitiated it looked convincing, but to the medical profession I am afraid that it was an outright disaster. Many have said, that and many have acted on it: we lost an outstanding orthopaedic surgeon called Mr. Miller, who moved to Liverpool because he was unhappy with what was happening&mdash;although he still comes back to Teesside to get his hair cut. We lost an eminent paediatrician and gynaecologist who went south. I happen to know also that an anaesthetist with 30 years' service at the hospital is looking to finish his professional career elsewhere. They are all excellent senior men disturbed by the Darzi proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/8">Staff at the James Cook university hospital south of the river were not disturbed at all. In professional, collective unanimity they said, &quot;It's not going to happen and we're not going to participate&quot;. The Darzi report as it was first presented was doomed to failure from the outset, because the medical profession would not have it. Now we are left with a residual concern manifesting itself in the pages of Hartlepool's local press. It seems that there is still a fear that the hospital is under threat of closure. I state quite boldly that it is not under threat of closure and never has been, and&mdash;as people will hear from the words that I shall utter this morning, if I am allowed&mdash;it never will be until such time as it collapses into a pile of dust.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/9">Agencies in Hartlepool are seeking to acquire the maternity and paediatric services at the University hospital of North Tees, which has an excellent maternity and paediatrics unit. It is a centre of excellence&mdash;so much so, in fact, that it was opened six and a half years ago by none other than my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, accompanied by his good lady, Mrs. Blair. North Tees's record is superb&mdash;indeed, it is second to none&mdash;because right next door, in the same building, are the emergency surgical services that are necessary to take care of cases that might go awry, when mother nature gets awkward. Hartlepool wants to take that unit, yet it does not have the emergency surgical services. There seems to be a hiccup&mdash;is that the word?&mdash;or at least a glitch in the logic being applied. To take a unit on which millions of pounds have been spent and convey it 12 or 13 miles to the north-east, where it will not have immediately to hand the necessary back-up services that it has at North Tees, is frankly madness.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/10">If we consider the proposal in terms of demography, it is even screwier. Hartlepool is my home town, and my family still live down there. According to the figures for 2005, the population of Hartlepool is 90,000. That is a lot of people&mdash;or at least a lot of Hartlepudlians. They are formidable one by one, so 90,000 of them can be a real problem, although I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool realises that. However, the same figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show that the population of Stockton is 186,700. In other words, it is more than twice the size. Yet we seek to remove the maternity unit from the larger area and take it to the smaller one. That is another glitch in logic.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/11">My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South and I have also recognised already that because of the distances involved many of her constituents will not naturally and instinctively make a beeline for Hartlepool. There is nothing wrong with Hartlepool, by the way&mdash;I want to survive the rope as well. For some of those constituents, Hartlepool is a distance of between 19 and 21 miles. They will make a beeline for the James Cook university hospital of South Tees, south of the river. I have known the Minister for many years and hold her in high regard. She is an intelligent lady and will not need me to tell her that the James Cook university hospital is already in serious trouble, with saturation of medical cases, and has overspent to a mega degree. It is a wonderful hospital, by the way. It has saved my life a couple of times&mdash;much to the consternation of some of my Labour party colleagues&mdash;and I hope that it will continue to do so, but it has hugely overspent. However, the people from Stockton, South will make a beeline there simply because it is 15 miles closer than the hospital in Hartlepool</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/12">The whole idea of even considering moving the maternity and paediatrics unit from Stockton to Hartlepool beggars belief. I just cannot understand it. Hartlepool has never been under threat and it never will be. Why will it not be under threat? Let me try to put the matter in military terms. When our young men and women are in a firefight and get wounded in a foxhole, their first port of call is the person next to them&mdash;the person sharing the foxhole&mdash;or they shout for a stretcher bearer. That person comes along with their casualty pack, and might give the victim a shot of morphine, put on a tourniquet and bandage the wound up. That is primary health care.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/13">The next step is to get the casualty removed from there to secondary care, which is usually a mobile army surgical hospital. As a matter of fact, I am going to visit one of those units tonight, here in London. It is a unit that has been used more than any other unit throughout the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns. Those units perform wonderfully well and I pay all tribute to them. The casualty is moved from primary care to secondary, to the MASH. Having received attention there&mdash;successfully, I hope&mdash;they undergo CASEVAC, or casualty evacuation, to a tertiary hospital, probably in Frankfurt or in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/14">The health service is having to adjust its structure to a similar pattern&mdash;not identical, but similar. We are developing primary provision, through our paramedics in ambulances, our nurse practitioners in GPs' surgeries, and GPs themselves. That must be the pattern throughout the country. The GPs, the nurse practitioners and the paramedics in the ambulances in the north-east perform so well already and will perform even better as we develop the service to its full potential. I suggest that they will provide the primary care and that Hartlepool university hospital will provide secondary care, as will the North Tees university hospital in Stockton.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/15">However, our constituents who need more specialised attention currently have to go south of the river to the James Cook university hospital, increasing the congestion there, up to the Royal Victoria infirmary in Newcastle or down to Jimmy's in Leeds. Those two hospitals will provide secondary care, so what are we going to do for tertiary care? Are we going to depend on the James Cook, the RVI or Jimmy's too? That does not make sense at all. I suggest, as I have suggested many times before, that in seven, eight or nine years' time, regardless of what happens tomorrow, we are going to need a tertiary hospital north of the River Tees to take care of the larger communities of Stockton and Hartlepool. There is no doubt in my mind about that. Mark my words: it will happen because it has to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/16">I have been talking for about the right amount of time, but I will take a couple of minutes more if I may. I would ask the Minister to take the advice that I offer to her Secretary of State. Tell her to ignore the dust storm that has raged for so long as a result of the Darzi report and to let that dust settle. If it settles in a manner that buries the report&mdash;without burying Professor Darzi, of course&mdash;I will be a happier man and the world will be a safer place. However, if the dust does not bury the report, I urge the Minister to advise the Secretary of State to put the issue of maternity and paediatrics on the highest shelf, out of anybody's reach, and forget it. She should then take down the Tees review, so ably completed by Ken Jerrold, and praised so highly by every medical authority that read it that it took my breath away. She should look into that report to see what we can put in place to resolve the problem, if it still exists. I do not think that there is a problem; we should leave the issue of maternity and paediatrics as it is. Hartlepool has a pretty good maternity and paediatric service anyway; why would we want to add to it when we have only half the number of people?</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/17">Hartlepool's advocates will say, &quot;Hartlepool is not just Hartlepool&mdash;it includes Blackhall, Easington and Horden,&quot; but Stockton has similar surrounding areas. Not only that, but the town has developed enormously to the south since the 2005 figures were published. It is now developing along the A66 towards Darlington. Its population is far larger than 186,700.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/18">The Secretary of State should look carefully at the Tees review, which is much more sensible. Ken Jerrold was in place for years. Professor Darzi is a very bright man, but he had little time and a bowdlerised remit that had been changed for him. That was not his fault; other people changed it&mdash;I do not want to get too heavily into that, but it was not very wise.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/19">The Tees review is valuable because its first priority is patient care and community need, which is where we should have started in the first place. Sadly, however, the Lib Dems changed the argument right from the start, saying that there was a threat that Hartlepool hospital would close. It has not and will not, regardless of what the hyenas say.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/20">All Members involved have received a letter from Peter Carr of the strategic health authority, which states:</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/21" class="indent">&quot;You are aware that the Secretary of State for Health, in August 2006, asked the Independent Reconfiguration Panel to undertake a review of maternity and paediatric services in Teesside following representations made by local authority overview and scrutiny committees.....there is a possibility that the results of the Panel's work and its advice to the Secretary of State could be published at the end of this week.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/22">I wonder whether we will hear something to that effect later in this debate. The letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/23" class="indent">&quot;Whatever the Panel advice...it would be helpful for David Flory and I to meet with you to discuss the outcome.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/24">I have arranged for representatives of the strategic health authority to come to my office first thing on Friday morning, at 9 o'clock or half-past 9, to discuss the issues. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South has agreed to be there, and I invite my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool to join us, although the authority would meet him separately anyway.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.1/25">If the issue is not resolved in the sensible way, the electoral consequences in Stockton will make those in Hartlepool seem like nothing. Frankly, Stockton's reaction will be indescribable. There are other things to be said, but I leave that to my hon. Friends. I thank the hon. Members for listening.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16b.234.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="234"  time="011:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070116/halltext/70116h0005.htm#07011648000500">
	<p pid="b.234.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" name="Frank Cook">my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook)</phrase> on securing this debate. A couple of weeks before Christmas, I secured an Adjournment debate in the House on maternity and paediatric services in Hartlepool. During that, <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="MultipleMatch">my hon. Friends the Members for Stockton, North and for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor)</phrase> and I had a number of clashes, and I look forward to something similar today.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/2">I do not want to talk about Professor Darzi and the independent reconfiguration panel's look at maternity and paediatric services. They carried out a series of consultations. I was interviewed twice, and I understand that they provided their report to the Secretary of State for Health on <phrase class="date" code="">18 December</phrase>. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North mentioned, it is anticipated that the report will be published some time this week.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/3">In Hartlepool on Thursday, there was a meeting attended by members of the public and the chairman and chief executive of the North Tees and Hartlepool NHS trust, during which the first phase of Darzi's recommendations was discussed. Patients and clinicians universally recognise that the first phase has been an immense success since it was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>, and there is no reason to suggest that all Darzi's recommendations would not have similar success. I shall come to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/4">I want to talk about the provision of health services in general. In all parts of the country, health services should be based on clinical safety, best practice and specific local considerations and wishes. The residents of Teesside deserve no different from those in other parts of the country; indeed, there is a strong argument that because of our legacy, the people in our area deserve better than average.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/5">People who design health services for my area need to be aware of, and take into account, the specific geographical, historic and demographic factors that demonstrate that in Teesside one size of health service provision does not fit all. On the Order Paper, thetitle of this debate is &quot;Provision of health services on Teesside&quot;. However, in many geographical, administrative and&mdash;most crucially&mdash;psychological respects, Teesside does not exist. Although the towns of Hartlepool, Stockton, Middlesbrough, Darlington and Redcar and Cleveland occupy a relatively small geographical area, they are very distinct and have proud and separate identities of their own.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/6">It is significant that in many areas there was very little public support for Cleveland county council. Since its abolition and the establishment of unitary authorities in 1996, coupled with the election of a Labour Government the following year, all areas in the sub-region have improved. Co-operation takes place between the local authorities, but autonomy remains important because of local considerations. Centralisation has been avoided&mdash;perhaps health bureaucrats could take heed of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/7">Hartlepool has a particularly distinct identity, although I would say that. It is compact and separated geographically from other parts of what is known as Teesside. In addition, in the past few decades population growth and migrant flows into the town have tended to come from south Durham&mdash;the former pit villages of Blackhall, Horden and Easington and the new town of Peterlee&mdash;rather than from the Teesside area.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/8">There are many family ties between Hartlepool and south Durham, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North said, the university hospital of Hartlepool not only serves Hartlepool's population of 90,000 but is the major hospital centre for the 50,000 or so people from Easington and south Durham. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1562" name="John Cummings">My hon. Friend the Member for Easington (John Cummings)</phrase> could not be here today&mdash;he is performing a duty similar to yours, Miss Begg, in another part of the House&mdash;but he suggested that I mention those issues on behalf of his constituents. When we have taken those issues into account, we need to consider taking health provision northwards, not only into my town but into Easington. That applies particularly in the new era of &quot;choose and book&quot;, in which family ties, which help patients who have had hospital treatment to recover, will be a major consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/9">It is unfortunate for health bureaucrats that population areas do not come in neat bundles subject to clear administrative boundaries. Professor Darzi rejected an option that I shall mention in a moment, but now that it appears that all of Darzi's recommendations are up for grabs, I will say that there is a strong case for reconfiguring NHS trusts in the area to reflect local health considerations, with greater ties between Hartlepool and Easington, to tackle the acute health inequalities. I suspect that more people in my constituency would feel at ease with and have greater loyalty to a Hartlepool and South Durham NHS trust than to the current arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/10">That distinctiveness and sense of geographical separation is heightened by the transport infrastructure in the area. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North said, Hartlepool and Stockton are about nine or 10 miles apart. That does not seem far, but it is actually much further than it appears. Public transport between the two towns and between the two hospitals is poor. In many ways, the A689 and A19 cut off Hartlepool from the rest of the Tees area, and the A19 is frequently crowded. If plans for economic expansion in the sub-region come to fruition, particularly the growth of Wynyard, the road&mdash;in particular the stretch between Wolviston and Norton&mdash;will become even more congested. That will not help achieve the objective of local and accessible health services.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.0/11">In addition, car ownership in my constituency is about half the national average, which causes problems for people travelling to hospitals or visiting relatives and friends. I fully acknowledge that there are similar rates of car ownership in neighbouring constituencies. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South told me last week that 40 per cent. of households in her constituency do not have access to a car. That makes my point that it is difficult for people throughout the Tees area to access hospital services in other towns. A distance of some nine or 10 miles does not seem far, but somebody who has to attend an appointment in a hospital outside their town, whether it be Hartlepool or Stockton, will find the journey time-consuming and stressful. It may require two or three bus changes. Some people sneer at that, but for some of my constituents an appointment at North Tees hospital might as well be on the moon.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16b.240.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1840" speakername="Dari Taylor" colnum="240"  time="011:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070116/halltext/70116h0006.htm#07011648000507">
	<p pid="b.240.0/1">It is always a pleasure to participate in a debate chaired by you, Miss Begg. I want to say a big thank you to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" name="Frank Cook">my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook)</phrase> for securing time for us to debate the Ara Darzi report.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/2">My contribution will specifically and solely reference the Ara Darzi report. It will reference the concern that we all share that high-quality medical services should be delivered to our constituents. There has been an overwhelming amount of comment and angry debate about splitting the function of paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology in North Tees university hospital so that acute services are performed by one hospital and elective services by another, and about the claim in the Ara Darzi report that an excellent department can retain its excellence, even if it is transferred to another hospital. Those views are both heartily contested, including by me.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/3">No consultant from paediatrics, gynaecology or maternity was ever consulted about the spilt in function. I should have thought that if a split were thought appropriate, the first people who would be spoken to would be the experts who deliver the service. Equally, there seems to be no understanding in the report of the fact that it takes time to build up a medical department of the excellence of these three departments. There is a need to attract competent, complementary staff who work together and respect and trust each other. That takes a long time. It has taken North Tees university hospital a long time to attract such competence and to gain the universal respect of the northern region. That cannot simply be transferred. It most certainly cannot be transferred when no medical consultant has been involved in splitting up the department.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/4">It is not merely about people, but about the technical equipment that the hospital has secured over time with an expenditure of more than &pound;7 million&mdash;it is probably nearer &pound;10 million. That has ensured that the department has up-to-date, first-rate equipment of the best standard that can deliver the best to the people who require those services&mdash;my constituents and those of my colleagues. Such activity takes place over time, not instantly. There seems to be a belief that sheer will-power and a removal van can ensure the establishment of excellent departments of paediatrics, gynaecology and maternity in Hartlepool, but it would take longer and require more persuasive activity. It would also require further expenditure&mdash;probably of &pound;10 million&mdash;to secure it. Ara Darzi's plan was wrong in its conception because he did not ask the people who needed to be asked whether the split in function was feasible.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/5">I am keen to tell the House that the same professor did a report on Darlington and Bishop Auckland hospitals. His recommendation was clear. The outcome of the inquiry was that elective and acute treatment should be kept together. What is so seriously different about North Tees university hospital and Hartlepool university hospital? My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North put his finger on it: the professor was given the mandate to save the hospital. It was a nonsensical mandate. There never was a threat&mdash;&mdash;it was a nonsense put about by the Liberal Democrats during <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the by-election won by my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase>. It persisted because local people passionately want to keep what they have and do not want it closed. Professor Ara Darzi responded to that nonsensical threat, which was whipped up in the press by the Liberal Democrats&mdash;and shame on them for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/6">My concern today is to secure the best medical services for the people that we serve. If they have to travel for half an hour or even two hours for the best, then so be it. As politicians, we should have the guts and the courage to say so. It is time that we acknowledged the fact that there is not always enough money instantly to produce the best. For me, the absolute fact is that we have the best in North Tees university hospital, and I am not prepared to let it be split in two when such a split does not make sense.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/7">I bring to the attention of the House the fact that one clinician has resigned and that others are considering their position. People are saying that the situation is insecure and that they are not prepared to accept it. They are also not prepared to do again the phenomenal work that it took to develop the department in the first place, as they will have to retrace their steps entirely if it is to be reproduced at Hartlepool university hospital. I do not accept that the argument is about the miserably low level of health achievement universal in the north-east, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool spoke. I am not prepared to go down that route.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/8">We should understand exactly what Ara Darzi's report will mean for three departments of excellence. The paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology consultants said that they have a very high level of emergency work. They all believe that they should not be moved to an elective site. Are we serious in not taking the experts' advice when designing appropriate medical services? If so, our constituents will look upon us with disdain. The obstetric consultants emphasised that theirs is essentially an emergency service. They said that it makes no clinical sense for the department to be moved to an elective site, as they usually deal with emergencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/9">The paediatric consultants state that, if paediatric services are separated from the acute site, it will require a significant increase in investment to provide round-the-clock cover for paediatric surgery and trauma. A doubling of the staff employed in both hospitals will have to be accepted. They also say that both sites will need a paediatric anaesthetist, and they are scarce. The consultants say that it is difficult to get staff appropriately trained to deal with trauma and emergency operations and that total understanding and competence is required of all consultants and surgeons performing such operations. They also say that running costs will be significantly greater.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/10">The consultants gave me examples. They said that the vast majority of women giving birth need consultant care. Although the majority of women deliver babies without complications, that is not synonymous with doctors having no input. They also say that there will be a high transfer rate between the midwife-led units at North Tees hospital and consultant-led units at Hartlepool hospital. On paediatrics, they said that many decisions can be made only by specialists&mdash;for instance, a child suffering from stomach pains may have appendicitis, but paediatric emergency services with surgery competence will be needed if a misdiagnosis is made.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/11">It does not need an Einstein to understand what is required. It is not about ensuring an easy transfer between two hospitals; the journey on the main roads between Hartlepool and North Tees hospitals from8 am to 9.30 am and from 4.30 pm to 6 pm is seriously difficult. A misdiagnosis might not be problematic, but such a journey might have to be accommodated. A child who had received emergency surgery for appendicitis in North Tees hospital would have to be transferred to Hartlepool for post-operative care. We must understand the problem. For example, a mother with three children may have to travel by bus to see one of them in hospital. Will she be able to see her child in Hartlepool as easily as in North Tees university hospital? I do not think so. We need to consider such services in the round.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/12">The gynaecology service makes the same point. Someone with stomach pains could be suffering an ectopic pregnancy; that could be highly problematic. The last thing we should do is to split acute and elective surgery, as it would threaten peoples' lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/13">Of course, it is not only the consultants who would have problems. The overstretched ambulance service told me that, if it made the wrong diagnosis, the patient could be taken to the wrong hospital. Should the ambulance go to Hartlepool or North Tees? The wrong decision could have a serious outcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/14">With the best grace that I can muster, I have to say that the Ara Darzi report, which splits the functions and suggests that we can transfer excellence effortlessly, is wrong. I am delighted that the independent reconfiguration panel has reconsidered it. I must tell the Minister and my hon. Friends that, if I am wrong and if I have misunderstood the information and evidence that I have been given, I will say so. I will accept the panel's conclusions on how best to deliver the best medicine for the people whom I represent. I believe that I am honour-bound to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/15">My hon. Friends mentioned travelling. I have a large population in the south of my constituency&mdash;in Parkfield, Thornaby, Yarm, Hilton and Kirklevington. It probably takes people 20 minutes to get to Middlesbrough by bus, and it would take at least an hour and a half to get to Hartlepool. That is the operational distance. If it takes people 20 minutes to get to Middlesbrough, take it from me, they will not go to Hartlepool. If they do not travel to Hartlepool, we will have a split in elective and acute services and Hartlepool will find itself without sufficient throughput of patients. My people will not go to Hartlepool, and I am not making that up; it is a fact. The throughput will not be sufficient and that department will be vulnerable before it begins its life. I ask for someone to take that on board. It is not just because of the hour and a half journey time or because my constituents have to travel south before they travel north; people face two or three bus changes and may have buggies or young children. In addition, the cost will be three times that to go to North Tees hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/16">The conclusions regarding this issue are wrong because the report was set up with the wrong purpose: to save Hartlepool university hospital. There would never be a threat to that hospital. I would stand on the line protesting with my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool if I ever thought that there was a threat. The conclusions are wrong and I hope that I have made sufficient sense and that what I have said is taken on board&mdash;I said the same when giving evidence to the independent reconfiguration panel.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.0/17">I end where I began by making the same statement very quickly all over again. My concern is for the delivery of competent medical services to the people whom I represent. That is what I shall fight for and that is what I believe should be delivered. I am not arguing for North Tees to have what Hartlepool does not. I am simply saying to hon. Members that the division suggested by Ara Darzi is plain wrong and that all the evidence supplied by the consultants would support that statement.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16b.244.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="244"  time="012:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070116/halltext/70116h0007.htm#07011648000510">
	<p pid="b.244.2/1">They did.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.2/2">I will concentrate on the generic features that an issue such as this throws up. I am a veteran of such issues. My local hospitals were reconfigured in 2002 when the Shields report, not the Darzi report, was implemented. The accident and emergency, paediatrics and maternity departments were moved, and there were marches, meetings, protests and gigantic petitions. I even had a hospital campaigner backed by Martin Bell stand against me in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.2/3">Today's events in Westminster Hall suggest that my experience in 2002 is now replicated across the land. The problems associated with this issue are a product of certain pressures and policies. The pressures are relatively well established: the working time directive, the new tougher financial regime, the drive to get hospital deficits down, changes in the hours for junior doctors, and the higher training needs specified by the royal colleges. The other factor is policies and there are some good policies based on the need to have centres for excellence, the drive to improve quality and the need to have services brought closer to the patient at a community level.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.2/4">The problem is dealing with the pressures and the policies while getting the balance right. There are a variety of routes that can be followed to balance out the pressures and the policies. One mantra recited by the Government is to leave it to local decision making, which, we all understand, really means decisions by a local quango&mdash;a locally based set of appointees. Following a consultation that is often completely ignored and, in many cases, virtually an insult, quangos make their decision with all the aplomb and indifference of colonial governance. That is not genuine local decision making, but, time and time again, it is what the Government call local decision making&mdash;I have heard it said already this morning. In fact, decisions are not made by local people, but by local appointees who ultimately owe their careers to the health service, not to responding to what local people ask of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.2/5">Answer No. 2 when dealing with the balancing out of pressures and policies is to have a report and implement it, whether it is a Jerrold report, Darzi report or, as was relevant to my constituency, a Shields report. The deficiency in that is that such reports tend disproportionately to reflect the interests of medical communities, which are more worried about litigation and the advice from the royal colleges than issues of access. The report carried out in my neck of the woods on configuring services contained a clause that suggested a configure services in a particular way that created enormous transport problems&mdash;there were not the roads or rail or bus services to support it. The report went on to say that that was not an issue for an NHS report. In other words, how people get to the services was outwith its concern. The same is true of many reports that I have seen that have attempted to reconfigure services: the transport issues are set aside for somebody else to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.2/6">Reports take time and are normally a long time in the cooking before they see the light of day. During that time, the world changes and the advice changes&mdash;&mdash;even advice from the royal colleges. Also, as has been alluded to today, they tend to be nipped in the bud by political tampering and do not turn out to be the honest pieces of work they ought to be. That is also unsatisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.2/7">Answer No. 3, which was referred to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1840" name="Dari Taylor">the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor)</phrase>, is to refer the issue to the independent reconfiguration panel, which, in principle, is a good idea. However, reference in most cases depends on the Secretary of State being compliant with it and, even when the report is done, it will not have the necessary coercive force.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.2/8">The solution that we all advocate is genuine local decision making, but that needs to be based on two distinct pillars. We need to have a clear view of the entitlements and what the people of Teesside require in terms of service and access to service. The hon. Member for Stockton, North referred to the fact that people did not start by considering what people needed, but rather the more problematic question of what the services are and how they might be configured. We should also be clear and honest about what the people of Teesside and the country are prepared to pay for through taxation, because every service comes with a price tag.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.2/9">We need more fairness and honesty from the Government on this issue. There are a range of concerns and three particularly affect Teesside, but they also affect most parts of the country. One issue is deficits, because they tend to affect how things turn out. There is no doubt that previous NHS methods of finance were sloppy and had broken down into a system of bailing each other out&mdash;a kind of financial pass-the-parcel. When the music stopped, and, clearly, it has now stopped, some trusts were left holding huge historic debts. Under new resource accountancy rules, that meant reduced revenue and led to a spiral of decline, added to which some trusts&mdash;I do not know what the situation is in Teesside&mdash;are saddled with substantial debts as a result of capital investment or private finance initiative schemes. Without fair funding, configuration cannot be done fairly and people will not be persuaded that clinical needs are the driving force. We have not got there yet and that is why these problems persist.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.2/10">The Government also need to be clear about moving care into the community. They cannot just talk about it; the funding and the service actually has to be out there. Community-based care cannot simply be an aspiration to justify closing existing facilities. There was a case in my constituency where the blood service was moved out of the hospital to a clinic. That was called &quot;moving it into the community&quot;. It was moved into a clinic in the far south of the constituency, so50 per cent. of my constituents now have further to go for a simple blood test. They would much prefer to have the service in the hospital, because it would be closer to the part of the community in which they live.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.2/11">It is crucial for Teesside that we have clarity on neonatal safety. We had a recent debate in the House on maternity services and I listened carefully to what the Secretary of State said. She began by praising small, midwife-led units. Later, she extolled the virtues of high-tech ones. When asked what would be the optimum size of a maternity unit and what evidence the Government had for any view that they might take, she dodged the question. I remember that she was pressed on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">the issue by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.2/12">I do not think there was any desire on the part of the Secretary of State to be mendacious, duplicitous or especially evasive in this context. She was talking about units being safe for different types of birth. Clearly, midwife-led units that are well run will be safe for unproblematic births; for more problematic or low-weight births, a more sophisticated unit will be required. What is required in a maternity unit has become extraordinarily vague. It would be helpful if the Government published the evidence on what is safe and for which type of unit and birth, and the standards required. They would thereby add the clarity that the debate needs. Unless the Government contribute more clarity to the process, what we are seeing today in Teesside will be replicated in other areas and heard about in debates throughout this Parliament.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16b.246.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" speakername="Tim Loughton" colnum="246"  time="012:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070116/halltext/70116h0007.htm#07011648000511">
	<p pid="b.246.0/1">I add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" name="Frank Cook">my congratulations to the hon. Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook)</phrase>. These debates have become a familiar scene. Ministers and shadow Ministers visit this Chamber fortnightly to deal with some part of the health service that is annoying hon. Members around the country. This debate has a particular sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu about it. It is round 2 of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the debate that the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> started on <phrase class="date" code="">11 December</phrase>, with the same protagonists from Hartlepool, Stockton, South and Stockton, North, although we have had perhaps rather less heated interjections from the hon. Gentleman this time. The time was extended from half an hour to one and a half hours and, with the added reference to the hyenas of the political savannah&mdash;the Liberal Democrats&mdash;I feel something of a bystander in all this.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.0/2">Hon. Members have spoken about the relative merits of James Cook university hospital in South Tees, the university hospitals of North Tees and of Hartlepool, the Darzi report and the Tees report by Ken Jerrold. I add my tributes to the very dedicated staff at all three hospitals, who must be bemused by the political to-ings and fro-ings that have gone on over too many years when they all want to do is to get on with their job of looking after their patients to the best of their ability. I have not visited any of those hospitals, but all the speeches made by the hon. Members representing the constituencies where they are based were eerily familiar.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.0/3">The hon. Member for Stockton, North talked about constant reviews. In my part of the world, we have had that, too. He spoke about reviews and their timing being to do with general elections. We had that in my part of the world in Sussex as well. He and other hon. Members talked about consultants voting with their feet and leaving, which is very worrying. We have that in our part of the world, too. He also made the bold claim that Hartlepool hospital is not under threat of closure and never will be. We used to think that about some of our hospitals in Sussex, too. Just two years ago, we were given cast-iron guarantees by the present Government that there would not be any more tampering or reconfiguration. Now, they are under the spotlight of reconfiguration, closure or downgrading after all, so my advice to the hon. Gentleman is not to hold his breath.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.0/4">We heard a familiar story about millions of pounds being lavished on new facilities at hospitals, only for it to be proposed that they be transferred elsewhere. The James Cook university hospital, which the hon. Gentleman referred to, is already in trouble with saturation and deficits. We, too, have hospitals like that, which will supposedly have to grow to take up the slack.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.0/5">The hon. Member for Hartlepool made similar comments, although obviously tailored rather more to his own constituency hospital in Hartlepool. He talked about demographics and mentioned the greater needs of the elderly population. I think he said that 15 per cent. of his constituents were over the age of 60. He has got it easy. In Worthing, in my constituency, 45 per cent. of the population are pensioners and 4.5 per cent. of that population are over the age of 85, with all the extra health requirements that the elderly population has. I am glad that he drew attention to that issue, because it is a case that we have made and that Ministers have not paid sufficient regard to on too many occasions.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.0/6">The hon. Gentleman spoke about congested roads. Again, we have it worse in Sussex, in the most densely populated part of the country. He spoke alarmingly, but rightly, about the poor public health figures. They are not down to poor hospitals or good hospitals but to the complete failure of the Government's public health policy. He gave shocking figures for the alarmingly increased chances of death from lung cancer in women under 50 in his constituency. He talked about 32,000 people signing a petition; some 300,000 people have signed petitions against reconfiguration in my county alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1840" name="Dari Taylor">The hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor)</phrase> concentrated on the Ara Darzi report and some of the inconsistencies between earlier reports that it threw up. That was all eerily similar to what is going on in the health service up and down the country. For North Tees and Hartlepool hospitals, I could easily substitute Worthing and Southlands hospitals and the Royal Sussex county hospital at Brighton, in my part of the world. Every Sussex hospital is under the spotlight. The difference is perhaps that in our part of the world Ministers do not join the demonstrations outside those hospitals against their downgrading. I suspect thereare problems elsewhere in other areas of the regionthat we are discussing. Tomorrow, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">the hon. Memberfor Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland(Dr. Kumar)</phrase> will talk about education funding in the same area.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.0/8">What is common to all these discussions is that we believe that any decisions about major reconfiguration should be based on three main things. First, they should be based on sound clinical practice that should improve the standard of health care for local communities, not on financial expedients. The Government need to come clean and admit that many of the decisions are being made on the latter basis. Secondly, they should take the local community with them if there is to be any credibility to Government claims about local decision making being of the utmost importance. The NHS is owned not by Ministers, NHS bureaucrats or even the staff but by the people and the patients. That is why the NHS is there. There should be genuine consultation of local people, the consultants and the clinical staff&mdash;to which the hon. Member for Stockton, South referred&mdash;not the sham, preconceived consultations that we have often seen.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.0/9">Thirdly, there is more to hospital services than bricks and mortar and places of treatment. This is about the quality of life, the effect on large employers, infrastructure and transport, convenience and incentives to business. Just yesterday in my town, Worthing, the chairman of the South East England Development Agency came to a press conference to say that he believes that the proposals for reconfiguration in Sussex will have a serious detrimental impact on investment in our region&mdash;the powerhouse of the United Kingdom economy&mdash;and will downgrade the quality of life. He went on the record and said that. There is much more to this argument than just short-term financial balancing of books.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.0/10">I could go into great detail about the problems with maternity services. A lot of this is about the vagueness of the proposals on which the decisions are being made. Does a maternity unit need to have 3,000 births to be sustainable and viable? In our part of the country, we are told that there must be at least 4,000 births, but Worthing hospital, for example, will have about 3,000. The largest maternity unit in Germany deals with only 3,000 births. If the reconfiguration proposals for our area go ahead and everything goes to Brighton, it will be the largest maternity unit in the whole of Europe, not just in this country. That cannot be good for patient care. Why does big always have to mean best? There is no evidence on which those decisions are being based that says that maternity departments of 3,000 or 2,500 or even 2,000 provide a lower quality of care, or pose a higher risk of mortality, to mothers and babies.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.0/11">Let us have genuine horses for courses. Let us have genuine local consultation and local decision making. Let us not have the divide and rule that is going on in the health service. We have seen it graphically this morning, with neighbouring Members from the same party arguing for different things. If it ain't bust, don't fix it, and if it really is down to short-term financial expedients, the Government should at least have the honesty to say so, so that we can have a transparent and honest debate. The Government are busy trying to avoid that.</p>

	<p pid="b.250.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. All my hon. Friends referred to the fact that their region has some of the most deprived health areas in England. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North touched on the growing population served by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the different trusts. My hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> highlighted some of the health problems that have arisen because of industrialisation and particularly because of contact with hazardous materials. It is very much part of the Government's policy to try to reduce health inequalities through a mixture of extra investment and new opportunities for NHS staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.1/2">Let me deal briefly with some of the issues around the current reconfiguration proposals. My hon. Friends clearly set out the background and history to some of the changes, and hon. Members have touched on the different reviews that have taken place, culminating in the Darzi review, which proposed a number of changes. Given the diversity of views and the changes in services that have been proposed, it is not necessarily surprising that the joint overview and scrutiny committees wish the issue to be referred to an independent scrutiny panel.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.1/3">Let me touch on our vision for maternity services, because it is important for a number of the issues that hon. Members raised. We want there to be three main drivers for the provision of maternity services: the maternity standard of the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services; our 2005 manifesto commitment to improving choice in maternity services; and the White Paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;. The White Paper emphasised my hon. Friends' point about the importance of getting services into the community, and they highlighted what happened previously, when there was a reliance on hospital services. The issue is how we ensure that we have good services in the community, and the hon. Member for Southport referred to the standard that we have set out, which, in a sense, pulls together the Government's vision for maternity services over the next 10 years. Women should have easy access to supportive, high-quality maternity services that are designed around their individual needs and those of their babies.</p>
	<p pid="b.250.1/4">All hon. Members said that it is important to consult clinicians, and I absolutely back that view, because it is important that we can do that. Following the review of maternity and paediatric services in Hartlepool and Teesside, two scrutiny bodies chose to refer the maternity and paediatric elements of the proposals to the Secretary of State. In response to the inquiry from my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Stockton, North, let me say that the report on the issue will be published on <phrase class="date" code="">19 January</phrase>. In view of that, it is not possible for me to comment further on the detailed points that have arisen, except to say that I agree that it is time that there was some certainty about services. The reviews have gone on for many years, and I am sure that local people and clinicians want that certainty.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16b.252.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="252"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070116/halltext/70116h0008.htm#07011648000519">
	<p pid="b.252.1/1">I think that everyone will be familiar with banks' charging system. I do not know whether the Minister has been subject to any penalty charges, but the fines are incurred when there is a lack of funds in the account to cover payments out, such as direct debits, bounced cheques and exceeding the overdraft limit. What may not be realised is that every year about one in four bank customers suffers penalty charges, that a single charge can be anything up to &pound;38&mdash;they average about &pound;30&mdash;and that the charges can be applied on every occasion when someone goes over the overdraft limit, for every cheque or direct debit at that point. Last year the top six high street banks therefore pulled in an estimated &pound;4.5 billion in such charges.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/2">I am raising the matter today because I believe that it is a major contributor to the UK's debt crisis and to social exclusion. Perhaps most important of all, those bank penalty charges are more than inconvenient and unfair&mdash;they are illegal. The fact that they continue to be levied in such large sums leads one to conclude that the Office of Fair Trading is failing and the Government are turning a blind eye. What may be a minor inconvenience to a person on a good regular income becomes a spiral of debt to the bank for those who are less well-off.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/3">At my travelling surgery this year, as I was researching the issue and becoming more aware of it, I started to ask constituents who came to me with other problems&mdash;such problems were often, I might add, caused by government, and delayed payment of pensions, tax credits or benefits, or delays with the Child Support Agency&mdash;about the bank charges that they might be facing. I have yet to find a single case of somebody in such circumstances who does not tell me that they had been hit by bank charges. The problems are often caused through no fault of their own, and result from Government inefficiency and late or non-existent benefit payments, which are payable to the people in question only because they are already hard up. They are then mugged by their bank not with just one charge, but with numerous charges, since one penalty causes another and another. The people involved, who are at the bottom of the income scale and who depend on support for one or another reason&mdash;it may be a pension or disability benefit&mdash;find it impossible to extricate themselves from the excess on the overdraft limit. They continue, therefore, to be hit by penalty charges.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/4">Numerous constituents have experienced that snowball effect. They are hit by hundreds or thousands of pounds of bank penalty charges, either because of someone else's mistake or because they have made a small error themselves, such as assuming that a cheque has been processed by the bank more quickly than it has. The worst hit are low-income families, single parents, the elderly, the disabled, people who are out of work, students and young people who are starting out&mdash;the very people whom the Government say they were elected to defend and whom they want to prioritise.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/5">An example is when a late pension payment leads to a charge for a bounced direct debit. The pension payment finally arrives, but the pensioner is still over the limit because of the previous penalty charge, so another penalty charge is levied, and then another&mdash;charge after charge. A real example concerned Miss R., a student from St. Austell, who had an account with the Alliance and Leicester, but moved most of the money into another bank account, leaving just a few pounds behind, and instructing all the organisations with which she had a direct debit mandate to use the new account. An insurance company mistakenly issued a direct debit request on her old account and the Alliance and Leicester bounced it and charged Miss R. a penalty charge. She went overdrawn, which meant she then incurred another charge. In three months she had received &pound;300 in penalties. Despite the fact that she wrote three times to explain that it was not her fault, Alliance and Leicester refused to refund her anything.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/6">What of cases in which people are considered at fault? When I raise this issue I am often told that people should be more careful with their accounts. An example of such a person is Mrs. V., a working mum in Truro, whose husband paid a cheque into her account but did not realise that because of the bank's clearing cycle it would take a few days to clear. Direct debits bounced, and in one month she was charged &pound;380. As a result, she was over the limit the next month. More direct debits bounced: that was another &pound;405. That comes to nearly &pound;1,000 in just two months. In the end she was charged well over &pound;1,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/7">Victims of the punitive charges system are also made to feel that they have done something wrong. The partner of a nursery worker, Miss W., from Grampound in my constituency, came to my travelling surgery to tell me about their problems with tax credits. I looked into the matter and helped to sort out the tax credit problem, but in the meantime I asked whether they had been hit by bank charges. It turned out that the problem with bank charges was bigger than the tax credit problem that it resulted from. The couple accrued &pound;500 in charges. We helped Miss W. to take the matter to court. As a result, Nationwide paid out in a matter of weeks, to pre-empt a court case. However, in an act of retribution, despite the repayment, Nationwide issued a letter giving Miss W. 30 days to close her account. It has now been closed, and that of course has caused her even greater stress and inconvenience.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/8">Not everyone is willing or able to take their bank to court about such matters, or even knows that they can. The volunteers who help, such as the one who helped with Miss W.'s case, cannot help everyone. Since the announcement of the debate my phone has been ringing constantly and my e-mail inbox has been full with messages of support and information about other cases from around the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/9">This problem arises from the banks using poverty as a source of profit&mdash;a great deal of profit. The bank commission of BBC 2's &quot;The Money Programme&quot;, which included eminent business academics and a former senior NatWest executive, concluded that the absolute maximum administrative cost to a bank of processing a bounced cheque&mdash;the most labour-intensive of the processes in question&mdash;is &pound;4.50. For all other items, such as unauthorised overdrafts or bounced direct debits, the commission concluded that the absolute maximum, in this electronic age where everything is done automatically through a computer, is &pound;2.50. However, the average charge is approximately &pound;30. Some are as high as &pound;38, and they are charged every time people make what the banks consider to be an unauthorised transaction. That is a substantial profit for the banks, which rake in some &pound;4.5 billion, without even taking account of the similar examples that the Federation of Small Businesses found in business banking accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/10">Almost all of what is charged is profit, not costs. It is profit at the expense of hard-up customers. It is the biggest bank robbery in Britain, and it involves the banks robbing their own customers, especially their poorest ones. A common response when the practice is described is that there should be a law against it; but there is a law, or there are laws. First, under common law, disproportionate and punitive charges have always been illegal. In layman's terms, if a consumer breaks the contract the other party&mdash;the bank, in this case&mdash;cannot impose a charge greater than the reasonable estimate of its loss. That common law has been unchanged for 100 years, and numerous cases in the higher courts have confirmed it. However, we can go further. The rights in question are protected by statutory instrument. The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 made that clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/11">I am no lawyer, and it might be argued that my interpretation is wrong. I hope that the Minister can tell us what he believes Parliament intended the law to provide on this matter. However, it appears that the banks know perfectly well that they are acting against the law, contrary to what they told the Office of Fair Trading. Why do I say that they know? Because I have helped constituents to regain thousands of pounds by threatening to take the matter to court. So have others. My former constituency researcher, Bob Egerton, has helped dozens more on a voluntary basis, which has made him famous in <i>The Sun </i>as &quot;Bob the Bankbuster&quot;. If people want more information on that, they should go to <a href="http://www.bankbuster.co.uk">www.bankbuster.co.uk</a>, but there are similar sites that advise people on how to get their money back.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/12">Every time court action is threatened, the banks refuse to defend themselves, and there is only one possible reason for that. They know that they will lose and that if they lose a test case they will forfeit this multi-billion pound source of illegal profit for ever. Millions of people still pay illegal charges because they believe that if the banks say that they are legitimate and show tariffs of what that they intend to charge, they must be legitimate. The banks claim that the charges are legal, but they will not face the courts. They know that it is an illegal rip-off of trusting and often impoverished customers. They are mugging their customers, and the OFT and the Government are letting them get away with it. If a backstreet lender were doing the same, the OFT would close it down within weeks, so what is being done?</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/13">The OFT looked into penalty charges on credit cards, but that took two years. It decided that &pound;12 is a fair charge, although I argue that that is still way in excess of what is fair, but it then took what it described as a &quot;novel approach&quot; to this issue. It got no undertakings, but issued a statement calling on the industry to comply as a matter of priority. In its letter to me of <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-03">3 January</phrase>, it could say only:</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Most credit card companies have since reduced their charges by at least half&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/15">There has been no action to force repayments to people who have been ripped off in the past. Despite what the OFT says, given that it has the power to threaten sanctions against its consumer credit licences, I believe that it has the power to make banks do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/16">When the OFT said that the same principles that apply to credit card charges apply to bank charges, the banks simply said that they did not agree. Instead of enforcing its view, the OFT is to review the issue for up to another six months before deciding whether to launch an investigation. Given that it took the OFT two years to investigate credit card charges, which are worth only &pound;300 million a year compared with &pound;4.5 billion in bank charges for the top six high street banks, it seems that the banks will be able to make even more illegal penal charges, worth almost &pound;10 billion, before there is any likelihood of an outcome from the OFT. That is a novel approach indeed, especially given that it has taken firm action against at least three commercial companies regarding penalty charges in their contracts, all of which were reported in its 2002 case bulletin. Why not take the same approach with the big banks? What is the OFT afraid of?</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/17">For at least 18 months, consumers have been asking the OFT to look into this issue, and there is no reason why it could not have been investigated at the same time as credit cards. Even the OFT has said how similar the issues are. Given that the Government are effectively forcing people into the hands of big banks by encouraging them to receive benefit and pension payments through banks, and by closing post offices, there is an even bigger impetus and moral duty on the Government to make banking responsible and to ensure that those to whom they pay benefits are not landed with outrageous charges.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/18">The first thing that I hope will come out this debate is that the OFT speeds up its investigation and moves from simply reviewing the matter to conducting a full investigation. I hope that it will then produce a fair maximum charge according to law.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16b.256.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" speakername="Edward Balls" speakeroffice="The Economic Secretary to the Treasury"  colnum="256"  time="012:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070116/halltext/70116h0009.htm#07011648000522">
	<p pid="b.256.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro andSt. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing the debate, and thank him and his office for their courtesy in giving me advance notice of the issues that he intended to raise. He has raised important matters, and it is important that there is proper transparency and profile in those issues. I was pleased to be able to read, before the debate, the comments that he made on &quot;The Westminster Hour&quot;. His appearance on that programme gave publicity to today's debate and gave some of these issues a wider profile. That information has enabled me to prepare to respond in detail to the points raised in his powerful speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/2">As well as raising specific issues about bank charges, the hon. Gentleman makes a broad point with which I, and most people, agree. While banks play a fundamentally important role in the workings of our economy, and while it is important for the working of our economy to have a strong, healthy and profitable banking sector, banks also play an integral role in our society and lives. Banks are among our biggest companies, and like any company&mdash;perhaps more so&mdash;they have social obligations and responsibilities within society. Given their important role in the economy and society, they should be leaders in corporate social responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/3">In recent years, we have worked closely with the banking industry and the British Bankers Association on a range of different policy issues that all pertain to that wider social role of the banking industry. A key Government priority in tackling financial inclusion has been to try to reduce the number of people in our society who have no bank account. When we established our financial inclusion taskforce, we calculated that 2.8 million people in our society have no bank account. The hon. Gentleman will know that not having a bank account can impose real costs, such as not being able to access affordable sources of credit or take advantage of discounted utility bills by using direct debits.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/4">Our wider agenda is to tackle illegal lending and loan sharks. Our pilot schemes in Birmingham and Glasgow, which are about to be extended across the country, are all about trying to ensure that we tackle the problem of people being ripped off outside the mainstream banking industry. An important part of our broader work on financial inclusion has been encouraging the third sector credit unions to play a wider role in providing bank accounts for the lowest-income customers, and cracking down on illegal lending.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/5">We have also worked closely with the banks to try to ensure that we tackle customers' inability to access banking services in the poorest communities. Just before Christmas, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1972" name="John McFall">my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (John McFall)</phrase>, who is Chair of the Treasury Committee, and I announced an agreement with the banks to provide automatic teller machines&mdash;ATMs&mdash;in the poorest communities of our country, where it is often hard for people to access banking services.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/6">We have been working hard on other areas. As part of the implementation of the Cruickshank review, the payments system task force was established in 2004 to try to speed up the provision of banking services for customers. The length of time that it has taken to clear cheques has been an important and characteristic feature of my ministerial postbag&mdash;I am sure that the same applies in respect of the hon. Gentleman's postbag. We announced an agreement on those areas before Christmas.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/7">I am aware that penalty charges in the mainstream banking system, particularly current account charges, such as overdraft fees, and the problems they can pose to those in financial difficulty have received significant attention. The Treasury Committee also raised that issue in its recent report on financial inclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/8">The hon. Gentleman noted that the Office of Fair Trading has been closely engaged in this area, and he will know that we established an independent regime for competition inquiries&mdash;the OFT and the new Competition Commission. The banking industry often makes points to me that are directly opposed to the ones he has made about the scrutiny role that the OFT plays in its affairs, although I listened carefully to what he said.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/9">The OFT carried out an investigation into penalty charges in the credit card sector and set a &pound;12 administrative threshold for intervention by the competition authorities. As a result, credit card issuers have agreed to reduce their default charges, the majority agreeing to do so by almost half. That investigation was conducted under the principle of unfair terms in the Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, which specify that financial service companies should recoup only the administrative costs of dealing with default. That was the basis upon which the OFT made that ruling, which was not popular in some circles in the industry but has been broadly welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/10">The OFT recently said it believes that the same principles of fairness and transparency that it applied to credit card default charges are likely to be applicable to bank account default charges. Following the credit card investigation in which it acted, it has instigated an exercise to determine the facts in respect of the banking sector and then to decide what proportionate and appropriate action it should take.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/11">The OFT is independent of Government; we do not direct it in or set the pace of its inquiries. In many cases, it is for the OFT to propose and implement remedies. The fact that those individual, case-by-case decisions are being made at arm's length from Ministers is one of the strengths in terms of protecting consumers. In my experience of contact with the banking industry, the OFT inquiry is very serious&mdash;it is certainly being taken seriously by the banks. The OFT has collected the information and it has an established track record of acting when it believes that actions are being taken that are potentially outside the law. It would be wrong for me to comment on this particular case, because it is a matter for the OFT. If I were to second-guess an inquiry&mdash;the inquiry of an independent competition agency&mdash;when it is being conducted, it would be an error on my part. I would like to express my strong support, and that of the Government, for the principles of fairness and transparency, which the OFT applies in general. It applied such principles to credit cards and is now planning to apply them to banks.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/12">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned that some customers are challenging default charges in thecourts. It is up to individuals whether they challenge the decisions of a private institution in the courts.The OFT is holding a more general inquiry into the particular kind of cases that he mentioned. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the particulars of those legal cases, especially while the OFT inquiry is ongoing. As I said, we are very supportive of the general principles that the OFT is seeking to apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/13">The penalty charges that result from late payments by Government agencies and cause people to go overdrawn through no fault of their own have been mentioned. In 2006, the Department for Work and Pensions made more than 680 million payments, of which fewer than 21,000&mdash;or 0.0003 per cent.&mdash;were reported as late or missing by recipients. In the negligible minority of cases where payments are late because of an error on the part of the Department, the Government's policy is to refund any penalty charges that might arise to the individual concerned.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16b.263.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1863" speakername="Sin James" colnum="263"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070116/halltext/70116h0009.htm#07011648000529">
	<p pid="b.263.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her comments. It is true that it is our duty to protect young people. If society does not look after them, they may not realise the long-term dangers. It is up to us to educate them and provide information.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/2">I would welcome further work between the Minister and other Departments to consider introducing a licensing scheme for sunbed outlets throughout the country. Such a scheme exists in some cities, but a consistent approach is needed, led by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/3">Back in 1995 when the health and safety guidelines were drawn up, the automated, unstaffed sunbed centre did not exist on our High streets, but there has since been an explosion of them, which is why we must look again at the issue. Regulations have not kept up with developments in the industry, and public health is suffering. Unstaffed, coin-operated salons should not be worried about a licensing system, and I call on them to work with me on this campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/4">I have been accused of trying to prevent choice and to stop people using sunbeds, and wanting to ban them all. That is not so. I do not wish to stop adults over 16 accessing sunbeds, but perhaps with the recent change in the age restriction on the sale of tobacco we should consider 18. I wish only to prevent children from being able to walk into unstaffed salons and use them unchallenged. There has been a public outcry about young people accessing gambling machines in amusement arcades. Sunbed abuse is just as damaging and as harmful to young people's long-term well-being.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/5">I have heard arguments that under-16 year olds will continue to access the salons despite the introduction of an age ban, but that was said about cigarettes and alcohol. The success of the &quot;Think 21&quot; campaign demonstrates clearly that an effective voluntary system can challenge any under-age young person attempting to purchase alcohol or tobacco. The same should be true of the sunbed industry. It is imperative that a member of staff is present to challenge any under-age young person attempting to access the premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/6">One company in my constituency has been displaying a notice that says:</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/7" class="indent">&quot;We do not accept responsibility for people under the age of 16 on these premises.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/8">It is an example of shoddy practice that must be exposed. In other words, the notice is saying, &quot;It is not our fault; blame someone else.&quot; Companies must take responsibility for their services. If they offer a service to the public, they should have a minimum set of standards, which is why licensing is needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/9">Consol says that the education of children is the responsibility of parents, but if parents discover their children using unstaffed salons, or if a passer-by notices a child in an unstaffed salon and reports it, nothing is done. There is no complaint mechanism to deal with such circumstances, and nobody is prosecuted or fined. Action is taken only if there is a fault with the equipment or if an incident occurs. That is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/10">In conclusion, there is a strong case for regulation, probably in the form of licensing. It is unacceptable in this day and age for unstaffed operators to pretend that there is no problem with under-16s accessing their salons. There is growing public awareness about the health and well-being of our young people. It does not make sense that we can protect them from alcohol, cigarettes, pornography and gambling, but that we cannot recognise the dangers to their long-term health from sunbed abuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.1/11">I urge the Minister to be bold, as she has been with tobacco. I hope she agrees that it is always better to fake than bake, and I ask her to take the necessary steps to protect our children's health.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16b.264.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16c.264.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16b.264.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="264"  time="013:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070116/halltext/70116h0010.htm#07011648000530">
	<p pid="b.264.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1863" name="Sin James">my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mrs. James)</phrase> on securing the debate. I also welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1607" name="Linda Riordan">the presence of my hon. Friends the Members for Halifax (Mrs. Riordan)</phrase> and for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper), and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1974" name="James McGovern">the earlier attendance of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. McGovern)</phrase>, who has had to leave the Chamber. I thank them for attending and for showing their support.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/2">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East for her participation in discussions with officials in the Department of Health. They have been assisted by her information and experience locally, and by what she has gained from people contacting her, given the high profile that she has lent the issue. I must admit that one difficulty is securing the necessary data and information about the extent of the problem. We know, at least anecdotally, that coin-operated facilities in particular tend to be located in some of our more deprived communities. It is clear that they do not offer the beauty parlour experience that one might have in more affluent areas, where sunbeds under supervision sit alongside nail bars, facial services and everything else.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/3">My hon. Friend has outlined today and shared with me in private meetings some of the ways in which the facility is open to abuse. The questions are about how much abuse takes place and who is responsible for trying to reduce the amount of misuse of coin-operated facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/4">The issue is important, and as she said, about 150 MPs from all parties signed her early-day motion. We continue to try to address the subject. Although my hon. Friend rightly draws attention to the public health concerns, it is an issue not only for the Department of Health but for the Department for Work and Pensions, to which the Health and Safety Executive is accountable; for the Department for Trade and Industry; and for the Department for Communities and Local Government, which leads on licensing matters. It does not sit with only one Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/5">We share with my hon. Friend and others concern about the increase in the incidence of skin cancer and the importance of prevention. The popularity of tanned skin has raised the potential risks of getting skin cancer. However, the debate is not about people enjoying the sunshine but about the extent to which they do. That is important. There are benefits to sunshine through vitamin D, as we all know, but it is the extent to which people expose their skin, either naturally or artificially, which poses dangers for their future health. The trouble is that overexposure to natural sunlight or to sunbeds without protection does not manifest straight away. The problem is one of how we measure the impact of exposure on something that may manifest as skin cancer only some years later. It is a challenging area.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/6">The Government discourage the cosmetic use of sunbeds, whether coin-operated or otherwise, particularly by young people. For adults, the key issue is that sunbed use is the result of an informed choice. However, for young people with skin at greater risk of damage from cosmetic tanning, and possibly an inadequate understanding of the potential harm, it is an issue not only for parents, as Consol said, but for the industry and for the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/7">For that reason, the Department of Health, along with other UK health organisations, has funded Cancer Research UK to run SunSmart, the national skin cancer prevention and sun protection campaign. The campaign includes raising public and professional awareness of skin cancer by providing information about it, including how it manifests and its early detection, and by providing guidance on preventive measures to reduce the risk of its occurring. The campaign raises awareness through support for health promotion events, the provision of printed resources, media briefings and the SunSmart website. It has proved a valuable addition to the exploration of concerns about skin cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/8">A key message of the campaign is to take care not to burn, whether in the sun or on sunbeds. We must reinforce that message as much as possible, and the website has a special section covering sunbeds. It highlights the fact that sunbeds, far from being cosmetic friends, cause premature skin ageing and blemishing at a younger age once the tan has faded. When discussing prevention among young people, that is an important message to get across, because unfortunately, the more serious problem of skin cancer may not appear until later in life. Focusing on the more immediate outcomes of over-use of sunbeds is an important way of getting the message across.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/9">The campaign also makes the point that sunbeds should not be used by people who are particularly vulnerable. They include people with fairer skins, and specifically people under 16 years old, as my hon. Friend admirably pointed out. The Health and Safety Executive has also issued guidelines on the use of sunbeds for operators and customers. The guidelines are available on its website.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/10">The guidance was developed in consultation with the Department of Health and leading experts. We have been trying to encourage self-regulation and the following of guidance. I noted my hon. Friend's point about the Sunbed Association's code and the basis on which it admits members to its organisation, because we want to ensure that anybody who operates sunbeds, whether coin-operated or otherwise, takes up the Health and Safety Executive's guidance. There is a clear split of opinion among the sunbed industry on the subject, and that influences the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/11">Cancer Research UK has supported the guidance by working with representatives of the industry, particularly the Sunbed Association, to try to improve information for staff and customers. That includes displaying information about the use of sunbeds and the risks to customers' health, and discouraging the use of sunbeds by young people under 16. There are issues with how one can meaningfully do so if there are no staff present to reinforce whatever written information is provided in an outlet.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/12">As my hon. Friend rightly says, coin-operated sunbeds are often in establishments that do not use full-time staff. Last year, as a result of my discussions with her, I made a commitment to initiate cross-Government discussions to explore the options for regulating coin-operated sunbeds. She has taken part in those discussions, which have allowed us to exchange information in order to get a better understanding of the issues involved. We have considered licensing arrangements&mdash;local authorities have powers to license in this area&mdash;and we will discuss further the guidance currently provided by the Health and Safety Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/13">A sunbed symposium was held last autumn, which raised several issues including matters of data and information. I understand that the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health plans to follow up the survey results that it has pulled together with a fuller report. More information, from whatever source, would be very helpful for our future discussions on the provision of coin-operated sunbeds in communities and the way in which they are used by individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/14">There are a number of factors to consider, such as the different types of regulatory provision and their impact. I am aware that a Regulation of Sunbed Parlours Bill is being considered in Scotland. We are keeping a watchful eye on that and we are interested in the evidence base being considered as that Bill goes through the Scottish Parliament. There are common issues, although not necessarily identical ones, and clearly there is an opportunity for us to learn from the experiences of other parts of the UK, within our devolved island.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/15">In the meantime, we continue to have discussions. I will be meeting my noble Friend Lord McKenzie of Luton, who has just taken responsibility for this area of health and safety within the Department for Work and Pensions, and that meeting will follow on from the one my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East had with Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, who has recently joined my Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.0/16">This debate is timely, and it is opportune for me to explore the guidance with my colleague in the DWP, determine whether there are areas that we can tackle and think about strengthening the guidance and other routes that we may take. I welcome my hon. Friend's campaign in this area, and I am sure that, along with me, she will seek to engage Departments that have a role to play in ensuring the best possible public health outcomes, particularly for those most vulnerable in our communities, such as those under the age of 16.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-16b.268.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1738" speakername="Richard Bacon" colnum="268"  time="013:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070116/halltext/70116h0010.htm#07011648000533">
	<p pid="b.268.4/1">I am pleased that my hon. Friend raised that point. The threat to public safety is the single biggest problem. Of course, there are other issues, such as rising motor insurance premiums. I know that he has taken a big interest in the matter, as the chairman of the all-party group on insurance and financial services. He is right: the very serious and growing threat to public safety is the single biggest issue. Serious injuries such as broken limbs and crushed rib cages can occur, and have done. If the fraud is allowed to continue, there will almost certainly be fatalities and a growing injury rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.4/2">Some evidence suggests that women driving alone and those on the school run with children are targeted by fraudsters because they think that they are more likely to admit liability. As my hon. Friend said, these crimes are forcing insurance premiums to rise, which is paid for by innocent motorists, and insurers estimate that the fraud is now yielding at least &pound;200 million a year for organised criminals. The phenomenon is growing so quickly, however, that that could be a significant underestimate. We are talking about many hundreds of millions of pounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.4/3">That links directly to the third issue: cash generated from the fraud is fuelling the growth of organised crime. Norwich Union referred to that in its 2005 fraud report, &quot;Shedding Light on Hidden Crime&quot;. Insurers believe that the proceeds from induced car accidents are being used routinely to fund other forms of organised crime, including drugs and people trafficking, benefits and credit card fraud and money laundering. It might even be funding terrorism. Induced accident fraud started among predominantly Muslim gangs in the north of England, but has now spread so widely that criminals from all backgrounds are involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.4/4">It remains the case, however, that the gangs that started the earliest and so acquired the most expertise have been the most successful in perpetrating the fraud. That is reflected geographically in the figures for the number of staged accidents. The Insurance Fraud Bureau has estimated that since 1999 there have been 22,605 staged or induced accidents, and has broken them down city by city. Blackburn comes top, with 1,710 staged accidents since 1999&mdash;7.5 per cent. of the total. Bradford and Birmingham come next, followed by Oldham. Those four cities alone account for more than a quarter of all such crashes. Bolton, Manchester, Liverpool and Preston come next and bring the total to more than 42 per cent.&mdash;some 9,500 crashes. The Serious Organised Crime Agency monitors terrorists' finances. I hope that the Solicitor-General can tell us that the agency is aware of those figures, which indicate a significant concentration in a small number of northern cities where Asian gangs&mdash;they are predominantly Muslim&mdash;started this fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.4/5">I shall examine the reasons for the quick growth of the fraud. Before 2006, the police were generally unable to investigate these organised gangs. Typical cited reasons for not doing so are limited resources or the low prioritisation of fraud in the national policing plan&mdash;no targets were set. This fraud has been an extremely profitable and almost risk-free activity, so it would have been extraordinary if it had been ignored by organised crime. Since 2006, with the growing focus on fraud as a national issue, police forces in the south of England have begun to investigate more cases of such fraud. In notable cases, prosecutions are ongoing. To date, however, no police force in the north of England, where this problem started and is most prolific, has investigated a single case. Consequently, the vast majority of the 40 known gangs operating in the UK are not under investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.4/6">I remind hon. Members that it took six to seven years to generate more than 22,000 crashes. The Insurance Fraud Bureau believes that at the current rate of growth, a further 20,000 crashes will be generated over the next 18 months. Another reason for the growth is that the crime is so profitable and easy that it is now being franchised. Insurers have obtained intelligence that they believe indicates that the largest and most prolific gang in the north-east is effectively selling franchises to other gangs, providing support, set-up and driver training. I am given to understand that requests to investigate the gang have been refused routinely by the relevant police authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.4/7">I shall examine the implications for the policing and prosecuting authorities. It is a national problem requiring a structured national response. In my view, any significant delay represents an unacceptable risk to public safety. Without the consistent threat of prosecution across the UK, experience has shown that the problem will continue to grow. Police targets are set on the basis of harm caused to individuals and society by a particular crime. That approach makes a strong case for making the prosecution of induced accident fraud an immediate priority&mdash;it poses a direct risk to public safety, funds organised crime and possibly terrorism, and impacts on society through higher motor insurance premiums and the rate at which the problem is growing.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.4/8">In my view, a case could be made also for the immediate ring-fencing of police anti-fraud resources around the UK, as recommended by the Attorney-General in his excellent fraud review last year. Without that, we can reasonably expect a continued erosion of specialised police anti-fraud resources. In the past decade, available resources for combating fraud outside London have been halved. Last year, at the request of the Home Office, following representations from the insurance industry, an evidence-based threat assessment was submitted to the Home Office by the Association of British Insurers detailing and quantifying the threat to the UK of induced accidents and requesting urgent and co-ordinated action from law enforcement agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.4/9">That has been superseded by more recent research by the newly formed Insurance Fraud Bureau indicating that the problem is significantly larger than first thought. Details of that research were presented to the all-party group on insurance and financial services, chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale, and subsequently shared with MPs from affected constituencies. I would like clarification from the Government on a number of questions. First, who in the Government is responsible for considering the implications of the research and deciding on an appropriate course of action? Secondly, is such consideration ongoing, and if so, when will a decision be reached? Thirdly, will the relevant Minister advise us on the action to be taken to combat the national problem of induced accidents and on how the Government intend to stop its prolific growth? Fourthly, will that Minister agree to meet with the Association of Chief Police Officers to discuss how to prioritise the arrest and prosecution of such gangs before the problem escalates out of all proportion?</p>
	<p pid="b.268.4/10">Induced accident fraud is just one example of the wider problem of fraud. Its recent growth is connected to low awareness of fraud and the fact that it has not been a national policing priority. However, it is important to say that good work is now being done. I applaud both the growing efforts of our police in the south-east and the excellent work done by the Attorney-General's fraud review team.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.4/11">Almost overnight, our perception of the problem has changed. For example, the Attorney-General's review concluded that fraud as a crime is perhaps second only to class A drugs in the harm that it does nationally. Induced accident fraud is only one of the many rapidly growing methods of fraud facing us, which include VAT fraud, benefit fraud, credit card fraud and corporate fraud. I welcome the Attorney-General's review of fraud and support its recommendations, which once implemented will lay the foundations of a more fraud-resistant economy and society. I await the Government's response to those recommendations and would welcome active steps to ensure that they are implemented as soon as possible. The Attorney-General's report recognised that there are currently no up-to-date statistics on the extent and impact of fraud on the UK. I await with interest the ACPO study to measure that, which I believe is due to be published next month. Perhaps the Solicitor-General could tell us whether he has met the Attorney-General to discuss the recommendations of the fraud review and say what hope he has that the recommendations will be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.4/12">I have focused most of my remarks in this debate on induced accident fraud, so I hope that the Solicitor-General will concentrate primarily on that in his reply. I hope that I have persuaded him of the seriousness of the issue. Induced accident fraud is one of the most startling forms of fraud. It targets innocent motorists in a disgraceful way, and is a significant and growing threat to public safety. It offers organised criminal gangs easy pickings that are nearly risk-free for the fraudsters. Although some police forces are now taking an interest, there is a long way to go. There are large parts of the country, particularly in the north of England, where the organised criminal gangs undertaking the fraud are unimpeded and uninvestigated, and can operate with virtually zero risk of prosecution. Finally, the proceeds of such crimes are used to finance more organised crime. This cannot continue.</p>

	<p pid="b.272.1/1">I cannot accept that, because I do not have any evidence for it. However, the hon. Gentleman says so and no doubt he has been informed of that by the insurance companies. If he has evidence that that has occurred, I should be happy to look at it and talk to the CPS about why that might have occurred, or to the Home Office, if the police have felt unable to conduct such investigations. However, I entirely accept the view, which has been increasingly put to us in consultations with the Association of British Insurers and the insurance industry more generally, that induced accident fraud is a growing problem. It puts innocent individuals at risk and is a growing criminal issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/2">I am concerned by the hon. Gentleman's references to police in the north of England. I agree that some of the problems appear to have arisen initially in West Yorkshire. The issue came to our attention in early 2005, with a spate of accidents in West Yorkshire that followed a similar pattern. However, prosecutions are also taking place in a number of counties in the south of England. There is a growing awareness of the problem by the police, and I suspect that we shall see an increasing focus on it in the months to come.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/3">Key actions for the police service, as set out in the recently published national community safety plan, include the need to have strategies to address all major threats, including fraud. The hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that fraud is currently not one of the key policing indicators. We always have to be careful about how many targets we set for public services. He will be aware of the criticisms that his party has made of the number of targets that are presented to public authorities. We need to hold discussions with the police about how they deal with such issues, and about where KPIs and other targets have a role. However, the national community safety plan includes references to fraud, and we have flagged up with the police the need to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/4">I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments about the fraud review, which the Attorney-General conducted recently, and the close work that has been undertaken between our Department and the insurance industry to examine some of the issues that it faces to do with fraud. The results of the review have been broadly welcomed by the insurance industry and I hope that that will make a significant change.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.1/5">Another thing that will make significant change is yesterday's introduction into law of the Fraud Act 2006. That is significant, not only because of some of the increased penalties&mdash;in one case doubling the penalty for fraud from five years on indictment to10 years&mdash;but because it will make it easier to focus on the reality of the fraud rather than on the technical problems of implementing some of the fraud-related provisions of theft legislation. I hope that that new legislation, which I helped take through the House of Commons, will help to enable the police and prosecuting authorities to focus more effectively on such crime.</p>
