<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15a.439.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="439"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060215/halltext/60215h01.htm#60215h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.439.3/1">I sought this debate because there is an emerging controversy&mdash;indeed, a scandal&mdash;about the small British dependency of Ascension Island. Over a period of years, its inhabitants, of whom there are just over 1,000, were led to believe that they had a settled future on a developing, liberalising island. Those expectations have been rather brutally removed following a Government policy U-turn announced at the end of last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/2">Concern over the issue has been compounded by the suspicion&mdash;there is no proof of this&mdash;that much of that change in policy is attributable to the influence exerted on the Government by the Americans, who have a major strategic interest in the island. That, therefore, is the context of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/3">I was prompted to seek the debate by a constituent, Mr. Hutchison, who is passionately interested in the subject. Since then, I have been deluged with e-mails and other messages from islanders, their elected councillors, people who have served on the island and former British administrators, all of whom feel passionately that the islanders have been betrayed and that we might well be on the brink of a case similar to that of Diego Garcia, which aroused much controversy four decades ago and whose consequences rumble on to this day. The island is, of course, very small, and the issue affects a small number of people, but it is worth remembering that this country went to war 20 years ago over the 2,000 people in the Falklands. The status and rights of just over 1,000 people on Ascension Island should therefore concern us, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/4">Let me give a bit of background to explain why the issue is important and how it came about. The British started using Ascension as part of the empire roughly at the time of the Napoleonic wars, and that was related to Napoleon's incarceration on St. Helena. From the outset, there have been arguments within the Government about what to do with the island. That was rather beautifully captured in a quotation about the first Admiralty commandant at the beginning of the 19th century, Captain Bates. It was said that he was</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/5" class="indent">&quot;by no means the last commandant of Ascension to be crippled by changes in&mdash;or rather the lack of&mdash;any proper policy in London. The Lords of the Admiralty seem never to have made up their minds about what they wanted Ascension to be.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/6">That is as true today as it was 200 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/7">The geography is unpromising, as the island is on a volcanic outcrop on the Atlantic ridge. The rock is very new; indeed, it is so new that there was originally no soil on the island. However, when people involved in the campaign first showed me pictures of it, I was struck by the fact that there were forests and small farms at the top of the mountain. I was told that they were there because people had imported soil in the 19th century so that agriculture could begin. They had carried it to the top of the mountain because that was the only place where water could be captured. Great labour has therefore gone into creating this British dependency and into its active use.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/8">The population is small, and there has been a long tradition of controlling it. A statement of policy in, I think, 1925 said that only friendly tribes could go to the island. That was a reference to St. Helenians, and migrant workers from St. Helena make up three quarters of Ascension Island's population. The pattern of population has been characterised by contract working. Workers on the island are, in effect, Gastarbeiter in the truest sense: they are there to work for a period and are required to leave when they retire. That has been the traditional pattern.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15a.449.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" speakername="Mark Lancaster" colnum="449"  time="010:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060215/halltext/60215h01.htm#60215h01_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.449.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing the debate. When I saw that there would be a debate on this issue, I could not help but come and say a few words, although I shall be brief. I shall concentrate on two areas: the environment of the island and the military impact on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/2">I am fortunate to have been to the island many times. When I first went there, I was due to stop for just one day on the way to the Falklands, but in true style the Royal Air Force broke down and I spent a week there. I have been back on several occasions to do engineering work, not least with the Army, and to do environmental work, also with the Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/3">Before I get on to my two main points, I shall try to add a bit of colour to this rather barren rock, because I think it the most remarkable place in the world. It is, of course, the second most remote island in the world, but other hon. Members have touched on how unique it is. It is an island full of surprises.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/4">Green mountain, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" name="Peter Bottomley">my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley)</phrase> referred, is remarkable. Reaching the Dew point on the way to the top, one enters a marvellous microclimate with a mini rain forest on top. One of my worst memories of Ascension is having to do the Dew point run, which involves running from the shore to the top of the mountain. It covers about 7 miles and the runners are absolutely exhausted by the time they get there. The island is probably the only place that I have ever played half a round of golf&mdash;there is only half a golf course&mdash;entirely on flint and rock with not a blade of grass to be found.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/5">The community is unique because it has so many different elements. GCHQ is there, as is the BBC. There is an American community and there used to be a Royal Air Force community. All four parts of the community, as well as the St. Helenians, manage to work together well. The island is one of the few places in the world where I have spent any time where people did not have to lock their doors, and I would hate for that to be spoiled.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/6">As one travels up the island through Donkey plain to Cricket valley around the back, one can see that it is the most remarkable environment. Although it is essential that tourism on the island is developed, I am concerned about how we will ensure that such a unique place is not destroyed by too much tourism. I would like to hear the Minister's view on that. We have already done our bit by introducing the rat to the island, which has caused some problems, although we have also done some quite remarkable things. As one goes up to the now defunct National Aeronautics and Space Administration centre&mdash;I know that it is defunct because I kicked the front door in during a military exercise once, and there is definitely no one there any more&mdash;one passes a remarkable plantation with incredibly tall, thin trees. I asked what it was, and was told that they are trees planted by the Royal Navy in the 19th century to provide spare masts. They are still there. That is the sort of place Ascension Island is&mdash;an island full of secrets.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/7">I am concerned about the environmental impact of an increase in tourism. I was fortunate when I went in that the green turtle, which lays its eggs on the shores, was laying its eggs when I arrived. When I went back in the summer, they were hatching. I can see the appeal and that tourists would want to see such things, but that must be handled sensitively so that we do not impact on the island or on that population.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/8">I also want to touch on the military aspect. I am concerned that the state of the island is deteriorating. I saw the range on the far side of the island only recently. It is kept in mothballs, but it is an absolutely essential facility. I am sure that during the Falklands war no one expected that Ascension Island would be as prominent as it was. It is essential that we keep it in top condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/9">As the Royal Air Force squadron was withdrawn several years ago, I am concerned that the island is being overlooked to a degree. We rely entirely on the Americans to look after the runway. I realise that it is leased to them, but it is vital that as a country we maintain some form of military community there to ensure that it is there when we need it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15a.452.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="452"  time="010:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060215/halltext/60215h01.htm#60215h01_spnew14">
	<p pid="a.452.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing the debate. I think that it was my first day in the House when I went into the Tea Room and someone said to me, &quot;You know, whatever topic is discussed in the House, there will always be someone who is an expert on it.&quot; When I saw the title of this debate on the Order Paper, I obviously knew that the hon. Gentleman was an expert on the subject, but I did not know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" name="Mark Lancaster">my hon. Friends the Members for North-East Milton Keynes (Mr. Lancaster)</phrase>, for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) and for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley), as well as the hon. Members for Colchester (Bob Russell) and for Taunton (Mr. Browne), were also experts. I congratulate them all on their speeches.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/2">I also congratulate you, Mr. Bercow, as I think this is the first time that you have found yourself in the Chair for these proceedings. We are delighted to see you in that exalted position and hope that you will have many happy years sitting in the Chair, doing exactly what you are doing today.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/3">I tend to the theory that there has not been a conspiracy over what is happening on Ascension Island and that the Government have found themselves in a bit of a muddle. As the hon. Member for Taunton said, they did not want to be totally open about their thinking on what the future of the island ought to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/4">I declare an interest: like a number of my hon. Friends, I have been to Ascension Island on the way to the Falklands. I spent a happy lunchtime in the administrator's delightful residence. It had a lawn that many people in this country would be proud to tend, and a great deal of effort must go into tending it considering the problems on the top of the mountain there. We had to spend even more time on the island on the way back from the Falklands because the RAF would not take us out of there until the fog had cleared at RAF Brize Norton. The RAF did not want to land at Heathrow or Prestwick because of the cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/5">Like my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Milton Keynes, therefore, I have spent several hours on Ascension Island. There is not much there, but it is no exaggeration to say that the Falkland Islands invasion could not have been repelled without the use of the island. It is strategically very important to the Government and to the Americans, as one can see by the size of the airport there and the facilities that GCHQ, Cable &amp; Wireless and the RAF have there. It is a vital strategic base for us, as well as an important test base for the Americans, with their tracking of rockets and so on. The Government therefore need to be totally open about what they want to achieve for the island.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/6">I, too, was struck by the article in <i>The</i> <i>Daily Telegraph </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February</phrase>, just two days ago. I picked out from it the phrase &quot;contingent liabilities&quot;. The Government need to explain carefully to us what gave rise to the complete change of heart. They established an island council and they wanted to establish property rights, alternative American charter flights and a tourism business. Now, all of a sudden, the Government have changed their mind. It would be useful if the Minister explained clearly to us the reasons for that change of mind. As my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West pointed out, it would have been useful had the Minister spoken at the beginning, because we could have questioned him on what he said. In the absence of that, we have to ask a few questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/7">I have given the Minister notice of my questions. If he cannot answer today all the points raised in the debate, I would be grateful if he put a note in the Library, or perhaps provided a written statement to the House on the points that emerge. Perhaps we could have a position paper on the Government's intentions for the future of the island. It might be helpful to have that on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/8">I shall ask the Minister a few of the questions of which I gave him notice. Do the Government regret their recommendation that there should be a review in relation to the constitutional rights of residence for people living on Ascension Island? Do the Government now believe that the residents of Ascension Island should have any influence on local decision making or not? What will be the future of the island council? If the people are to have some form of representation, the Government need to know how they are to be represented, both on the island council and directly to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/9">What did the Government have in mind when they decided in April 2001 that fundamental changes were necessary in how Ascension Island was run? Do the Government regret their decision to introduce the idea of an island council in the 2001 concept paper, and their introduction of a new fiscal regime in April 2002, which brought in local income, property and customs taxes without the award of local democratic representation to the residents of Ascension Island? Those are critical questions, as are those on property rights, to which the hon. Member for Twickenham alluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/10">Ascension Island's revenue budget for 2003&ndash;04 amounted to &pound;4.3 million. Fiscal expenditure amounted to &pound;3.3 million for recurrent expenditure and &pound;0.7 million for capital expenses, leaving transfer reserves of &pound;0.3 million&mdash;7 per cent. of revenue. Government expenditure funds one school, one hospital offering limited services but including basic operations, and police and judicial services, all of which are provided free to local taxpayers. Given that the economy is so fragile, surely the Government should reassure the residents of Ascension Island by employing a consistent and fair policy towards the island.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/11">Following the completion of negotiations with the US authorities in October 2003 to allow air-charter access to Wideawake airfield, what approaches have been made by private transport groups to operate a link with Ascension Island? Have the Government considered promoting such links? Incidentally, Wideawake airfield is a misnomer if ever I heard one, because one nearly always arrives there in the middle of the night after a long flight from RAF Brize Norton anything but wide-awake. I think that the name refers to the birds, rather than the human condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/12">What assessments have been made of the effect on the Ascension Island economy and on the local economy of a link with airports such as Brize Norton? It seems to me that that would be a possibility. Having visited Brize Norton, which is contiguous to my constituency, and knowing that the RAF is thinking about introducing a more commercial element to Brize Norton, there is an ideal opportunity to establish some form of tourism and more commercial activity with the island if the Government want to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/13">The hon. Member for Twickenham asked how many people were born on the island. It seems to me that if people, and perhaps their parents and grandparents, were born there, they have gone a long way down the road of citizenship. If they have citizenship of the island, will the Government recognise it?</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/14">What discussions have taken place in the past 12 months with the US Administration on changes in the administration of Ascension Island? Have those discussions impeded the agreed powers of the Ascension Island Administration? That is a key matter. I suspect that some discussions have taken place with the Americans and that some security implication has caused the Government's change of mind. It would be helpful&mdash;within, obviously, the bounds of open government&mdash;if the Minister gave us an idea of that today.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/15">What are the contingent liabilities? The hon. Member for Twickenham, with his financial background, concentrated on the financial possibilities of contingent liabilities, but they could cover a multitude of possibilities&mdash;including even contamination and things of that kind. Alternatively, are we just thinking about the human condition and the problems of providing health, pensions and social security? Are they what is meant by contingent liabilities? We need to know. This is one of the crucial questions that we need to have answered in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/16">According to Government figures, the cost of internal security and policing on Ascension has not been borne by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Who has shouldered that cost and what influence do they now have over the running of the island? Is it true that Ascension Island's local government paid for its own policing and internal security in 2004&ndash;05 and does the Minister believe that the Ascension Island Administration are now capable of running their own affairs? If there is to be a council, we need to know what revenue-raising powers, and thus the likely powers over administration of the island, it will have with regard to those essential public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.0/17">What measures are the Minister's Department and the Ministry of Defence taking to ensure that the residents of Ascension Island who are entitled to a state pension receive a fair deal? If the Government will not award them quarterly uprating, does the Minister intend to give the Ascension Island Administration the powers necessary to provide for those residents? We need to know that with regard to not only pensions, but the entire range of public services.</p>

	<p pid="a.457.1/1">Let me deal with the specific issue of the right of abode. Where Ascension Island is unique and can be distinguished from St. Helena is that all those working and living on the island are there only because they or their families are employed by one of the users. The administrator of Ascension has authority to grant permission to enter and remain on the island, and employees of the users and their families are entitled to enter and remain on Ascension for the duration of their employment contract. On the termination of their contract with a user, they are required by Ascension Island law to leave. There is, therefore, no general entitlement to enter or remain on Ascension Island, nor has there ever been under British rule.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.1/2">The hon. Member for Twickenham argued that the Government raised false hope for the people living and working on Ascension&mdash;a point also raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase>&mdash;by giving them the impression over the last six years that they would be granted a general right to remain and own property on the island, separate from employment with a user. I shall set out the chronology surrounding consultations on this issue to explain how the Government reached their decision, as set out by Lord Triesman in his letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January</phrase>, not to allow the development of these rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.463.1/1">It is unusual for me to be on the Front Bench and it is worth having a debate just to be here.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/2">The Minister is used to occasions such as this. I think that this is the third time this week that she has been in such a room to discuss Northern Ireland, as she has already spoken about rates and selling the family silver. She is here now to discuss education, and I look forward to hearing her response.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/3">Recent Government figures have indicated that more than 100,000 youngsters live in relative poverty in Northern Ireland. Many of them are concentrated in particular areas, some of which are relatively affluent but have estates in the middle with a high concentration of families living in poverty and deprivation. That impacts on educational achievement.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/4">The debate on those issues has sometimes been mixed up with other big educational controversies in Northern Ireland. For example, there has been an attempt to link educational under-achievement and disadvantage with the selection system, although I want to stay away from that issue this morning, because it is a red herring and it does not answer the problem; I see the Minister smiling, however, because she has sometimes tried to link the two.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/5">I do not believe that the solution is simply to throw money at the problem, although resources are required. The important question is how to lift people's aspirations. In many deprived areas education is not seen as it used to be: as a way out of poverty and a way of improving opportunities in life. How do we give people the inspiration and aspiration to look to education as a way out of their current economic situation?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15a.463.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="463"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060215/halltext/60215h02.htm#60215h02_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.463.3/1">Absolutely. The problem is not unique to Northern Ireland. Many of the lessons that we have learned in Northern Ireland can be transported to other parts of the United Kingdom. Equally, some best practices need to be transported to Northern Ireland. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/2">It is clear that there are problems, because there has been no lack of initiatives in Northern Ireland. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that there are currently 58 or 59 initiatives to deal with failing schools, raise standards, improve attendance and so on. Sometimes, all that happens is that jobs are created for those who administer the initiatives and a paper nightmare is created for principals who must find out about initiatives and how to apply for them, and then fill in the forms. Education and library boards provide some help, but resources are dispersed. The resources themselves are often time-limited and are stopped just when they begin to bite. Even worse, sometimes when the results begin to come through the schools no longer qualify. They may benefit from an innovative scheme, but the money may then dry up.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/3">I want to look at two initiatives that illustrate some of the best practices and some of the problems. First, the school support programme amounted to &pound;50,000 a school. Clear targets were set and one school decided that it wanted to spend the money on tackling the problem of school attendance. The money provided a home-school liaison officer who targeted families whose children had a poor attendance record. The liaison officer obtained parental involvement, which was important&mdash;sometimes, that meant putting parents on accredited courses to learn how to help youngsters with reading, homework, counting and so on&mdash;and brought in other statutory agencies. Sometimes it was a case of ensuring that youngsters came to school having had breakfast, and also came there clean. Money can be poured into breakfast clubs in schools so that youngsters at least start the day with some food in their stomachs, so that they can concentrate for the rest of the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/4">The effect of that initiative was that the school moved from the bottom 5 per cent. at key stage 2 into the top 5 per cent. over two years. However, once it had moved up, the money was no longer available and the good work was lost. That is a problem with many initiatives. It might be better to have fewer initiatives, but to have more money going directly to schools while allowing them to decide how to use it in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/5">It is important to get parents involved. Some community groups and initiatives have been helpful, such as the &quot;Parents and kids together&quot; initiative in the Sunnylands area of Carrickfergus in my constituency, but its funding is under threat. It identified a problem regarding the need for pre-school work and after-school clubs, but it did not allow parents simply to dump their youngsters at the community centre to be looked after. It demanded parental involvement. Sometimes that parental involvement was no more than an information evening about what services and courses might be available. Sometimes men were required to look after the youngsters playing football and fathers were asked to come down to help out with that. When I made a visit, I saw that many of the parents who had come along reluctantly at the start had seen the value for their youngsters, had become enthusiastic supporters and had begun to volunteer for more and more activities. Sometimes the scheme gave leadership to youngsters, such as when menfolk took them out for games. Sometimes it gave parents inspiration to find other ways of helping their youngsters. Many of them moved on to accredited courses and some then went on to other educational courses to improve their opportunities in life. Such initiatives require funding, but they can involve people who might not previously have been involved in their youngsters' education.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/6">Some initiatives have not worked and lessons can be learned from them. One is the group 1 schools initiative, under which some schools received &pound;200,000 over five years. Some received &pound;1 million over that period. I visited some of those schools with the Assembly Education Committee. There has been a lot of good work and a lot of effort, but much of it has been dissipated, perhaps because there was not enough direction. There were no boundaries for success, and although the core purpose was to raise standards, there seems to have been little monitoring. I understand that the schools involved deal with difficult youngsters, but so did many schools that received money from the schools support programme, and we have not seen the same return.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/7">One problem is that it was left to individual principals to come up with ideas. If we are to stick with initiatives, perhaps there should be sharing of best practice or even an initiatives forum so that people can find out what has happened and what has been good in other schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/8">Another thing that we need to consider is the attitudes of the schools themselves. I want to be careful about what I say. Many teachers who teach in difficult areas have a difficult task. Perhaps it is because of that that they can become burnt out and cynical more quickly. I have visited many schools and seen the kind of inspirational teaching that is done. Nevertheless, in many cases, it is a fact that teachers who have been teaching difficult youngsters in difficult schools for a long time sometimes lose their initial enthusiasm. The schools themselves tend to be faced with declining numbers and therefore budgetary problems. They have all kinds of resource problems. Perhaps the new, enthusiastic teachers are the first to be made redundant in many such cases, thereby leaving a gap in those schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/9">There is a role for the inspectorate, which I sometimes think is a bit cowardly. Inspectors may come in and say that such and such a teacher is having problems or that a class was not well taught, but leave it up to the school and the principal to decide what should happen. It is rare that an inspector will put his name to a report stating that a teacher needs to be moved on or needs retraining&mdash;the decision is usually left up to the school. Inspectors need to take a more proactive approach if they think that failure may be partly the result of the need for some staffing changes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15a.466.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" speakername="Angela Smith" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"  colnum="466"  time="011:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060215/halltext/60215h02.htm#60215h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.466.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> on securing the debate and on choosing what is perhaps one of the most topical issues in Northern Ireland at present. It is certainly one of the most important if we are to consider what happens in Northern Ireland in the future. I enjoy my discussions on education with the hon. Gentleman, and I believe that we are as one on many issues. We have similar outlooks on what we seek to achieve for the education system in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/2">The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight areas of educational disadvantage. Kids have one chance in school. We fail them if we do not give them the opportunity to make the best life chance that they possibly can through the education system, and we should take that on board in everything that we do to improve education.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/3">This debate is not just about fairness for the individual, but about the future needs of our economy. The hon. Gentleman rightly highlighted academic vocational education. Unless we offer a twin-track approach providing every child with the opportunity for academic and vocational education, we will not meet the needs of 21st century Northern Ireland. We will not produce the people whom we need as plumbers, doctors, parents and so on, and we will not address the need to ensure that people have the required skills and abilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/4">The hon. Gentleman also highlighted the problem&mdash;we have to acknowledge it before we can do anything about it&mdash;of far too many young people leaving our schools without achieving their full potential. Across Northern Ireland as a whole, 6 per cent. of them leave school with no GCSEs. In the most deprived areas, about which I know he is concerned, that proportion rises to 14 per cent. One quarter of 14-year-olds fall short of the expected standard in literacy and numeracy. In some schools in the most deprived areas, which he and I have visited, the figure is closer to three quarters, and more than 20 per cent. of adults have low literacy and numeracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/5">Those figures surprise some people. When we debate post-primary education and the removal of academic selection, we often hear about Northern Ireland having had the best results in the whole UK&mdash;no one can touch Northern Ireland's exam results. That is true at one level, but those figures and that success mask deep-seated problems that we have a duty to address. I fully take on board the hon. Gentleman's comments that just removing academic selection would not achieve the outcomes that we want, but I point out that it is part of a package to improve life opportunities for every child that includes changing the curriculum across Northern Ireland and giving support to schools that need it. Those things together can make a difference. I always think that there is only one opportunity in life and politics to make a difference, and we should take it. We are addressing the problem for the benefit of not only children, but the Northern Ireland economy as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/6">We need to avoid the easy option that some people take of blaming the parents, school or teachers. We are talking about deep-seated issues, and we have to consider the answers to them in the round. We need to consider all the factors that influence educational attainment, and the hon. Gentleman is right to highlight that that is not a job for education alone. I often discuss with my officials and with politicians in Northern Ireland the fact that if we try to deal with disadvantage in education and lack of achievement through the education system alone, we will not succeed; we have to consider the matter holistically, and involve the health service and housing. The Department for Social Development will look into those problems as well. Together, we can tackle the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/7">Parental support for the school is key; the hon. Gentleman highlighted the differences that it can make. We have found in disadvantaged areas as well as others that parents and young people recognise the value of education. We need to find ways of channelling that recognition and giving parents support so that they can help their youngsters in school.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/8">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the number of initiatives. It is fair to say that the Department has not sat on its hands ignoring the problem; there have been a number of initiatives to achieve what is needed. He mentioned that there were 58 or 59 programmes, but the number is irrelevant. I met a group of primary and secondary school principals who were talking about the number of initiatives that came through to schools. I asked, &quot;If you could get rid of some of these, which would you choose?&quot; They said, &quot;Well, none, because they are all valuable.&quot; Although there are initiatives and they are valued, we have to streamline them and make it easier for schools to be involved in them&mdash;and, where there are problems, we have to take them on board and address them.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/9">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the school support programme, which normally gives a school three years of intensive professional help and support. Some 193 schools are or have been involved, and 26 are currently on the programme, which is worth &pound;9.4 million. It is time-limited, and not open-ended. The idea behind the programme is that schools get the support that they need and move forward. There should then be a review on removing that support, because the school should have achieved its objectives through the programme. However, I take on board what he said, and I will come back to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/10">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the group 1 initiative, which is &pound;200,000 a year for schools in severe difficulties. He was concerned about the lack of monitoring and the role of the inspectorate. The action planning, monitoring and evaluation are intrinsic parts of the process, but I share some of his concerns. I will take on board some of his comments about the education and training inspectorate. Since I became Minister with responsibility for education, I have had regular meetings with the ETI, and I am impressed by its knowledge, commitment and drive for the education system. Perhaps we should incorporate it more in policy making, and take on board its comments when we look to move forward on those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/11">The Government and the inspectorate have no interest in supporting those who are not going to be good teachers. If teachers are having the difficulties and problems that the hon. Gentleman mentions&mdash;if they are getting worn out, tired and put under tremendous pressure&mdash;they should get all the support that we can give them; but if teachers are really not able to teach, and teaching is not the profession that best suits them, then we should support them in looking into alternative professions. I share some of his concerns about the group 1 programme. There will be a review of the school improvements programme as a whole, and I give him an assurance that it will deal with the issues that he highlighted. Unless we review it and look into how we can do things better in future, we will not address the problems that he and I want to address. I shall announce the details of that review shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/12">The literacy and numeracy strategies have been very successful. We can see how results have improved in Northern Ireland schools and how, at the lower levels, where there is disadvantage and underachievement, those strategies are making a difference; I am pleased with how they are working. The reading recovery programme has also been very successful. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the dissemination of good practice, and some &pound;15 million is being put into that. There may be better ways to share good practice, as the inspectorate highlighted.</p>

	<p pid="a.469.1/1">We always recognised that there would be costs in implementing SENDO. If the hon. Gentleman is asking whether I can give a commitment that every school will have everything that it needs, I should say that that would be quite difficult, but certainly money has been allocated for that. Schools to which I have spoken have been very supportive of inclusion where it is appropriate for the individual child, the school and other children in the school. I have met representatives from a number of mainstream schools that have included children with disabilities, and they have reported that where inclusion suits the pupil, it has been a success. We keep that issue under review to give support to the schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/2">I should also highlight the &quot;Entitled 2 Succeed&quot; programme, which looks into the curriculum, as well as collaboration and transfer between schools. That has the potential&mdash;largely through the curriculum&mdash;to address the points made by the hon. Member for East Antrim about ensuring academic and vocational support for every young person who wants it.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/3">The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of leadership in schools. It is important that there be effective, high-quality leaders in schools. In a number of schools that I visited, I could see where that made a difference. If a head teacher inspires the staff and pupils, one can see a school lift off, and it is not just the results that change, but the behaviour and aspiration of pupils. We are keen to pursue that. There are some good examples of regional training units and children's and students' services, but we want to do more in working with heads to improve capacity. The head teacher from my previous school, in my constituency, was in Northern Ireland recently, talking with people involved in the education services, and one thing that I have found useful is heads giving support to other heads. Heads who have that inspirational leadership really want to pass it on to other heads. That is another area that we have to develop further.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/4">The message that I want to give today is that the Government are very much attuned to wanting to give support to all pupils in Northern Ireland, so that we not only maintain our high levels of academic excellence, but ensure that young people who are currently underperforming in the education system have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Part of the answer is ensuring that the finance and support are in place, but we are spending the money that we have far too thinly across Northern Ireland's schools. I am very concerned whenever I speak to head teachers who have to give up being a full-time head to go into the classroom and teach full-time because of funding in the school. That is not because there is a lack of funding; the amount of funding going to schools is constantly increasing, but we are spending it across too many schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/5">The hon. Gentleman asked about rationalisation. I have spoken to the boards about that. Under the capital programme that I shall announce shortly, we will see whether there are opportunities to rationalise schools, and to support merging, amalgamations and closures where appropriate. If we do not take that on board and make sure that we have a schools estate that is fit for purpose, we will have too many schools that are not sustainable. That will put unacceptable pressure on schools that have to finance their work while money is being drained by too many schools across the board. We want to take that on board, and I give him an assurance that we will do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/6">I fully endorse the hon. Gentleman's point about schools being hubs in their communities. We already have breakfast clubs and activities to promote good health for young people; there is no doubt that children who eat better and who have good health learn better. There are also links to parents through Sure Start family learning programmes. There is support for study through homework clubs, too, where children have the opportunity to work with other children and get support enabling them to undertake the work that they have been given. There is clear evidence that that helps their studies to improve. There are also much closer links between education, health and social services, because we are bringing those together; we are taking a holistic approach to the young person. The children and young person's funding package, which the state announced in the budget process, is designed to tackle those issues to improve the life chances of young people. Further details will be announced shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/7">In conclusion, I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising the subject. I hope that I have addressed some of his concerns, and I look forward to discussing the issues further with him and seeing what more we can do to ensure that every single young person reaches their full potential and gets the life chances that they deserve.</p>

	<p pid="a.473.0/1">I welcome this debate, because I always give the Government the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps others in the Chamber are less generous, but I want to hear what the Minister has to say, because I cannot believe that a Labour Government would act in that fashion. I am prepared to suspend judgment, although I will touch on the matter later.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/2">I hope that the Minister will largely agree&mdash;although perhaps not entirely&mdash;with a fair summary of the position, which is that it was unchallenged and widely understood before <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January</phrase>. There was then a debate about the Post Office in the other place in which Baroness Prosser, a member of the Post Office board, made a speech; she seems to have put the cat among the pigeons. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Government actions threaten us on two fronts. The first is their proposal to set up 70 high street offices to vet and interview applicants for passports. This would dig into the &pound;12 million net contribution this business currently brings in. Secondly&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/4">and relevant to this debate&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the Department for Work and Pensions has notified us that the current Post Office account card will cease when the contract ends in 2010&ndash;11. It is simply not possible to maintain the service politically demanded while at the same time being deprived of the wherewithal to underwrite the cost of that service.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 677, c. 329.]</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/6">It was suggested that the DWP had unilaterally taken the initiative to indicate that it intended to end the Post Office account when the contract ended in 2010, despite a well accepted understanding that, although the existing contract was an interim one, with a seven-year life and an objective that had been agreed by everybody involved, every effort would be made to allow it to evolve into a better arrangement that suited post office customers, the Post Office and the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/7">Unfortunately, that statement by the noble Baroness was not referred to or expanded on by the Minister who replied to the debate in the other place. So the story is out: the implication of Baroness Prosser's remarks is that unilateral action has been taken via the DWP, and there is to be no &quot;son of Post Office accounts&quot;&mdash;no life after 2010. The attitude is, &quot;We do not care what is said by the Treasury, the DTI or No. 10's performance unit, in 2010 we are coming out regardless of the consequences.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/8">If the Minister in the other place had answered the point at the time, this debate might have been unnecessary. However, the remark in that debate referred to pensioners all over the UK, who did not want to give up their pension books and who eventually compromised and accepted a Post Office card account. They now feel let down, angry and fearful. They believe that their cards will be withdrawn and they will have to have bank accounts whether they like it or not. The hard-working people who run sub-post offices genuinely fear that the Government have reneged on the agreement and are determined to move the business out of post offices and into banks. That will mean massive closures and not a few bankruptcies.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/9">This debate is a good chance for the Minister to kill that misunderstanding and reassure people. I sincerely hope that that will happen. This is not a pleasurable debate; it reflects a lot of worry among small businesses, vulnerable pensioners and benefit recipients. The sooner that fear is dispelled the better. I still worry, however. In the past half hour, I have received some e-mails. The one from Postwatch says:</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/10" class="indent">&quot;We were surprised to learn that the government's subsidy for the POCA will not be continued&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/11">That is from people who know the situation. If they are surprised, one wonders what is going on. The most worrying one was from the Post Office itself. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The Department for Work and Pensions have informed Post Office Ltd that they will not support the Post Office card account beyond 2010. This notification is given under the terms of the current agreement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/13">That is worrying, and it needs to be dealt with, because we have a Government commitment to life after 2010 for the Post Office account and the plastic card for those who wish it, yet this suggests that the DWP is acting unilaterally and has given notice. It would be useful to clear that up.</p>

	<p pid="a.475.4/1">It is genuinely much gentler. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.475.4/2" class="indent">&quot;DWP will . . . write to 35,000 existing POCA customers with bank account details, suggesting they may like to move over to a bank account payment and requesting their bank details.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.475.4/3">It we consider the two approaches, the truth will lie somewhere in the middle. It is still a disturbing situation and we would welcome clarification from the Minister. Much gentler that might have been, but, however phrased, it puts pressure on the customer. It is reminiscent of past bad behaviour and, above all, it is a breach of faith with sub- postmasters and Post Office account holders and takes a potential 35,000 customers away from sub-post offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.4/4">In my former incarnation as a trade union official, I would not have accepted it if an employer who had a seven-year agreement with me sought to interfere with it in such a way in only the third year. The Government and the DWP made an agreement and signed a contract. To do anything without consultation in the third year of a seven-year contract is provocative and needs to be rethought.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, and I apologise for the fact that I will have to leave to meet a constituent at 3 pm to discuss this very issue. For me, this came to light only two years ago when the whole issue of the pension credit was being considered, when I discovered through Pension Service staff that the account was short-term. If there is a problem, it is the fact that it was not spelt out to everyone when the Post Office card account was introduced that it would be only until 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.3/2">I agree with what the spokesman for the Scottish National party, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase>, said about this being an issue in rural areas. We have a particular difficulty in Scotland, because of the major banks. It would have meant additional business if the major banks had joined up, and we might have been in a more sound position.</p>

	<p pid="a.477.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Bercow, it is a pleasure to speak with you in the Chair. I reiterate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the comments of the hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase>; perhaps this will be a temporary sojourn on the Chairmen's Panel and you will be on the Front Bench soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/2">I congratulate the hon. Member for Leeds, East on landing this debate, which is of great interest to many of our constituents. I have worked on this issue as a constituency MP for a long time. As I have told the House before, a few years ago I drove around 28 post offices in my constituency, a 150-mile drive, and established that in many of them the proportion of turnover related to benefits was extraordinarily high. It was 60 per cent. in Gobowen, 80 per cent. in Treflach, 70 per cent. in Pant, 60 per cent. in West Felton, and 50 per cent. in Baschurch and Prees.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/3">At that time, I was working with a splendid postmaster, Colin Doyle from Knockin. I went to see the then Minister of State for Energy, E-Commerce and Postal Services, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" name="Stephen Timms">the hon. Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms)</phrase>, to discuss the real barriers that were being put up by authorities, which were being backed by the Government, to put people off getting a card account. We were told on the Floor of the House that there were only three steps to be taken, but I went through it with Colin and we established that in some cases there were a minimum of 22 steps, and that applications for cards would be rejected for the slightest of errors, in order to force people to take payments directly into bank accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/4">The outgoing Conservative Government had a perfectly sensible swipe card scheme, which would have had the advantage of the security that the Government wisely seek, and would have kept income going through sub-post offices. However, that scheme was unwisely scrapped because there was great belief in the universal bank. The hon. Member for East Ham, who is one of the most respected members of the Government and whom I completely trust, said that he genuinely thought that everyone would have an opportunity to partake in the universal bank in a few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/5">The Minister who is here today gave me a parliamentary reply only yesterday saying that the following banks do not offer current accounts through post offices: Abbey, Bank of Scotland, First Trust, Halifax, HSBC, NatWest, Northern bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Ulster bank and Yorkshire bank. We are a country mile away from having a universal bank option and enabling all benefits customers to take direct payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/6">At no stage in any discussions was it hinted that for those who had struggled through the jungle with their machetes, survived the passage of 22 obstacles and got their cards, this was a temporary option. It was thought that having made a substantial investment&mdash;the Minister will tell us how much; the Government trumpet those figures all the time&mdash;in the new system, it would be there for good. I have a letter from the hon. Member for East Ham, which does not even hint that there was a 2010 deadline.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/7">I enjoy the role of secretary to the all-party group on sub-post offices, which is chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase>. We were astonished on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>, when one of our meetings was attended by Colin Baker, general secretary of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, to be told by him about the three trials. That was the most extraordinary revelation.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/8">I ask the Minister to confirm what consultation he had with anyone, not least with his colleagues in the DTI. I asked the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry about the subject in questions recently, and he seemed bemused. I raised it with the Leader of the House in the main Chamber and he ran into semantics about the difference between the words &quot;impermanent&quot; and &quot;temporary&quot;. Again, he did not seem to realise the consequences of what the Government are proposing through their arm, the DWP.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/9">What consultation has taken place? What happens if one of the 3,000 new benefits claimants does not want to open a card account? What would happen to one of the 35,000 existing customers who did not like the tone of the letter from the DWP, however it is phrased and even if it is in cuddly language from the parliamentary Labour party? What happens if one of the 2,500 existing customers is not prepared to have their payments put into a bank account or if they are with one of the banks mentioned on the list in the reply to the parliamentary question? What will the consequences be? What is the legal basis for the change? What rights do benefits claimants have not to be bamboozled by the Government and forced into new arrangements that none of us have heard of?</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/10">It was alarming in our meeting that the chief executive of the Post Office, Adam Crozier, said that he would need 4,000 post offices to run a mail service. The Government have done grievous damage to post offices. An income of &pound;400 million through the benefit payments has been taken away from post offices, and it is probably down to &pound;160 million with the 4.3 million existing card account holders. If they are to be dragooned into some form of direct payment and made to surrender their cards in 2010, what will be the role of the 14,400 post offices when only 4,000 are needed to run a mail service? The Government do not appear to have thought that through.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/11">There may be sensible, rational gains and savings to be made. We would all support that; we do not want the Government to waste public money. There may be savings in having direct payments and dropping the card account scheme. However, there has been substantial investment in recent years and benefit income is the core of the sub-post office network. The post offices that I have visited&mdash;we have been through this in previous debates&mdash;have other business tacked on. There is stationery related to the direct benefits payment at the post office, but it may also sell dry food, fresh food and fruit. Many post offices have an off-licence attached, or they may sell cold food or products for tourists. Benefits are always the core base from which the hub of the village shop is built up, and that performs a valuable service.</p>

	<p pid="a.485.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> for securing this debate and making his case effectively and eloquently. Rather than repeat many of the points that he made, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to just two issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.0/2">The all-party group on small shops, of which I and many hon. Members present are members, published a survey today called &quot;High Street Britain: 2015&quot;. One of its conclusions is that the Government should directly support and expand the specific services offered by the sub-post office network. The sub-postmasters' submission to the inquiry went further and suggested that they could be paid to provide advice centres for the Government. Many of them already give a wide range of advice for free.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.0/3">The Welsh Assembly Government have given &pound;4.1 million of Post Office development fund money to support and develop post office branches located in the 125 most deprived and isolated electoral divisions throughout Wales, including a number in my own constituency. The grant was given to improve their future viability. If a post office closes within three years of receiving a grant, the money, quite properly, must be repaid.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.0/4">The killing off of the Post Office card account is a real threat to the viability of post offices that serve small rural communities or deprived urban communities. Is that really joined-up Government thinking? The card account brings people into the post office who then make other purchases there or in an adjacent corner shop, helping to make those businesses viable. Furthermore, in a close-knit and caring community, if Mrs. Jones does not pop in to use her card account, the post office staff will make inquiries to check that she is safe and well and ensure that nothing untoward has happened to her. I hope that the Minister is listening and that he realises post offices are the heart of our communities. If the heart is ripped out, the community is killed off.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15a.490.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1468" speakername="David Ruffley" colnum="490"  time="015:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060215/halltext/60215h03.htm#60215h03_spnew59">
	<p pid="a.490.0/1">It is always a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> on securing this debate and on a superb speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/3">The future of the Post Office card account is escalating into a major political problem for the Government. More than one third of the Members of the House of Commons have signed early-day motions 147 and 1531, which express concern about the future of that account. The Post Office card account cannot be debated in isolation from the future of the sub-post office network, as many excellent contributions today made clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/4">I have no desire to play Punch and Judy politics on this issue. There is a great deal of cross-party agreement and I am prepared to accept that the Government have put many millions of pounds into social network payments and the urban reinvention programme, but there are still some serious questions that the Minister must address because Government rhetoric is simply not being matched by Government action.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/5">The Cabinet Office performance and innovation unit's report of June 2000 assured us that over the next five years, there would be development of</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/6" class="indent">&quot;a shared understanding of the role that post offices should play in the longer term&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/7">and that advice would be given to the Government on the options for the policy framework after 2006. It is now 2006 and there is not much sign of a framework. The Government have not said whether the social network payment will extend beyond 2008. They have not said whether Post Office Ltd will have its current duty to prevent avoidable closures in rural areas extended beyond March 2006. We are now told that after 2010 there will be no Post Office card accounts and that everyone should have realised from day one that that was the deal. Even worse, three pilot schemes have been introduced this year out of the blue, as hon. Members made clear, with no consultation and, as the hon. Member for Leeds, East said, without Parliament being properly informed.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/8">The pilot schemes are likely to have the effect of ensuring that well before 2010 a large number of Post Office account holders will have their accounts closed, 35,000 existing customers will receive a letter from the DWP asking for their account details, 3,000 new benefit claimants will not have a right to open a Post Office card account, and 2,500 existing customers will unilaterally be told that their payments must be paid into a bank account and not an existing Post Office card account.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/9">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1957" name="Robert Smith">the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> said, all that echoes the rather high-handed, bullying tactics deployed by the Department when the order books were phased out.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/10">Post Office card accounts are very popular and more than 4.5 million people use them. Some do so purely to support their local post office, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> said in a powerful observation. In other cases, as Age Concern's director general made clear, people opened Post Office card accounts because it was &quot;easier for older people without a bank account to receive their cash securely without the fear of becoming overdrawn or paying extra charges.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/11">That was the beauty of that simple, straightforward account. Many pensioners who did not have traditional bank accounts found that even basic bank accounts did not meet their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/12">The paper from Citizens Advice on banking benefits makes it clear that basic bank accounts are not a panacea. There may be difficulties getting a credit score to obtain eligibility for such an account. There may be problems with identification documents and the length of time it takes to open an account. Pensioners in my constituency said that they did not want a basic bank account because they would be bombarded with banking bumph trying to sell them things that they did not want. That put them off the whole idea of getting involved with the basic bank current account system with Barclays or any high street bank. Those are reasons why the Post Office card account was the choice of so many people.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/13">We have heard that the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters was not told when the Post Office card account was created that it would be a temporary contract or that it might end in 2010. Most of us&mdash;the Minister is the exception&mdash;agree that that is the case. There was never a clear statement that the account would go beyond 2010, but nor was there a statement that it would not. In the Government's response to the Trade and Industry Committee's report, &quot;People, Pensions and Post Offices&quot;, in September 2003, they said:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/14" class="indent">&quot;This is the first year of a seven-year contract and it is too early to speculate about what might happen in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/15">I took the trouble of listening to the Minister on that great programme, &quot;Moneybox&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-21">21 January</phrase>. You may think that I should get out more, Mr. Bercow, but it is a very good programme. It disclosed a lot of information and the Minister said of the contract for card accounts:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Well, they were always an interim arrangement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/17">Paul Lewis, the interviewer, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/18" class="indent">&quot;Well you say it was always intended&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/19">to be interim</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/20" class="indent">&quot;but I asked your office for any evidence from 2000 to 2003. They couldn't produce any.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/21">The Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/22" class="indent">&quot;It's always been in the contract. Now we didn't speak publicly about the contract for commercial reasons.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/23">The Government are speaking publicly now, but it is a bit late. It really is unacceptable for the Minister to say that people knew about the interim nature of the account. How on earth could they have known something that was stated in a contract that nobody could see or know about for commercial reasons, as the Minister said on the radio? Such logic is usually found in the pages of &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/24">The Minister tried to get out of the hole he had dug for himself by saying that there are four years left on the contract and that the Government would now start helping people in a sensitive way to migrate to other accounts. The Minister talks about new accounts that will be developed by Post Office Ltd. That sounds fine, but, unfortunately, the sub-postmasters in my Suffolk constituency to whom I have spoken know only that they have no chance of planning their business for the long term. They fear that the pilots will be extended and that they will drive people away from POCAs long before 2010, with a commensurate loss of subsidy to urban and rural post offices. It is for that reason that the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters referred to the DWP tactics as underhand. I believe that there is another word for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/25">Direct payments removed more than &pound;400 million of annual revenue from the post office network. Not coincidentally, that move resulted in the closure of 2,500 post offices. The announcement of the termination of the POCA in 2010&mdash;in effect, before 2010, for the reasons that I gave&mdash;will be a further grievous blow to post offices. They will lose income; it is as simple as that. If post offices close, not only will pensioners stop accessing benefits and pensions through the POCA, but no one will be able to access money from basic bank accounts, or any bank account, because there will be nothing at all in the village, settlement or suburb.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/26">In conclusion, we need an urgent review of the future of the POCA and the strategy for the post office network. First, it would be useful to know on what basis the Government say that it costs &pound;1 a time to pay pensions or benefits on the POCA, compared with 1p on a traditional bank account. Sub-postmasters get about 15p for every &pound;100 withdrawn from a POCA, but no one seems to know what the remainder of the money is or whether it is a subsidy that the Government will continue in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/27">Secondly, we need a clear indication from the Minister today that he has spoken to his colleagues at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the DTI about doing a cost-benefit analysis of the overall cost to the whole of Government should the change go through and lead to closures of post offices. My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire also made this point. What about the loss of jobs? More than 14,500 sub-post offices employ more than four people, many of them part-time. What will happen to them, and what will be the social and economic costs of those job losses?</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/28">I conclude by quoting the words of Sally Reeves, who is an NFSP representative in East Anglia and the sub-postmistress of the excellent Stowupland post office in my constituency. She stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/29" class="indent">&quot;If you listen to the DTI and what they are saying about Government investment you want to give them credit for that. But when you hear the DWP talking about the scrapping of the post office card account . . . you ask yourself 'whatever happened to joined up government?'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.0/30">Perhaps the Minister can tell us.</p>

	<p pid="a.494.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman will let me make this point, I will take interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.494.1/2">That intention was specifically covered in the contract signed by the Government and the Post Office in 2002. It is unusual to quote from contracts, but in view of what has been said by others in recent weeks, I shall do so. I shall not breach any commercial aspect of the agreement, as that would of course be incorrect. The contract states:</p>
	<p pid="a.494.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Under the Government's present policy to combat social exclusion and in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness of government and minimise fraud, Benefits recipients will receive benefits by Direct Credit.

	<p pid="a.501.3/1">It is always a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow. I ascribe my membership of the House in part to the sterling work that you did on a certain Bill a long time ago, although whether other hon. Members regard that as your finest moment, I am not entirely sure.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.3/2">I obviously begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" name="Brian H Donohoe">my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase> on securing this debate on a publication that is still relatively hot off the press. However, he was beaten to it by our noble Friend Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, who managed to initiate a debate on the findings of the Arbuthnott commission's report at exactly the same time as Sir John was unveiling it at a press conference in Scotland. There must be something in the Ayrshire water to produce such prescient and astute politicians. I also shall try to respond to the various points that other hon. Members raised and undertake to write in answer to the questions that I do not address.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.3/3">My hon. Friend asked two specific questions and a more general one about the Government's response. Let me deal with those questions straight off the bat. He said that there had not been a Scottish Grand Committee since November 2003. As far as I am aware, there have been no requests for a Scottish Grand Committee since then. Such matters are dealt with through the usual channels. I am not, nor have I ever been, one of the usual channels. However, it is within the right of any Scottish Member of Parliament to request a Scottish Grand Committee, and it is then up to the usual channels to allocate one. The fact that there has not been a Scottish Grand Committee for some time does not meant that the Government are preventing them, but that no one has requested one hitherto.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.3/4">My hon. Friend asked a straight question about whether the Government are considering holding a referendum. Let me say clearly&mdash;I know that this will come as a crushing blow to him&mdash;that the Government have no plans for such a referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.3/5">My hon. Friend asked in more general terms about the Government's initial response to the analysis and proposals in the Arbuthnott commission's report. My answer to that will form the bulk of my response, but first I shall reiterate the welcome that the Secretary of State gave to the report on the day of publication. I thank Sir John and the members of the commission for the time and effort that they put into producing the report, which forms the substance of this debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.503.3/1">I am more than happy to pay tribute to the committee and the commission for the work that they did. I did so during the Adjournment debate secured in November by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase>, and I am happy to do so again. I have absolute confidence that the commission went about the report in a professional way, and with integrity.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.3/2">That is not to say that its recommendations command universal support. They do not, and I shall come to that. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> points across the House, but Sir John explicitly rules out, for the time being, the extension of STV, which I understand is his party's policy, so he would not be particularly overwhelmed with joy about that recommendation. I am happy to pay tribute to the report, but there is no escaping the fact that it has not commanded overwhelming support. I have not made any attempt to disparage the report and I have done nothing but praise the integrity of those who carried it out. At the same time, however, it is incumbent on me to point out that there is no consensus as to how we should proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.3/3">Let me return for a second to the business of decombining the elections, which is not a bureaucratic or procedural point. There is a belief, which I share, that combining the elections is one means of seeking to maximise turnout. My hon. Friend said that he thought that turnout was decreasing because of the complexity of elections. That point has been made by others on other occasions. In the most recent elections, we have seen a reversal in the decrease in turnout, and the figures beginning to go up. That has happened in general elections, and it occurred in the by-election in Dunfermline, which had a very respectable turnout. I shall say no more about it, but the turnout was respectable, which gave me something positive to say when I was interviewed on television that night, other than how nice the weather was. We continue to believe that having the elections on the same day is one way of maximising turnout.</p>

	<p pid="a.504.1/1">Any local authority or electoral returning officer can always come forward to the Government with proposals to pilot such schemes. I think that in the May 2006 local elections in England, there will be about 16 pilots, which will include systems such as voting in supermarkets. However, I add the large caveat that the election in question is the first being done under STV, which is complicated to administer. Obviously, we must make it as simple as possible for people to vote, so we might not see an enormous amount of innovation this time around, but local authorities&mdash;and joint valuation boards in Scotland&mdash;might put forward different voting options. We will see that in the local elections in England in a few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.1/2">It is clear from this short debate that there are strongly held views on the commission's recommendations on voting systems and boundary matters. It is also clear that those strikingly divergent views do not come together in a consensus about the electoral process or boundary patterns. After considerable consideration of the STV system's merits, Sir John explicitly ruled out extending it to the election of Members to the Scottish Parliament at present. Some hon. Members will welcome that aspect of the report, but others will find it disappointing, as they have advocated that approach for many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.1/3">We have not heard a lot about this in today's debate, but the report does not promote coterminous boundaries between Holyrood and Westminster constituencies. It says that they are &quot;desirable but not essential&quot;. It was, in part, anxieties about the implications of having non-coterminous boundaries that led to the creation of the commission in the first place. Some hon. Members will welcome that conclusion, while others will not.</p>

	<p pid="a.505.1/1">No, I do not accept that the report is flawed because of that. There is some contention&mdash;I know that this was aired in the Select Committee&mdash;about whether the committee had too narrow an interpretation of its remit because it respected the essential nature of the devolution settlement, which has a proportional element. However, it is not valid to claim that the Arbuthnott report is fundamentally flawed. An element of proportional representation is an essential feature in it, but there are ways of delivering an element of proportionality in the system other than the recommendations that Sir John made.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire is, of course, the eponymous creator of the Donohoe solution, as history will record it. The commission examines that solution in pages 12 to 15 of its report, but does not support it. I appreciate that that is a disappointment to him, although it might please others.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.1/3">This debate has illustrated that there is simply no consensus on how to proceed with this. That is why I think it sensible to take some time to seek consensus, although that might not be possible as unanimity is rarely possible in these matters. When it comes to the very essence of democracy and how we go about electing those who govern us, it is incumbent on us to seek the broadest possible consensus, as we did with the Electoral Administration Bill that is making its way through Parliament, which is a broadly consensual Bill. We should therefore take our time in responding to the report. We should listen to what hon. Members have to say, but on the understanding that there is clearly no consensus on how to proceed.</p>

	<p pid="a.507.2/1">I was quoting Professor Crawford's opinion, which was commissioned by the all-party parliamentary group and published in December. It is entitled &quot;Extraordinary rendition of terrorist suspects through the United Kingdom&quot;, and states that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/2" class="indent">&quot;the United Kingdom is bound by its own obligations in respect of torture, and not by any view taken by the United States as to what constitutes torture . . . Under international law, States are prohibited from sending a person to a territory where it is believed that he will be tortured. This obligation . . . arises both under general international law and under international treaties to which the United Kingdom is a party.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/3">Professor Crawford went on to observe:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The United States ratified the Torture Convention with an extensive reservation dealing with various aspects of the application of the Convention in United States law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/5">Therefore, it is not sufficient for the UK Government simply to seek cover from Secretary Rice's assurances. The test in the UK is not the US implied test of whether the risk of torture is more likely than not, but whether there is a real risk that a person would be tortured if returned.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/6">Moreover, it seems reckless of the UK Government to accept US assurances without reservation or questioning when we have all witnessed the way in which the US Government have operated Guantanamo Bay, whose procedures and presence offend every principle of international jurisprudence.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/7">I understand that the officials who prepared the Minister's briefing in response to this debate are from the Foreign Office's counter-terrorism department. They cannot be insensitive to the fact that Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld approved 24 interrogation techniques for use at Guantanamo Bay. In an article entitled &quot;US Abuse of Iraqi Detainees at Abu Ghraib Prison&quot; in the <i>American Journal of International Law, </i>Tom Farrer observes that the techniques are aimed at</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/8" class="indent">&quot;significantly increasing the fear level in a detainee&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/9">and</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/10" class="indent">&quot;attacking or insulting the ego of a detainee&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/11">It is clear beyond peradventure that the US Government have engaged in cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, both at Abu Ghraib and at Guantanamo Bay, yet they claim that that treatment does not amount to torture. The UK Government should not be associated with those semantics.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/12">In last month's edition of &quot;International Affairs&quot;, the journal of Chatham House, Alex Bellamy, who is a lecturer in peace and conflict studies at the university of Queensland and recently wrote a book called &quot;Just Wars&quot; and is an expert in that area of policy, observed that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/13" class="indent">&quot;there is a significant amount of circumstantial evidence to suggest use of torture by the US and some of its allies in the war on terror is both widespread and systematic . . . a coordinated strategy of information gathering, based on torture&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/14">Bellamy went on to observe that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/15" class="indent">&quot;there is evidence to suggest that successive US Attorney Generals have attempted to create a permissive legal environment for the use of torture . . . the current Attorney General, Roberto Gonzales, played a key role as White House Legal Counsel in sidelining the State Department's concerns about the use of torture. In a memorandum to the President on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-25">25 January 2002</phrase>, Gonzales argued that:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/16" class="indent">'The nature of the new war on terrorism places a high premium on other factors, such as the ability to quickly obtain information from captured terrorists and their sponsors and in order to avoid further atrocities against American civilians. This new paradigm renders obsolete (the 1949 Geneva Protocol on the Treatment of Prisoners of War) strict limitations on questioning of any prisoners'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/17">Clearly, the United States has decided to abandon respect for international law. Indeed, President Bush clearly stated that in 2003 when he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/18" class="indent">&quot;International Law? I better call my lawyer . . . I don't know what you are talking about by International Law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/19">The issue for the House is whether the United Kingdom Government have also decided to abandon the principles of international law. Once torture becomes accepted in any legal system, it spreads like an infectious disease. It saves the labour of investigation and hardens those who become accustomed to its use. The Foreign Affairs Committee has accused the Government of failing to deal with its questions on rendition with appropriate transparency and accountability and has recommended that the Government end their policy of what the Committee described as &quot;obfuscation&quot;. Such behaviour by the Government raises the question of what they think they have to hide.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/20">The matters that I am talking about clearly need proper explanation. For example, minutes of the meeting between US justice officials and EU officials in January 2003 show that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/21" class="indent">&quot;both sides agreed on . . . increased use of European Transit facilities to support the return of criminal/inadmissible aliens . . . and improving cooperation in removals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/22">Ministers seem to suggest that such allegations are without foundation, so why did the legal affairs committee of the Council of Europe publish, a matter of weeks ago, a report that concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/23" class="indent">&quot;drawing on all this concordant information and evidence we can say that there is a great deal of coherent convergent evidence pointing to the existence of 'relocation' or 'outsourcing' of torture. Acts of torture or severe violation of a detainee's dignity through the administration of inhuman or degrading treatment are carried out outside national territory and beyond the authority of the national intelligence services&quot; ?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/24">Those are the conclusions of a committee of elected representatives drawn from throughout Europe, reflecting the whole range of political views.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/25">Former CIA agent Robert Baer was quoted by the BBC as saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/26" class="indent">&quot;if you want a serious interrogation you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want him to be tortured you send him to Syria. If you want him to disappear . . . then you send him to Egypt&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/27">Does the Foreign Office consider that he was fantasising? Was a former British ambassador to Syria, Henry Hogger, making things up when in December, commenting on the case of Mahrar Arar, a Canadian citizen who was taken to Syria and tortured, he observed that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/28" class="indent">&quot;what was going on in Syria at the time was not unlike the way it has been described&quot; ?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/29">When Craig Murray, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, published on the internet copies of telegrams that he sent to London between 2002 and 2004, warning that information being passed on by the Uzbek security services was &quot;torture tainted&quot;, was he fantasising? Mr. Murray also published on the internet a document that clearly appears to be the text of a Foreign Office legal opinion seeking to argue that the use by intelligence services of information extracted through torture is not a violation of the UN convention against torture.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/30">Perhaps it was a similar approach to information extracted through torture that caused the Government to contest the assertion that the Special Immigration Appeals Commission should not receive evidence that has or may have been procured by torture inflicted in order to obtain evidence by officials of a foreign state. The judgment of the House of Lords, given on <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase> in the case of A (FC) and others v. the Secretary of State for the Home Department, should be required reading for every Member of the House and every Minister. The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, comprising Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Hoffman, Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, Lord Carswell and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, unanimously found against the Government. It is difficult to imagine a stronger representation by the Appellate Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/31">Lord Bingham observed that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/32" class="indent">&quot;the English common law has regarded torture and its fruits with abhorrence for over 500 years . . . I am startled, even a little dismayed, at the suggestion . . . that this deeply-rooted tradition and an international obligation solemnly and explicitly undertaken can be overridden . . . The issue is one of constitutional principle, whether evidence obtained by torturing another human being may lawfully be admitted against a party to proceedings in a British court . . . To that question I would give a very clear negative answer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/33">Lords Nicholls said:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/34" class="indent">&quot;Torture is not acceptable. This is a bedrock moral principle in this country. For centuries, the common law has set its face against torture . . . Torture attracts universal condemnation . . . No civilised society condones its use. Unhappily, condemnatory words are not always matched by conduct.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/35">Lord Hoffman said:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/36" class="indent">&quot;The use of torture is dishonourable. It corrupts and degrades the state which uses it and the legal system which accepts it . . . many people in the United States . . . have felt their country dishonoured by its use of torture outside the jurisdiction and its practice of extra-legal &quot;rendition&quot; of suspects to countries where they would be tortured . . . the rejection of torture . . . has a special iconic importance as the touchstone of a humane and civilised legal system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/37">If a member of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords feels confident to say in terms in a judgment in a landmark case on torture, res judicata, that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/38" class="indent">&quot;many people in the United States . . . have felt their country dishonoured by its use of torture outside the jurisdiction and its practice of extra-legal 'rendition&quot; of suspects'&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/39">can Ministers be surprised that hon. Members on both sides of this House and large numbers of people outside it are less than convinced when the Foreign Secretary simply repeats the mantra of the US Secretary of State that that country does not indulge in torture?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/40">Lord Hope observed:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/41" class="indent">&quot;Views as to where the line is to be drawn may differ sharply from state to state. This can be seen from the list of practices authorised for use in Guantanamo Bay by the US authorities, some of which would shock the conscience if they were ever to be authorised for use in our own country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/42">It must be of very real concern that at the start of the 21st century it is necessary for the most senior judges in the land to express the view put simply by Lord Brown:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/43" class="indent">&quot;Torture is an unqualified evil. It can never be justified. Rather it must always be punished.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/44">There have been other recent cases in respect of which the Government's approach has been equivocal. There was the judgement on the torture and killing of Iraqis by British forces, published on <phrase class="date" code="">22 December</phrase>. The Government argued unsuccessfully in respect of the right to rely on evidence extracted under torture and to be exempt from liability for torture carried out by British troops outside the UK. There is also the case of Mitchell and others <i>v. </i>Al-Dali and others. I will not say too much about that case. It has been before the Court of Appeal and I understand that it is going to the House of Lords, so it is almost certainly sub judice, but what is not sub judice but is a matter of public record is the letter of Geoffrey Bindman published in <i>The Guardian</i>. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/45" class="indent">&quot;My clients . . . seek redress against the officials responsible for torturing them in Saudi Arabia. Our Government intervened unsuccessfully in the Court of Appeal in support of the Saudi claim to immunity for the Saudi Kingdom and its officials. The Court of Appeal rejected immunity for the officials and the Saudi Kingdom is appealing to the House of Lords. Again, the British Government are seeking to intervene against its own citizens, yet Article 14 of the UN Convention Against Torture, requires every Government 'to ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/46">There are a number of questions that Ministers should answer and of which I have given this Minister notice, so there should be no surprises for him here. In the Foreign Office memo of <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase> to No. 10, officials concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/47" class="indent">&quot;we now cannot say that we have received no such requests for the use of UK territory or air space for extraordinary rendition.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/48">To whom do the Government believe that requests for rendition would be made? How was it that it took the machinery of government some weeks to resolve the line to take on the issue? What representations have the Government made to the US Administration about the practice of extraordinary rendition?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/49">The US Government have now clearly acknowledged that they have rendered detainees to other countries for questioning; indeed, that practice is now well documented in a number of cases, such as that of Maher Arar, which I have already cited, who was kidnapped in Canada. Amnesty International has told me of some 78 Gulfstream V Turbojet flights that have stopped over in the UK since 2001 that could be connected to rendition. One could be walking down the street in any part of the world and be kidnapped. Have the Government asked the US Administration in terms whether, and if so how many, detainees have passed through UK airspace or airports?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/50">Have the US Administration sought permission for any state flights to pass over UK airspace or land in the UK to transfer detainees? Has any agency in the US Administration, including the CIA, asked for such permission and have the UK Government ever granted a blanket permission for the passage of such flights? That is particularly important because the December memo to No. 10 admits that there is no way of the UK Government knowing whether any detainees captured by British forces in Iraq or Afghanistan have subsequently been transferred by the US to interrogation centres overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/51">Whatever the US Government choose to do, the UK Government have obligations under international law.Have the Government at any time reminded the US Administration of the higher threshold that must be passed in order to meet UK legal obligations with respect to the UN convention against torture? Has an explanation been given that UK law will have been breached if there are grounds to believe that rendition may carry a real risk of torture and that the US interpretation that such rendition will become unlawful if it is &quot;more likely than not&quot; that the person will be tortured is insufficient?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/52">Let us step back from the carefully phrased denials and examine what we know. Evidence has emerged that makes these concerns plausible: the snatched photos of the cages at Guantanamo and the photographs of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. The existence of secret CIA-run prisons in eastern Europe has not been denied by the Bush Administration. There is compelling testimony from people who claim to have been shipped abroad by the US and tortured. The UK Government have not questioned the definition of torture being used by the US Government, which differs from that set out in international human rights treaties, and appears not to extend to forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The UK Government show no inclination to investigate reports of US aircraft using UK airspace or airports for rendition purposes. Is it out of the bounds of possibility that the US might not have made formal requests for the use of UK airspace for such flights, but carried them out anyway?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/53">My shopping list of what I would like the Minister to do is short&mdash;only three things. First, given the mounting evidence that UK territory has been used to assist in unlawfully transporting detainees to countries where they may face disappearance, torture or other ill-treatment, the UK Government should launch an immediate, thorough and independent investigation. Secondly, as part of such an investigation, the UK Government should ask the US Government to declare whether they have used UK airports, airspace or US military airbases on UK soil for the purposes of extraordinary rendition since 1998, with or without the approval of the UK authorities. That would include transporting detainees from, to or through UK airspace as well as servicing planes about to embark on or return from a rendition mission. Thirdly, what steps are being taken or considered to prevent future use of airspace and airports in the UK by aircraft being used for such illegal activities?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/54">Finally, I urge the UK Government to co-operate fully with the parliamentary investigations into the issue and the Council of Europe inquiry led by its secretary-general, Terry Davis, himself a former Labour Member of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/55">I submit that the Prime Minister has repeatedly failed to give a straight answer to questions about possible British Government complicity, but seeing nothing, hearing nothing and saying nothing is becoming less and less of an option.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15a.512.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" speakername="Ian Pearson" speakeroffice="The Minister for Trade"  colnum="512"  time="017:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060215/halltext/60215h05.htm#60215h05_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.512.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Bercow, and I very much welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the opportunity that the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> has given us to debate these issues today.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/2">Human rights form one of the cornerstones of this country's value system and one of the key elements in our country's social and legal structures, informing our policies, legislation, interactions with one another and our relationships with our international partners. The UK unreservedly condemns the use of torture, and is working hard with its international partners to eradicate that abhorrent practice by launching a global campaign for universal ratification of the UN convention against torture, as well as lobbying in support of its optional protocol; publishing and distributing a number of human rights handbooks specifically aimed at combating torture; and supporting anti-torture work by the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe. The UK also used its EU presidency to take forward an EU initiative to combat torture around the world. That included d&eacute;marches in 39 countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/3">The hon. Gentleman made much of allegations about illegal rendition. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has said a number of times to the House, our policy on rendition is clear. We do not deport or extradite any person to another state where there are substantial grounds to believe that that person will face a real risk of torture, or where there is a real risk that the death penalty will be applied. We have found no evidence of detainees being rendered through the UK or overseas territories since <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>. Nor have we found evidence of detainees being rendered through the UK or overseas territories since 1997 where there were substantial grounds to believe that there was a real risk of torture. We would not assist in a rendition if to do so would put us in breach of our national or international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/4">The hon. Gentleman suggests that we have been seeing nothing, hearing nothing and saying nothing. That is not the case. We have addressed the issue with the US Government. As part of our close co-operation with them over several years, including in recent months, we have made it clear to them that we expect them to seek permission to render detainees via UK territory and airspace, including overseas territories. We have made it clear to them that we will grant permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition would accord with UK law and our international obligations, and we have also made it clear to them how we understand our obligations under the UN convention against torture and the European convention on human rights. We are clear that the US would not render a detainee through UK territory or airspace, including overseas territories, without our permission. The US has sought such permission in the past, as the Foreign Secretary has told the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/5">The hon. Gentleman cited the Foreign Affairs Committee's suggestion that the Government have a policy of &quot;obfuscation&quot; on the issue. That could hardly be further from the truth. Preliminary searches of recent records produced no evidence of US requests to use UK airports or airspace. As the search continued back in time, we found four cases in 1998. The Foreign Secretary lost no time in updating the House as new information came to light, and he will continue to do so. The whole world loves a good conspiracy theory and is always reluctant to let the facts get in the way of a good story. The hon. Gentleman suggested that it would seem reckless to accept US assurances. I shall doubtless annoy the cynics by saying that we do indeed accept the assurances of our close ally.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/6">That does not mean that we always agree, however. Indeed, we sometimes differ on matters of policy, and we say so. On Guantanamo Bay, the Prime Minister has stated that he sees it as</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/7" class="indent">&quot;an anomaly that has to end&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/8">We have made it clear that we regard the circumstances under which the detainees continue to be held in Guantanamo Bay as unacceptable, and the US Government are fully aware of our views.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/9">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib. He will recall that US servicemen and women have been disciplined, prosecuted and convicted for what happened there. The US Detainee Treatment Act, which President Bush signed into law on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-30">30 December 2005</phrase>, provides that no individual in the custody of the US Government or under their physical control, regardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which it defines as the cruel, unusual and inhuman treatment or punishment that is prohibited by the US constitution. That legislation makes a matter of statute what President Bush has made clear was already US Government policy, and we welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/10">As for our own laws, the hon. Gentleman suggests that the Government did not welcome the unanimous finding of the House of Lords that evidence that has or may have been procured by torture is not admissible before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. On the contrary, it has never been the Government's intention to present to court evidence that we believe may have been obtained by torture. We believe that that would be wrong. The effect of the judgment was to reinforce that clear policy with an exclusionary rule of law. The Government have welcomed the clarity that their lordships' judgment of <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase> has brought to this important and difficult issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/11">The hon. Gentleman also spoke about mounting evidence to indicate that the Government are complicit in cases of extraordinary rendition. He cited the inquiry led by Senator Marty, chair of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly's legal affairs and human rights committee. Senator Marty produced his information memorandum on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase>, which was debated in the Parliamentary Assembly on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January</phrase>. The hon. Gentleman did not report what was said during the debate, in which several British members spoke about the lack of substance and evidence in Senator Marty's reports. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government are co-operating fully with Senator Marty's inquiry, as with the inquiry launched by the secretary-general of the Council of Europe, my good former colleague Terry Davis.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/12">In addition to those inquiries and a temporary committee of inquiry established by the European Parliament, the Government have also been co-operating with the inquiry on rendition allegations co-ordinated by the chief constable of Greater Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/13">The hon. Gentleman suggests that we asked the US Government to make a public declaration. It is not for us to make such a demand of another Government, especially about intelligence and security-related matters. However, I repeat the following points. We have found no record of US requests for rendition through the United Kingdom since May 1997, other than those about which my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has informed the House. We have made it clear to our US colleagues that we expect them to seek permission to render detainees via UK territory and airspace, including overseas territories. We have made it clear that we will grant permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition accords with UK law and our international obligations. We have made it clear how we understand our obligations under the UN convention against torture and the European convention on human rights. We are clear that the US would not render a detainee through UK territory or airspace, including overseas territories, without our permission.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/14">The hon. Gentleman concluded by insisting that the Government have failed to give a straight answer to questions about complicity. I repeat my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary's clear statement of policy: we would not assist in any rendition case if to do so would put us in breach of United Kingdom law or our international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/15" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/16" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at eighteen minutes to Six o'clock.</p>
