<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15a.439.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="439"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060215/halltext/60215h01.htm#60215h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.439.3/1">I sought this debate because there is an emerging controversy&mdash;indeed, a scandal&mdash;about the small British dependency of Ascension Island. Over a period of years, its inhabitants, of whom there are just over 1,000, were led to believe that they had a settled future on a developing, liberalising island. Those expectations have been rather brutally removed following a Government policy U-turn announced at the end of last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/2">Concern over the issue has been compounded by the suspicion&mdash;there is no proof of this&mdash;that much of that change in policy is attributable to the influence exerted on the Government by the Americans, who have a major strategic interest in the island. That, therefore, is the context of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/3">I was prompted to seek the debate by a constituent, Mr. Hutchison, who is passionately interested in the subject. Since then, I have been deluged with e-mails and other messages from islanders, their elected councillors, people who have served on the island and former British administrators, all of whom feel passionately that the islanders have been betrayed and that we might well be on the brink of a case similar to that of Diego Garcia, which aroused much controversy four decades ago and whose consequences rumble on to this day. The island is, of course, very small, and the issue affects a small number of people, but it is worth remembering that this country went to war 20 years ago over the 2,000 people in the Falklands. The status and rights of just over 1,000 people on Ascension Island should therefore concern us, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/4">Let me give a bit of background to explain why the issue is important and how it came about. The British started using Ascension as part of the empire roughly at the time of the Napoleonic wars, and that was related to Napoleon's incarceration on St. Helena. From the outset, there have been arguments within the Government about what to do with the island. That was rather beautifully captured in a quotation about the first Admiralty commandant at the beginning of the 19th century, Captain Bates. It was said that he was</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/5" class="indent">&quot;by no means the last commandant of Ascension to be crippled by changes in&mdash;or rather the lack of&mdash;any proper policy in London. The Lords of the Admiralty seem never to have made up their minds about what they wanted Ascension to be.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/6">That is as true today as it was 200 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/7">The geography is unpromising, as the island is on a volcanic outcrop on the Atlantic ridge. The rock is very new; indeed, it is so new that there was originally no soil on the island. However, when people involved in the campaign first showed me pictures of it, I was struck by the fact that there were forests and small farms at the top of the mountain. I was told that they were there because people had imported soil in the 19th century so that agriculture could begin. They had carried it to the top of the mountain because that was the only place where water could be captured. Great labour has therefore gone into creating this British dependency and into its active use.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.3/8">The population is small, and there has been a long tradition of controlling it. A statement of policy in, I think, 1925 said that only friendly tribes could go to the island. That was a reference to St. Helenians, and migrant workers from St. Helena make up three quarters of Ascension Island's population. The pattern of population has been characterised by contract working. Workers on the island are, in effect, Gastarbeiter in the truest sense: they are there to work for a period and are required to leave when they retire. That has been the traditional pattern.</p>

	<p pid="a.449.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing the debate. When I saw that there would be a debate on this issue, I could not help but come and say a few words, although I shall be brief. I shall concentrate on two areas: the environment of the island and the military impact on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/2">I am fortunate to have been to the island many times. When I first went there, I was due to stop for just one day on the way to the Falklands, but in true style the Royal Air Force broke down and I spent a week there. I have been back on several occasions to do engineering work, not least with the Army, and to do environmental work, also with the Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/3">Before I get on to my two main points, I shall try to add a bit of colour to this rather barren rock, because I think it the most remarkable place in the world. It is, of course, the second most remote island in the world, but other hon. Members have touched on how unique it is. It is an island full of surprises.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/4">Green mountain, to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" name="Peter Bottomley">the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley)</phrase> referred, is remarkable. Reaching the Dew point on the way to the top, one enters a marvellous microclimate with a mini rain forest on top. One of my worst memories of Ascension is having to do the Dew point run, which involves running from the shore to the top of the mountain. It covers about 7 miles and the runners are absolutely exhausted by the time they get there. The island is probably the only place that I have ever played half a round of golf&mdash;there is only half a golf course&mdash;entirely on flint and rock with not a blade of grass to be found.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/5">The community is unique because it has so many different elements. GCHQ is there, as is the BBC. There is an American community and there used to be a Royal Air Force community. All four parts of the community, as well as the St. Helenians, manage to work together well. The island is one of the few places in the world where I have spent any time where people did not have to lock their doors, and I would hate for that to be spoiled.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/6">As one travels up the island through Donkey plain to Cricket valley around the back, one can see that it is the most remarkable environment. Although it is essential that tourism on the island is developed, I am concerned about how we will ensure that such a unique place is not destroyed by too much tourism. I would like to hear the Minister's view on that. We have already done our bit by introducing the rat to the island, which has caused some problems, although we have also done some quite remarkable things. As one goes up to the now defunct National Aeronautics and Space Administration centre&mdash;I know that it is defunct because I kicked the front door in during a military exercise once, and there is definitely no one there any more&mdash;one passes a remarkable plantation with incredibly tall, thin trees. I asked what it was, and was told that they are trees planted by the Royal Navy in the 19th century to provide spare masts. They are still there. That is the sort of place Ascension Island is&mdash;an island full of secrets.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/7">I am concerned about the environmental impact of an increase in tourism. I was fortunate when I went in that the green turtle, which lays its eggs on the shores, was laying its eggs when I arrived. When I went back in the summer, they were hatching. I can see the appeal and that tourists would want to see such things, but that must be handled sensitively so that we do not impact on the island or on that population.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/8">I also want to touch on the military aspect. I am concerned that the state of the island is deteriorating. I saw the range on the far side of the island only recently. It is kept in mothballs, but it is an absolutely essential facility. I am sure that during the Falklands war no one expected that Ascension Island would be as prominent as it was. It is essential that we keep it in top condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/9">As the Royal Air Force squadron was withdrawn several years ago, I am concerned that the island is being overlooked to a degree. We rely entirely on the Americans to look after the runway. I realise that it is leased to them, but it is vital that as a country we maintain some form of military community there to ensure that it is there when we need it.</p>

	<p pid="a.463.1/1">It is unusual for me to be on the Front Bench and it is worth having a debate just to be here.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/2">The Minister is used to occasions such as this. I think that this is the third time this week that she has been in such a room to discuss Northern Ireland, as she has already spoken about rates and selling the family silver. She is here now to discuss education, and I look forward to hearing her response.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/3">Recent Government figures have indicated that more than 100,000 youngsters live in relative poverty in Northern Ireland. Many of them are concentrated in particular areas, some of which are relatively affluent but have estates in the middle with a high concentration of families living in poverty and deprivation. That impacts on educational achievement.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/4">The debate on those issues has sometimes been mixed up with other big educational controversies in Northern Ireland. For example, there has been an attempt to link educational under-achievement and disadvantage with the selection system, although I want to stay away from that issue this morning, because it is a red herring and it does not answer the problem; I see the Minister smiling, however, because she has sometimes tried to link the two.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/5">I do not believe that the solution is simply to throw money at the problem, although resources are required. The important question is how to lift people's aspirations. In many deprived areas education is not seen as it used to be: as a way out of poverty and a way of improving opportunities in life. How do we give people the inspiration and aspiration to look to education as a way out of their current economic situation?</p>

	<p pid="a.463.3/1">Absolutely. The problem is not unique to Northern Ireland. Many of the lessons that we have learned in Northern Ireland can be transported to other parts of the United Kingdom. Equally, some best practices need to be transported to Northern Ireland. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/2">It is clear that there are problems, because there has been no lack of initiatives in Northern Ireland. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that there are currently 58 or 59 initiatives to deal with failing schools, raise standards, improve attendance and so on. Sometimes, all that happens is that jobs are created for those who administer the initiatives and a paper nightmare is created for principals who must find out about initiatives and how to apply for them, and then fill in the forms. Education and library boards provide some help, but resources are dispersed. The resources themselves are often time-limited and are stopped just when they begin to bite. Even worse, sometimes when the results begin to come through the schools no longer qualify. They may benefit from an innovative scheme, but the money may then dry up.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/3">I want to look at two initiatives that illustrate some of the best practices and some of the problems. First, the school support programme amounted to &pound;50,000 a school. Clear targets were set and one school decided that it wanted to spend the money on tackling the problem of school attendance. The money provided a home-school liaison officer who targeted families whose children had a poor attendance record. The liaison officer obtained parental involvement, which was important&mdash;sometimes, that meant putting parents on accredited courses to learn how to help youngsters with reading, homework, counting and so on&mdash;and brought in other statutory agencies. Sometimes it was a case of ensuring that youngsters came to school having had breakfast, and also came there clean. Money can be poured into breakfast clubs in schools so that youngsters at least start the day with some food in their stomachs, so that they can concentrate for the rest of the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/4">The effect of that initiative was that the school moved from the bottom 5 per cent. at key stage 2 into the top 5 per cent. over two years. However, once it had moved up, the money was no longer available and the good work was lost. That is a problem with many initiatives. It might be better to have fewer initiatives, but to have more money going directly to schools while allowing them to decide how to use it in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/5">It is important to get parents involved. Some community groups and initiatives have been helpful, such as the &quot;Parents and kids together&quot; initiative in the Sunnylands area of Carrickfergus in my constituency, but its funding is under threat. It identified a problem regarding the need for pre-school work and after-school clubs, but it did not allow parents simply to dump their youngsters at the community centre to be looked after. It demanded parental involvement. Sometimes that parental involvement was no more than an information evening about what services and courses might be available. Sometimes men were required to look after the youngsters playing football and fathers were asked to come down to help out with that. When I made a visit, I saw that many of the parents who had come along reluctantly at the start had seen the value for their youngsters, had become enthusiastic supporters and had begun to volunteer for more and more activities. Sometimes the scheme gave leadership to youngsters, such as when menfolk took them out for games. Sometimes it gave parents inspiration to find other ways of helping their youngsters. Many of them moved on to accredited courses and some then went on to other educational courses to improve their opportunities in life. Such initiatives require funding, but they can involve people who might not previously have been involved in their youngsters' education.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/6">Some initiatives have not worked and lessons can be learned from them. One is the group 1 schools initiative, under which some schools received &pound;200,000 over five years. Some received &pound;1 million over that period. I visited some of those schools with the Assembly Education Committee. There has been a lot of good work and a lot of effort, but much of it has been dissipated, perhaps because there was not enough direction. There were no boundaries for success, and although the core purpose was to raise standards, there seems to have been little monitoring. I understand that the schools involved deal with difficult youngsters, but so did many schools that received money from the schools support programme, and we have not seen the same return.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/7">One problem is that it was left to individual principals to come up with ideas. If we are to stick with initiatives, perhaps there should be sharing of best practice or even an initiatives forum so that people can find out what has happened and what has been good in other schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/8">Another thing that we need to consider is the attitudes of the schools themselves. I want to be careful about what I say. Many teachers who teach in difficult areas have a difficult task. Perhaps it is because of that that they can become burnt out and cynical more quickly. I have visited many schools and seen the kind of inspirational teaching that is done. Nevertheless, in many cases, it is a fact that teachers who have been teaching difficult youngsters in difficult schools for a long time sometimes lose their initial enthusiasm. The schools themselves tend to be faced with declining numbers and therefore budgetary problems. They have all kinds of resource problems. Perhaps the new, enthusiastic teachers are the first to be made redundant in many such cases, thereby leaving a gap in those schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.3/9">There is a role for the inspectorate, which I sometimes think is a bit cowardly. Inspectors may come in and say that such and such a teacher is having problems or that a class was not well taught, but leave it up to the school and the principal to decide what should happen. It is rare that an inspector will put his name to a report stating that a teacher needs to be moved on or needs retraining&mdash;the decision is usually left up to the school. Inspectors need to take a more proactive approach if they think that failure may be partly the result of the need for some staffing changes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15a.466.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" speakername="Angela Smith" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"  colnum="466"  time="011:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060215/halltext/60215h02.htm#60215h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.466.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" name="Sammy Wilson">the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> on securing the debate and on choosing what is perhaps one of the most topical issues in Northern Ireland at present. It is certainly one of the most important if we are to consider what happens in Northern Ireland in the future. I enjoy my discussions on education with the hon. Gentleman, and I believe that we are as one on many issues. We have similar outlooks on what we seek to achieve for the education system in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/2">The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight areas of educational disadvantage. Kids have one chance in school. We fail them if we do not give them the opportunity to make the best life chance that they possibly can through the education system, and we should take that on board in everything that we do to improve education.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/3">This debate is not just about fairness for the individual, but about the future needs of our economy. The hon. Gentleman rightly highlighted academic vocational education. Unless we offer a twin-track approach providing every child with the opportunity for academic and vocational education, we will not meet the needs of 21st century Northern Ireland. We will not produce the people whom we need as plumbers, doctors, parents and so on, and we will not address the need to ensure that people have the required skills and abilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/4">The hon. Gentleman also highlighted the problem&mdash;we have to acknowledge it before we can do anything about it&mdash;of far too many young people leaving our schools without achieving their full potential. Across Northern Ireland as a whole, 6 per cent. of them leave school with no GCSEs. In the most deprived areas, about which I know he is concerned, that proportion rises to 14 per cent. One quarter of 14-year-olds fall short of the expected standard in literacy and numeracy. In some schools in the most deprived areas, which he and I have visited, the figure is closer to three quarters, and more than 20 per cent. of adults have low literacy and numeracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/5">Those figures surprise some people. When we debate post-primary education and the removal of academic selection, we often hear about Northern Ireland having had the best results in the whole UK&mdash;no one can touch Northern Ireland's exam results. That is true at one level, but those figures and that success mask deep-seated problems that we have a duty to address. I fully take on board the hon. Gentleman's comments that just removing academic selection would not achieve the outcomes that we want, but I point out that it is part of a package to improve life opportunities for every child that includes changing the curriculum across Northern Ireland and giving support to schools that need it. Those things together can make a difference. I always think that there is only one opportunity in life and politics to make a difference, and we should take it. We are addressing the problem for the benefit of not only children, but the Northern Ireland economy as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/6">We need to avoid the easy option that some people take of blaming the parents, school or teachers. We are talking about deep-seated issues, and we have to consider the answers to them in the round. We need to consider all the factors that influence educational attainment, and the hon. Gentleman is right to highlight that that is not a job for education alone. I often discuss with my officials and with politicians in Northern Ireland the fact that if we try to deal with disadvantage in education and lack of achievement through the education system alone, we will not succeed; we have to consider the matter holistically, and involve the health service and housing. The Department for Social Development will look into those problems as well. Together, we can tackle the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/7">Parental support for the school is key; the hon. Gentleman highlighted the differences that it can make. We have found in disadvantaged areas as well as others that parents and young people recognise the value of education. We need to find ways of channelling that recognition and giving parents support so that they can help their youngsters in school.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/8">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the number of initiatives. It is fair to say that the Department has not sat on its hands ignoring the problem; there have been a number of initiatives to achieve what is needed. He mentioned that there were 58 or 59 programmes, but the number is irrelevant. I met a group of primary and secondary school principals who were talking about the number of initiatives that came through to schools. I asked, &quot;If you could get rid of some of these, which would you choose?&quot; They said, &quot;Well, none, because they are all valuable.&quot; Although there are initiatives and they are valued, we have to streamline them and make it easier for schools to be involved in them&mdash;and, where there are problems, we have to take them on board and address them.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/9">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the school support programme, which normally gives a school three years of intensive professional help and support. Some 193 schools are or have been involved, and 26 are currently on the programme, which is worth &pound;9.4 million. It is time-limited, and not open-ended. The idea behind the programme is that schools get the support that they need and move forward. There should then be a review on removing that support, because the school should have achieved its objectives through the programme. However, I take on board what he said, and I will come back to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/10">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the group 1 initiative, which is &pound;200,000 a year for schools in severe difficulties. He was concerned about the lack of monitoring and the role of the inspectorate. The action planning, monitoring and evaluation are intrinsic parts of the process, but I share some of his concerns. I will take on board some of his comments about the education and training inspectorate. Since I became Minister with responsibility for education, I have had regular meetings with the ETI, and I am impressed by its knowledge, commitment and drive for the education system. Perhaps we should incorporate it more in policy making, and take on board its comments when we look to move forward on those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/11">The Government and the inspectorate have no interest in supporting those who are not going to be good teachers. If teachers are having the difficulties and problems that the hon. Gentleman mentions&mdash;if they are getting worn out, tired and put under tremendous pressure&mdash;they should get all the support that we can give them; but if teachers are really not able to teach, and teaching is not the profession that best suits them, then we should support them in looking into alternative professions. I share some of his concerns about the group 1 programme. There will be a review of the school improvements programme as a whole, and I give him an assurance that it will deal with the issues that he highlighted. Unless we review it and look into how we can do things better in future, we will not address the problems that he and I want to address. I shall announce the details of that review shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/12">The literacy and numeracy strategies have been very successful. We can see how results have improved in Northern Ireland schools and how, at the lower levels, where there is disadvantage and underachievement, those strategies are making a difference; I am pleased with how they are working. The reading recovery programme has also been very successful. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the dissemination of good practice, and some &pound;15 million is being put into that. There may be better ways to share good practice, as the inspectorate highlighted.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15a.469.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" speakername="Angela Smith" colnum="469"  time="011:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060215/halltext/60215h02.htm#60215h02_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.469.1/1">We always recognised that there would be costs in implementing SENDO. If the hon. Gentleman is asking whether I can give a commitment that every school will have everything that it needs, I should say that that would be quite difficult, but certainly money has been allocated for that. Schools to which I have spoken have been very supportive of inclusion where it is appropriate for the individual child, the school and other children in the school. I have met representatives from a number of mainstream schools that have included children with disabilities, and they have reported that where inclusion suits the pupil, it has been a success. We keep that issue under review to give support to the schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/2">I should also highlight the &quot;Entitled 2 Succeed&quot; programme, which looks into the curriculum, as well as collaboration and transfer between schools. That has the potential&mdash;largely through the curriculum&mdash;to address the points made by the hon. Member for East Antrim about ensuring academic and vocational support for every young person who wants it.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/3">The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of leadership in schools. It is important that there be effective, high-quality leaders in schools. In a number of schools that I visited, I could see where that made a difference. If a head teacher inspires the staff and pupils, one can see a school lift off, and it is not just the results that change, but the behaviour and aspiration of pupils. We are keen to pursue that. There are some good examples of regional training units and children's and students' services, but we want to do more in working with heads to improve capacity. The head teacher from my previous school, in my constituency, was in Northern Ireland recently, talking with people involved in the education services, and one thing that I have found useful is heads giving support to other heads. Heads who have that inspirational leadership really want to pass it on to other heads. That is another area that we have to develop further.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/4">The message that I want to give today is that the Government are very much attuned to wanting to give support to all pupils in Northern Ireland, so that we not only maintain our high levels of academic excellence, but ensure that young people who are currently underperforming in the education system have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Part of the answer is ensuring that the finance and support are in place, but we are spending the money that we have far too thinly across Northern Ireland's schools. I am very concerned whenever I speak to head teachers who have to give up being a full-time head to go into the classroom and teach full-time because of funding in the school. That is not because there is a lack of funding; the amount of funding going to schools is constantly increasing, but we are spending it across too many schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/5">The hon. Gentleman asked about rationalisation. I have spoken to the boards about that. Under the capital programme that I shall announce shortly, we will see whether there are opportunities to rationalise schools, and to support merging, amalgamations and closures where appropriate. If we do not take that on board and make sure that we have a schools estate that is fit for purpose, we will have too many schools that are not sustainable. That will put unacceptable pressure on schools that have to finance their work while money is being drained by too many schools across the board. We want to take that on board, and I give him an assurance that we will do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/6">I fully endorse the hon. Gentleman's point about schools being hubs in their communities. We already have breakfast clubs and activities to promote good health for young people; there is no doubt that children who eat better and who have good health learn better. There are also links to parents through Sure Start family learning programmes. There is support for study through homework clubs, too, where children have the opportunity to work with other children and get support enabling them to undertake the work that they have been given. There is clear evidence that that helps their studies to improve. There are also much closer links between education, health and social services, because we are bringing those together; we are taking a holistic approach to the young person. The children and young person's funding package, which the state announced in the budget process, is designed to tackle those issues to improve the life chances of young people. Further details will be announced shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.1/7">In conclusion, I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising the subject. I hope that I have addressed some of his concerns, and I look forward to discussing the issues further with him and seeing what more we can do to ensure that every single young person reaches their full potential and gets the life chances that they deserve.</p>

	<p pid="a.475.4/1">It is genuinely much gentler. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.475.4/2" class="indent">&quot;DWP will . . . write to 35,000 existing POCA customers with bank account details, suggesting they may like to move over to a bank account payment and requesting their bank details.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.475.4/3">It we consider the two approaches, the truth will lie somewhere in the middle. It is still a disturbing situation and we would welcome clarification from the Minister. Much gentler that might have been, but, however phrased, it puts pressure on the customer. It is reminiscent of past bad behaviour and, above all, it is a breach of faith with sub- postmasters and Post Office account holders and takes a potential 35,000 customers away from sub-post offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.475.4/4">In my former incarnation as a trade union official, I would not have accepted it if an employer who had a seven-year agreement with me sought to interfere with it in such a way in only the third year. The Government and the DWP made an agreement and signed a contract. To do anything without consultation in the third year of a seven-year contract is provocative and needs to be rethought.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, and I apologise for the fact that I will have to leave to meet a constituent at 3 pm to discuss this very issue. For me, this came to light only two years ago when the whole issue of the pension credit was being considered, when I discovered through Pension Service staff that the account was short-term. If there is a problem, it is the fact that it was not spelt out to everyone when the Post Office card account was introduced that it would be only until 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.485.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> for securing this debate and making his case effectively and eloquently. Rather than repeat many of the points that he made, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to just two issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.0/2">The all-party group on small shops, of which I and many hon. Members present are members, published a survey today called &quot;High Street Britain: 2015&quot;. One of its conclusions is that the Government should directly support and expand the specific services offered by the sub-post office network. The sub-postmasters' submission to the inquiry went further and suggested that they could be paid to provide advice centres for the Government. Many of them already give a wide range of advice for free.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.0/3">The Welsh Assembly Government have given &pound;4.1 million of Post Office development fund money to support and develop post office branches located in the 125 most deprived and isolated electoral divisions throughout Wales, including a number in my own constituency. The grant was given to improve their future viability. If a post office closes within three years of receiving a grant, the money, quite properly, must be repaid.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.0/4">The killing off of the Post Office card account is a real threat to the viability of post offices that serve small rural communities or deprived urban communities. Is that really joined-up Government thinking? The card account brings people into the post office who then make other purchases there or in an adjacent corner shop, helping to make those businesses viable. Furthermore, in a close-knit and caring community, if Mrs. Jones does not pop in to use her card account, the post office staff will make inquiries to check that she is safe and well and ensure that nothing untoward has happened to her. I hope that the Minister is listening and that he realises post offices are the heart of our communities. If the heart is ripped out, the community is killed off.</p>

	<p pid="a.494.1/2">That intention was specifically covered in the contract signed by the Government and the Post Office in 2002. It is unusual to quote from contracts, but in view of what has been said by others in recent weeks, I shall do so. I shall not breach any commercial aspect of the agreement, as that would of course be incorrect. The contract states:</p>

	<p pid="a.501.3/1">It is always a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow. I ascribe my membership of the House in part to the sterling work that you did on a certain Bill a long time ago, although whether other hon. Members regard that as your finest moment, I am not entirely sure.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.3/2">I obviously begin by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" name="Brian H Donohoe">the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase> on securing this debate on a publication that is still relatively hot off the press. However, he was beaten to it by our noble Friend Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, who managed to initiate a debate on the findings of the Arbuthnott commission's report at exactly the same time as Sir John was unveiling it at a press conference in Scotland. There must be something in the Ayrshire water to produce such prescient and astute politicians. I also shall try to respond to the various points that other hon. Members raised and undertake to write in answer to the questions that I do not address.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.3/3">My hon. Friend asked two specific questions and a more general one about the Government's response. Let me deal with those questions straight off the bat. He said that there had not been a Scottish Grand Committee since November 2003. As far as I am aware, there have been no requests for a Scottish Grand Committee since then. Such matters are dealt with through the usual channels. I am not, nor have I ever been, one of the usual channels. However, it is within the right of any Scottish Member of Parliament to request a Scottish Grand Committee, and it is then up to the usual channels to allocate one. The fact that there has not been a Scottish Grand Committee for some time does not meant that the Government are preventing them, but that no one has requested one hitherto.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.3/4">My hon. Friend asked a straight question about whether the Government are considering holding a referendum. Let me say clearly&mdash;I know that this will come as a crushing blow to him&mdash;that the Government have no plans for such a referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.501.3/5">My hon. Friend asked in more general terms about the Government's initial response to the analysis and proposals in the Arbuthnott commission's report. My answer to that will form the bulk of my response, but first I shall reiterate the welcome that the Secretary of State gave to the report on the day of publication. I thank Sir John and the members of the commission for the time and effort that they put into producing the report, which forms the substance of this debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.503.3/1">I am more than happy to pay tribute to the committee and the commission for the work that they did. I did so during the Adjournment debate secured in November by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">the Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase>, and I am happy to do so again. I have absolute confidence that the commission went about the report in a professional way, and with integrity.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.3/2">That is not to say that its recommendations command universal support. They do not, and I shall come to that. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> points across the House, but Sir John explicitly rules out, for the time being, the extension of STV, which I understand is his party's policy, so he would not be particularly overwhelmed with joy about that recommendation. I am happy to pay tribute to the report, but there is no escaping the fact that it has not commanded overwhelming support. I have not made any attempt to disparage the report and I have done nothing but praise the integrity of those who carried it out. At the same time, however, it is incumbent on me to point out that there is no consensus as to how we should proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.3/3">Let me return for a second to the business of decombining the elections, which is not a bureaucratic or procedural point. There is a belief, which I share, that combining the elections is one means of seeking to maximise turnout. My hon. Friend said that he thought that turnout was decreasing because of the complexity of elections. That point has been made by others on other occasions. In the most recent elections, we have seen a reversal in the decrease in turnout, and the figures beginning to go up. That has happened in general elections, and it occurred in the by-election in Dunfermline, which had a very respectable turnout. I shall say no more about it, but the turnout was respectable, which gave me something positive to say when I was interviewed on television that night, other than how nice the weather was. We continue to believe that having the elections on the same day is one way of maximising turnout.</p>

	<p pid="a.504.1/1">Any local authority or electoral returning officer can always come forward to the Government with proposals to pilot such schemes. I think that in the May 2006 local elections in England, there will be about 16 pilots, which will include systems such as voting in supermarkets. However, I add the large caveat that the election in question is the first being done under STV, which is complicated to administer. Obviously, we must make it as simple as possible for people to vote, so we might not see an enormous amount of innovation this time around, but local authorities&mdash;and joint valuation boards in Scotland&mdash;might put forward different voting options. We will see that in the local elections in England in a few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.1/2">It is clear from this short debate that there are strongly held views on the commission's recommendations on voting systems and boundary matters. It is also clear that those strikingly divergent views do not come together in a consensus about the electoral process or boundary patterns. After considerable consideration of the STV system's merits, Sir John explicitly ruled out extending it to the election of Members to the Scottish Parliament at present. Some hon. Members will welcome that aspect of the report, but others will find it disappointing, as they have advocated that approach for many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.504.1/3">We have not heard a lot about this in today's debate, but the report does not promote coterminous boundaries between Holyrood and Westminster constituencies. It says that they are &quot;desirable but not essential&quot;. It was, in part, anxieties about the implications of having non-coterminous boundaries that led to the creation of the commission in the first place. Some hon. Members will welcome that conclusion, while others will not.</p>

	<p pid="a.505.1/1">No, I do not accept that the report is flawed because of that. There is some contention&mdash;I know that this was aired in the Select Committee&mdash;about whether the committee had too narrow an interpretation of its remit because it respected the essential nature of the devolution settlement, which has a proportional element. However, it is not valid to claim that the Arbuthnott report is fundamentally flawed. An element of proportional representation is an essential feature in it, but there are ways of delivering an element of proportionality in the system other than the recommendations that Sir John made.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire is, of course, the eponymous creator of the Donohoe solution, as history will record it. The commission examines that solution in pages 12 to 15 of its report, but does not support it. I appreciate that that is a disappointment to him, although it might please others.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.1/3">This debate has illustrated that there is simply no consensus on how to proceed with this. That is why I think it sensible to take some time to seek consensus, although that might not be possible as unanimity is rarely possible in these matters. When it comes to the very essence of democracy and how we go about electing those who govern us, it is incumbent on us to seek the broadest possible consensus, as we did with the Electoral Administration Bill that is making its way through Parliament, which is a broadly consensual Bill. We should therefore take our time in responding to the report. We should listen to what hon. Members have to say, but on the understanding that there is clearly no consensus on how to proceed.</p>

	<p pid="a.507.2/1">I was quoting Professor Crawford's opinion, which was commissioned by the all-party parliamentary group and published in December. It is entitled &quot;Extraordinary rendition of terrorist suspects through the United Kingdom&quot;, and states that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/2" class="indent">&quot;the United Kingdom is bound by its own obligations in respect of torture, and not by any view taken by the United States as to what constitutes torture . . . Under international law, States are prohibited from sending a person to a territory where it is believed that he will be tortured. This obligation . . . arises both under general international law and under international treaties to which the United Kingdom is a party.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/3">Professor Crawford went on to observe:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The United States ratified the Torture Convention with an extensive reservation dealing with various aspects of the application of the Convention in United States law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/5">Therefore, it is not sufficient for the UK Government simply to seek cover from Secretary Rice's assurances. The test in the UK is not the US implied test of whether the risk of torture is more likely than not, but whether there is a real risk that a person would be tortured if returned.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/6">Moreover, it seems reckless of the UK Government to accept US assurances without reservation or questioning when we have all witnessed the way in which the US Government have operated Guantanamo Bay, whose procedures and presence offend every principle of international jurisprudence.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/7">I understand that the officials who prepared the Minister's briefing in response to this debate are from the Foreign Office's counter-terrorism department. They cannot be insensitive to the fact that Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld approved 24 interrogation techniques for use at Guantanamo Bay. In an article entitled &quot;US Abuse of Iraqi Detainees at Abu Ghraib Prison&quot; in the <i>American Journal of International Law, </i>Tom Farrer observes that the techniques are aimed at</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/8" class="indent">&quot;significantly increasing the fear level in a detainee&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/9">and</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/10" class="indent">&quot;attacking or insulting the ego of a detainee&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/11">It is clear beyond peradventure that the US Government have engaged in cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, both at Abu Ghraib and at Guantanamo Bay, yet they claim that that treatment does not amount to torture. The UK Government should not be associated with those semantics.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/12">In last month's edition of &quot;International Affairs&quot;, the journal of Chatham House, Alex Bellamy, who is a lecturer in peace and conflict studies at the university of Queensland and recently wrote a book called &quot;Just Wars&quot; and is an expert in that area of policy, observed that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/13" class="indent">&quot;there is a significant amount of circumstantial evidence to suggest use of torture by the US and some of its allies in the war on terror is both widespread and systematic . . . a coordinated strategy of information gathering, based on torture&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/14">Bellamy went on to observe that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/15" class="indent">&quot;there is evidence to suggest that successive US Attorney Generals have attempted to create a permissive legal environment for the use of torture . . . the current Attorney General, Roberto Gonzales, played a key role as White House Legal Counsel in sidelining the State Department's concerns about the use of torture. In a memorandum to the President on <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-25">25 January 2002</phrase>, Gonzales argued that:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/16" class="indent">'The nature of the new war on terrorism places a high premium on other factors, such as the ability to quickly obtain information from captured terrorists and their sponsors and in order to avoid further atrocities against American civilians. This new paradigm renders obsolete (the 1949 Geneva Protocol on the Treatment of Prisoners of War) strict limitations on questioning of any prisoners'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/17">Clearly, the United States has decided to abandon respect for international law. Indeed, President Bush clearly stated that in 2003 when he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/18" class="indent">&quot;International Law? I better call my lawyer . . . I don't know what you are talking about by International Law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/19">The issue for the House is whether the United Kingdom Government have also decided to abandon the principles of international law. Once torture becomes accepted in any legal system, it spreads like an infectious disease. It saves the labour of investigation and hardens those who become accustomed to its use. The Foreign Affairs Committee has accused the Government of failing to deal with its questions on rendition with appropriate transparency and accountability and has recommended that the Government end their policy of what the Committee described as &quot;obfuscation&quot;. Such behaviour by the Government raises the question of what they think they have to hide.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/20">The matters that I am talking about clearly need proper explanation. For example, minutes of the meeting between US justice officials and EU officials in January 2003 show that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/21" class="indent">&quot;both sides agreed on . . . increased use of European Transit facilities to support the return of criminal/inadmissible aliens . . . and improving cooperation in removals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/22">Ministers seem to suggest that such allegations are without foundation, so why did the legal affairs committee of the Council of Europe publish, a matter of weeks ago, a report that concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/23" class="indent">&quot;drawing on all this concordant information and evidence we can say that there is a great deal of coherent convergent evidence pointing to the existence of 'relocation' or 'outsourcing' of torture. Acts of torture or severe violation of a detainee's dignity through the administration of inhuman or degrading treatment are carried out outside national territory and beyond the authority of the national intelligence services&quot; ?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/24">Those are the conclusions of a committee of elected representatives drawn from throughout Europe, reflecting the whole range of political views.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/25">Former CIA agent Robert Baer was quoted by the BBC as saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/26" class="indent">&quot;if you want a serious interrogation you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want him to be tortured you send him to Syria. If you want him to disappear . . . then you send him to Egypt&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/27">Does the Foreign Office consider that he was fantasising? Was a former British ambassador to Syria, Henry Hogger, making things up when in December, commenting on the case of Mahrar Arar, a Canadian citizen who was taken to Syria and tortured, he observed that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/28" class="indent">&quot;what was going on in Syria at the time was not unlike the way it has been described&quot; ?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/29">When Craig Murray, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, published on the internet copies of telegrams that he sent to London between 2002 and 2004, warning that information being passed on by the Uzbek security services was &quot;torture tainted&quot;, was he fantasising? Mr. Murray also published on the internet a document that clearly appears to be the text of a Foreign Office legal opinion seeking to argue that the use by intelligence services of information extracted through torture is not a violation of the UN convention against torture.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/30">Perhaps it was a similar approach to information extracted through torture that caused the Government to contest the assertion that the Special Immigration Appeals Commission should not receive evidence that has or may have been procured by torture inflicted in order to obtain evidence by officials of a foreign state. The judgment of the House of Lords, given on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-08">8 December</phrase> in the case of A (FC) and others v. the Secretary of State for the Home Department, should be required reading for every Member of the House and every Minister. The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, comprising Lord Bingham of Cornhill, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, Lord Hoffman, Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, Lord Carswell and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, unanimously found against the Government. It is difficult to imagine a stronger representation by the Appellate Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/31">Lord Bingham observed that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/32" class="indent">&quot;the English common law has regarded torture and its fruits with abhorrence for over 500 years . . . I am startled, even a little dismayed, at the suggestion . . . that this deeply-rooted tradition and an international obligation solemnly and explicitly undertaken can be overridden . . . The issue is one of constitutional principle, whether evidence obtained by torturing another human being may lawfully be admitted against a party to proceedings in a British court . . . To that question I would give a very clear negative answer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/33">Lords Nicholls said:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/34" class="indent">&quot;Torture is not acceptable. This is a bedrock moral principle in this country. For centuries, the common law has set its face against torture . . . Torture attracts universal condemnation . . . No civilised society condones its use. Unhappily, condemnatory words are not always matched by conduct.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/35">Lord Hoffman said:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/36" class="indent">&quot;The use of torture is dishonourable. It corrupts and degrades the state which uses it and the legal system which accepts it . . . many people in the United States . . . have felt their country dishonoured by its use of torture outside the jurisdiction and its practice of extra-legal &quot;rendition&quot; of suspects to countries where they would be tortured . . . the rejection of torture . . . has a special iconic importance as the touchstone of a humane and civilised legal system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/37">If a member of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords feels confident to say in terms in a judgment in a landmark case on torture, res judicata, that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/38" class="indent">&quot;many people in the United States . . . have felt their country dishonoured by its use of torture outside the jurisdiction and its practice of extra-legal 'rendition&quot; of suspects'&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/39">can Ministers be surprised that hon. Members on both sides of this House and large numbers of people outside it are less than convinced when the Foreign Secretary simply repeats the mantra of the US Secretary of State that that country does not indulge in torture?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/40">Lord Hope observed:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/41" class="indent">&quot;Views as to where the line is to be drawn may differ sharply from state to state. This can be seen from the list of practices authorised for use in Guantanamo Bay by the US authorities, some of which would shock the conscience if they were ever to be authorised for use in our own country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/42">It must be of very real concern that at the start of the 21st century it is necessary for the most senior judges in the land to express the view put simply by Lord Brown:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/43" class="indent">&quot;Torture is an unqualified evil. It can never be justified. Rather it must always be punished.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/44">There have been other recent cases in respect of which the Government's approach has been equivocal. There was the judgement on the torture and killing of Iraqis by British forces, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-22">22 December</phrase>. The Government argued unsuccessfully in respect of the right to rely on evidence extracted under torture and to be exempt from liability for torture carried out by British troops outside the UK. There is also the case of Mitchell and others <i>v. </i>Al-Dali and others. I will not say too much about that case. It has been before the Court of Appeal and I understand that it is going to the House of Lords, so it is almost certainly sub judice, but what is not sub judice but is a matter of public record is the letter of Geoffrey Bindman published in <i>The Guardian</i>. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/45" class="indent">&quot;My clients . . . seek redress against the officials responsible for torturing them in Saudi Arabia. Our Government intervened unsuccessfully in the Court of Appeal in support of the Saudi claim to immunity for the Saudi Kingdom and its officials. The Court of Appeal rejected immunity for the officials and the Saudi Kingdom is appealing to the House of Lords. Again, the British Government are seeking to intervene against its own citizens, yet Article 14 of the UN Convention Against Torture, requires every Government 'to ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/46">There are a number of questions that Ministers should answer and of which I have given this Minister notice, so there should be no surprises for him here. In the Foreign Office memo of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-07">7 December</phrase> to No. 10, officials concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/47" class="indent">&quot;we now cannot say that we have received no such requests for the use of UK territory or air space for extraordinary rendition.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/48">To whom do the Government believe that requests for rendition would be made? How was it that it took the machinery of government some weeks to resolve the line to take on the issue? What representations have the Government made to the US Administration about the practice of extraordinary rendition?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/49">The US Government have now clearly acknowledged that they have rendered detainees to other countries for questioning; indeed, that practice is now well documented in a number of cases, such as that of Maher Arar, which I have already cited, who was kidnapped in Canada. Amnesty International has told me of some 78 Gulfstream V Turbojet flights that have stopped over in the UK since 2001 that could be connected to rendition. One could be walking down the street in any part of the world and be kidnapped. Have the Government asked the US Administration in terms whether, and if so how many, detainees have passed through UK airspace or airports?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/50">Have the US Administration sought permission for any state flights to pass over UK airspace or land in the UK to transfer detainees? Has any agency in the US Administration, including the CIA, asked for such permission and have the UK Government ever granted a blanket permission for the passage of such flights? That is particularly important because the December memo to No. 10 admits that there is no way of the UK Government knowing whether any detainees captured by British forces in Iraq or Afghanistan have subsequently been transferred by the US to interrogation centres overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/51">Whatever the US Government choose to do, the UK Government have obligations under international law.Have the Government at any time reminded the US Administration of the higher threshold that must be passed in order to meet UK legal obligations with respect to the UN convention against torture? Has an explanation been given that UK law will have been breached if there are grounds to believe that rendition may carry a real risk of torture and that the US interpretation that such rendition will become unlawful if it is &quot;more likely than not&quot; that the person will be tortured is insufficient?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/52">Let us step back from the carefully phrased denials and examine what we know. Evidence has emerged that makes these concerns plausible: the snatched photos of the cages at Guantanamo and the photographs of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib. The existence of secret CIA-run prisons in eastern Europe has not been denied by the Bush Administration. There is compelling testimony from people who claim to have been shipped abroad by the US and tortured. The UK Government have not questioned the definition of torture being used by the US Government, which differs from that set out in international human rights treaties, and appears not to extend to forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The UK Government show no inclination to investigate reports of US aircraft using UK airspace or airports for rendition purposes. Is it out of the bounds of possibility that the US might not have made formal requests for the use of UK airspace for such flights, but carried them out anyway?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/53">My shopping list of what I would like the Minister to do is short&mdash;only three things. First, given the mounting evidence that UK territory has been used to assist in unlawfully transporting detainees to countries where they may face disappearance, torture or other ill-treatment, the UK Government should launch an immediate, thorough and independent investigation. Secondly, as part of such an investigation, the UK Government should ask the US Government to declare whether they have used UK airports, airspace or US military airbases on UK soil for the purposes of extraordinary rendition since 1998, with or without the approval of the UK authorities. That would include transporting detainees from, to or through UK airspace as well as servicing planes about to embark on or return from a rendition mission. Thirdly, what steps are being taken or considered to prevent future use of airspace and airports in the UK by aircraft being used for such illegal activities?</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/54">Finally, I urge the UK Government to co-operate fully with the parliamentary investigations into the issue and the Council of Europe inquiry led by its secretary-general, Terry Davis, himself a former Labour Member of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.507.2/55">I submit that the Prime Minister has repeatedly failed to give a straight answer to questions about possible British Government complicity, but seeing nothing, hearing nothing and saying nothing is becoming less and less of an option.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-15a.512.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" speakername="Ian Pearson" speakeroffice="The Minister for Trade"  colnum="512"  time="017:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060215/halltext/60215h05.htm#60215h05_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.512.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Bercow, and I very much welcome the opportunity that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> has given us to debate these issues today.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/2">Human rights form one of the cornerstones of this country's value system and one of the key elements in our country's social and legal structures, informing our policies, legislation, interactions with one another and our relationships with our international partners. The UK unreservedly condemns the use of torture, and is working hard with its international partners to eradicate that abhorrent practice by launching a global campaign for universal ratification of the UN convention against torture, as well as lobbying in support of its optional protocol; publishing and distributing a number of human rights handbooks specifically aimed at combating torture; and supporting anti-torture work by the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe. The UK also used its EU presidency to take forward an EU initiative to combat torture around the world. That included d&eacute;marches in 39 countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/3">The hon. Gentleman made much of allegations about illegal rendition. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has said a number of times to the House, our policy on rendition is clear. We do not deport or extradite any person to another state where there are substantial grounds to believe that that person will face a real risk of torture, or where there is a real risk that the death penalty will be applied. We have found no evidence of detainees being rendered through the UK or overseas territories since <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>. Nor have we found evidence of detainees being rendered through the UK or overseas territories since 1997 where there were substantial grounds to believe that there was a real risk of torture. We would not assist in a rendition if to do so would put us in breach of our national or international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/4">The hon. Gentleman suggests that we have been seeing nothing, hearing nothing and saying nothing. That is not the case. We have addressed the issue with the US Government. As part of our close co-operation with them over several years, including in recent months, we have made it clear to them that we expect them to seek permission to render detainees via UK territory and airspace, including overseas territories. We have made it clear to them that we will grant permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition would accord with UK law and our international obligations, and we have also made it clear to them how we understand our obligations under the UN convention against torture and the European convention on human rights. We are clear that the US would not render a detainee through UK territory or airspace, including overseas territories, without our permission. The US has sought such permission in the past, as the Foreign Secretary has told the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/5">The hon. Gentleman cited the Foreign Affairs Committee's suggestion that the Government have a policy of &quot;obfuscation&quot; on the issue. That could hardly be further from the truth. Preliminary searches of recent records produced no evidence of US requests to use UK airports or airspace. As the search continued back in time, we found four cases in 1998. The Foreign Secretary lost no time in updating the House as new information came to light, and he will continue to do so. The whole world loves a good conspiracy theory and is always reluctant to let the facts get in the way of a good story. The hon. Gentleman suggested that it would seem reckless to accept US assurances. I shall doubtless annoy the cynics by saying that we do indeed accept the assurances of our close ally.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/6">That does not mean that we always agree, however. Indeed, we sometimes differ on matters of policy, and we say so. On Guantanamo Bay, the Prime Minister has stated that he sees it as</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/7" class="indent">&quot;an anomaly that has to end&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/8">We have made it clear that we regard the circumstances under which the detainees continue to be held in Guantanamo Bay as unacceptable, and the US Government are fully aware of our views.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/9">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib. He will recall that US servicemen and women have been disciplined, prosecuted and convicted for what happened there. The US Detainee Treatment Act, which President Bush signed into law on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-30">30 December 2005</phrase>, provides that no individual in the custody of the US Government or under their physical control, regardless of nationality or physical location, shall be subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which it defines as the cruel, unusual and inhuman treatment or punishment that is prohibited by the US constitution. That legislation makes a matter of statute what President Bush has made clear was already US Government policy, and we welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/10">As for our own laws, the hon. Gentleman suggests that the Government did not welcome the unanimous finding of the House of Lords that evidence that has or may have been procured by torture is not admissible before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. On the contrary, it has never been the Government's intention to present to court evidence that we believe may have been obtained by torture. We believe that that would be wrong. The effect of the judgment was to reinforce that clear policy with an exclusionary rule of law. The Government have welcomed the clarity that their lordships' judgment of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-08">8 December</phrase> has brought to this important and difficult issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/11">The hon. Gentleman also spoke about mounting evidence to indicate that the Government are complicit in cases of extraordinary rendition. He cited the inquiry led by Senator Marty, chair of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly's legal affairs and human rights committee. Senator Marty produced his information memorandum on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase>, which was debated in the Parliamentary Assembly on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January</phrase>. The hon. Gentleman did not report what was said during the debate, in which several British members spoke about the lack of substance and evidence in Senator Marty's reports. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government are co-operating fully with Senator Marty's inquiry, as with the inquiry launched by the secretary-general of the Council of Europe, my good former colleague Terry Davis.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/12">In addition to those inquiries and a temporary committee of inquiry established by the European Parliament, the Government have also been co-operating with the inquiry on rendition allegations co-ordinated by the chief constable of Greater Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/13">The hon. Gentleman suggests that we asked the US Government to make a public declaration. It is not for us to make such a demand of another Government, especially about intelligence and security-related matters. However, I repeat the following points. We have found no record of US requests for rendition through the United Kingdom since May 1997, other than those about which my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has informed the House. We have made it clear to our US colleagues that we expect them to seek permission to render detainees via UK territory and airspace, including overseas territories. We have made it clear that we will grant permission only if we are satisfied that the rendition accords with UK law and our international obligations. We have made it clear how we understand our obligations under the UN convention against torture and the European convention on human rights. We are clear that the US would not render a detainee through UK territory or airspace, including overseas territories, without our permission.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/14">The hon. Gentleman concluded by insisting that the Government have failed to give a straight answer to questions about complicity. I repeat my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary's clear statement of policy: we would not assist in any rendition case if to do so would put us in breach of United Kingdom law or our international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/15" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.512.0/16" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at eighteen minutes to Six o'clock.</p>
