	<p pid="b.1.2/1">Motion made, and Question proposed, That the sitting be now adjourned.&mdash;[Mr. Watson.]</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.1.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" speakername="Michael Clapham" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.1.3/1">I draw hon. Members' attention to my entry in the Register of Members' Interests. I am pleased to have secured the debate, because the issue of asbestos and the changes that are being made to relax standards in respect of it is important. I shall make three main points. First, the use of asbestos in the UK and Europe generally has left us with a bitter legacy. The Government recognised that when they introduced the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002, which were, and still are, a positive step forward. Changes are being made by means of an amendment to the EU asbestos worker protection directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/2">Secondly, the proposals dilute the current practice&mdash;the way in which we impose standards in respect of asbestos. I draw to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister early-day motion 1224, which stands in my name and has attracted the signatures of more than 100 MPs who are concerned. I shall refer to other, much more eminent people who have voiced concern about the proposed change. Thirdly, certain experts say that the research on which the proposal has been based is flawed. That will be the major plank in my argument that the Minister should press for the standards to remain as they are and should decline to accept the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/3">It is 100 years since the first death related to asbestos was reported in Parliament. It was reported in 1906 to a Committee that dealt with workers' compensation. In the 100 years since that death, there have been an enormous number of such deaths. One expert, Robin Howie, takes the view that, over the period from 1929 to 2020, between 663,000 and 820,000 deaths will have been caused by exposure to asbestos. The investigative journalist Peter Martin, writing in <i>The Sunday Times Magazine</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-16">16 May 2004</phrase>, estimated that the number of asbestos-induced deaths in the UK between 2000 and 2050 could be as high as 186,000. Again, I draw the Minister's attention to the need to ensure that we have robust standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/4">Each year, there are about 1,900 diagnoses of mesothelioma, which is a cancer. The TUC believes that asbestos causes two to three times as many cancers overall as it does mesothelioma, so we are talking about a considerable number of people who are put in jeopardy each year by asbestos exposure. Asbestos has now been banned, but although the first Act of Parliament that set standards to minimise the exposure of workers to the dust came in 1931, it took another 68 years before we banned asbestos. That was done in November 1999 after this Government came to power.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.2.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.2.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that, during the period that he has mentioned, the industry fought back and constructed an argument that white asbestos was safe and blue asbestos was the dangerous one? That argument has been ridiculed over the past few years, which has made a significant difference. Science is sometimes used by industry to justify its profits and position.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.2.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" speakername="Michael Clapham" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.2.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention; what he says is correct. Although blue and brown asbestos were banned in 1985, there are still a considerable number of deaths. He will be aware that the Health and Safety Commission asked Leicester university in 1998&ndash;99 to carry out research before it advised on a ban, and that that research showed that there was no safe level for working with white asbestos. White asbestos is just as dangerous as other types of asbestos. That is why we must ensure that the high standard of protection against asbestos exposure is not reduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.1/2">Making the corporate control of asbestos a statutory priority was at the core of the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002. That positive regulation assigned the responsibility for managing asbestos in some 500,000 non-domestic premises to property owners, landlords, licensees, tenants, employers and building and maintenance managers. That was a positive step.</p>

	<p pid="b.2.2/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate, which is on a very important topic. May I draw to his attention the sad experiences of Southfield school for girls in my constituency? It had a lot of asbestos in its buildings, which was disturbed by renovation work in 2003. The whole school essentially had to be relocated for the best part of a year, and all the records and equipment were lost. Even though we do not use asbestos today, the legacy of its use in buildings affects even schoolchildren in 2006.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.2.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" speakername="Michael Clapham" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.2.3/1">I am grateful for that intervention because it emphasises the need for robust standards to control asbestos in premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/2">The Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 showed the Health and Safety Commission's determination to make safety a priority. It is understandable, therefore, that there is widespread concern about the consultation document that has been issued. The consultation finishes today. The document is called &quot;Proposals for revised Asbestos Regulations and an Approved Code of Practice&quot; and it proposes a relaxation of asbestos protection. Some believe that the HSC is now more concerned with cost cutting than ending the national asbestos epidemic. In my view, there is a real need to cap that epidemic.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/3">The amendment that is to be made will use the concept of sporadic and low-intensity exposure to asbestos. I accept that that wording is taken from the directive, but the concept is causing serious unease. Dr. Nancy Tait of the Occupational and Environmental Diseases Association says:</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/4" class="indent">&quot;Sporadic and low intensity described the exposure recognised by DWP as responsible for many mesotheliomas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/5">Two Health and Safety Executive publications from 1995, &quot;Asbestos alert&quot; and &quot;Asbestos dust: The Hidden Killer&quot;, drew attention to the fact that many decorative plaster finishes contained asbestos and that asbestos fibre was the hidden killer.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/6">I shall draw the Minister's attention to a discrepancy in the figures that I believe shows clearly that deaths are occurring in the home as a result of people being subject to airborne asbestos fibre. A letter from Nancy Tait refers to the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council's report on asbestos-related diseases&mdash;Cm 6553&mdash;which states in paragraph 48:</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/7" class="indent">&quot;The Council was concerned about the apparent discrepancy between the number of deaths in the UK from mesothelioma and the number of people awarded&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/8">industrial injuries disablement benefit for mesothelioma. It continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/9" class="indent">&quot;In 2001, there were 1,579 male and 269 female deaths, compared to 710 male and 40 female new assessments&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/10">who received industrial disablement benefit. There is a massive discrepancy and that may well be because of the long latency period. Many of the people who died after retirement may have been subject to asbestos exposure during their working life. I suggest that among those figures may be a number of deaths caused by exposure to airborne fibres in schools, although when I asked a question a couple of years ago about the number of teachers who had died of mesothelioma there was one. That is explicable because it is more difficult to put a death into an occupational category if it occurs after retirement. I suggest that the figures that Nancy Tait referred to include people who have been exposed to airborne fibres in domestic premises. That is another reason for setting much stronger standards and not accepting a relaxation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/11">I want to refer to a number of concerns that have been expressed. The TUC believes that there is no safe level of exposure to asbestos and that reliance on the concept of sporadic and low intensity exposure to asbestos will inevitably lead to more tragedy. It recently stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/12" class="indent">&quot;Given the risk of a fatal disease, even at low exposure, the nature of the maintenance and construction industry and the low level of general enforcement outside of the licensing regime, it would be irresponsible to exclude all sporadic and short term exposure work . . . The HSE should be committed to increasing protection, yet for some groups this proposal would decrease the level of protection they currently enjoy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/13">The Transport and General Workers Union and the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians, which represents workers in the construction industry, put out a joint statement saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/14" class="indent">&quot;The adoption of a risk based approach by the HSE will result in the deregulation of work with textured decorative coatings such as Artex, the asbestos content of which can be as high as 5 per cent. by weight; previously only a licensed contractor acting within defined parameters was permitted to work with this kind of material&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.2.3/15">Those unions are concerned that relaxation via the amendment to the directive will result in people being put more in jeopardy. The workers who will be put in jeopardy will be electricians, carpenters working in households, joiners, builders, plumbers and so on. There is a real need to ensure that we do not accept a relaxation of standards.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.4.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" speakername="David Laws" colnum="4"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.4.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. He will know that one of the HSE's arguments for the relaxation that he has just described is that cement containing asbestos is already exempt on the basis that it poses a very low risk. Does he accept that argument or does he believe that cement containing asbestos should be included in the regulated materials?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.4.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" speakername="Michael Clapham" colnum="4"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.4.1/1">I believe that cement containing asbestos needs to be covered by the same strict and robust standards that we have had previously. It is dangerous to relax standards for any situation in which asbestos fibres are likely to be present. We must be very cautious about that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.4.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" speakername="John Battle" colnum="4"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.4.2/1">The cement was examined when it was mixed and only about a year old. The problem is that asbestos was added to cement in the 1960s and cement dries out; in old buildings it dries right through. The problem with fibres can exist 20 or 30 years later, but the delay factor has been ignored. When the HSE and insurance companies say that asbestos is inert, they are wrong. It is not dead material. It comes alive again and kills people.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.4.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" speakername="Michael Clapham" colnum="4"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="b.4.3/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for that intervention. He has explained clearly why it is necessary to have more robust standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/2">The research on which the Health and Safety Commission's proposals were based is flawed. I want to draw the Minister's attention to what Robin Howie said. He was an occupational hygienist and president of the British Occupational Hygiene Society. He said that the research was carried out under unrealistic conditions and that the findings did not reflect the level of exposure that would take place in the real world. The removal of asbestos-containing textured coatings was done under controlled conditions by operatives working for licensed contractors in asbestos enclosures fitted with negative pressure extraction units. He made the point that the use of skilled operatives using the latest technology and equipment has not produced results that will be replicated by untrained workers employed by unlicensed contractors, unobserved and working without the same technology used in the research. That is a major point. If those controlled conditions cannot be replicated&mdash;they obviously cannot&mdash;in the real world, people will be put in jeopardy.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/3">Furthermore, Howie pointed out that the health and safety laboratory researchers measured the level of exposure experienced by the operatives in that enclosure. What they did not take into account was the airborne asbestos fibre concentrations that would be experienced by unprotected families living in homes where textured coatings had been removed. The health and safety laboratory study was commissioned jointly with the Association of British Insurers, a body that works energetically to reduce asbestos-related liability.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/4">The problem is that the research cannot be replicated in the real world and textured coatings in domestic premises will be removed by unlicensed contractors with the danger that they will not use the protection necessary to ensure that airborne fibres are not left when the family returns to the premises. Again, further inspections are necessary following removal of asbestos coatings and I shall refer to that in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/5">I want to bring to the Minister's attention a paper published in 2005, which was co-authored by Daniel McElvenny of the HSE's epidemiological and medical statistics unit, which details the increasing incidence of asbestos cancer from secondary exposure such as that experienced by plumbers, gas fitters, joiners, builders and electricians. If textured coatings are removed from the licensing regime, it is highly likely that more deaths will occur among that group of workers. That is something that the Minister should take on board. The paper produced in 2005 by the HSE actually supports the point made by the agency in 1998 that there should be no relaxation. I cannot see what has changed since that paper was published in 2005. Only a sceptic would say that cost was a factor.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/6">There is another issue of greater public concern: when textured coatings are removed by unlicensed contractors, they are likely to be dumped in unlicensed sites. According to Environment Agency statistics, someone fly-tips in England and Wales every 35 seconds; there are around 70,000 incidents per month. Following the introduction in 2004 of more stringent regulations for waste disposal, the number of landfill sites that accepted asbestos fell dramatically, and the cost increased. It is hard to see how the combination of unlicensed contractors and the reduced number of landfill sites can do anything but increase fly-tipping of that dangerous material, exposing more people to greater risk. Again, the Minister should take that point on board. Perhaps that fact should be brought to the attention of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/7">It is known that it takes a long period of exposure for someone to develop an asbestos-related cancer. I referred earlier to secondary exposure, but let me bring to the Minister's attention a case that I dealt with between 1996 and 1997 of a miner who had been subject to secondary exposure. He recalls finishing his national service and starting work with British Coal, or the National Coal Board as it was then. He worked for just four months in 1954 with a machine that had asbestos brake linings. In 1996, he fell ill. His illness was diagnosed as mesothelioma, and he died in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/8">The point is that that man did not have asbestosis. I recall taking him to tribunals, and we could not establish asbestosis because in order to establish it there must be fibrosis of the lungs; in other words, the illness must be pneumoconiosis, and asbestosis is a form of pneumoconiosis. The diagnosis was that there was asbestos fibre in his lungs, but it had not coalesced. As a result, we had to fight through the tribunal to establish that he had been working in conditions in which he was subject to asbestos. Finally, we established that point, and he was paid industrial injuries disablement benefit. That man had been working with a machine more than 40 years ago, and it took that long for the mesothelioma to develop, even though he was exposed for only a very short period.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/9">What is to be done? In 1998, the HSE was persuaded that there should be no relaxation of controls on removing asbestos coatings&mdash;or, should I say, textured coatings&mdash;because of the danger that it presented to those who could be exposed, and its document of 2005 supports that. So what has changed? Could it be that the HSE is now looking into cost cutting, as many people believe? That may be the case, but my view is that, given the evidence available, the methodology on which the proposal is based should be thoroughly reviewed. I hope that the Minister will order that review. I also hope that she will support continuing the process of third-party inspections by an independent body when a textured coating has been removed. That way, the family moving back into the premises can be safeguarded from exposure to airborne fibres.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/10">Also, I hope that the Minister, who represents the lead Department on the issue, will instigate a cross-departmental approach for the victims of asbestos. Three Departments are involved in the issue&mdash;the Department for Constitutional Affairs, the Department of Health and, of course, the Department for Work and Pensions, which has the lead. The Department for Constitutional Affairs is involved because it recently put out a consultation paper suggesting that the number of specialisms in the courts should be reduced, among them the mesothelioma specialism. That specialism has been in place in the Queen's bench division of the High Court for the past three years, and it has meant that live mesothelioma cases have been settled within four weeks, and posthumous cases within seven weeks. There is a danger that if it is dropped as a specialism we will be back to longer periods in court.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/11">I also ask the Minister to consider whether it is time to introduce a scheme for people suffering from asbestosis, and particularly mesothelioma. It could be similar to the scheme that the Department of Trade and Industry operates for miners, but better. It should be financed by the insurance companies and based on settlements commensurate with what men and women would receive in court. That would stop the indignity of being dragged through court.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.3/12">As regards the Department of Health, there is a real need to introduce a treatment and care strategy. If we can marry up the legal and health sides, we can make a lot of progress for asbestos victims. I hope that the Minister will take that on board, and I hope that, having heard the evidence that shows that the proposal was based on flawed research, she will order that the matter be thoroughly reviewed, with a view to maintaining the current high standards.</p>

	<p pid="b.6.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> for initiating this debate and for giving such an excellent speech, detailing concerns that many of us have about the European worker protection directive. I am also grateful to him for tabling early-day motion 1224.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.0/2">The debate is timely, marking as it does the end of the public consultation on the directive. I say at the beginning that there is much in the directive that we can support and welcome. For example, I particularly welcome the tightened provisions and the single lower control limit of 0.1 fibres per cubic centimetre of air. That is an important provision, which will be welcomed in the industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.0/3">As the hon. Gentleman said so eloquently, there is a long history attached to dealing with asbestos-related illnesses. I represent Rochdale, which, as many Members will know, was the site of the world's first asbestos factory, and the largest. There are not many people in Rochdale whose families have not been touched by the effects of asbestos-related diseases over the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.0/4">The first asbestos victim from Rochdale, Nelly Kershaw, died in 1924; the first mesothelioma victim was reported in Rochdale in 1936; and a study in the 1950s established the link between asbestos and lung cancer. Despite all that evidence and the fact that people knew about the deadly effect of the mineral, it was not until 1997 that that the product was finally banned. An excellent book, &quot;Magic Mineral to Killer Dust: Turner and Newall and the Asbestos Hazard&quot;, highlights graphically the steps that industry took to hide information about the effects of asbestos and related disease, and prevent it from coming into the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="b.6.0/5">The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone expressed concern about the proposed changes in relation to textured coatings. We have to look at what is happening and who is wagging the tail. It is a fact&mdash;we have seen it reported in the press&mdash;that the insurance industry continues to do everything possible to minimise costs and risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.7.0/1">I am glad that the hon.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> set out the evidence in his excellent contribution; in addition, only last Thursday the insurance companies overturned a High Court ruling that we got 20 years ago, saying that they would no longer recognise pleural plaques as evidence of mesothelioma, or potential asbestos pollution. Does not that prove that the insurance companies are determined to wriggle out of paying compensation and move away from their legacy?</p>

	<p pid="b.7.1/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that. I know that he has had a long battle in respect of the Armley factory. Last week was a severe set back for all those workers&mdash;there are many thousands in Rochdale&mdash;who may suffer as a result of that decision. I hope that the Minister will take up the suggestion of the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone and try to bring some order to the situation and stop the insurance companies from denying some comfort to dying people and their families in their last days.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/2">The proposal that we are discussing flies in the face of evidence and concerns about the use of textured coatings. Yes, we are not using asbestos any more, but it is still found in many thousands of buildings. We simply do not know the scale of the problem. It is an accepted fact&mdash;back in the 1980s the then Under-Secretary of State for Employment, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1852" name="John Gummer">the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase>, admitted it&mdash;that there is no safe limit as far as asbestos is concerned. Why, then, are we going ahead with declassifying and handing over to people who will not be aware of the potential effects and dangers, will have had no training and could be exposing themselves to severe risk?</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/3">As has been said, the research is flawed. Before we go ahead and introduce the new changes, we need to ensure that we have the best research available. Again, it is a fact that, throughout history, science and research have been used to suit industry's needs. I am in no doubt that the directive is a cost-cutting measure that will, if implemented, result in some tragic consequences.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/4">I shall finish&mdash;because many other hon. Members want to speak&mdash;with a final quote from &quot;Magic Mineral to Killer Dust&quot;, which illustrates why we are here today:</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/5" class="indent">&quot;The asbestos experience demonstrates starkly the political and social problems in revamping health and safety laws, compensation payments and medical surveillance. Occupational diseases are deeply social and political. Industry inevitably influences both politicians and the formulation of industrial laws. The events surrounding the introduction of asbestos regulations in 1969 should banish any naive ideas that government and industry logically follow the healthiest and safest option.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/6">We have the healthiest and safest option at the moment, but if we proceed with the introduction of the directive in its proposed form, we will not have that and we will suffer the consequences in years to come.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.8.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" speakername="John Battle" colnum="8"  time="010:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew12">
	<p pid="b.8.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> on raising this subject again. He has fought tirelessly on this issue throughout his time in Parliament&mdash;often unacknowledged by many in the media and so on. He has kept the issue alive in the House, in Parliament and in Departments. His expertise on these matters is second to none, because he has worked through cases and the law, and we owe him a great debt for insisting that the subject is kept in the forefront of the public mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/2">Last week, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January</phrase>, Norwich Union, on behalf of a consortium of companies, overturned in court a decision that we got in Manchester in 2004, under Lord Justice Holland, which ruled that asbestos victims could claim if they had pleural plaques&mdash;signs of mesothelioma and cancer later down the line. Last week that decision was overruled: pleural plaques were declared inert. It was said that they would not be a problem, so people could not claim compensation from the insurance company. I want to say a little bit about why that demonstrates that the insurance companies are absolutely determined not to pay out for victims; they want to hold on in there and keep court cases going for years and years, as they have in my constituency, in the hope that the people will die out and take the evidence with them.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/3">When I first stood for Parliament a young man of 48 came into my office. He was off work sick with chest problems, but volunteered&mdash;he was not a Labour party member&mdash;to help in the campaign. He asked if he could do a bit of office work. I found out that he lived in the Armley neighbourhood near the office and near to J. W. Roberts's factory, which made asbestos blankets but which had closed in 1956. That factory was part of the Turner and Newall group over in Rochdale. We discovered during our research that although laws were brought in to protect the workers, to some extent, in the 1930s, for some strange reason that factory thought that it was okay to carry on blowing the dust out on to the streets nearby after work. People picked it up and used it as snowballs, for example, and it was on the lintels and window sills. What was the result? More than 400 people in my constituency in a cluster around that factory have died of mesothelioma. The young man I mentioned was one of those people. Two years after he came into my office he was dead of mesothelioma. All he had done was go to the local school and play in the asbestos dust.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/4">It took us eight years to get Turner and Newall into court. Why? It said that the problem was in the neighbourhood, rather than the factory, and the laws only affected workers, not the neighbours. We established the precedent that the company was liable for polluting the neighbourhood. We had to clean up all the houses. This Government gave money to the council&mdash;some &pound;5 million&mdash;to strip the asbestos out of all the houses and clean up the neighbourhood. That was a cost to the public. Can we get the money back from the company? No. The company was taken over by Federal-Mogul in America, which campaigned for years to try to stop paying out money to the victims.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/5">Then what happened? Last week, we got a decision. I should just like to mention Professor Richard Doll, who died last year at the age of 90. He gave his life to campaigning for people with lung diseases. He campaigned against the odds, when everyone was saying that he was wrong. He campaigned to ensure that asbestosis and mesothelioma were taken seriously, as well as smoking-related diseases. He would be turning in his grave if he had heard the decision on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January</phrase>. If he had been there, he would have spelled out that pleural plaques are&mdash;to use his words&mdash;an indicator of exposure to asbestos that is latent, not inert, 20 years down the line. That man in my office had been in the playground; 40 years later the disease was evidenced in his lung. Exposure to one fibre gave him mesothelioma.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/6">We must remember that this is a disease with a time line. It is a disgrace for the companies now to declare that pleural plaques are no longer compensatable, because there is no proof that people are suffering. It is a bit like saying, &quot;It's all in your head, really. You're worried about it, but there's no problem. You might get it later, but it's nothing to do with us. Move away.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/7">I want to contrast what is happening with two other examples. In America, people are given compensation if they have the potential to die from mesothelioma or asbestos-related disease. That is allowed at the early stages. One reason why the companies will not pay out on the Armley cases is because we deal with actual cases in Britain&mdash;people must have proof that they have the disease. However, in America, it is the potential that matters. Sometimes, the lawyers refer to those people, rather abusively, as &quot;the worried well&quot;, but the companies pay out. The Armley cases at the back of the line are potential cases. If they can accept potentiality in America, why do not the insurance companies and the big multinationals accept it here?</p>

	<p pid="b.9.0/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that in America the industry got wily and moved production to Mexico to pollute the lungs of the Mexicans?</p>

	<p pid="b.9.1/1">Indeed. However, I do not have time to deal with that, because this debate was secured by my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/2">We found out, after research, that the company in my constituency moved the Armley factory to India, so it could carry on producing and move away from any regulation here. We got someone outside the factory gates in India to show that the workers there would be killed within 40 years in the same way that people in my neighbourhood had been.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/3">Let me draw another parallel. There is one question that we should be asking the insurance companies, and I would be very interested to ask it. We should say, &quot;Okay, you say pleural plaques don't count. You say if I've got them, they're inert and don't really matter. So can I have my life insurance? How long will you give me?&quot; I bet my bottom dollar that they would cut back provision and increase my premium if I had pleural plaques. Well, they cannot have it both ways: they cannot ask me to pay more because I have pleural plaques, but go to court the day after and tell me that they do not count for anything and will not kill me. They are having it both ways, and we should expose the scandalous way in which they are trying to move away from the problem. Insurers who deduct from life insurance but who campaign to say that pleural plaques do not count should be challenged.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/4">Last week, three judges in the Court of Appeal overturned the decision that Mr. Justice Holland made in Manchester in November. He ruled that victims of asbestos pollution could claim on the basis of pleural plaque evidence, and Richard Doll would have supported that. The Court of Appeal decision was divided&mdash;two of the judges were for it and one was against&mdash;and even the chair of the bench, Lord Phillips, said, &quot;Oh well, the court is divided. It will obviously have to be looked at again.&quot; So the case moves on to the Lords. We should build a campaign against the Court of Appeal decision in memory of Richard Doll and say that we want it overturning. Lady Justice Smith, who ruled against the appeal, said that Mr. Justice Holland's decision should stand. If we do not campaign against the Court of Appeal decision, but let it stand, the asbestos companies&mdash;the Turner and Newalls and the Federal-Moguls&mdash;will wriggle out of their responsibilities, backed by their insurers.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/5">We do not have the detailed figures, but Richard Doll showed where the curve is and we could guess how many people are affected. Asbestos use has stopped, and we can look back over the 50s, 60s and 70s and work out who might be affected 20, 30 or 40 years down the line. The asbestos insurers have done their calculations and have an idea of how much they will have to pay out and they are trying to bring that curve down. That is what this is really about.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/6">We should campaign to say that time is up. We have the scientific evidence, and my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone has put it in a much wider context. We should not backslide and let the Health and Safety Executive and the insurance companies say, &quot;Well, this is a difficult one. We've done a bit about it. We've stopped it happening in the future. But we won't address the legacy of the past.&quot; The victims are being denied justice and we should continue to fight for them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.10.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1526" speakername="Jon Cruddas" colnum="10"  time="010:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew15">
	<p pid="b.10.0/1">I shall be relatively brief because a few of my colleagues want to speak and several of the points that I wanted to make about the pleural plaques judgment and the policy issues have been made in the three excellent speeches that we have heard. I, too, want to speak against the changes to the licensing regulations that apply to the removal of textured coatings that contain asbestos, such as Artex. Such changes would mean that contractors could manage textured coatings regardless of their experience or qualifications. Unlicensed contractors will not have the training or insurance to ensure that workers, householders and their families are adequately protected against exposure.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/2">By way of background, let me say that the borough that I represent&mdash;Barking and Dagenham in east London&mdash;is one of the country's hotspots for asbestos-related cancers and mesothelioma. According to the Health and Safety Executive report &quot;Mesothelioma mortality in Great Britain: an analysis by geographical area, 1981&ndash;2000&quot; the standardised mortality ratio and the number of deaths in my area are the highest in London and the ninth highest in the country; indeed, for women, the figures are the highest in the country. East London remains a hotspot, partly because of the legacy of the Cape asbestos factory in Barking. The testimonies of the people who worked there are very similar to many others, with the stories about snowballs in the yard and women washing out clothing, and that accounts for the high mesothelioma rates. Such problems are transportable round the country and they are not the product simply of our industrial heritage in the north of England; they exist in this city today. That is an important point.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/3">In Barking and Dagenham, we have set up an asbestos group with the London Hazards Centre, and I was fortunate and privileged enough to chair the first meeting a few months ago. We are working hard on this agenda, and I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> for his long record of work on this issue, for his expertise and for his tireless campaigning, which is a credit to public representation in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/4">The proposed decreases in safety controls will weaken the protections currently offered to many groups of workers, many of whom are constituents of mine. Many of the policy issues have been covered in previous contributions, however, so I shall just give a simple example. I held a surgery on Friday night in Dagenham, and the 29th case that came through the door was that of Mr. Michael Barclay of Marsh Green road in Dagenham and his mate, Bob Bailey, who are constituents of mine. They are both plumbing and heating fitters in a neighbouring local authority's work force, and I simply want to read a bit of an HSE report about an incident that they logged in 2004. This is Mr. Barclay's testimony:</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/5" class="indent">&quot;I went to the job on 21/06/2004 and identified that a water heater inside the sink unit which was surrounded by suspected asbestos material. Left the job and informed the manager to use an asbestos removal team&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/6">a licensed contractor.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Manager informed these people and asked them to fax him when they were going to be there so work could be stopped. This didn't happen, on 22/06/2004, a new central heating boiler was to be fitted. Walked into the property to find two men in there, one with a crow bar and another with a hammer who were hitting out the asbestos. They weren't wearing any breathing masks or taking other precautions&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/8">I repeat that this is a licensed contractor.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/9" class="indent">&quot;I left the boiler in the flat and left immediately. I returned to the yard and made an incident report to my manager. The same day, the manager received a clearance certificate from Cavendish Laboratories saying that the property had been air-tested and been given the all clear. On 23/06/2004, at about 10:30AM, myself and my partner, Bob Bailey, arrived at the site with other materials e.g. pipework and radiators. On arrival, there was a plumber at the premises, noticed that the warm air unit that was supposed to be taken out and disposed of was still there. There was lots of dust as well as debris on the floor. Immediately phone my Manager, which is Paul Gibbons and he told us not to touch anything and he attended straight away. He had some sample bags.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/10">He took the bags away, and of four samples, three tested positive within two hours. The job was closed and the locks were sealed. The matter was reported to the services manager&mdash;a safety officer at the borough&mdash;and a report was made to the safety manager at the HSE on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/11">Mr. Barclay then describes in detail the countless efforts that he has subsequently made to contact the HSE. He has made 13 different formal representations, and there have been representations from his union to find out the details of the HSE report. Mr. Barclay was reliably informed that the HSE</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/12" class="indent">&quot;came down and took lots of statements and told me that within six months the people responsible would be pulled in.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/13">A year and a half later, however, nothing has happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/14">That happened in a regulated part of the building industry in east London, where licensed contractors do local authority work today. That raises several issues, which are applicable to some of the proposed relaxations in the regulations regarding coated materials. First, there is the ease with which people can get clearance statements. Secondly, there is the question of licensed contractors with a lot of work hiring guys with no knowledge of working with asbestos. The people whom Mr. Barclay described had no safety equipment and were just banging the asbestos out with mallets. Thirdly, there is the issue of prevalence. In my area, we have a massive council estate with a long history of asbestos-related incidents, and the problem is dormant in many of our houses, where Artex is used throughout. We seem to be moving in the wrong direction in relaxing the regulations, and all the policy issues that have been raised today demonstrate that.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/15">I shall say nothing more, because my colleagues have covered all the substantive policy issues. I simply make the point that when it comes to the day-to-day realities of work in modern Britain, the problem of asbestos has not been resolved, as Mr. Bailey and his mate have shown. It is a day-to-day hazard, and we should be moving in the opposite direction, not relaxing the regulations covering work in certain industries.</p>

	<p pid="b.12.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I certainly take the view that there is no more important issue for legislators than protecting the safety of our constituents. All our constituents should be allowed to come home from work at night free from any causes of danger to their lives. I say that as a former shipyard worker who worked with this deadly material. Like many thousands of my colleagues, I live every day with the fear that there is something inside waiting to come out, and that is not a pleasant experience. Having watched some of my former colleagues suffer and die, I know that there is nothing more horrible than to die of an asbestos-related disease. It is not only the victims who are affected but their families, who have to watch them die.</p>

	<p pid="b.13.0/1">Does my hon. Friend find it ironic that there is a picture in the newspapers today of the Prime Minister having a lung function test? Did my hon. Friend's work mates ever have lung function tests or was the company doctor so tame that even that was too much?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.13.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" speakername="Jim Sheridan" colnum="13"  time="010:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew18">
	<p pid="b.13.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a perfectly valid point. I, too, saw the picture of the Prime Minister in the newspaper. It would not take the colleagues I worked beside in the shipyard long to blow into a tube, because they would not have the breath, but at least we are making progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/2">Having worked in the shipyards, I can well remember when the sun would shine into the bilges of the ships. It is not often believed, but there are sunny days in Glasgow&mdash;the third Wednesday in May, I think. When the sun shone through we would see the particles and our gaffer would say, &quot;Oh, that's okay, it doesn't affect you. That's all in the insulators&quot;&mdash;the &quot;white mice&quot; or &quot;laggers&quot;, as they were called. &quot;It's only the guys working with that stuff who'll be affected. Don't worry about it, just carry on doing what you're doing&mdash;you're fine.&quot; People would go home in the belief that their employer knew better than they did. They carried on working, only to find out in later life that that was not the case. Indeed, some of the gaffers and foremen are now dying from mesothelioma as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/3">I well remember driving a van for Breville, delivering the insulation to the people who were stripping out the asbestos in the bowels of Lennox Castle hospital. They were six young men, stripping out asbestos with their bare hands and wearing no protective equipment whatever. At the same time, they were eating their chips, as we call them&mdash;or lunch, as it is called here&mdash;with the stuff on their hands. Being the kind of person I am, I raised the issue with the employer on site, only to find&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;that when I got back to the depot my services were no longer required. That is the nature of the beast with such companies.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.1/4">I have had other unfortunate experiences. Scottish law recently changed. It used to be that when a claimant died, the claim died with him and the family received no compensation whatever. However, I pay tribute to my union, the Transport and General Workers Union, for going to court and getting the law changed. Some of the insurance companies and those representing them had developed a practice whereby they would get the claimant to court&mdash;sometimes with great difficulty for that individual&mdash;and make them face a GP sitting beside a lawyer. The GP would try to judge how long that claimant had to live and a technical reason would then be found to suspend the case in the hope that that person would die before it started again. Those are the kind of people whom we were dealing with, but thankfully the law has been changed, as a direct result of the trade union's action.</p>

	<p pid="b.14.0/1">Is my hon. Friend also aware that the insurance companies are seeking to challenge claims under tort and common law by arguing that an individual who has worked with asbestos over 20 years and in 10 different companies, for example, has to prove which company got the asbestos fibres into their lungs? If they are unable to prove that a specific company is responsible, their claim fails. That is another case of insurance companies and employers trying to wriggle out of their responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.14.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a perfect point. Trying to get people who have moved between different sites around the country to identify which company is responsible is ridiculous. Often a company will sub-contract a job to another company, so claimants become involved in a paper chase. That is outrageous, and people are losing out. Companies are finding loopholes to avoid facing their responsibilities and paying out compensation.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.1/2">I do not wish to take up too much time, as others wish to speak, but it would be remiss of me not to mention Clydeside Action On Asbestos, which is a voluntary organisation that does excellent work in the west of Scotland. It is now common practice for its volunteers to wear a black tie every day, because it is guaranteed that there will be a funeral. The group does magnificent work counselling families, giving advice to those who have contracted this horrible disease and offering guidance on some of the legal loopholes.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.1/3">In concluding, I am extremely concerned that companies are moving out of this country and into developing countries, such as India. I despair to think that in years to come people in underdeveloped countries will suffer from the same horrible disease that people in this country suffered from in the 1950s and 1960s&mdash;and even today&mdash;while the employers and the insurance companies walk away scot-free.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> not only on calling today's debate but on his excellent work over many years, not least with the all-party group on occupational safety and health, which has pushed the issue hard.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.3/2">When I entered Parliament four years ago I was told not to go looking for causes because they would come to me. Within six months of my becoming an MP, a lady called Ann Howells walked into a surgery in one of the villages in my constituency and tearfully told me about the recent loss of her husband through asbestos-related disease. She explained that she had no support and guidance and that she did not know where to turn. That was the first instance that I had come across and it prompted me to look at the research work and all the matters that have been alluded to, and the issue became a cause for me.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.3/3">Unlike the constituencies of other hon. Members who have spoken so passionately, articulately and knowledgeably, mine is not in a hotspot. In some ways that causes its own difficulties, because the level of support and guidance in relatively remote and rural areas is significantly different from that on Merseyside, Clydeside or wherever there are docklands or a history of heavy industry involving asbestos. However, that does not make the need to support the people affected any less urgent. I am pleased that in south Wales we have established a support group for those who have been affected by asbestos-related diseases, with union support and the help of a firm of lawyers. The group is growing in numbers, and it is surprising how many isolated people come forward once one starts banging the drum on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.3/4">I echo support for a national scheme such as my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone proposed. If we are staring at the start of a rising bell curve for asbestos-related disease among people exposed 20, 30 or 40 years previously, now is the appropriate time for the Government to consider implementing something similar to the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease scheme, with which many of us are familiar. If we carefully consider such a scheme now, it could be in place before we reach the peak of the bell curve and, in addition to addressing the diseases, could help the worried well. They include the families, who may not have been exposed to heavy industry directly but may have washed the clothes of those who were. We can help them avoid the added trial of taking their cases through the courts one by one in ways that will have the insurers standing against them at every turn. If the Minister is to take one message from my brief contribution, I hope that it is to speak with ministerial colleagues and consider the possibility of introducing a scheme similar to the COPD scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.15.0/1">We have had an excellent debate and I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> on having secured the debate. He has demonstrated his long-standing commitment to addressing the issue. He has also, as has been said, managed to secure the debate on the very day on which the Health and Safety Commission consultation ends. That is extremely timely; the random nature of the balloting process for our debates sometimes has a logic of its own.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.0/2">We have heard good speeches from other hon. Members with a commitment to tackling the issue, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase>, who spoke about the problems in his constituency. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" name="John Battle">The right hon. Member for Leeds, West (John Battle)</phrase> made a passionate speech about compensation, an extremely topical issue that really merits a debate on its own, and which he aired fully. I shall not touch on it now because of the limited time available, but it would repay us to come back to it in future. We also heard about the experiences of the hon. Members for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas), for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan) and for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies), and about some of their work on the issue. I am pleased to see that there is such a strong corps of hon. Members who take the matter seriously and who are determined to follow through their concerns over a long period.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.0/3">It is tempting for those of us who are not so well informed on the issue as some of the hon. Members who have spoken today to think that the asbestos problem belongs in the past, and that we have got through it. However, the figures that have been cited for new cases and for deaths from mesothelioma demonstrate that we are experiencing the problem now, and that the full cost of the problems caused by asbestos is beginning to show in our health figures. We are dealing with a massive legacy, as a number of speakers have said. The HSC estimates that some 500,000 commercial, industrial and public buildings and the common areas of some 4 million rented residential properties are likely to contain asbestos, so the legacy is enormous.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.0/4">In the light of the ghastly diseases associated with asbestos, and the concerns that hon. Members have expressed about the way in which certain commercial operators have acted over the years, it is not surprising that there is a lot of emotion about the issue and a great deal of concern about whether commercial interests are influencing the development of legislation and guidelines. However, it is important to make the point&mdash;I am sure that the Minister will do so later&mdash;that, although there must be a great deal of concern about the emotional and commercial issues, we are entitled to ask the Health and Safety Commission to base its judgments and guidelines on the evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.0/5">A number of hon. Members questioned whether the HSC was basing its judgments on the evidence or being swayed by commercial reasoning. In my view it has, on the whole, tried to strike the right balance between excessive regulation and exposing people to unacceptable risk. I take at face value its attempts, in new regulations&mdash;</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.16.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" speakername="David Laws" colnum="16"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew25">
	<p pid="b.16.1/1">I will not, if the right hon. Gentleman does not mind. We have a very short time left, and I want the Minister to have time to respond.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/2">Although the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone has raised legitimate issues today, we ought to accept at face value the HSC's attempts to strike the right balance. It spelled out what it was seeking to do in a press release dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-18">18 January</phrase>, which said:</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The draft package implements changes to the European asbestos worker protection directive and tightens statutory protections for those working with asbestos, by introducing a single, lower control limit for worker exposure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/4">It continues, in relation to the specific issues raised by the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone:</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/5" class="indent">&quot;The consultation takes into account new research. This research shows that the risk from asbestos-containing textured decorative coatings is comparable to the risks from work with asbestos cement, something that already does not require a licence. It is proposed that work with such textured coatings will no longer require a licence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/6">The HSC claims elsewhere:</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Asbestos exposure levels from these materials are much lower than previously thought: estimated to be 1000 times less than that for other licensable materials, and lower than that from work with asbestos cement&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/8">which, it repeats, does not require a licence.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/9">The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone is perfectly entitled to raise his concerns. I shall return to them in a moment, and the Minister must address them head on. He is also entitled to say that it is clear that the HSC changed its view over the years, so the situation cannot be regarded as having one obvious solution. The recommendations have changed over time, and we are entitled to ask whether it is right that that should have happened, and what evidence has been used as a basis for change.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/10">In section 42 of its consultation paper, &quot;Proposals for revised Asbestos Regulations and an Approved Code of Practice&quot;, the HSC points out:</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Work with asbestos cement has never required a licence because the risks are relatively low, and below the level to attract a licence. The new research suggests that the risks from work with textured coatings are even lower than the risks from work with asbestos cement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/12">There is a table showing the predicted deaths over a 50-year period for 500,000 general building workers, working 0.5 per cent. of their time on asbestos-containing materials for 10 years. In that time 0.3   asbestos cement removal workers and 0.1 people working with textured decorative plaster are expected to die. In other words, despite the concerns of the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone about the existing asbestos regulations, the HSC&mdash;using its own evidence&mdash;considers that the product is considerably safer than cement, which does not now require the same degree of regulation. That is why I asked whether the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone believed that cement should be included in the protections and regulations. The logic of his position, surely, is that we should tighten the regulations rather than ease them.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/13">That is the HSC's case, and it is perfectly entitled to it. Its job should be to assess risk, and to make us aware of the types of risk with which we are dealing. There are risks in everything; there are risks in crossing the road. I say that not to be childish or to score points but to illustrate the HSC's job. It has to ensure that people are not subjected to unreasonable levels of risk and that we do not spend a lot of money protecting ourselves from minuscule risks.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/14">That case having been made by the HSC, I hope that the Minister will address some of the concerns about the evidence on which it bases its conclusions, such as those raised by the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone, who considers that the evidence from trials was secured under unrealistic conditions. He mentioned that controlled conditions with extractive units would not be replicated by untrained workers, and that the research could not be replicated in the real world. Those are legitimate concerns. If the HSC has come to its conclusions on the basis of an utterly unrealistic scenario that would not be faced by real workers in the real world, none of us will be happy and we will not want to expose people to the risks. We understand that perfect conditions are often not reflected in the real world, as the hon. Member for Dagenham said.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/15">As a politician without medical expertise or knowledge of asbestos as a product, I want to know whether the evidence that the HSC has gathered, which seems to be its basis for changing the regulations, is rational and soundly based, or whether the concerns of the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone are legitimate. I congratulate him on having raised the matter, and hope that the Minister will address that particular point.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.18.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1529" speakername="Tim Boswell" colnum="18"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew26">
	<p pid="b.18.0/1">I, too, thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> for bringing this important subject to the attention of the House. Of course, this might well be our only opportunity to rehearse the draft regulations in such circumstances. The hon. Gentleman has a long and honourable record of leading on occupational health matters in the House, and I am pleased to collaborate with him in the all-party group on occupational safety and health. I take seriously the passion and sobriety of the comments made by other hon. Members and the sober, careful and dispassionate analysis developed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.0/2">The debate has been useful. It is about a dreadful disease and complex of diseases that are particularly vicious, not only in their intensity and almost inevitable fatality but because they arise through latent effects, often over a long time. Frankly, I have no special expertise on the area, but I have a little more familiarity with some of the policy issues on exposure to ionising radiation, and there are some analogies. Effects can be immediate in such cases, but they typically occur over the long term, leading to cancers and other horrible diseases. However nothing is visible by way of hazard, unless it is mediated and exposed by equipment.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.0/3">I take the point that there may be cases in which problems have been obvious and should have been dealt with at the time, but that is not typical. In relation to asbestosis there is both an occupational risk for carpenters, joiners, plumbers and so on and a long-term risk of domestic exposure for people in the house afterwards. I agree with the hon. Member for Yeovil that the Health and Safety Commission should approach the matter objectively, partly because of the intensity of the feelings concerned. I certainly do not think that health and safety matters should ever be approached in the House in a partisan spirit. We should start by looking at what is right and build our thoughts from that.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.0/4">From my own somewhat jaded ministerial experience, I know that in some issues of scientific policy experts will always come with different views and present them within Departments or outside the frame, and that they will comment on departmental decisions, which are ultimately the responsibility of Ministers. Ministers are well advised to take seriously the objective advice that they receive, to ask questions about its quality and, if necessary, to seek further advice&mdash;I do not advise that they depart from that. That is the way in which I would expect the Minister to approach the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.0/5">The difficulties that have emerged from the debate include the nature of risk. Clearly, the HSC must take the lead. It has demonstrated to my satisfaction that, although there is no question but that there is an element of risk, the risk is definitely less than that for other substances. It would normally be the practice in government to set the control level above the point at which there is real concern about occupational health. I remember from my time looking at becquerel counts that the control level is an order of magnitude different from where real danger is likely to arise. It has to be set appropriately, however.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.0/6">There is also the question of the European directive. The Minister needs to comment on the fact, which I know has concerned some TUC representatives, that there are two tests in the European directive&mdash;sparsity and low intensity. I take it that that implies two tests rather than merely being tautologous.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.0/7">We should also remember when considering risk elements that they will vary in particular circumstances. They may depend on the type of coating, the way in which it is placed on the wall, the likelihood of people ingesting it when they remove it, and so on. It is not simply a matter of saying that such things are safe or below the control level; the work has to be seen in context. I am concerned that there is no guarantee that the work will be done to a satisfactory standard by a non-licensed contractor. Indeed, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1526" name="Jon Cruddas">the hon. Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas)</phrase> has given examples of what goes wrong and there must be concerns about what happens. At the same time, if the requirements of the regulations are too onerous or inappropriately onerous&mdash;this is not an excuse but a statement of fact&mdash;people will be more likely to take the law into their own hands, knock the stuff out with a hammer and fly-tip it. I suspect that that is the worst of all possible outcomes. It is also worth saying that there is a general obligation, even if the specific regulations on textured coatings are lifted, for contractors to operate a safe working practice. The difficulty that Ministers are bound to have is that we are not likely to know for 40 years whether what has been done wrongly will have any effect. That is the dilemma.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.0/8">The long-term effect is real. On the other hand, it is impossible to give a permanent certificate for the status quo in such issues. They must be re-evaluated. Just because something has been restricted in the past is not in itself an argument for restricting it indefinitely if the risks are found to have changed. It is, I think, an argument for caution in making changes. Given the nature of the disease and the facts that have been properly set out by hon. Members from all parties, we cannot simply look for a commercially attractive solution without considering the matter coolly and objectively. It is therefore up to the Minister, based on the advice that she receives from the HSC, to make her own case.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.0/9">It is important that the Government should be informed by a number of general considerations. First, Ministers need to satisfy themselves that they have a proper understanding of the risks involved. I gather that the HSC is to look again&mdash;although we do not have all the data yet&mdash;at some of the issues. Those need to be factored into the decision, even if they cannot be factored into the consultation document because the consultation is now closing.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.0/10">Secondly, even if changes are made in the regulations, I hope that there will be some follow-up. It is right that when the commission&mdash;or local authorities acting on its behalf&mdash;considers building work, it should carry out proper monitoring of the activities that are undertaken. It is possible to take tests in buildings after the event and ask, &quot;Was it really cleared? Is it safe for domestic reoccupation?&quot; We should bear in mind, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> said some time ago, the fact that risk tends to arise from the removal of such substances rather than leaving them in place, and it is tremendously disruptive to the activities of schools and families when it is necessary to impose restrictions.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.0/11">The Government have also got to be ready&mdash;to steel themselves&mdash;to maintain specific controls where they are seen to be appropriate, in the light of any further evidence, and even to reintroduce elements of specific control for particular cases&mdash;perhaps taking into account the way in which the surfaces are configured or the nature of the anticipated occupational exposure for those removing them. Indeed, in the light of any monitoring that will take place if the regulations are relaxed, it should be possible to consider and, if necessary, to act on any changes that give rise to concern. Again, I emphasise to the Minister that it is not easy to do that. If Ministers do not carefully control the process, something could be let out the consequences of which we may not see for 40 years. That is why she has, rightly, to proceed with caution. If she had any doubts about that&mdash;I do not think that she did&mdash;she will have no doubts after this debate that there are real concerns. People have been killed, and there is a legacy that we should all be concerned about, whatever our politics, and however much we may have particular commercial or other interests.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.0/12">We need to get this right. It is a matter that goes far beyond sectional interests. This is one of those occasions when Ministers have to respond frankly to the public concern, look at all the evidence coolly and objectively, be prepared to keep their minds open to any changes that the evidence may bring over time, and do the right thing on behalf of our community and the people who work in it.</p>

	<p pid="b.20.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> on securing the debate. It has been a thoughtful debate on a very difficult subject, and I congratulate all the hon. Members who have participated. I am aware that there are great concerns about asbestos. They are shared by Members of all parties, as is highlighted by the list of those who have sponsored an early-day motion tabled by my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/2">Asbestos is an emotive issue and feelings run high, not least because of the tragic cases that have arisen, some of which hon. Members have highlighted in this debate. Many of us who represent former industrial areas or areas where there has been a strong mining community come across such cases in our daily activities as Members of Parliament. However, although these are difficult issues, I must stress that the precautions necessary to work with asbestos materials should also be proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/3">The Health and Safety Commission continues to take the risks from asbestos very seriously. About 3,500 people in Great Britain die every year because of past exposure to asbestos. That has been well illustrated by many hon. Members. Although we all recognise that this is a dreadful legacy, it is important to remember that there is a delay of between 15 and 60 years between exposure to asbestos fibre and the onset of asbestos-related disease. Most of those dying now were exposed to asbestos from the manufacture and installation of asbestos products between the 1950s and 1970s, when exposures were often high due to less stringent control measures. It is estimated that the number of deaths will peak between 2011 and 2015, but those will still in the main be due to past exposures, some of them from decades ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/4">Although the current high death rates do not in any way reflect current levels of exposure, it is necessary to retain stringent controls, and asbestos is one of the few substances that has its own set of regulations. Although asbestos is no longer imported or used, asbestos products are still present in many buildings&mdash;we have heard some examples this morning&mdash;that were constructed or refurbished between the 1950s and the 1980s.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/5">We have heard some horror stories. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" name="John Battle">the Member for Leeds, West (John Battle)</phrase> mentioned that schoolchildren used to make snowballs from asbestos; that clearly indicates that there was a time when asbestos was not thought to be the dangerous substance that we now know it to be.</p>

	<p pid="b.21.0/1">I just want to correct that. It was thought to be dangerous in 1936, but the companies concerned would not accept responsibility for what happened in the neighbourhood, although they accepted it for the factories. That is the problem.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.21.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2013" speakername="Anne McGuire" colnum="21"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h01.htm#60131h01_spnew28">
	<p pid="b.21.1/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for that intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/2">Because of the continuing risk from asbestos, the HSC has consulted on proposals that it believes would further strengthen the regulatory protection for workers. Today is the deadline for responses to the HSC's consultation on asbestos regulations. That is a happy coincidence&mdash;or perhaps the powers that be have managed to make it happen. It may help to clarify matters if I explain some of the HSC's proposals, but I should emphasise that before the HSC puts any advice before Ministers, it will carefully consider all the comments made during the consultation&mdash;and, of course, during this debate. Therefore, at this point in time Ministers have before us no proposals or advice from the HSC, and I should not&mdash;and cannot&mdash;pre-empt anything that it might say to us.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/3">It is proposed to retain the requirement currently in regulations for those employers who undertake high-risk work with asbestos materials to be licensed by the Health and Safety Executive. It is important to understand the purpose of asbestos licensing. It should not be confused with separate requirements to control work with asbestos, which apply to all work with asbestos.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/4">The example highlighted by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1526" name="Jon Cruddas">the Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas)</phrase> should not happen. Last year, the HSE issued 155 enforcement notices. There are situations in which licences are revoked. That example was horrific, and action should be taken. If my hon. Friend gives me the details of it, we can pursue that.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/5">Another important proposed amendment to the legislation would require employers to provide specific training for all workers who are, or who are likely to be, exposed to asbestos fibres. The proposed regulations would specify the training required to enable workers to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills, and although that is already covered in existing guidance, it would in future be a specific legal requirement. That would apply to all work, both licensed and unlicensed; that is an important point. Maintenance workers and others who are likely to encounter and disturb asbestos products during the course of their work will need asbestos awareness training. This requirement is imperative if we are to ensure that workers appreciate the possible risks and are able to use the correct measures sufficiently to reduce those risks. The training requirement would also support the duty to manage asbestos in non-domestic premises introduced into the regulations in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/6">During the consultation, there has been great focus on a single element in the proposals&mdash;the proposal to remove asbestos-containing textured decorative coating from the licensing regime. I take this opportunity to describe that proposal, and to explain why it has been made by the HSC, and&mdash;perhaps&mdash;to allay some of the concerns raised in this debate. The HSC is consulting on the proposal to remove such textured coatings from the licensing regime because recent research and a risk assessment have demonstrated that the risk is very much lower than was previously thought. I appreciate that hon. Members&mdash;such as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>, who is no longer present&mdash;may challenge that assertion, but that is the current judgment of the HSC. The consultative document includes a summary of the research on the removal of textured coatings and a wider risk assessment, and proposes amendments to the regulations on that basis. The HSE used research undertaken by the Health and Safety Laboratory, along with previous measurements, to calculate the risks to licensed asbestos removal workers from work with various different asbestos-containing materials.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/7">I take on board the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone about the controlled nature of the experiments, which was also reflected in some of the remarks made by Opposition Members. There will be a review of the science, recognising some of the concerns that have been raised; a peer review is currently being undertaken. That will of course be a part of the consultation exercise, and it will also form part of the material that will be taken on board by the HSC commissioners when the report is eventually given to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/8">Not all textured decorative coatings contain asbestos. Most such coatings contain chalk and gypsum plaster. In the judgment of the HSE&mdash;I appreciate that this is a matter of judgment&mdash;even when work to remove textured coatings is carried out poorly and dust is produced, only a very small proportion of that dust is released as asbestos fibres. Work with those textured coatings is currently within the scope of the HSE's licensing regime.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/9">It could be asked why all work with asbestos is not licensed. Asbestos licensing is a regime that is intended to cover the highest-risk asbestos-containing materials. Work with lower-risk materials and certain types of work of short duration are not licensed&mdash;</p>

	House of Lords Reform

	<p pid="b.23.1/1">It is a privilege to open a debate on House of Lords reform, the first such debate in this House since that which was initiated on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February</phrase> last year by the then right. hon. Member for Livingston, the late and much lamented Robin Cook. He was truly an outstanding parliamentarian and a superb ambassador for the House. How fitting it is that an issue so important to him and of such continuing concern to many Members in all parts of the House should be kept on the agenda in the way that today's opportunity is providing for it to be.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/2">In 1911, the Parliament Acts were introduced. They were accompanied by a statement from the Government that they intended to substitute</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/3" class="indent">&quot;for the House of Lords as it at present exists a second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of hereditary basis&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/4">Interestingly and telling, there was an accompanying caveat, which said:</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/5" class="indent">&quot;but such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/6">Pressing the fast forward button, we find that 92 years later, the Government presented seven options to the House on the future of the second Chamber. Each option was defeated, but it is relevant to recall that the option of an 80 per cent. elected and 20 per cent. appointed House came within three votes of being approved. It was defeated by 284 votes to 281. No fewer than 336 Members voted for 60 per cent., 80 per cent., or 100 per cent. election. However, it was not to be. A noble cause was put on the back burner.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/7">In late 2004, Lord Falconer signalled that the final stage of Lords reform could be expected to take place early in a third Labour term. Since then, internal division within the Government, and possibly some lethargy to boot, have combined to produce no significant development. The most recent utterance that I have encountered was from the Minister of State at the Department for Constitutional Affairs, whom I welcome to the debate. In response to a written question from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1786" name="Andrew Rosindell">the Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell)</phrase>, the right hon. and learned Lady said that the Government intended to go ahead with</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/8" class="indent">&quot;a Joint Committee of both Houses to consider and codify the powers of the House of Lords.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-01-09.240"><i>Official Report, </i>9 January 2006; Vol. 441, c. 240W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/9">Separately from that commitment, she underlined that the Government also intended to press ahead with plans for a time limit on consideration by the Lords of any Bill, with the proposed abolition of the remaining hereditary peers and with a free vote on the future composition of the second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/10">It is important that the momentum for reform be maintained and accelerated. Today, I want to argue for the sort of second Chamber that is suitable to a modern democracy. In other words, I am describing the way ahead. The first issue on which I wish to focus is that of functions and powers. It is my view, and I am convinced that there is almost consensus in the House, that the second Chamber should be a House of review, scrutiny and deliberation. In other words, whether it will in future be called the House of Lords or something else, it should continue to be complementary, but not duplicatory, to the work of the House of Commons. The logical corollary of that proposition, for which there is general support, is that the powers of the second Chamber should be broadly the powers that it possesses today.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/11">Thirdly, I wish to make a suggestion of which I am not the original author. When there are genuine and continuing controversies, a dispute resolution committee to resolve them should be established. It would make sense for that to be a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament, tasked with the responsibility to propose compromise amendments to legislation on which ping-pong between the House of Commons and the House of Lords was taking place.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/12">The matter of functions and powers is not especially difficult or controversial. I shall move on to the meat of the issue, from which we should not be long delayed.</p>

	<p pid="b.24.0/1">As for a dispute resolution committee, how many pings and pongs does my hon. Friend envisage before reference would take place? Would it still be necessary under the new dispensation slightly to change the amendment each time there was a ping or a pong, or would he go for a much more transparent arrangement?</p>

	<p pid="b.24.1/1">On the whole, I favour transparency, but I am open to persuasion. I do not have a definite view about the number of pings and pongs that should take place or be allowed to happen before the committee is invoked. There is something to be said for its being invoked slightly earlier than the arrangement at the moment, which allows for protracted exchange and continuing controversy.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.1/2">Several such thoughts have been articulated eloquently in the pamphlet published last year by University College, London entitled &quot;Reforming the House of Lords: Breaking the Deadlock&quot;. It was a cross-party publication authored by the late Robin Cook, my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, my right hon.

Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> on introducing such an important debate. During the past eight months, I have been troubled as a new Member of Parliament by the number of times I have agreed with him. I have not had the benefit of reading the pamphlet to which he referred, but how many other countries with upper Houses have a disputes resolution committee?</p>

	<p pid="b.24.3/1">That is a question of the quality to which we have become accustomed from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase>. It is one of those questions that is asked ordinarily by someone who knows the answer to it, although now might be an exception. I must admit that I do not know. I think that there are about 69 second Chambers throughout the world, 47 of which have a mixed membership. However, that is a different point, and I admit that it is somewhat irrelevant to his question. Perhaps one of the authors of the report can answer him.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.3/2">Almost irrespective of that which applies elsewhere, there is an argument for trying to break the logjam and to ensure that there is a mechanism whereby people of good will can abandon megaphone diplomacy, sit round a table and try to resolve issues in a civilised way, perhaps in a fashion that members of the public engaged in a continuing argument would employ.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. Does he share my worry that in discussions about House of Lords reform, the good work carried out in a modest way by the House of Lords to revise our legislation is often overlooked by the public, who tend to concentrate on what the membership of the upper House should be, rather than the function that it undertakes?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.25.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" speakername="John Bercow" colnum="25"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h02.htm#60131h02_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.25.1/1">I agree. The House of Lords does a good job in the circumstances. I shall explain more fully what I mean by that.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/2">I wish to talk about the principles of composition of the second Chamber. For a long period, I felt strongly that we should, in a modern democracy, have a fully elected second Chamber. I have not departed from that view, but I reckon that the prospect of achieving agreement to it in political reality is somewhere between minimal and non-existent. I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that there is something to be said for fashioning a proposal for a mixed, predominantly elected, second Chamber. That is the view of a number of colleagues here today, and it happens to be mine.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/3">We can argue the toss about what the precise distribution should be, but my suggestion is that to have 70 per cent. elected and 30 per cent. elected is reasonable and would command widespread support. There has been widespread support in the House and in opinion poll after opinion poll for a predominantly elected second Chamber, but the notion of a mixed composition, respecting the principle of democracy and retaining the principle of existing, but unelected, expertise should unite colleagues rather than divide them.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/4">The second principle is that the second Chamber, once reformed, should be a great deal smaller. At the moment, the House of Lords comprises 728 Members. I do not believe that we suffer from under-government in this country, but there is a compelling argument that in important respects we are materially disadvantaged by over-government. If we are to have a Chamber that is in any case principally about review, scrutiny and deliberation&mdash;in many cases, the attempt to reach consensus&mdash;a smaller group of people is almost certainly desirable. I suggest a Chamber of approximately 300 Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/5">Thirdly, there is merit in the principle that the Chamber should, in formal terms, be hung. That is to say, no one party should ordinarily enjoy a majority in that Chamber, and it would be possible to construct a revised House of Lords so as either to render that impossible or to make it highly unlikely that one party would command an overall majority.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/6">My fourth principle is that Members of the revised and reformed second Chamber should serve much longer terms than those in the House of Commons. This is another example of how, in terms of character and ethos as well of function and expectation, it would be a very different Chamber from the House of Commons. The notion that we are just mirroring the House and providing for duplication or guaranteeing rivalry and unhealthy tension is rebutted by the fact of those desirable arrangements. Between 12 and 14 years would probably be the right period for someone to serve.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/7">My fifth principle, and it is incredibly important that this should be included in the arrangements, is that membership of the second Chamber should be for a non-renewable term. Not only should it be non-renewable in the sense that someone who was elected and has served should not then be able to serve another term in the second Chamber, but no such individual should have the right immediately&mdash;if at all&mdash;to go for election to the House of Commons. We need to establish and preserve the distinctiveness of the second Chamber that we seek to establish.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/8">If there is to be patronage on the part of the Prime Minister in the appointment of people to the upper House or the revised second Chamber, whatever its designation, that patronage should be kept to a minimum. The suggestion has been made that the Prime Minister should be entitled to appoint up to four people a year, and I concur, but it should not be more than that.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/9">There is real merit in having the elections taking place on the same day as elections to the House of Commons, but on a regional basis and via a system of proportional representation, the better to conduce to precisely the non-partisan, consensus-seeking political culture that is desirable.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/10">I do not feel strongly about specific categories of people who are currently part of the appointed element of the House but, overall, I confess that there is a lot to be said for including the Law Lords, who have a very distinctive and valuable contribution to make, attributable to their particular expertise, which is relevant to legislation, the approach to human rights issues and a miscellany of other matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/11">On the whole, though I would not go to the wall over it, I am much less sympathetic to the notion that special places should be preserved for the bishops. They undoubtedly might be, and frequently are, sources of great ecclesiastical wisdom, but that does not mean that they should also be sources of political authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.26.0/1">I am listening very carefully to the hon. Gentleman's arguments and agree with almost all that he says. I would like to be clear on one thing: when he says Law Lords, does he mean serving Law Lords or former ones? Former Law Lords make an inestimable contribution to the present House of Lords. The serving Law Lords are constrained by their judicial role and intervene very little in debate on matters of the day.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.26.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" speakername="John Bercow" colnum="26"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h02.htm#60131h02_spnew8">
	<p pid="b.26.1/1">I was not going to confine the appointed element to serving Law Lords. It should apply to those who have retired from their positions.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/2">We have a pretty clear idea of what could constitute a set of principles for a predominantly elected second Chamber. There is, of course, the very important question of our approach towards the appointed element of the House. My view is that there should be a statutory appointments commission, the responsibility of which would be to recommend names. The names recommended should then go before a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament for determination.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/3">As a second principle when dealing with the appointed peers, it is desirable to suggest a minimal focus on party. Of course people should be entitled to have a political preference, and perhaps even a publicly stated party affiliation, but one wants to keep that to a minimum because we seek to provide for the appointment of a set of people of distinction and expertise that is not driven by or particularly related to party political loyalty.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/4">My third point on the appointed element is that it is long overdue and politically essential that we break the link between the peerage and Parliament. If the honours system is to be preserved&mdash;there is a powerful case for doing so&mdash;people can be made Lords, and will be, from time to time. If the Queen is pleased to approve recommendations for peerages for individuals, so be it. It should not follow that because someone is entitled to call himself a Lord, or herself a Lady, that individual should enjoy a seat in Parliament. We have a great and historic opportunity to break a link that has become increasingly discredited. Let us take it.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/5">I should like to say something about the status of the second Chamber in the new circumstances that I envisage regarding salaries and allowances. Let us be clear: the second Chamber at present is&mdash;I say this not pejoratively but as a statement of fact&mdash;a House of amateurs. That is unfortunate, anachronistic and in practical need of early replacement. The premise on which it is constituted is very clear. There are mainly gentlemen and, in some cases, lady amateurs who come in and contribute from time to time. No salary is paid or expected, accommodation is poor, facilities are inadequate and allowances are paltry. The underlying supposition is that most of the people in the second Chamber have means by which to sustain themselves: either they have inherited wealth or they have been successful in making money in industry, commerce or the City. In 2006, that seems quite wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/6">The related point is that allowances are very poor. My research suggests that if a Member of the House of Lords were to attend every single sitting day in a parliamentary Session and it ran to its full length, he or she would be entitled to &pound;13,000 in secretarial assistance. That is woefully inadequate. We accept, of course, that Members of the upper House do not have constituency responsibilities, but, if they are regularly to participate in important debates and undertake Committee scrutiny on public issues, why should we work on the assumption that they have nil or minimum contact with the outside world? That reinforces the notion that the upper House is just a club to which people come and in which they converse with each other without any sort of relevance to the country whose interests are at stake.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/7">I strongly believe that the Senior Salaries Review Body should consider the possibility of making the upper House essentially a professional House. That does not mean that there would necessarily be an expectation that people would serve full time, but there is something to be said for formally recognising the idea that a job is being done and that a salary should be paid. That salary would probably be somewhat less than in the House of Commons because there would not be an expectation that the work would be full time and there would not be a constituency element, but it would be a salary none the less. There should also be a decent sufficiency of allowances to ensure that, in a modern democracy, that constituent part&mdash;the revised second Chamber&mdash;could discharge its responsibilities effectively, irrespective of whether Members had means of their own on which to draw.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/8">The intention is to encourage the emergence and growth of a class of people of all political persuasions and, as I have emphasised, of none, who are more active in pursuit of their responsibilities. A study by the Public Administration Committee showed that 25 per cent. of Members of the House of Lords ask 87 per cent. of the questions and make 76 per cent. of the speeches or interventions. Now, I can almost hear the sedentary and unspoken intervention from any number of colleagues that that is probably not dissimilar to the position in the lower House. I am sorry to be anorakish about this, but there is an important difference: there is a much smaller number of Ministers in the House of Lords and therefore a much larger pool of question askers, speech makers and intervention contributors. In those circumstances, the fact that such a small fraction of the House is doing so much of the work on its Floor seems wrong. We want to encourage a different culture.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/9">I genuinely believe&mdash;I say this in all sincerity and with all respect to the Minister, who I suspect is on the side of the angels in this matter&mdash;that the issue of powers is a smokescreen put up in a determined but ultimately doomed attempt to conceal the division and indecision at the heart of the Government on this important matter. People of good will, sitting round a table, could resolve the issue of powers in the space of an afternoon. The matter could certainly be decided with no great difficulty on the Floor of the House in a similar time.</p>

	<p pid="b.28.0/1">To be fair to those on the side of the angels, one reason why the review of powers is taking place is that we have a thing called a manifesto, and one of the things guaranteed in that manifesto was the review that the hon. Gentleman has talked about. I would also suggest that his party was slightly busy between July and December, which meant that Conservative Members were not as robust as they could have been as far as this matter was concerned.</p>

	<p pid="b.28.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is partly right on both counts. There was a manifesto commitment, but I would argue that it is not necessary for a Joint Committee to take very long about the matter. He makes a fair point about the intervention of the Conservative leadership election and the inevitable delay that that caused. If the Minister is prepared to give an explicit commitment today that the Government will press ahead with all due speed in the matter, I will be greatly reassured.</p>

	<p pid="b.28.3/1">I stand rebuked by my hon. Friend. He is obviously less suspicious and sceptical than I have been up until now. Again, I wait with interest to hear what the Minister has to say.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.3/2">I think that we are clear that the House of Lords, in its revised form, will continue to have a very important role to play, but with powers essentially comparable to those that it enjoys at present. It is essential that we do not, as the late Robin Cook said in the big debate last February,</p>
	<p pid="b.28.3/3" class="indent">&quot;keep the second Chamber subordinate by keeping it illegitimate.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-02-04.161"><i>Official Report</i>, 4 February 2003; Vol. 399, c. 161&ndash;2</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.28.3/4">That would be an exercise of bad faith, and I certainly do not expect that from the Government or the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.3/5">Let us be explicit. A seat in Parliament should not be a prize for historic battles won, services rendered or favours done. A seat in Parliament should not be a mark of approval by the great and the good that someone is suitable to join their number. A seat in Parliament should be the result of a choice by voters that an individual has the equipment and can be relied on to deliver.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.3/6">The Chancellor of the Exchequer has talked many a time and oft about the merits of a progressive consensus. Well, many of us on the Conservative Benches are sympathetic to such a notion, and certainly many Conservatives are sympathetic to a progressive consensus on reform of the House of Lords. None is more distinguished in our House than my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe. However, we are in a curious situation. There is a progressive consensus between sizeable numbers of Conservative Members, and, in fairness, the Liberal Democrats, who need a little recognition and sympathy at the moment and whose commitment is of long standing. The progressive consensus also enjoys the support of sizeable numbers of Labour Members of Parliament, presumably including the very considerable number who voted for a fully or partially elected Chamber in 2003. Oddly, however, the progressive consensus currently does not enjoy the support of the Government, even though one of the most senior members of that Government is its most enthusiastic advocate.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.3/7">In the modern world, we have to have legitimacy and credibility in the exercise of power and scrutiny functions. That is why we have to move in the direction of a predominantly elected second Chamber. Let us have that progress soon&mdash;bring it on now.

	<p pid="b.29.0/1">When my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> rose to his feet at 11 o'clock, he was confident that he would catch your eye, Mr. Caton. He does not always have such confidence that he is going to be successful when he jumps up from his seat in the Chamber. We are grateful to him for initiating this important debate on House of Lords reform. It is a little bit like &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, which I think will be quite soon. We have had a number of debates about the next stage for the House of Lords. My hon. Friend mentioned that nearly a year ago the late Robin Cook initiated a debate at which he launched a document&mdash;&quot;Reforming the House of Lords&quot;&mdash;that bears the names of a number of Members present. I just want to add a few footnotes to what my hon. Friend said.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.0/2">When the Prime Minister begins to think about his legacy, he will find the page with &quot;House of Lords reform&quot; at the top of it as yet incomplete. If he wants to leave a legacy of which he can be proud, he will have to do something quite quickly. If one puts the matter in context, in retrospect, the Government should have heeded the advice of people such as Bob Sheldon, who warned them against initiating stage one without stage two. If the Minister casts her mind back to the debate during the 1997 to 2001 Parliament, many people warned the Government that if they split the process in two, they would not get further than the first hurdle. The argument was turned around, and we were told that if we tried to do it all at once, we would fail and get nothing; but if we split it into two digestible sections, we would be more likely to complete the reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.0/3">It is worth reminding Members that when Lord Wakeham wrote his report during that Parliament, he was hoping that the first regional elections to the House of Lords would take place in 2001. That was the pace at which reform was expected. In the Government's response to the Wakeham report, they said that they would</p>
	<p pid="b.29.0/4" class="indent">&quot;make every effort to ensure that the second stage has been approved by Parliament before the next general election.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.29.0/5">That was the 2001 general election. But, of course, nothing happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.0/6">During the last Parliament, there was the fiasco of the vote to which my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham referred. My hon. Friend is a very generous man, because he might have reminded Government Members that there was a commitment in the 2001 Labour party manifesto to a more democratic and accountable House of Lords. Presumably, the Prime Minister had some passing connection with the drafting of that commitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.0/7">It is astonishing that between 2001 and 2003, the Prime Minister made a complete U-turn. When it came to the vote, he voted for a wholly appointed House of Lords. How he reconciled that with the manifesto commitment to a more democratic and accountable House of Lords escapes me.</p>

	<p pid="b.30.0/1">The explanation is quite simple: the Prime Minister developed a lethal addiction to unfettered power.</p>

	<p pid="b.30.1/1">My hon. Friend is moving into a less generous mode than that which he exhibited when he was on his feet. It is astonishing, given the rebukes that should have fallen on the Prime Minister for that complete U-turn on a major constitutional proposal, that he escaped quite lightly. As my hon. Friend said, the key division on the 80 per cent. proposal was lost by three votes. It would be fair to say that there was a certain amount of confusion and tactical voting that evening. The important conclusion is that if one considers all the Divisions, there was a majority for a predominantly elected second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/2">We should have taken a warning that the Government were not going to make fast progress from their response to the Wakeham report. There is a sentence that is worth reading out, but before I do, let me say that it does not come from &quot;Yes, Minister&quot;. Giving the impression that the Government accepted the Wakeham proposals, they said:</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/3" class="indent">&quot;There are however a number of areas where further consideration of the practical effects of certain recommendations led the Government to consider some modification of the precise recommendations so as to ensure implementation of the Commission's principles in the most effective way possible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/4">Sir Humphrey could not have bettered that paragraph. In the ensuing eight or nine years, whoever drafted it has probably become a permanent secretary somewhere. It is a remarkably skilful exposition. Indeed, we have not made much progress since then.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/5">I am reminded of a story that Michael Foot told the House about a conjuror in his Plymouth constituency who asked a member of the audience to produce a gold watch. Another member of the audience produced a silk handkerchief, which was placed over the gold watch. The conjuror produced a mallet, and brought it down with some force on the handkerchief and the watch. He then said, &quot;I'm frightfully sorry, but I've forgotten the rest of the trick.&quot; In a sense, that is what the Government have done with the House of Lords. They have abolished what was there, and they have not got round to the second half of the performance.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham came up with some recommendations for what a new Chamber might look like. The authors of the document before us are flattered that his proposals bear some resemblance to what was in the document: in particular, he mentioned a much smaller upper House, which would be predominantly elected. We want to get from this debate some idea about the speed of and the commitment to the process by which we shall move on from where we have been for five or six years.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/7">In the Norton report, the Wakeham report and the unanimous Public Administration Committee report, there is not much controversy about powers. I am deeply suspicious if the Government are now saying, &quot;We can't make progress until we look at the powers.&quot; I am afraid that that is equivalent to putting the matter in the long grass. There is broad consent about powers. All the reports are roughly agreed. Yes, we must do something about ping-pong, but that need not arrest the process of moving towards a more legitimate second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/8">I want to make one point about the argument that is always held against those such as myself and my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> who prefer a predominantly elected second Chamber. We are told that there is a risk of a rival mandate, and that another Chamber with an elected element will somehow challenge this House. However, in the proposals in our document, the second Chamber is clearly defined as complementary and subordinate to this House. Its only powers would be those given to it by this House, which is and would be pre-eminent. The second Chamber would not be able unilaterally to change its powers.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/9">None the less, there has been an assertion that members of a second Chamber, were they elected, would have some moral authority that enabled them to challenge the authority of this House. I do not accept that. Members of this House are all elected on the same day on the basis of the same manifesto, and we are elected for one Parliament to the pre-eminent House, which sustains the Executive and produces the Prime Minister. We submit ourselves for re-election. None of those conditions would apply to the second Chamber as proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham and those who produced the report. Members of a second Chamber would be elected not all at the same time, but over a certain period. They would therefore have no mandate, and some would be not elected at all, but appointed. The notion that they could somehow convert themselves into an equally legitimate Chamber that could challenge the authority of this House is simply for the birds.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.1/10">We welcome the Prime Minister's commitment to give Government Members a free vote. No doubt, it will release some of them from any shackles of loyalty to the Prime Minister that they may have felt before. I hope that the Minister will explain in which of the Lobbies she personally will vote, if there is a free vote, as we are entitled to know that and to have it on the record. I also hope that she will give us some idea of when the vote will take place. Finally, I hope that she will provide a commitment that the necessary legislation for a legitimate second Chamber will be on the statute book by the end of this Parliament. If we can obtain that, my hon. Friend will have secured a debate of enormous value to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> on raising the debate and agree with practically every proposition that he has put forward. The debate on House of Lords reform has been going on interminably, although fortunately the pace has stepped up slightly during the past two Parliaments. There is always a danger that people will want to put this subject into the long grass, and I am delighted that my hon. Friend has mown the grass a little, and given us the opportunity of hearing the Minister explain&mdash;with a little more clarity than has been evident, I hope&mdash;precisely where the Government are and how they intend to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/2">I very much agree with almost all the points that my hon. Friend made. I worked with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>, together with Robin Cook, Paul Tyler and others from all parties during the last Parliament, to produce the proposals in the document on reforming the House of Lords to which my hon. Friend referred. I am pleased and flattered to listen to my hon. Friend and realise that, with minor exceptions, he is very close to those proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/3">The authors of that paper were not unanimous on every point when we started. Our objective, genuinely, was to do a little trading and reach some compromise in order to produce proposals that would command the widest possible support across parties in the House of Commons. At various stages, we all compromised with the others with whom we were working to achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/4">My hon. Friend's speech encourages me to believe that we got near our objective. He expressed what is not exactly consensus across the House of Commons, but I do not believe that anything he said would be violently objected to by Members of Parliament of any party who have taken a genuine and close interest in the subject recently. While the Government have, with great respect, dithered and moved far more slowly than they should on the subject, a body of opinion is forming, and people are becoming impatient to move pretty much in the direction that my hon. Friend recommended today.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/5">I shall be slightly churlish and comment on the one thing on which I did not wholly agree with my hon. Friend and on which I have some doubts. Like my hon. Friend, I start from the position that I would prefer a wholly elected Chamber. However, I have been persuaded that that is not only unrealistic but that some good arguments can be made in favour of having an appointed element, so long as the appointments are free from patronage and party political content. There are good arguments for the present House of Lords, which has moved on from Gilbert and Sullivan's day, when it</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Did nothing in particular</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/7" class="indent">And did it very well.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/8">At present, it plays a more powerful role in Parliament by raising some important points about the quality of legislation, about civil liberties and so on. There is an argument that it is the most effective part of Parliament in holding the Executive to account in the interests of John Citizen and in making us all reflect on some of the extraordinary things that are passed by the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/9">One reason why the House of Lords is able to do that is that it is not reserved for the professional politician. I am not so old-fashioned as to believe in the Victorian concept of the amateur being the best person to do everything, but the House of Commons has lost the knights of the shires, the trade union activists and the gentlemen with political interests who had their activities outside and came to the House to do their duty. Although many Members of the House of Commons have outside interests&mdash;not as many as used to&mdash;we are, largely, professional politicians. We are criticised for becoming a closed community of professional politicians with an increasing number who have never had any career but politics from the moment they left university.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/10">At present, the House of Lords benefits from the expertise to which my hon. Friend referred. If we accept the argument that there should be appointed peers, we must ask exactly what sort of men and women we are thinking of. There is a case for the man or woman who, throughout the 12 years of office&mdash;if that is what we decide&mdash;remains predominantly scientists, academics, lawyers or business men, and who are not able to attend the House of Lords every day and to immerse themselves in full-time political careers. Plainly, if we were to start putting in place full-time salaries and large staffs, if we were to make decisions on the basis that a smaller number of peers would all be professionals, such people would be driven away.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/11">If we are to accept the idea that some men and women in the upper House&mdash;a minority&mdash;would not stand for election but would be there for their independence, expertise or prestige, we must allow some room for the sort of person who will probably take part only in debates that are within their medical interest, or their business experience, or whatever it may be. I would be a bit cautious about saying that in order to get the legitimacy that we all want the upper House should be composed of full-time professional politicians who are different from those in the House of Commons only because they do not want to pursue the career of politics.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/12">However, the fact that I am not repeating my hon. Friend's arguments does not mean that I wish to undermine them in any way. I was pleased to hear them and would be absolutely delighted were we to proceed on the basis that he described. If he were whipping a Bill through the House of Commons, he would get my support, and we would have an improved, more powerful, more effective Parliament as a result.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/13">Let me say what I expect from the Minister on this important occasion. I, like my hon. Friend, am prepared to be generous and to wait to hear a helpful contribution from the Minister. However, she must deal with my suspicions about where the Government are going. I have taken part in such discussions over the years, and my feeling is that the Prime Minister long ago regretted ever raising the subject of House of Lords reform, and that many members of the Cabinet deeply regret taking the lid off a Pandora's box. They have been trying to put it back on, and they have been trying to kill reform ever since it started. The more they have come to love Executive power, the more they have decided that improved accountability for Parliament is, perhaps, something that should wait for a future Administration of which they are not members&mdash;they are not ready for it at present.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/14">My right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire referred to past manifesto pledges, and the expectation that the second stage would follow the first stage fairly promptly. All that is obviously all fading away. I hope that the Minister can allay my unworthy fears. There are times when I believe that the Government have just two objectives. One is to get rid of the remaining hereditary peers who, in my opinion, are in the upper House as a result of a most peculiar arrangement negotiated with great skill by my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Cranborne. No other country in the world could have produced, in a modern constitution, elected hereditary peers with only an hereditary electorate.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/15">However, people of remarkable quality have emerged from that ugly Mickey Mouse system, which would be derided as an example of a reactionary, undemocratic process if it were introduced by some leader of a Government in sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, if it pleases the Back Benchers, the Labour party will be alongside them to get rid of the remaining hereditaries. Personally, I think that the hereditary principle is dead in contemporary politics, and I would not defend the continued existence of hereditary peers. Plainly, people should not be in the upper House of a modern legislature by virtue of birth.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/16">The Government's only other interest is to reduce the powers of the House of Lords. That is what the present review is about, and there will probably be another Joint Committee of both Houses on it. The Government want an entirely appointed upper House with fewer powers and less ability than the present House of Lords has to slow the scrutiny and flow of legislation. I am afraid that I am becoming more and more convinced that that is the agenda of the Prime Minister and a large proportion of the Cabinet.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/17">For that reason, we should obstruct any attempt to move in that direction if there is no sign that the Government are prepared to consider the wider issues of the legitimacy of the Lords, improvements in its composition and things that might give it more power and authority. I would probably even find myself voting for and defending the hereditary peers, not because I believe that they should remain a moment longer than is necessary after proper reform is undertaken, but because I would resist the Government's being allowed to get rid of them without paying the price of introducing more democratic elements and more elected members.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/18">The key argument, which has been made over and over, is unanswerable: to make Parliament more powerful, our revising Chamber&mdash;the upper House&mdash;must have more legitimacy, and, in the modern world, legitimacy comes from the fact that the man or woman has his or her own mandate based on a section of the population who have been persuaded to send them to Parliament. The House of Lords carries out its present task very well, but it would be a more formidable influence if most of its Members had the legitimacy that comes only with democratic election.</p>

	<p pid="b.35.0/1">The right hon. and learned Gentleman waxes lyrical about the Executive&mdash;an overweening Executive, as he sees it. I am interested in his contribution to this debate, but will he tell us how his views have evolved during the past 20 or 30 years? It strikes me that between 1979 and 1997 nothing happened on the issue of House of Lords reform. Was he arguing for change, democratic legitimacy and a reformed House of Lords but simply ignored by his colleagues in Government, or have his views changed since that period?</p>

	<p pid="b.35.1/1">I accept that the Governments of whom I was a member took the view that we could not touch the subject because there was such a wide range of opinion. Opinion, however, has moved on. It was the Pandora's box argument. The 1911 settlement was described as temporary, but almost a century of Governments decided that the temporary had better remain, because no one could agree on any alternative.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.1/2">Even 20 years ago, in both Houses there would have been people flatly against any reform. The House of Lords reforms agreed by all parties, introduced so long ago as to be before my time here, were destroyed by Michael Foot and the orthodox Labour party, who were in favour of unicameralism and did not want a second Chamber at all, and by Enoch Powell and the Tory traditionalists, who thought hereditary peerage a fine and defensible part of our constitution. All that put everybody off for many years.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.1/3">During our time in office, the Executive grew ever more powerful and Parliament began to grow weaker. That has continued and, in my view, has accelerated in the past seven years; the urgency of the issue has therefore got greater and greater as time has gone by. Most of us believe in parliamentary democracy, and quite a lot of democrats from all parties in this Chamber today think the time has come to put a further check on the Executive into the House of Lords.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.0/1">The Conservatives, of course, introduced life peers in the 1950s&mdash;absolutely nothing happened during the Labour years of the 1960s. The criticism from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1545" name="Edward Miliband">the hon.

	<p pid="b.36.1/1">My hon. Friend is right; that was a very important change. It was astonishing that the flow of hereditary peers continued to be fed until a Conservative Government abolished them. My predecessor as Conservative Member for Rushcliffe became a hereditary peer and his son still holds the title, although he has not been elected to the upper House. Reform came from outside, and that was the most significant change.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.1/2">It is important that we settle this issue. If the argument of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1545" name="Edward Miliband">the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband)</phrase> is that we Conservatives are playing a double game and that if we were to win the next election, a Conservative Government would decide immediately that they did not want to weaken the Executive and would not go ahead and reform, all I can say is that at least four Conservatives here would be utterly outraged and that position would be indefensible. We are committing ourselves to a process whereby it would be absolutely impossible for a Conservative Government not to tackle the subject and move on to the second stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.2/1">I put it to my right hon. and learned Friend that the sort of proposals that I have outlined this morning, which are closely modelled on his and his colleagues' outstanding pamphlet of last year, are in the best traditions of Conservative reform. Such proposals seek to preserve the best and improve the rest, and to adapt Conservative principles for proper application to the circumstances of our time.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.3/1">I am not sure that the late Robin Cook would have agreed entirely with that. I think that the proposals are in the best Conservative traditions, although Robin obviously thought that they were in the best traditions of the radical elements of the Labour party as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.3/2">Robin and I always got on well personally, but I thought we were politically like chalk and cheese until we suddenly found ourselves in total agreement on House of Lords reform and, as it happens, on the invasion of Iraq. The fact that people such as Robin Cook, my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham and I could be brought to such close agreement shows that the time is right for such reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.3/3">Finally, I should say that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham has chosen the right day to raise this issue. Later today, we shall discuss a highly controversial Bill on the Floor of the House. In my opinion, views on that Bill cut across parties, because it raises all kinds of ethical and legal issues in such a way that one cannot automatically assume which way a member of the Labour, Liberal Democrat or Conservative parties will go on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.3/4">In the heat of publicity, we are being made to think again about and take a final decision on the content of that very difficult Bill. That has been an achievement for the upper House; over and over, the House of Lords has made us rethink things during the lifetime of this Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.3/5">However, if the Bill had been sent back in its amended form by a House of Lords that was largely elected and able to thunder that, like the Commons, it had democratic legitimacy on its side&mdash;although of a different type&mdash;the prospects of that Bill's being rewritten in a sensible form would have been hugely improved. The public would benefit from a House of Lords that had its present powers but was genuinely able to amend, scrutinise and put the Government's feet to the fire, even when the Government had a majority in the House of Commons.</p>

	<p pid="b.37.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> and to agree with almost everything that he said, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon.

Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>. Judging from their interventions, I suspect that I would also agree with the hon. Members for Tooting (Mr. Khan) and for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband).</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/2">The hon. Member for Tooting asked what other legislature in the world has an hereditary upper House. The answer was given in a speech made by the late Robin Cook&mdash;the legislature of Lesotho is the only one that can be found.

	<p pid="b.37.0/3">There is enormous frustration for those of us who, after 90 or however many years, see reform of our upper House as a priority, and wish to continue and finish the work done by David Lloyd George in introducing the Parliament Act 1911. Those of us who see that as a necessity if our parliamentary system is to have any legitimacy find ourselves constantly having to stand back in amazement and admiration for the work done by the unelected House of Lords. The right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe is absolutely right: at the moment, it acts as a bulwark for the rights of the citizen and for human rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/4">I have had more reason than most to welcome that, given the work that I have done in recent years on home and constitutional affairs. We have been constantly aware that we have friends in another place who are doing their jobs very well. However, in no way does that constitute legitimacy for an unelected House. It is time we made progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/5">I pick up the hon. Member for Buckingham on one thing in his otherwise extremely good speech. He talked about maintaining the momentum for reform, but there is no momentum; the reform process has the momentum of a garden slug. No progress is being made at the moment, and the reason is, I am afraid, that forces of reaction are determined that we should not make progress. Against that, we have the shining light of those who are genuinely engaged in the debate on reform, such as the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe, my noble Friend Lord Tyler, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> and many others who are looking seriously at ways forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/6">Why is there this impasse? It is because there is a view that progress can be made only when we all absolutely agree. Well, we are not all absolutely going to agree. The spectrum of opinion is a mile wide, between those whose view is unicameralist&mdash;although it is not a view that I share, many legislatures are unicameralist, and it is a proper and respectable position&mdash;and those who would prefer to go back to the hereditary principles and think that it is a great shame that we made even the minimal progress that we did. That overlooks the fact that there is a clear centre of gravity, certainly within this elected House, as demonstrated in the convoluted system used on the last occasion for voting on the different options. I think that the system was devised intentionally by the Government Whips to avoid our reaching a clear view. The hon. Member for Tooting was not in the House at the time, but let me tell him that the Government Whips had a clear role in frustrating the will of the majority in the House. It was a great sadness to see the then Leader of the House frustrated in his ambitions by other Ministers who wanted no progress. It was clear that there was a centre of gravity for a predominately elected House&mdash;my preference is for a wholly elected one&mdash;around which we could agree.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/7">We can make progress on a series of things if we approach them in a spirit of consensus. We need to consider the method of election, and I agree with the hon. Member for Buckingham that the logical view is that a proportional system should be used. A single transferable vote system, perhaps on a regional basis, as he describes, is most likely to give an appropriate result. That is a matter of detail. I understand the need for a system that means that the upper House reflects the genuine state of opinion across the country and does not give an artificial majority to a single party in a revising Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/8">There is a genuine issue about the length of mandate. Again, I agree with the hon. Member for Buckingham that a long mandate without renewal provides for an independence of Members of the upper House that would not otherwise occur. At a stroke, such a mandate removes many of the powers of patronage that would otherwise exist. There is a downside that we should recognise: such a mandate would also reduce the accountability to the electorate. Nevertheless, I can see an advantage in such a proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/9">There is a discussion to be had about duplication of function between the two Houses. Most of us see the primary role of the House of Lords&mdash;or an upper House&mdash;as that of a revising Chamber. It allows for greater scrutiny, which will perhaps be extended into areas of appointment in a way similar to the United States Senate. It performs a number of functions that are simply not possible for this House to do adequately within the constraints of time and the continuing process of legislation under which we operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/10">I am not sure that the upper House needs to continue replicating some of the things that we do. I have always thought it complete nonsense that a statement in our House from a Cabinet Minister is then solemnly read out in the other Chamber a few minutes later by a Minister there. I cannot see the point of that; it is not necessary for a revising Chamber to respond to the announcement of the day from a Minister. Indeed, I would question whether we need Ministers in the House of Lords at all. I see no reason why they should not go to the House of Lords to present legislation, but if they were not drawn from the ranks of the membership of the upper House, it would remove an area of patronage that is not helpful to the independence of that Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/11">We need to re-examine disqualification. It is extraordinary that someone can be a Member of the British Parliament having served a sentence for a criminal offence of sufficient seriousness to require imprisonment. If it is not allowed for us, it should not be allowed for any Member of this legislature. That needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/12">The Minister said that she would seek to entrench the primacy of this House. That is right, but primacy will be established if we are clear about the relative functions. As was said earlier, it is right that we do not establish primacy by establishing illegitimacy on the part of one half of our legislative system.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.0/1">We are agreeing about so much that it does not matter if, periodically, there is something about which we disagree. I return to the principle of the rehabilitation of offenders. On the assumption that someone who has served a prison sentence is able to secure public support, there should not be an objection to such an individual serving in the upper House.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.1/2">If we are to retain any element of patronage, we must stop its abuse. It is a corruption of the political process for major donors to political parties to be admitted to the legislature apparently only because they donated large sums of money to any one of the parties. That does enormous harm to Parliament as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.3/1">I am running out of time and other hon. Members wish to speak, so if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will make progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.3/2">We need to avoid the minutiae. There will be a long and, I suspect, involved debate in another place this afternoon about the Lords speakership. I have my views on whether the Lords should have a Speaker, but it is a peripheral issue. We need to talk about the basic form and function of the Lords. That is my concern about the proposed Committee of both Houses and it is why we have raised questions with the Leader of the Lords about its remit. There is a danger that the Government want to divert attention on to complicated issues of the marginal powers of the House of Lords rather than to look holistically at form and function, which is what is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.3/3">I want the Joint Committee to have a clear remit covering all those issues and a clear time scale, so that the danger of the subject being kicked into the long grass&mdash;a situation that has been described&mdash;is avoided. I have a nagging suspicion that the alacrity with which some noble Friends of the hon. Member for Buckingham wished to join the Joint Committee was simply to maintain it in existence for as long as possible and avoid the reality of reform. That might have been at the back of their minds.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.3/4">We need better terms of reference, a time scale and a draft Bill at the earliest opportunity, as part of a democratic renewal that goes beyond reform of the Lords, Commons, European Union, civil service and voting system, and which involves a reinvigoration of our democracy in this country. That is what we should all be about.</p>

	<p pid="b.40.0/1">We are all grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> for giving us the opportunity to debate House of Lords reform. He presented his arguments with his customary eloquence and force of argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/2">I remember the similar debate that we had a year ago, which was opened by Robin Cook. He referred to the pamphlet, &quot;Reforming the House of Lords: Breaking the Deadlock&quot;, which has made a good contribution to building consensus. It was excellent that we were able to have contributions from my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>, both of whom were part of the team that produced that pamphlet.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/3">It was 11 years ago that the Prime Minister, in his manifesto for the leadership of the Labour party, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/4" class="indent">&quot;I support Labour's commitment to replacing the House of Lords with an elected second chamber&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/5">As my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire said, that was repeated in the 1997 and 2001 Labour manifestos in pledges to make the second Chamber more democratic and representative. Instead, in his ninth year in office and as he approaches the end of his premiership, the Prime Minister has given us a second Chamber that is more dependent on patronage than it was in the day of Pitt the Younger. That is because the Government failed, at the outset, to grasp the nettle and have a full reform. At the time, Conservatives did not oppose getting rid of hereditary peers, but we argued that there should be a full reform with the consensus that is necessary for success behind it. We were mindful that in 1911, in the days of David Lloyd George, who was quite dodgy on the patronage front by all accounts&mdash;although he is a colossus in constitutional history&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.40.2/1">I am sure that David Lloyd George would agree with the hon. Gentleman about that. I understand that a full price list was available.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/2">We have made it clear that we would like to move forward and build consensus, and that a substantially elected second Chamber is required. Since 1999, we have had two White Papers, a royal commission, a Joint Committee, free votes and, most recently, Lord Falconer's ill-fated proposals, which he withdrew in March 2004. We are not much nearer to solving the problem than we were in 1997. It is time that we tried to find a balance. As has been said, that balance is very much around the idea of a substantially elected chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/3">I remember the comment made by Robin Cook that what the Prime Minister has done so far is to move us</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/4" class="indent">&quot;from the 15th-century principle of heredity to the 18th-century principle of patronage.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/5">Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether we are to go any further down that route. The Prime Minister has appointed 46 per cent. of the current House of Lords, including 70 per cent. of Labour peers and 65 per cent. of Liberal Democrat peers. He has created 100 more peers in eight years than Lady Thatcher created in 11 and a half. He is the uncrowned king of the ermine. I think that he has a taste for it; perhaps when one is Prime Minister, patronage seems like a jolly good thing when one is exercising it. We deserve better.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/6">If one considers the way in which the House of Lords has performed, one sees that it has been the bulwark that has stood up for human rights and civil liberties in recent months. Control orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 are essentially a form of house arrest and an abuse of habeas corpus, and we would not have had the sort of thorough review of that legislation that we ended up with, or the need for further parliamentary approval in 12 months' time, were it not for the active approach of the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/7">As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe said, it is the Lords who have ensured that the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill has been substantially amended. Although other issues are to be discussed this afternoon, the improvements that have been made to that Bill, which I am sure that the Government will trumpet this afternoon, saying that it is now a better Bill, are the result of the work of the House of Lords. It is the Lords who are exposing all the inadequacies, loopholes and impracticalities of the legislation on identity cards. Although there are concerns on both sides of the House of Commons about that, it is only in the Lords that anything is done. Those are a few examples of the shame of the House of Commons, which is that although the elected Chamber consists of people who were sent here to debate such issues and fight for civil liberties where they are being oppressed, we are unable to tackle those issues seriously because of severe guillotining and all the problems that the Government visit on us; the other House is doing that valuable work.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/8">I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe that when we get a plan for a Joint Committee to seek agreement on</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/9" class="indent">&quot;codifying the key conventions of the Lords, and developing alternative forms of scrutiny that complement . . . those of the Commons&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/10">and on proposals to introduce limits on the time that Bills spend in the second Chamber, we are suspicious. There has been no delay from us. We got into negotiations about the form of the Committee with the Government and nobody has criticised us for not being speedy about it, so I want to make it clear that we have been prompt and willing to get on and consider the issues. If the Liberal Democrat spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>, was suggesting that that is in some way a problem, I say to him that it is not. We are prepared to be genuine and to consider these issues, but we are suspicious.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/11">I am not convinced that the commitments are really a new determination by Labour to improve scrutiny and accountability, and I am concerned that they are an attempt to stop the House of Lords from doing what it has been doing: scrutinising Government legislation effectively. With the Lords disabled, a Prime Minister who loves patronage, and a Government who silence debates with guillotines, the worry is that arrogance will become a greater feature of our system than it has been. We will resist that. Hopefully, it will be possible for the Joint Committee to have a sensible discussion about the powers, as my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham suggests, but the Minister should not think that we do not have our suspicions, because we do. I hope that there will be a genuine process of trying to achieve a better second Chamber. We believe in accountable Government and want proper, final reform of the Lords. We want a second Chamber with legitimacy and the authority to stand up to Ministers, and we want to build consensus that supports that.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/12">My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham talked about the composition of the second Chamber and how it would operate in the new world. I agree that a mixed composition is probably the most acceptable solution. I voted for 100 per cent. elected membership but am prepared to consider a mixed solution. My hon. Friend suggested that there should be 300 members; that number is not far off a sensible sort of level&mdash;perhaps there could be a few more. I doubt whether proportional representation is the answer. It would be good if the second Chamber could have representatives of the counties and the big cities, and I doubt whether we need the single transferable vote to achieve that. It would be possible to elect directly, using the first-past-the-post system, representatives of our cities and counties&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Our Liberal Democrat spokesman is not keen on that, but of course he has to speak up for the STV, as his party has for 100 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/13">On longer terms, I agree that something long is the answer, and terms should probably be non-renewable, or perhaps renewable once.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/14">The Law Lords have been mentioned. The former Law Lords bring a great deal of knowledge and expertise and are important in the Lords, so perhaps the idea is a strong one.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.2/15">Breaking the link with heredity is inevitable, although we should consider what some of the hereditary peers have done in recent years and recognise that they have not done nothing. Some have, in effect, given their lives to doing a good job in the other place, and they have done it under the rules of our constitution. That should not be diminished. I hope that the best of what the hereditary and other peers have achieved can be continued in the new era with an elected, or substantially elected, second Chamber.</p>

	<p pid="b.43.0/1">I start by saying, as have other hon. Members, how much we miss Robin Cook&mdash;none more so than me, who worked closely with him on this matter as we took it forward.

	<p pid="b.43.0/2">I also thank the hon. Gentleman for the tone in which he led the debate, which was absolutely right. Perhaps I may start by getting some points about tone out of the way.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.0/3">There are two ways in which we can go about the matter. We can try to work together to find consensus in the House and make progress, or we can try to score points off each other. The hon. Member for Buckingham knows how to score points, but he chose not to on this occasion because he wants to make progress. I have seen him, blue in tooth and claw, and in party political point-scoring. He is a party political fighter, but he wants to make progress. I, too, am not averse to knocking spots off my political colleagues, but I do not think that that is how we will make progress in this debate. The Tories may say that it is all about the Prime Minister being greedy for power and the king of all ermine, or <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> might say that the debate has been interminable and challenge our good faith. We might respond by saying, &quot;You did nothing before 1997 and anyway you did not even take part in the 2003 vote.&quot; We can all do that, but those of us who want to make progress on constitutional issues must leave that baggage at the door, and I intend to do so.

The debate is important because it is about how we legislate in our democracy. <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir G. Young)</phrase> and the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe have long track records on this issue. New hon. Members are also present at the debate: I am happy to welcome my hon. Friends the Members for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband) and for Tooting (Mr. Khan), who will play an important part.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.2/3">The problem is that the House of Lords has a legislative role in our democracy, but it is not democratic at all. There is general agreement that to give people a role in our legislature by virtue of their birth is simply not defensible. We cannot have a central part of our democracy that is not democratic. That is why we legislated to end the hereditary principle. Now, all but 92 hereditary peers have gone, and we have a commitment in our manifesto, which we will carry out, to abolish the right of the remaining hereditary peers to legislate. However, we have to agree on what will replace the hereditary principle as the way to select people for the second chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.2/4">There is general agreement that we must ensure the primacy of the House of Commons. We want a clear line of accountability from Parliament to the people, and a clear line for the accountability of the Government to this House. That is where the Government's authority comes from. The Government must have authority and legitimacy or they cannot do their job. The difficulty comes with the concern that we all have to achieve two things. We need an effective second chamber, as the hon. Member for Buckingham said, for additional review, scrutiny and deliberation. However, we must be careful that, in our enthusiasm to say that we need a second chamber, we do not do a disservice to this House by underestimating the importance of the review, scrutiny and deliberation that happen here. We want an effective second chamber, but we do not want it to undermine or threaten the primacy of this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.2/5">That is why the question of composition is difficult and inextricably linked to the role and powers of the second chamber. I do not agree that the work of the Joint Committee is a smokescreen. The issue is not a problem for me: when I came to vote in 2003 without the powers all laid out and codified, I thought, as the hon. Member for Buckingham did, that we could sort that out afterwards. The problem is that not all hon. Members took that view, and we could not reach consensus. I approach the issue in the firm belief that the Joint Committee's work is not a smokescreen but a necessary precondition to reassure those hon. Members who feel that, otherwise, we will not deliver on our commitment to ensure the primacy of this House. That is why we will set up an all-party Joint Committee to codify the powers of the second chamber, ensuring, for example, that the Salisbury convention will be respected and that we have reviews and scrutiny&mdash;</p>

	School Community Activities (VAT)

	<p pid="b.46.1/1">My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary visited my constituency when he was an Education Minister. He has seen our massive educational under-attainment. He knows that we send the fewest young people to university of any constituency, and that at all seven secondary schools on my patch youngsters have no option of staying on at their own school at the age of 16&mdash;they all have to leave. Now he can do something to help.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/2">I wish to raise an issue that might seem small in scope but it is gigantic in its absurdity. I am referring to the extraordinary VAT penalty that new schools and colleges risk if they open up their facilities to the local community. Such schools should be the hub of regenerating our disadvantaged communities&mdash;open to adult learning, evening classes and public use of their gyms, halls, classrooms and swimming pools, so as to be central to personal and family development. As we develop our three academies in the city of Nottingham and get more local youngsters qualified to go to our local sixth-form college, the problem will become ever more obvious and unacceptable. There is room for a piece of joined-up thinking by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/3">In 2005 a brand new sixth-form college, Bilborough college, was opened in my constituency. At the moment only a handful of young people from the constituency get the grades to be educated there, but we are working hard on improving that. One way forward is for the college to play a bigger role in serving the community in which it is located; to break down the barriers and literally open up its doors. The principal of the college wants to play his role. The world-class facilities lie idle at evenings, weekends and holidays. While the Prime Minister and other Ministers are urging greater community involvement, the Treasury and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs block the way.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/4">The price that the principal would pay for opening up the college to the community starts at &pound;2 million. Why? Because when Bilborough college was rebuilt, it received a zero rating for VAT on the cost of its construction. That is to say, it avoided the levying of 17.5 per cent. taxation&mdash;a sum of about &pound;2 million. However, it received that rating at a price. If Bilborough college opens its state-of-the-art theatre to the local cub scouts for their annual play, or its media centre to the learning and skills council for literacy courses, it must not charge anything. If it opens its doors for more than 10 per cent. of the time&mdash;about an hour a day after school&mdash;it will lose its zero rating and have to pay the &pound;2 million in VAT.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/5">According to the college's principal, Martin Slattery,</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/6" class="indent">&quot;if you open your doors to the community then it precludes zero rating.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/7">The restrictions mean that 90 per cent. of the school's usage must be for its principal activity: the post-compulsory education of 16 to 19-year-olds. That severely restricts them from the education of adults. By failing to address that HMRC regulation, and instead of the school being a familiar environment for local youngsters to aspire to, the Treasury is in effect waving two enormous fingers at a needy community. Would it not be better to turn this perverse policy on its head and levy VAT on schools that do not open their doors to the local community?</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/8">Bilborough college, like many further education institutions, was taken outside local education authority control and turned into an independent charitable corporation. For the most part, its cousins in the local education authority do not face the same problem. They can do as they wish with their existing buildings and realise their potential. However, the 5 per cent. de minimis level for exempt attributable input tax is clearly challenging many local authorities, at a time when there is desire to develop new buildings for wider community use.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/9">We could find LEA schools adding VAT to prices, pricing out many of the locals who would want to come in and use the facilities, or we could find facilities being handed over to for-profit organisations. That is not what our school policy should be about. New buildings should be, first, for those who use them during the school day, and then&mdash;not far behind&mdash;for all the community. That is particularly true given that we are trying to break the anti-education culture, in which schools are places that no one goes to other than children up to the age of 16, and when they reach 16 they are released from that imprisonment to do whatever else they need to do. We need to get a sense of the school being at the heart of the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/10">Exactly the same issue affects some further education colleges. For example, the principal of New College Nottingham told me this morning that he would love to use the brand new building in High Pavement&mdash;which is in the middle of Nottingham&mdash;in the evenings, but cannot. He says that that is a terrible waste of a resource. He cannot do what he needs to do to spread the education mission in Nottingham, North, where we are desperate for that sort of revival. As I shall suggest, that education loophole could be closed quickly and to the benefit of all with very little loss to the Treasury.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.1/1">I would like first to move on to academies, because that subject is of interest to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/2">Appalling as the impact of the VAT problem is, it gets much worse when we consider the Government's expansion of their academies programme. In Nottingham, North, we have worked tirelessly to get two academies. Again, I thank the Minister and his education team for all that they did to help us in that regard. Those two academies will help us to break into our poor educational culture by concentrating on vocational work and training for 14 to 19-year-olds. They will help us once again to make education not just academic, and so irrelevant to many of the kids off the estates in Nottingham, North. Instead, it will be relevant to them, their future and the future of local families, and that will help to crack that anti-education sentiment.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/3">We are grateful that academies have been given the flexibility to allow that sort of curriculum and approach, rather than a plain, straightforward academic approach; that is a brilliant breakthrough, yet we are banning those same youngsters, adults, and families on those estates from their school outside normal school hours. As with the other schools in my constituency, I want these new institutions to be key players, not just in local education, but in the local community, and I want them to offer services to local people as well as day pupils. However, as those institutions fall outside local education authority control, any community involvement outside the school's core functions will incur a colossal VAT bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/4">In my constituency, three secondary schools are uniting to create two academies. The two people likely to be head teachers of those academies are full of trepidation that their dream of building schools that will play an integral part in the community will be shattered because of this nonsense.</p>

	<p pid="b.48.0/1">The hon. Gentleman will be aware that this is not just a Nottingham issue; Ministers will know that we in Bermondsey have been pursuing it with the Government for more than a year. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it needs to be sorted so that schools can be rescued&mdash;in our case from a &pound;3.5 million burden&mdash;and sorted soon? Until the Government come up with an alternative solution, the problem will blight not just those places that are waiting to do their job but many plans in the pipeline. This is a serious, central issue. Ministers keep saying, &quot;Any day now, we'll get you an answer&quot;, but we have had lots of those, and we need an answer soon.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.48.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="48"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h03.htm#60131h03_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.48.1/1">I agree very much that this is not just a Nottingham problem. In fact, people are anxious about the issue throughout the UK, particularly as the academies programme unravels. For example, Sam Price of the Bexley business academy estimates that the opening of his school doors to the community would cost &pound;7 million in VAT. That flies in the face of the objectives of academies, which, according to the academies sponsor prospectus from the Department for Education and Skills, is to</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/2" class="indent">&quot;serve the local community in which they are established, including sharing their facilities with the community&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/3">It is set out in the prospectus that is issued to the people whom we are trying to draw in&mdash;as we are doing in Nottingham, North. For example, the university of Nottingham is intimately tied in to the health academy that we want to build, and there are many other sponsors. The founding prospectus states that we want to share the facilities with the community, yet a small loophole could be disastrous for the meeting of that objective. The point is not to open to provide nice add-ons in middle-class areas. It is central to our belief in building our academies that they should be part of the answer to the broader problems of regeneration in our area. They must be at the heart of what we are doing, not peripheral to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/4">To return to the subject of the Bexley academy, it cost &pound;31 million to build, which is why it has the sword of Damocles of an enormous VAT bill hanging over its head if it involves the community. VAT on construction was waived by the Treasury, which gave it a zero rating just as it did for Bilborough college. If we are not careful, we could end up defying the very drive that has led us to try to improve schools locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/5">In Nottingham, North it is imperative that the two fantastic new institutions that we hope for in the next couple of years should not be, effectively, useless outside the school day. Ironically, they would then be offering less to the community at large than the schools that they will replace. It would be a tragedy if during evenings, weekends and school holidays local people were left looking enviously through the windows of those state-of-the-art buildings and could not use them and develop as a result. We in Nottingham have lobbied, cajoled and begged our way to getting the two academies, so that they can be at the heart of our revival and regeneration&mdash;not so that they can be off limits and elitist.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/6">So, that is the problem; here is the answer. The Treasury has argued that the sixth European VAT directive prevents it from exempting academies and new build further education colleges from VAT. The obvious solution, therefore, is to allow them to recover their VAT under section 33 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994&mdash;a provision that is already enjoyed by local education authority schools without the collapse of civilisation as we know it. Section 33 allows local authorities, along with other specific bodies, to reclaim VAT on non-business activities and certain VAT-exempt business activities. Article 4 of the sixth VAT directive provides for such VAT reclamation:</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/7" class="indent">&quot;States, regional and local government authorities and other bodies governed by public law shall not be considered taxable persons in respect of the activities or transactions in which they engage as public authorities, even where they collect dues, fees, contributions or payments in connection with these activities or transactions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/8">Academies, sixth form colleges and FE colleges clearly fit the EU's test for</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/9" class="indent">&quot;bodies governed by public law&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/10">under the Council directive 93/96. The sixth directive stipulates that those bodies should be considered taxable only if their activities</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/11" class="indent">&quot;would lead to significant distortions of competition&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/12">I fail to see how offering evening classes to parents, facilities for local amateur dramatics, language classes, music classes, computer classes or five-a-side football for local disenchanted youngsters would cause significant distortions of competition. The present state of affairs is madness and the Government need to resolve it quickly. The activities that I outlined are exactly what the LEA schools are able to provide, and what academies and sixth form colleges, particularly in educationally under-attaining areas, should be aiming to provide. The last bit of Treasury advice was that schools should dodge the article by providing their facilities for free, which means misusing money from the Department for Education and Skills and sponsors as a way round this stupid regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/13">I understand that HMRC told the DFES that academies would not be eligible for section 33 status because they do not have tax-raising powers. That is ludicrous. The sixth directive makes no such restriction on existing bodies included under section 33, such as probation committees, charter trusts, the National Rivers Authority, galleries and museums&mdash;none of them have any tax-raising powers. Providing academies with section 33 status would not require any primary legislation, so we have even got rid of that feeble excuse; a statutory instrument from the Treasury would suffice. Indeed, there is a precedent, and a good one too. A statutory instrument was used in 2001 to place museums and galleries under section 33. Giving academies that status would provide them with the capacity to fulfil a key part of their charters. Will the Minister give a commitment seriously to consider introducing a statutory instrument to deal with the problem?</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/14">I am afraid that that was a rather dry exposition of some parts of EU and tax law, but it is the way forward. The point that I made may appear to be a technical irrelevance, but it is central to what the Minister did so well in his previous incarnation as an Education Minister and what the current education team is also doing so well: helping me and those of us fighting for better education in Nottingham, North&mdash;the UK's most educationally under-attaining constituency&mdash;to propose ways of using schools, in accordance with what Ministers and the Prime Minister have said.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/15">I look forward to the Minister's reply on behalf of the Treasury&mdash;so too, I suspect, will my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, who will wish to understand why the schools that he intends to be the flagships of his educational reforms should be subject to a VAT penalty that other schools escape. I am sorry to put my hon. Friend the Minister on the spot, but I will be ruthless in ensuring that everybody, whether at No. 10 or anywhere else, realises the damage that this technical loophole is doing to one of our key education policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/16">The heads, teachers and local education authority officers in Nottingham, North, sweat blood in the UK's most difficult teaching environment, yet together we are creating a way forward to break the cycle of generations of under-attainment. That solution places a central role on schools as the heart of our communities, and unless it does that, it will fail. If the Minister cannot give us an immediate answer, I hope that he will make it clear that he is across the problem, sees it as a difficulty and will do his level best to help us, not only in Nottingham, North, but throughout the UK. The development of academies will give an extra boost to our efforts to involve communities in schools and schools in communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.50.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing this very important Adjournment debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/2">I know, from my previous incarnation, how much he personally has championed the importance of raising educational standards, ambitions and aspirations in his constituency if that area is to undergo the social and economic regeneration that he spends a great deal of his time trying to facilitate. I understand the passion that underpins his contribution. I shall also try to address the concern of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase>. I say to both hon. Members that I may be happy to disappoint them on any occasion, but to disappoint the Prime Minister might be more difficult. We will see whether my response helps to address some of the issues raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/3">As my hon. Friend said, the Government are committed to supporting all schools in opening their facilities for wider community use as part of our extended schools agenda. The Secretary of State for Education made it clear that in future all secondary and primary schools will offer access to extended services that help to meet the needs of their pupils, families and the wider community&mdash;child care, adult education, study support and community sports facilities, for example. The same potential benefits also apply when a further education college opens its facilities to extended community use. To support our commitment to extended schools, we have already provided &pound;160 million-worth of resources across the school sector, and intend to invest a further &pound;680 million by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/4">The provision of extended services and wider community use is our ambition for all schools, but I am aware that VAT consequences have been a concern in that respect. As a Treasury Minister, I do not deny that it is a live issue that we need to address as promptly as possible. It is important to make it clear that VAT rules do not prevent academies and FE colleges from making their facilities available for community use and charging for doing so. However, the VAT rules can have an impact on the extent to which that can be done if academies and FE colleges are to benefit from full VAT relief on the construction of their buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/5">It is therefore important to put it on the record that VAT relief applies to the construction of charitable buildings or identifiable parts of those buildings provided that use other than for a relevant charitable purpose will be less than 10 per cent. of the total use. A building is used for a relevant charitable purpose when used for non-business activities such as the provision of core-free education or other activities for which no charge is made.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/6">It is a long-established principle in VAT that making facilities available in return for a charge, as an extended school or FE college may do, is generally regarded as a business activity regardless of the type of facilities, the level of the charge or the commercial or charitable nature of the supplier. That means that if the institution is to benefit from the VAT relief for construction, any use for which a charge is made must be less than 10 per cent. of the total use. Hon. Members are aware of the background to that provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/7">The VAT rules apply equally to all charities. I am sure that my hon. Friend appreciates that the situation is not unique to academies or FE colleges; many other charities are in a comparable position in that they provide a range of facilities or services to the community and are subject to the same VAT rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/8">My hon. Friend referred to VAT reliefs, which are governed by European VAT agreements entered into by successive Governments, under which we cannot extend our existing zero rates or introduce new ones. It is therefore not possible to allow full VAT relief regardless of the extent to which academy or FE college facilities are used for charge-business purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/9">As European agreements make it impossible to extend the existing VAT relief, it is reasonable to ask why we do not simply undertake to refund any VAT that an academy or FE college is charged. We are continuing to consider that possibility, but it is important to state that that solution is not without its own substantial difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/10">I say to my hon. Friend that, in relation to FE colleges, the central funding provided by the Learning and Skills Council should take into account VAT costs which cannot be recovered. As he is fully aware from experience in his constituency, schools have benefited from record increases in funding in recent spending reviews equivalent to 60 per cent. real-terms growth in resources between 1997 and 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/11">The Government have ambitious plans for the development of academies. My hon. Friend has direct experience of fighting for academies and being successful in attracting them to his area. We believe that it is important to target available funding as effectively as possible. In that context, we want seriously to consider whether resources available for the academy programme are best and most effectively deployed in VAT refund arrangements designed to allow academies a free hand in the extent to which they use their facilities for a business purpose.</p>

	<p pid="b.52.0/1">I do not want to eat into the Minister's time, but will he explain why we cannot apply the same principle as in local government? Councils are obliged to charge rates on a building&mdash;it might be a community building&mdash;but they will then give a grant so that there is a net zero cost. It seems that there would be no loss to the Treasury, even if we had to go through an accountancy loophole.</p>

	<p pid="b.52.1/1">Our concern is the precedent that that would set for other organisations. We are actively considering the options, because we are concerned about the financial implications, the precedent and the constraints imposed by legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/2">To return to my earlier point, there would be a need not only to find additional resources, but to ensure that the rules for academies were consistent with those for other charitable organisations. As hon. Members are aware, there are always difficulties in deciding in a fair and principled way that some charities will be refunded VAT costs while others will not.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/3">My hon. Friend mentioned section 33 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 and local authority-maintained schools. The refund scheme is a public spending measure that operates outside the VAT system and the scope of article 4 of the VAT directive that he mentioned. It reflects a commitment made when VAT was introduced in 1973 that the tax should not become a burden on local taxation. In keeping with that principle, since 1997 we have admitted new bodies to the refund arrangements only where they meet two conditions: first, they must undertake a function ordinarily carried out by local government and, secondly, they must have the power to draw funding directly from local taxation. Academies, as bodies that are funded directly by the Department for Education and Skills, clearly do not meet the second condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/4">My hon. Friend mentioned the inclusion in section 33 of other bodies that do not levy local taxation. Although the Government have taken no action to remove bodies that were already covered by section 33 when we came into government, we have been clear that new bodies will be admitted to those VAT refund arrangements only where they undertake a function ordinarily carried out by local government and have the power to draw funding directly from local taxation. The refund scheme for museums and galleries, for example, is entirely different from that which applies to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/5">More generally, the principles for funding public services require that special VAT refund arrangements, such as the scheme for local authorities, remain limited exceptions to the general rule and are applied only where they provide the most cost-effective and efficient way of achieving the Government's objectives. That demands that we remain cautious when considering any request to extend VAT refund arrangements, or introduce new refund schemes, for public service providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/6">The VAT constraints that I explained earlier mean that we cannot guarantee academies or FE colleges that wish to benefit from full VAT relief a free hand in allowing the use of their facilities for a charge. However, on academies, officials at the Treasury and the Department for Education and Skills, as well as the Academy Sponsors Trust, are working together to see how academies can make the best use of the existing relief or, in the limited number of cases where this would be relevant, how they can manage any VAT costs that arise.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/7">For example, in calculating the extent of relevant charitable use within a building, it is open to academies or FE colleges to consider identifiable parts of the academy or college separately. In addition, several methods of calculating the extent of relevant charitable use are available and, in some cases, are subject to agreement with HMRC. Using one such method, and taking the year as a whole, a 1,000-student institution could provide charged extended services for an average of 50 people a day. Obviously, that does not amount to fully unrestricted use, but it would still represent significant community participation.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/8">An academy or FE college might prefer not to restrict the extent to which it offers its facilities for a charge and might therefore be prepared to incur VAT on some part of its buildings. In such circumstances, it will be entitled, under the normal VAT rules, to register for VAT and reclaim from HMRC any VAT attributable to taxable business use of facilities. That might, for example, include the use of sporting facilities such as gyms or other leisure facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/9">This is a live, important issue. It is about trying to ensure that we are consistent in achieving Government objectives. We understand the importance of addressing the issue promptly, and this debate will, I hope, make an important contribution towards our reaching a solution that deals with the constraints to which I have referred to do with precedent, financial implications and legislation.</p>

	Post-earthquake Relief (Pakistan)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.54.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" speakername="Robert Wilson" colnum="54"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h04.htm#60131h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.54.1/1">I asked for today's debate because I wanted to ensure that we do not forget the people of Pakistan in their hour of need. Perhaps &quot;hour of need&quot; is the wrong phrase, because northern Pakistan will have years of need if it is to meet the many challenges that it now faces.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/2">It is important to keep reminding ourselves of the huge scale of those challenges. We are all aware that on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-08">Saturday 8 October</phrase> last year an earthquake struck, measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale. Its epicentre was in the area of Muzaffarabad, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, about 95 km north of Islamabad, and it caused widespread devastation and a significant number of deaths. The challenge created by the earthquake was unprecedented in its magnitude. More than 73,000 people perished, including 35,000 children, and twice as many were injured. Half a million homes were destroyed, more than 3.5 million people were left homeless and some 1.3 million people lost their livelihoods. The homeless are equivalent to almost half the population of Switzerland.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/3">Tens of thousands of families lost an entire generation that day. Children who left for school never returned; more than 120,000 people were injured, mostly women, children and the elderly; and thousands became disabled or paraplegic. Key public buildings and infrastructure were badly damaged, creating a catastrophe that was beyond the capacity of one country to manage on its own. Pakistan rightly sought international help, and Britain has played its part in supporting the aid effort. The immediate priority of digging people out of the wreckage soon turned to providing nearly 1 million tents, 1,800 tonnes of medicines and 73,000 tonnes of rations.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/4">There are now 605 tented villages and 40 tented schools, and under the Pakistan Government's interim shelter strategy, 290,000 interim shelters have been constructed. The urgent and immediate priority is to help more than 3 million people to survive the harsh Himalayan winter. So far, the Government of Pakistan, in co-ordination with international partners, have been able to control the worst impact of the winter. I hope that that success will continue, but it is by no means certain, as the coldest part of the winter is traditionally in February. The scale of the disaster means that relief operations will continue&mdash;rightly&mdash;to be critical to the region for at least another year.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/5">I know from discussions with Pakistan's high commissioner that Pakistan greatly appreciates the support that the British Government have provided so far. That has played an important role in ensuring that many people do not die unnecessarily. I have no doubt that the Minister will tell us more about the UK Government's actions.</p>

	<p pid="b.54.2/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on having secured this important debate. He is right that the earthquake brought complete devastation to many in the area. Not only the high commissioner is grateful. We managed to go to Pakistan and met the Prime Minister and other Ministers, and they were very appreciative and expressed their gratitude to the British Government and the people of the United Kingdom for the help that they have given to the victims of that devastating earthquake.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.2/2">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, although the sterling work and leadership of the Minister and the Secretary of State for International Development in helping the victims are commendable, it is unfortunate that there are still hundreds of thousands of people living in tents in freezing conditions who need our help, and that we should continue to give that help to them?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.55.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" speakername="Robert Wilson" colnum="55"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h04.htm#60131h04_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.55.0/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for International Development will pass his comments on.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/2">Having set the scene and brought the story up to date, I should like to turn to what we should do by way of a second phase of reconstruction and recovery. The United Kingdom has long-standing and close ties with Pakistan through the Commonwealth and the many families of Pakistani origin who live in the UK. That is particularly true in my constituency, which has a sizeable Pakistani community, many members of which originate from the area of the earthquake. They have been active in fundraising for the relief effort; indeed, the whole community in Reading&mdash;Muslim, Hindu, Sikh and Christian&mdash;has contributed generously to the many fundraising efforts.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/3">Substantial resources are needed, however, not only for the continuing relief work to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but for the longer-term reconstruction and rehabilitation. That work will involve rebuilding at least 400,000 homes, so that survivors do not become refugees living in tent cities; reconstructing 12,500 schools; providing rehabilitation and medical care to a generation of children; and building an estimated 1,400 basic health units, rural health centres and hospitals. The work will also involve restoring the basic infrastructure in an area where sanitation and water distribution systems, as well as Government buildings, have been completely and utterly destroyed. Entire towns and villages devastated by the calamity need to be built anew.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/4">Pakistan estimates that it will need about $3.5 billion for the reconstruction of the social sector, the physical infrastructure and the economy. That would be a massive undertaking for any Government, but Pakistan is ensuring that the reconstruction plan provides decent living standards for its people instead of recreating slums and shanty towns, and I am told that all reconstruction will take place on the basis of earthquake-resistant designs. Priority will be given to the restoration of community infrastructure, including housing, schools, hospitals, public health, water, sanitation and Government infrastructure. The reconstruction plan appears to be a good one.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/5">President Musharraf has launched a special initiative as part of the comprehensive plan for long-term construction and rehabilitation. Under his sponsorship programme, individuals, organisations and countries will be able to sponsor people, villages, schools, hospitals or even basic health units. Donors can also sponsor projects involving the environment, livelihood regeneration and the rehabilitation of orphans and widows. International agencies, charities and philanthropists have been invited to sponsor a health unit, a hospital or a school in the affected area.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.0/1">I have a particular concern, as many of us do, having been to exactly the part of the world affected. As we are in the middle of our winter, does the hon. Gentleman think that now would be a good time to look to our local authorities, many of which want to make a further contribution, to make those project-based commitments? That might do something immediate to help the Government effort, but would also be of continuing interest in the months and years ahead.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.1/1">That is an interesting idea and I am sure that the Minister will consider it in his response.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/2">The donation cost ranges from $25,000 for a primary school to $33 million for a university in Muzaffarabad. A basic health unit would cost about $200,000, while a leprosy hospital would need a donation of $5.8 million. In the north-west frontier province more than 8,000 schools and colleges and a university are available for donations, while in the health sector, 1,300 health facilities, such as basic health units, rural health centres and hospitals, are available. To help potential sponsors, the Pakistan Government have kindly set up a website, the address for which, for all our listeners, viewers and readers of <i>Hansard</i>, is <a href="http://www.earthquakepakistan.com">www.earthquakepakistan.com</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/3">Britain has done much but, in classic new Labour speak, there is much more to do. We must not stop now. The next five to 10 years will be crucial to reconstruction and saving lives.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.2/1">I also congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate and on generously giving way to three colleagues so far. We have talked about the numbers, but, important though the aid is, does he agree that it is also important to give people their dignity back? That could be done at a micro-level by enabling amputees to return to work, for example, and on a larger scale by reforming trade policy, to enable the country to trade its way out of destruction and allow people to rebuild their country themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising that important point, which I shall return to later.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.3/2">It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us the Government's long-term strategy of support. For example, what plans for long-term reconstruction have been drawn up? Do those plans have clear, measurable targets, goals and milestones? Will the process be independently audited by the National Audit Office?</p>
	<p pid="b.56.3/3">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase> for his intervention, and perhaps I can make a few suggestions about what Britain can do. Pakistan will continue to need money to help with reconstruction. I hope that we continue to be generous with our aid, working closely with the Pakistan Government to carefully target it for maximum impact. The British Government can encourage community organisations, and particularly the corporate sector, to take part in the reconstruction effort, by securing priority projects such as housing, schools and hospitals in the quake-affected regions.</p>

	<p pid="b.57.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. I am pleased that he has come to the part of his speech concerning what the Government can do. Will the British Government take a lead in encouraging the richer members of the Commonwealth to contribute to what is an appalling situation? All of us have been moved by the pictures on our television screens of small children, barefoot and ankle-deep in snow.</p>

	<p pid="b.57.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention, and I hope that the Minister will deal with that question when he responds.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/2">Doctors and paramedics in the national health service could take part in the rehabilitation programme. In the years ahead, northern Pakistan will face an acute shortage of physicians and other medical staff for the rehabilitation of trauma patients and the physically disabled, whom the hon. Member for Tooting referred to earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/3">Pakistan needs help so that it can use trade to overcome its post-earthquake challenges. Giving Pakistan special trading status in the European Union would be extremely helpful for jobs, prosperity and the overall reconstruction process. I hope that the Government are pushing hard for that, even though they no longer hold the EU presidency. Pakistan needs UK Government help with skill enhancement in many of its economic sectors, and many individuals need to be trained and reskilled. We in this country have much experience that we can share with Pakistan to help in that process.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.1/4">It is important that the British Government and the British community sustain the momentum of assistance in the days, months and years ahead to help Pakistan to accomplish the enormous task of reconstruction and rehabilitation. I hope that we can give Pakistan the message today that their friends in the UK will not let them down.</p>

	<p pid="b.57.2/1">In the traditional way, I join in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" name="Robert Wilson">the hon. Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson)</phrase> on securing the debate on this important issue. He was absolutely right to remind the House of the sheer scale and impact of the south Asian earthquake that took place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-08">8 October</phrase> last year. As he rightly says, there has been major destruction in the most highly affected area. Some 3.5 million people and 500,000 families have been affected, with nearly 2.5 million people losing their houses and 2.3 million at risk of not being able to meet their own food needs. We estimate the death toll in that part of the affected area to be about 73,000 people, with 70,000 injured. We must not forget the people of India who also lost their lives, or those badly affected by the earthquake. A number of people in Afghanistan were also affected by the earthquake; some lost their lives and some lost members of their family.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.2/2">The preliminary damage and needs assessment prepared for the Government of Pakistan by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank estimated that Pakistan will need $5.2 billion for relief and reconstruction. That figure includes $1.7 billion for continuing relief and to restore livelihoods, and $3.5 billion to replace damaged and destroyed buildings and infrastructure. Relief and rehabilitation are therefore a huge challenge for Pakistan in the months to come and in the longer term, as the hon. Gentleman identified, as well as being crucial for the international community more broadly, including the Commonwealth, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> alluded.</p>

	<p pid="b.58.0/1">Before my hon. Friend moves on to rehabilitation and reconstruction, will he comment on whether he believes that the international rescue and relief operation was adequate? We know of the great strides that our Government took, but was the international effort adequate? Secondly, have our Government and, more importantly, the international community, learned any lessons?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.58.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="58"  time="013:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h04.htm#60131h04_spnew10">
	<p pid="b.58.1/1">If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I will come to that when I talk about the relief effort. A number of lessons that have been learned from the tsunami have helped to influence our response. The earthquake in Pakistan and the international response to it has added fuel to the case for investment in a central emergency revolving fund&mdash;an international fund to help UN agencies in the immediate aftermath of a disaster better to meet the needs of the affected communities. I am pleased to say that we have now secured United Nations General Assembly support for the launch of CERF and we hope that it will be operational by the end of March.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.1/2">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase> and the hon. Member for Reading, East have said, we have been playing a strong role during the relief effort, committing some &pound;58 million-worth of support. We will continue to play a major role during reconstruction, both as a trusted partner of the Government of Pakistan and as one of the largest bilateral donors in that country. I pledged some &pound;70   million for the reconstruction programme at the donors conference in Islamabad last November. We are working with the Government and other donors to ensure that the lessons from previous natural disasters are included in both the relief effort and the long-term reconstruction effort.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.1/3">Some hon. Members will be aware, particularly those who have visited the affected areas, that such is the nature of the terrain&mdash;the area is remote and mountainous&mdash;that it is probably more challenging for the relief effort to help people to deal with the impact of the earthquake than it was to help those affected by the Asian tsunami. Road links have been badly affected, necessitating the extensive use of helicopters for relief support. In many areas the only means to get relief to those affected has been by Pakistani army patrols using mules. The harsh conditions of the Himalayan winter provide a further constraint on the rapid provision of adequate shelter and present a clear risk to survivors. The earthquake, coming as it did just before the immediate onset of winter, allowed only a short opportunity for emergency shelter and other critical facilities to be put in place.</p>

	<p pid="b.59.0/1">I will describe in detail our response. We have obviously heard of concerns that some of the tents that have been provided have not been good enough. We have certainly been working to do everything we can to ensure that the tents that we and other donors provide are the so-called winterised tents, to provide better support to people in the way that the hon. Gentleman has rightly said needs to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/2">I believe that, given the complexity of the disaster and the way in which we need to respond, relief efforts can be judged so far to have been broadly successful in meeting the priority needs. As the hon. Member for Reading, East and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1985" name="Mohammad Sarwar">the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar)</phrase> said, because February is traditionally the coldest month of the year in Pakistan, we cannot afford to be at all complacent about the coming weeks and the need to maintain the relief effort at its current level, if not to step it up a gear further.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/3">Adequate steps have been taken to prevent widespread outbreaks of diseases. There has been good collaboration between the Pakistani authorities, the Pakistan army, local and international non-governmental organisations and the international community. We have continued to play an important role in support of the relief effort, both in providing direct humanitarian assistance and in urging others&mdash;those in the Commonwealth and outside it&mdash;to do more as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.0/4">I have said that we pledged some &pound;58 million to the relief effort. We have so far committed some &pound;52 million of that.</p>

	<p pid="b.59.1/1">I join others in thanking the Government, through the Minister, for what they have done. Is it the view of the Government and the international community that there is available now the extra medical support and other equipment, particularly to deal with the very bad winter that may be in prospect? Is that in the region and available, or are we still short of what we may need to deal with what could be, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" name="Robert Wilson">the hon.

	<p pid="b.59.2/1">In very broad terms, the necessary relief supplies are in the region. However, the United Nations has flagged up a shortage of female medical personnel. That is creating major problems for the UN and other humanitarian partners, because there are, of course, various cultural and traditional reasons why female people in the affected areas would want to see only a female doctor. We will obviously support the UN in discovering what can be done to remedy that problem.</p>

Will the Minister consider helping other doctors to establish limbs-fitting centres, which could help thousands of people in the region to start leading a normal life?</p>

	<p pid="b.60.0/1">I pay tribute to the assiduous lobbying of my hon. Friend, and to that of other Members not only on the Labour Benches but of other parties, who have continued to champion the cause of Pakistan. I know that my hon. Friend has met the Secretary of State to discuss this issue. The only word of caution that I would throw back to him is that we must make sure that the Government of Pakistan are in the driving seat of the reconstruction effort, and that they decide the priorities for not only the relief but the reconstruction phase. If they think that such support is necessary, we will continue to engage with the organisation to which he has alluded.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.0/2">I should put on record that our direct support to the relief effort has included sending 15 relief flights and funding 78 flights for the Disasters Emergency Committee. We have also provided a range of urgently needed materials, including 5,500 winterised tents, 19,700 collapsible 10-litre jerry cans&mdash;which are crucial for the supply of water&mdash;36,000 blankets and 70,000 tarpaulins. More plastic sheets and blankets are arriving. We have provided &pound;19 million in support of the UN's relief effort, including our crucial and continuing funding of helicopters. We have also supported the UN's activities through the NATO airlift, transporting relief items from warehouses in Europe and the middle east to Pakistan, and through the direct use of three UK Chinook military helicopters and the 59 Independent Commando Squadron Royal Engineers, which has been doing emergency shelter-building operations in the remote high-altitude areas in the Bagh region.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.0/3">I met some of the crew of the Chinook helicopters when I visited Pakistan in November, and I wish to put on record my appreciation of the remarkable job that they were doing. They were clearly hugely appreciated by the people in the villages to whom they were airlifting supplies, and they deserve the recognition and praise of the House for their huge efforts. Our soldiers also deserve our praise for the work that they were doing; each shelter they built and the repairs to roads that they have effected have saved lives.</p>

Will he comment on today's comments of Save the Children? It said that there is an urgent need for more permanent shelter for the earthquake-affected communities in Pakistan.

	<p pid="b.60.2/1">I join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the work of aid agencies that were on the ground in Pakistan before the disaster struck and international non-governmental organisations that responded to the emergency, such as Islamic Relief, Oxfam and Save the Children, as well as groups such as Muslim Hands and Muslim Aid which also responded. I also pay tribute to&mdash;and I am sure that the House would want to record its appreciation of it&mdash;the generosity of the British public in helping to raise around &pound;50 million for work to support the Disasters Emergency Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> referred to the contribution that local authorities can make, and perhaps the Chamber will indulge me by allowing me to say that my local authority, Harrow, has helped to facilitate a fundraising effort among communities in my borough. Such hands-off but important and practical support is one way in which local authorities can continue to make a difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.2/3">We are supporting the provision of more shelter, winter kit&mdash;including stoves, management and servicing of campsites&mdash;primary health care centres, mobile clinics and hospitals, women's health and counselling services, water and sanitation in camps, and food both in camps and to displaced communities in remote areas. We remain the second largest donor to the relief effort. The truth is that relief efforts are better in some areas than others and careful monitoring of the situation in the coming weeks will be needed to try to iron out some of those differences. We will continue to be part of the effort.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.2/4">This debate is well timed because we need to think about the transition from the relief effort to early recovery and on to the reconstruction and rehabilitation phase. That relates to my hon. Friend's reference to Save the Children's concerns. That broader concern is well recognised in Islamabad, where the earthquake reconstruction and rehabilitation authority will take over from the Federal Relief Commission to lead the long-term reconstruction effort. The hon. Member for Reading, East is right to say that it will not be possible to complete that soon; it is a two-year, three-year or five-year process and for some people it will take a very long time indeed to recover. One of the immediate concerns that we must recognise is support to households to restore their livelihoods at an early stage&mdash;for example, through cash-for-work schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.2/5">We will continue to play an important role during reconstruction. We are one of the group of seven large donors who are working closely with the Pakistan Government to meet the recovery challenge. We have made it clear that we will do everything possible to help Pakistan to recover and that is why I pledged some &pound;70 million-worth of support for that reconstruction effort.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.2/6">On infrastructure alone, again as the hon. Gentleman highlighted, a huge effort will be needed to replace the facilities that were destroyed: 4,000 km of roads need to be replaced or repaired, 400,000 homes need to be constructed, 7,500 schools need to be repaired and nearly 600 primary health clinics and other medical facilities need to be provided. The earthquake destroyed some 84 per cent. of the housing stock in Kashmir and the north-west frontier province. There is a huge job of work to be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.2/7">As I said earlier, we can learn lessons from previous disasters to ensure that best practice in responding is brought to bear on the reconstruction effort. I am pleased that the Pakistani authorities and the seven major donors who are supporting them have agreed to make sure that a set of principles based on that international best practice is adhered to.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.63.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="63"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h05.htm#60131h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.63.1/1">The Prime Minister famously promised that the top three priorities of a Labour Government would be &quot;Education, education, education,&quot; and in our first two full terms in government, up until 2005, a high legislative priority and very large budget allocations helped to deliver on that early promise.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/2">Substantial progress was made. For instance, we were all delighted to see the disgraceful backlog of capital works shrink rapidly, along with oversized classes in our primary schools. In the 2001 and 2005 elections, there was no doubt that education and the economy were key electoral pluses in North-West Leicestershire and elsewhere. I was therefore somewhat surprised to find myself in front of the Parliament square cameras late last year, expressing major reservations about the then newly published White Paper, &quot;Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&mdash;More Choice for Parents and Pupils&quot;, which is very much a Janus of a document.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/3">The progressive parts were perhaps written by the Secretary of State and deal, inter alia, with personalised learning and school discipline. The bonkers bits may have been written by a shadowy, unelected, privately educated marketiser who, for security reasons, we will call Lord A. It launched trust schools and effectively bade farewell to local education authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/4">A major debate on those Government proposals, which have met such substantial flack from across the party, is under way. The proposals have drawn fire from the most surprising quarters and from the previously most loyal of colleagues. It is that unjustified and irrational abandonment of LEAs that I wish to deal with next.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/5">I must first declare an interest: I am a parent of four daughters, all educated entirely in local state comprehensive schools&mdash;none of which were bog-standard, in Alastair Campbell's unfortunate phrase. As a school governor for 25 years, and as someone who worked for a long time for the local county council, although not in the education sphere, perhaps I have the edge over metropolitan peers, who have none of the advantages that such experiences can offer. The White Paper's flaws are rooted in its metropolitan analysis, which does not apply to much of the rest of the country. Its proposals may have a resonance in London, but they are doomed to fail in the shire counties.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/6">My local LEA has never been controlled by my party, so my appreciation of its achievements is driven not by partisan considerations but by a real assessment of its successes over the decades. It was not well funded by successive Administrations; however, its portfolio includes fine comprehensive schools, first-rate community education, top-quality accessible music and the arts, and good special needs provision. The list goes on. For such a body to become an educational eunuch after being a prolific producer of initiatives and ideas is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/7">So what are the White Paper proposals intended to achieve? They are all of a piece with the general philosophy for the reform of public services that was spelled out starkly by the then Cabinet Office Minister, now the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. Speaking in Washington in October 2005, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/8" class="indent">&quot;We needed to drive greater challenge into the system, and that could not be entirely reliant upon target setting and performance management from the centre. It does involve greater contestability, the opening up of these monolithic structures from across the private, voluntary and social enterprise sector. This has proved to be our biggest political challenge. The expected opposition from the trade unions and the professional interest groups was predictable and it has happened.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/9">Contestability is the current euphemism for competition. When we came to power, the real powers-that-be must have concluded that the previous Government's marketisation was not changing the schools system fast enough, and that further central intervention was not achieving the desired results. Two additional organisational drivers are apparently needed. One is more competition, which is achieved by breaking up the LEA system into individual competing schools, driven by consumer choice on the part of parents and performance league tables. That, of course, tends to reinforce middle-class advantage&mdash;surely not a conscious political strategy. The other driver&mdash; following specialist schools and academies&mdash;means external sponsors and trust schools, both subjects for other debates.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/10">Let me turn to the rationale for the enfeeblement and ultimate marginalisation of local education authorities. Our Prime Minister said that we needed:</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Every local authority moving from provider to commissioner, so that the system acquires a local dynamism responsive to the needs of their communities and open to change and new forms of school provision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/12">The &quot;from provider to commissioner&quot; policy is not new. It has been Government policy since the Department for Education and Employment paper, &quot;The role of the Local Education Authority in school education&quot; was published in 2000; it was as long ago as that, as the Minister will know. For years LEAs have had to outsource many of the services they previously provided to schools, as a result of enforced delegation of budgets. That has created a profitable market for edubusiness companies, although the associated quality of the delivered services has not always lived up to reasonable expectations. It is now surely impossible to obtain further outsourcing without either more enforced delegation to schools or new legislation. Which is it to be?</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/13">Some critics suggest that the Government have pursued a consistent programme of centralisation of control. Often under the guise of local empowerment, programmes can have precisely the opposite effect. Passing responsibility to levels beyond which people have the resources, knowledge and skills to exercise it effectively gives greater control to the state. Governors in general, and parents in particular, are often not able to administer schools effectively. As a result, schools are controlled through the national curriculum, Ofsted and funding arrangements. I hope that that criticism will be answered by the Minister today.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/14">Let us consider the presently mooted reorganisation of local government. By moving powers away from local government on education and the police, for example, and fragmenting local government, particularly by splitting up counties, central Government may undermine effective local government&mdash;a level of government that can be a bulwark against, and an effective critic of, the occasional excesses and incompetence of all central Governments.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/15">Current suggestions for further fragmentation of local government appear to be along the same lines. Part of the White Paper is taken up with rather weak pseudo-statistics and anecdotal examples that do not add up to a substantial case. If the Government think that those form the basis for &quot;evidence-based change&quot;&mdash;a favourite phrase&mdash;they have started to inhale their own press releases.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/16">On the White Paper, the criticisms that the proposals will primarily benefit the middle classes and that there will be the effective introduction of more selection are probably relevant, but almost certainly a distraction in this context. The fundamental premise of the planned Bill seems flawed, unless the intention is to boost meritocracy, put more public money into private pockets and increase central Government control.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/17">The White Paper is summed up in its annexe on resource and legislative implications; there is not much merit in some of the proposals therein. The idea that parents know, let alone generally have the competence to carry out, what is best for schools can be off beam&mdash;parents organisations have said so.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/18">After decades of being a governor at a number of schools, I can say that the availability of governors, and of the time and knowledge to undertake the sorts of roles envisaged by Government in this White Paper, is patchy to put it mildly. The role of local government, far from being enhanced, becomes increasingly an arm of central Government administration.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.1/19">Education does need reforming&mdash;it needs constant reform, to reflect the needs of society, technology and all the other things that are happening in the background. It needs reforming to a system in which central Government give up most of their interference, hand back the development of education to the professionals and the experts, and give oversight to a level of local government that has the skill and resources to represent local interests.</p>

	<p pid="b.65.4/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> on securing this timely and important Adjournment debate. As a member of the Education and Skills Committee, he will know that we have suggested an enhanced role for local education authorities and schools admissions forums in monitoring closely schools admissions policies in the future. We also suggested the facility for LEAs to set benchmarks for all secondary schools in terms of all schools taking their fair share of children on free school meals and children of parents who receive working families tax credit. Does he agree that we need to examine those issues seriously if we are to take the White Paper forward?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.66.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="66"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h05.htm#60131h05_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.66.0/1">We certainly do need to take these issues seriously. I will come on to that point shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/2">Comprehensive Future correctly points out that if all schools were to become self-governing&mdash;either as trust, foundation or voluntary-aided bodies&mdash;there would be about 24,000 admission authorities, each of which would be able to set its own admissions criteria. It further states that, unless there is a clear division of responsibility for admissions between schools, local bodies and central Government, that is likely to lead to fragmentation on a grand scale. It will make the possibility of fair admissions even more unlikely than it is at present.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/3">If the promise of fair admissions&mdash;I accept that promise; the Minister is an honourable person&mdash;in the White Paper is to be a reality, there must be changes to permitted admission criteria, the regulations covering the code of practice, admission authorities, admission forums, the adjudicator and, particularly in the context of this debate, the role of local authorities. In 2004, for the first time, local authorities were required to co-ordinate the secondary school admissions process for their areas. From this year, local authorities will also co-ordinate primary admissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/4">Co-ordination has made it easier for parents to exercise the choice already available to them by cutting down on the number of forms that they have to complete and by introducing a common timetable for each area. It has ended a system under which different schools made offers on different dates, and some parents received several offers and some received none. In the first year of operation, a greater number of children received an early offer of a school place than in previous years. Co-ordination has also made it easier for local authorities to identify and follow up cases in which no application has been made for a child. Those improvements flow straight from the good work of local education authorities, the powers of which will disappear if the Bill becomes an Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/5">The e-admissions national project is an example of how, when LEAs are given responsibility for administration, systems can improve. To avoid the fragmentation that the White Paper will encourage, the local authority should administer admissions for all local schools, including the publicly funded independent schools&mdash;academies and city technology colleges. The local authority must assess how applicants for places meet the admission criteria for schools in its area and run the admission process.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/6">The shadow White Paper, &quot;Shaping the Education Bill: Reaching for Consensus&quot;&mdash;to which I have given some support, although I would like to see it go further&mdash;also expresses real concern that there is the potential for pupils from poorer areas to be disadvantaged as popular schools expand and as wealthier and better informed parents set up their own schools, operating their own admissions policies. It, too, states that local education policy must continue to be democratically accountable.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/7">The White Paper talks about local authorities acting as champions of parents and learners, but many have always tried to do just that. Moreover, Sir Jeremy Beecham, the leader of the Local Government Association's Labour group, has said of the White Paper:</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The proposals around admissions, the planning of new schools and the expansion of popular schools gives insufficient leverage to councils to maximise fairness or the efficient use of resources&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/9">Will the Minister say something about the impact of school expansions on pupils from poorer areas and about the democratic accountability of local education policy in a constituency such as mine, where there are more than 50 schools, or in a county such as mine, where there are substantially more than 300? Does he agree that the development of a body of self-regulating schools must encompass an effective system of accountability or measures to ensure that the interests of all pupils are protected and advanced? Without the measures proposed in the shadow White Paper, is it not almost certain that the present Government proposals would deliver enhanced choice for some, and reduced or restricted choice for many others? In short, would not disadvantaged pupils lose, rather than gain, from the projected policy?</p>
	<p pid="b.66.0/10">Like the Local Government Association, which I contacted before the debate&mdash;I do not support all of its responses, but I do support some&mdash;I believe that the Government's schools Bill must give local authorities more control over admissions, commissioning, strategic leadership and the 14-to-19 phase, to ensure that they are able to fulfil their role as champions of parents and pupils effectively.</p>

Local authorities, which we must now call them, must be given the power to ensure that all schools' admission policies are fair and that they cannot cherry-pick the best pupils. We need a system in which local authorities not only co-ordinate local admissions policies but set them in consultation with the admissions forum. Every admissions authority then has to abide by that policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/3">The Government must provide more detail on how the council's commissioning role will work. Local authorities must be able to specify services and hold schools to account beyond standards of academic achievement and behaviour, in particular against the five outcomes of the document &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;. Decisions on expanding popular schools and new sixth forms must be strategic decisions made by the local authority based on demographic change, greater efficiency and the needs of the whole community. Like the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;perhaps I do not say those words often enough&mdash;I disagree with the presumption that popular schools should necessarily expand as set out in the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/4">Local authorities must have sole strategic responsibility for the 14-to-19 phase of education. The current system of shared leadership with the Learning and Skills Council is confusing and complicated. It does not work in the best interests of children and young people. The Minister and I have much in common. We are east midlands MPs who were elected in 1997. He is looking very nervous at this point. We are both great believers in the centrality of manifestos and stood on Labour manifestos in 1992 when we were not successful, and in 1997, 2001 and 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/5">Last year's manifesto highlighted the need to continue to raise standards and bring in new provisions</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/6" class="indent">&quot;where standards are too low or innovation is needed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/7">However, among the numerous things that it did not mention was removing the role of local authorities and neutering them in many areas. I ask the Minister what has changed in the past few months and why on earth we are doing what we are doing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.68.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills"  colnum="68"  time="013:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h05.htm#60131h05_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.68.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I pay tribute to his work on behalf of his constituents in promoting their interests and I thank him for setting out his concerns so clearly. I have also been impressed by the excellent work that is carried out in Leicestershire to promote the interests of children and to raise standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/2">I was pleased that my hon. Friend began his remarks with a recognition of the record investment and the record results for 11, 14, 16 and 18-year-olds&mdash;the best ever results in this country as a result of eight years of investment and reform to date. As he knows, we have more to do. For example, we still have a low post-16 staying-on rate. Some of the most disadvantaged young people from low-income families are still not achieving what we might expect them to achieve. That is why we need to do more to take matters forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/3">I almost wholeheartedly disagree with my hon. Friend's description of the future role of local authorities, which he described as enfeebled and marginalised. Yes, the role of local authorities is obviously changing, but it is certainly not diminishing. Indeed, for the wider background to the debate, he focused on the schools White Paper. I want to preface my response to his remarks by reminding him of the bigger picture of the important role that local authorities now play.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/4">My hon. Friend will know that the Children Act 2004 underpinned the creation of the new children's trusts, which importantly amalgamated education and social services departments to create new directors of children's services and lead members. They are driving forward the development of a holistic and joined-up approach for children and young people throughout the area of the local authority. That joining up is especially important for the most disadvantaged in our society.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/5">The children and young people's plans will be introduced in April, when local authorities will ensure that all the services for children and young people are brought together. They are playing a crucial role in making that happen. The plan's delivery will be a vital part of the local authority improvement cycle and it will help to reduce bureaucracy by reducing duplication and over-prescription of some seven statutory and 12 non-statutory plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/6">The directors and lead members of children's services are already making a difference. The children's trust partnerships that they support are enabling partners from many areas to work together to provide the best services for children. Indeed, that is why we now refer to local authorities. We want to reinforce the move to integrated children's services at local level so that we think in different ways and break down the barriers to joint working in the interests of children. I say again that the local authority has a crucial role in taking the lead to enable full partnership working to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/7">Turning specifically to local authorities and schools, let me remind my hon. Friend of the words of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who spoke eloquently of the role of local authorities. At the Local Government Association conference last year, she talked about councils continuing to play a vigorous role&mdash;not an enfeebled role&mdash;in boosting standards and intervening decisively where there is failure or poor performance. She talked about local authorities challenging hard and using new school improvement partners to raise attainment in every school. She said that local authorities will need to give strong leadership to raise standards, empower citizens and put responsiveness and choice at the heart of service delivery. She said that local authorities must have a desire to respond proactively to the views of citizens, to address problems, to pre-empt difficulties and to give users a real choice over the services that they need. She described local authorities as the champion of the user, expanding their choice and responding to their concerns, with an increasing emphasis on commissioning, rather than delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/8">I should also mention the central part played by local authorities in taking forward &quot;Every Child Matters: Change for Children&quot; and in the delivery of the 10-year child care strategy. The schools White Paper, which I shall discuss in detail, the youth Green Paper and the 14-to-19 implementation action plan are all part of that wider direction of travel and of the enhanced role for local authorities. I dare say that my hon. Friend has been involved in negotiating the new local area agreements, and I know that Leicestershire is taking part in phase 2. Those agreements are being led by local authorities to help secure the best possible outcomes for children, young people and their families by pooling budgets and negotiating new freedoms and flexibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/9">The 14-to-19 implementation plan, which was published in December 2005, gives a lead role to local authorities, working in collaboration with local learning and skills councils. I emphasise that point because my hon. Friend made it towards the end of his contribution. Local authorities and learning and skills councils will work collaboratively together with schools, colleges, training providers, employers, universities and the rest to integrate and improve services for children. That, then, is the 14-to-19 implementation plan, which relies on collaboration led by the local authorities and learning and skills councils together.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/10">On the relationship between local authorities and schools, I emphasise that my hon. Friend's caricature of the role that local authorities will play is fundamentally misplaced. The local authority has a key role to play in ensuring that parents have a broad choice of high-quality school places. We will make local authorities the key decision maker as regards the overall pattern of provision by abolishing the school organisation committee, as my hon. Friend recognised. Our proposals strengthen the local authority's role as a commissioner of services. Local authorities will become champions of parents and pupils in their area; indeed, some of them already are, and he is right to emphasise that we are building on best practice. They will have a new duty to promote choice, diversity and fair access, as well as enhanced powers to ensure high standards. I should also stress that schools will have to have regard to the new children and young people's plans so that everything fits together in a strategic way when local services undertake their own planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/11">I want in particular to emphasise the role that local authorities will play for the most vulnerable children. The White Paper contains a range of measure to help schools to support low-attaining pupils, including those with special educational needs. However, there will be a new duty on local authorities to identify children missing from education&mdash;those who, for one reason or another, might be falling through the gaps. That is a critical job for the local authority. I will say more about admissions, but we will ensure that looked-after children&mdash;they are often looked after by the local authority&mdash;will have first priority in admissions to all categories of maintained schools. That is a major step forward for those children and will ensure that they get the education that they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/12">On the relationship between local authorities and schools in their area, we very much welcome the support that the Select Committee on Education and Skills, of which my hon. Friends the Members for North-West Leicestershire and for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) are members, gave to including the option of schools becoming self-governing trusts, free to develop their own distinct identity and ethos, and with freedom over their assets, management and staff, as described in the White Paper. That option is right for raising standards in such schools. The Conservative view that schools must be compelled to become trusts&mdash;a more centralising measure one could not imagine&mdash;represents a contradiction within the Opposition, and we do not support it.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/13">Trust schools will be able to set their own admission arrangements in the same way as foundation and voluntary aided schools do, but that does not mean that trust schools will be able to do what they like. They will have to comply with relevant legislation, including the school admissions code of practice, which is enforced by the statutory adjudicator. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire is right to suggest that the role of the admissions forum locally will play a critical role in establishing school planning arrangements locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/14">We know&mdash;my hon. Friend was right to say this&mdash;that parents value the right to choose a school for their child. However, we also know the importance of ensuring that fairness is a key element in the system, too. I want to tell him something that is directly relevant to the role of local authorities: there will be no free-for-all in school admissions; there will be no return to school selection by the front door, back door or any other door we care to name; and legislation rightly prevents schools from introducing selection as part of their admission arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/15">The existing system also ensures that local authorities can object to any arrangements that they think unfair. The vast majority of cases referred to the adjudicator are upheld, and we will reinforce that by making such judgments binding for three years, rather than one year as at present.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.0/1">The choice adviser will play a key role. Will he promote all schools in his particular local authority, or will he promote only trust schools for future expansion?</p>

	<p pid="b.71.1/1">My hon. Friend raises a good question, but with the limited time available, I cannot go into too much detail. He is right: we want to give parents better information. We know that in any number of ways, parental involvement is a critical part of a child's success at school. We want those parents in particular who have taken less interest in their child's education, which does not therefore succeed, to obtain information and to become more aware of the options available to them in all schools. When the parent chooses which school to send their child to, they will know all the options available to them and make informed choices about all schools in their area.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.2/1">I am grateful for the considered and careful way in which the Minister replies. Will he acknowledge that although &quot;parent power&quot; as a phrase has been abandoned, for which I am grateful, there is an assumption in the White Paper and in legislation that there will somehow be a pool of willing, able and committed parents sufficient to involve themselves in the running of schools in their community? It does not exist in large parts of Corby, in east Northamptonshire or in North-West Leicestershire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-31b.72.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="72"  time="013:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060131/halltext/60131h05.htm#60131h05_spnew12">
	<p pid="b.72.0/1">I am rapidly running out of time, but the real challenge for all of us is to engage parents right across the board. Many parents get involved, but there are many who do not. They do not have, or do not seek out, the information, or they do not have a voice, or they do not feel that they have the chance to air their views, so they do not get involved in the way that we know is so important to the future of their child's education. The White Paper describes a range of ways of providing parents with more information, giving them a greater voice in the system, getting them involved in how schools are run, and supporting them at home, so that they can provide the support for their children that is so vital to their success at school.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.0/2">I am sorry that I cannot address all the points, and I shall write to my hon. Friend. However, I emphasise that we see a major and changing role for local authorities in relation to schools and throughout services for children and young people. The White Paper enhances and strengthens the strategic role of local authorities&mdash;something that the Select Committee itself mentioned. We have seen its recommendations, and we shall consider them seriously and carefully as we move forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.72.1/1">Before I adjourn the sitting, it may help if I clarify the position about giving notice to Members who have half-hour Adjournment debates, because there are two relatively new Members present. If a colleague wishes to make a speech in a half-hour Adjournment debate, the convention is that the permission is sought of both the person whose debate it is and the Minister, and the Chair is then notified. Whether or not there are interventions is entirely in the gift of the person who has the floor at the time.</p>
