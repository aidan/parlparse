	<p pid="a.181.3/1">Good morning to you, Mr. Benton, and to other hon. Members. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of the care and nutrition of older people. I think that the Minister will know of my interest in the subject, because I had the opportunity last week to host the launch in the House of a campaign by Help the Aged and Action on Elder Abuse to help raise awareness and promote action to tackle the hidden scandal that is elder abuse in our country. The Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, also took part. The campaign is all about pressing for in-depth research to gauge the true level of the problem of abuse. The most recent figures obtained by the Select Committee on Health, during its inquiry in 2004, show that 500,000 elderly people time at any one may be the victims of abuse, including physical, psychological, financial and sexual abuse. Without a clear picture, however, it is impossible to know whether the current policy and practice, which have developed over the past five to 10 years, really are a fit response to the level of need.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.3/2">Although this morning's title gives scope to raise many issues, I sought the debate primarily to raise two. The first is the nutrition of older people, particularly vulnerable older people in care homes, and the second is the use and management of medication in care homes. Just before Christmas, the British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition&mdash;BAPEN&mdash;published a report into the nutrition of older people in a variety of care settings, and the facts speak for themselves. One in 10 care home residents loses up to 5 per cent. of their body weight within a month of being admitted to the home and 10 per cent. of their body weight within six months. Much malnutrition goes undetected; indeed, many regard it as the norm and as part of the aging process&mdash;it is not.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.3/3">Even on the basis of the available research, it is clear that malnutrition in care homes is at epidemic levels. Based on an analysis of people aged 65 and over by the national diet and nutrition survey, BAPEN found that 20.5 per cent of individuals in care homes&mdash;one in five residents&mdash;were at medium or high risk of falling victim to malnutrition.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.4/1">As the hon. Gentleman might imagine, I am a big NHS proponent, but does he agree and acknowledge that such treatment can, sadly, be found in both NHS hospitals and care homes? I introduced a private Member's Bill in the previous Parliament to establish an older people's rights commissioner to tackle issues such as nutrition and medication. Would he become a sponsor if I introduced it again later this spring?</p>

	<p pid="a.182.0/1">That is an invitation that I could not possibly refuse. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about the need for an advocate&mdash;particularly for the frail and vulnerable, who might lack capacity to make decisions for themselves&mdash;as a complement to some of the legislation on medical capacity. I hope that he would also support my ten-minute Bill, which is currently before the House, and which would extend the application of the Human Rights Act 1998 to all privately run care homes. It does not currently apply in those circumstances, and anyone who crosses the threshold of a privately run care home can no longer exercise their rights under the Act unless they have a contract with the local authority that specifically stipulates otherwise. The Government acknowledge that anomaly, but it needs to be addressed, and that loophole needs finally to be closed.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.1/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate and on his excellent work on the issue. Before he goes too much further into the issue of nutrition in care homes, may I draw to his attention the excellent work done by the Womens Royal Voluntary Service and the meals on wheels service in Kettering? They provide valuable nutrition for older people who are being cared for in their own homes and who will later go on to institutional care. Without meals on wheels volunteers, this country would be a in a very sorry state indeed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.182.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="182"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.182.2/1">I can only echo the hon. Gentleman's sentiments. I also have a meals on wheels service in my constituency, and it relies predominantly on voluntary effort to deliver meals. The service makes a huge difference in terms not only of the delivery of food, but of contact; indeed, it is the only contact that some people have, because many of them lead very isolated lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/2">As I said, one in five care home residents is at risk of malnutrition. Today, as many as 63,400 frail elderly people in care homes across England could be malnourished&mdash;that is 63,400 victims of poor nutrition. In the 21st century, it is a scandal that elderly people in some of these homes are, in effect, starving to death. The personal cost of such poor treatment is incalculable and unacceptable, and it includes poorer health, slower recovery from illness, the risk of complications from illness and, above all, a very poor quality of life. According to BAPEN, the cost to the taxpayer of treating malnutrition in long-term care has been estimated at &pound;2.6 billion a year. That really is a shocking waste of public money.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/3">According to figures from the Commission for Social Care Inspection, more than 2,000 care homes out of the 11,000-odd in England fail to meet the most minimal of national minimum standards for meals and mealtimes. As things stand, the national minimum standards say next to nothing about nutrition. It is only thanks to work by the Caroline Walker Trust and the National Association of Care Catering that a more detailed set of guidance is available to practitioners in the field. I very much welcome the news that the commission will publish a report on nutrition later this year, which is not a moment too soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/4">Last month, I had the opportunity to introduce the Care of Older and Incapacitated People (Human Rights) Bill under the ten-minute rule. I drew attention to a case that was reported to me and which illustrates the nutrition problem. It was the case of a care home resident who nearly starved to death. Like many other residents at the same care home, this elderly lady suffered from dementia and needed help with eating, but none was provided. Residents were left to fend for themselves, and relatives were banned from the dining area. When the news came that the care home was to be closed, conditions deteriorated further. Residents were forced to live on a diet of Angel Delight and beans on toast, and sometimes, if they were lucky, pilchards on toast. They were left for up to 16 hours between meals, as cooks went home at 4 pm. When the manager was asked what the residents could eat at night, he told relatives that there was a pot of fish paste in the fridge. Fortunately, the lady in question moved to a new care home, where she received much better attention, and she put on a stone within a month of arriving.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/5">Another lady wrote to me to say that despite years of battling to ensure that her mother was properly looked after, her mother could barely get a spoon to her mouth or reach her drink and had difficulties because she was offered no assistance in doing so. The lady told me that her mum was being fed on tinned corned beef and packets of Smash potato. After a complaint, she was moved on to tinned mince and Smash, and another complaint later led to the provision day after day of a banana for breakfast, tinned stew mixed with tinned soup for dinner and tinned soup for tea. That was a wholly inadequate diet, and relatives were given no explanation&mdash;if there was any&mdash;for why such a diet was provided. The lady's mother was put in a bed so high that she could not reach the water placed by her bedside&mdash;dehydration is also an issue in some care homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/6">It was only after the mother was admitted to hospital with breathlessness and chest pains that the lady was told that her mother was malnourished. Although her mother ate &quot;like a horse&quot;, as the hospital put it, during her stay in hospital, and gained weight in the process, the care home denied any responsibility and argued that she had not been eating due to lack of appetite. If we were served a constant diet of tinned stew mixed with soup every day, we might lose our appetites too. Not every care home is like that, but those that are should not be tolerated, because they are ruining people's lives, putting lives at risk and, in some cases, killing people.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/7">I want to raise three specific concerns regarding the nutrition of older people: training, nutritional screening and co-ordination. On training, there is no requirement in the national minimum standards for care homes regarding training catering staff, in particular, in the specialist task of meeting the dietary needs of care home residents. I understand from the National Association of Care Caterers that no module is available as part of national vocational qualification level 2 on catering to ensure that staff can meet those special dietary needs. A module exists and was drawn up by NACC in the late 1990s, but City and Guilds, the awarding body, has not seen it as a high enough priority to be made a component of NVQ, despite the demand for such a course throughout the sector. What action will the Minister take to ensure that training on special dietary requirements is available as part of any qualification for caterers in care homes?</p>

	<p pid="a.184.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.184.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="184"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.184.1/1">I shall ask my second question, then I shall give way one more time, as I need to make some progress as a number of hon. Members want to speak. Will the Minister also intervene to encourage the awarding authorities to make such training a priority for care catering?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.184.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="184"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.184.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that in recent years there has been a trend, which predates 1997, of enforced sell-off of local authority homes into the private sector, which in some cases has been accompanied by poorer standards of training for staff in privatised homes? That is especially true in relation to nutrition. The problem that he describes is much less apparent, although not invisible, in the remaining homes that are run by local authorities.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.184.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="184"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.184.3/1">I have two reactions to that point. First, I should like to see the commission's report, which will analyse performance by sector precisely on nutrition standards, inadequate as they are. Secondly, we are where we are, and we must ensure that the system delivers good quality, fit-for-purpose services, regardless of whether they are publicly, privately or charitably run. That is the purpose of my contribution, but I entirely take the hon. Gentleman's criticism, which I have heard about and share, about the downsides of the regulated but not very well managed system that we have had for too many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/2">After highlighting my concerns about malnutrition in care homes, I have received a great many letters and phone calls. Some have been from angry care home owners, but many have come from care homes wanting to tell me what they do in practice, relatives and residents sharing their personal experiences, and health and care practitioners pointing to good practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/3">An example of good practice that I commend came from Southwark primary care trust, which told me about its care home support team, which works with 40 independent sector nursing homes in the borough. The team has introduced systematic assessment of need, which includes intensive training courses for care home staff, with courses on dementia and nutrition, and working with people with swallowing difficulties&mdash;an issue that the Parkinson's Disease Society is most concerned about in the upcoming review of national minimum standards. Those examples of good practice should become the norm. Making them the norm is the challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/4">Standard 8 of the national minimum standards for care homes makes nutritional screening a requirement. However, that requirement is part of a bundle of other requirements, which means that a home could meet the overall standard but perform poorly on nutritional screening. Without proper screening it is hardly surprising that one in every 10 new care home residents loses up to 5 per cent. of their body weight within one month of being admitted and up to 10 per cent. of their body weight within six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/5">As things stand, there is no agreed screening tool. BAPEN has developed a universal malnutrition screening tool for assessment of individuals across all care settings that is supported by the Royal College of Nursing, the British Dietetic Association and the Royal College of Physicians. NACC has produced its own screening tool for use by care home managers that is designed with individuals with no nutritional or dietary training in mind. Care homes need clear guidance about the assessment tools available and the circumstances in which they should be used. Will the Minister make nutritional screening on admission to care homes a mandatory requirement in the national minimum standards?</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/6">I am sure that the Minister will tell me about the review of the national minimum standards, the work of the Food Standards Agency, the efforts of the Commission for Social Care Inspection and the imminent publication of National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance on the use of nutritional supplements. The review of national minimum standards offers the opportunity to strengthen nutritional requirements. I understand that CSCI is undertaking work on that, as well as developing a toolkit for inspectors, and is due to publish a report on nutrition next month. The FSA is developing recommendations on nutrient-based standards not only for the care sector, but for public institutions across the piece. That work includes developing example menus to assist caterers in menu planning. I understand that the FSA is in discussion with a range of interested parties about its work and will produce a draft report, which will be ready by this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/7">I do not say that there is not a lot going on; indeed, I acknowledge that there is. However, the more I have researched the issue and talked to people, the more the question arises of where the co-ordination of those different strands of work is. Who is pulling them all together? I and many outside, particularly those in BAPEN and NACC, would like to know whether the Minister or her colleagues in the Department of Health will take steps to ensure that the work of the FSA, CSCI, NACC, the Caroline Walker Trust, BAPEN and other interested parties is effectively joined up, to ensure that the future national minimum standards cover all aspects of nutrition and meal provision. Would she or the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, be willing to meet me and representatives of NACC and BAPEN to discuss our concerns and their recommendations?</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/8">The second issue that I should like to raise is medication, which I mentioned before Christmas in an Adjournment debate to which the Under-Secretary of State responded. This morning, CSCI issued its report on medicine management in care homes. The report is entitled &quot;Handle with Care?&quot;, and it follows a report by the National Care Standards Commission that was published in March 2004. That earlier report identified serious deficiencies in the way care homes managed medicine. In the light of the earlier report, today's report makes worrying reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/9">&quot;Handle with Care?&quot; states that</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/10" class="indent">&quot;homes are still not placing enough importance on this critical area of care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/11">According to the report, 45 per cent. of care homes for older people are failing to meet the national minimum standards on medication. Some 5,140 of the 11,543 care homes in England are not managing medicines according to the national minimum standards. In almost one in three London boroughs, fewer than 40 per cent. of homes meet the medicine management standards. The report states that it</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/12" class="indent">&quot;shows that there has been some slight improvement in performance overall&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/13">it covers not only older people's homes, but children's homes&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/14" class="indent">&quot;with the exception of nursing homes for older people. But the rate of improvement in such a crucial area of care has been disappointingly slow, with nearly half the care homes for older people and younger adults, providing 210,000 places for residents, still not meeting the minimum standard relating to medication. The primary responsibility for this failure rests with the homes themselves.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/15">Some 210,000 people are living in homes that do not meet the minimum standards on medication, and the buck stops with the homes themselves. I am not here to say that the Government have not delivered, but I point out that the owners need to end their constant denial of problems and failings.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/16">It seems that the reasons why homes are failing to manage medication properly have not changed since NCSC reported. Lessons have not been learnt, and attitudes have not been changed. Indeed, the commission says:</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/17" class="indent">&quot;expenditure on training does not seem to have had an impact on this area of quality.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/18">The commission has found that even homes that meet the standard then struggle, slip and fall back. I first raised the issue of poor medication management in my report &quot;Keep Taking the Medicine&quot; in 2001. I have published two more reports since and contributed to the writing of the Health Committee's report on elder abuse. Five years on, there is still an awful lot to do. The level of over-medication and inappropriate medication in our care homes is shocking. It is a scandal that such poor practice, mistreatment and abuse continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/19">When NCSC reported in 2004, it noted:</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/20" class="indent">&quot;The majority of prescribed medicines will be supplied by a GP on a repeat basis at the request of care staff and not the service user.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/21">That places care staff in a powerful position to influence prescribing for good or for ill. Little has changed in nursing homes and progress has been &quot;stagnant&quot;, according to the latest report. That means that some older people are being managed by means of chemical cocktails of drugs, not for their benefit, but for the benefit of the home. It is chilling to think that if the published research on inappropriate medication is right, as many as 22,233 elderly nursing home residents in England could be under sedation without medical grounds. Indeed, commission's findings suggest that the situation could be far worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/22">Action is long overdue. It is time that care homes came out of denial and took action. There is no quick fix, but ensuring that the recommendations of the commission's report are followed through as a matter of urgency must surely be a priority. Perhaps the Minister can explain how those recommendations will be followed up after the commission is abolished in a couple of years' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/23">One way in which the standards could be raised and the quality of life of care home residents improved would be the delivery of the national service framework standard for medication review. The standard is clear. People aged 75 and over on fewer than four medications should have an annual medication review, and those on four or more should have a review every six months.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.0/1">Is it not something of a missed opportunity that because the standard in the national service framework for older people is not the same as the standards to which GPs work to get their quality and outcomes framework points, the system provides no incentive for GPs to deliver what is in the national service framework?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.187.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="187"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.187.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. There is an apparent misalignment between the GP contract and the QOF, and the NSF standard. That has meant that there has been a lack of incentives in the system for people to get to the milestone for the NSF. The evaluation of &quot;Room for Review&quot; guidance on medication reviews, published last year by the Department, pointed to the fact that progress had been patchy&mdash;only 8 per cent. of PCTs had met the NSF standard for annual medication reviews for patients over 75, and 5 per cent. had met the target for six-monthly reviews for patients over 75 on four or more medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/2">It is worth bearing in mind that that NSF standard was meant to be achieved by 2002. Two years after that, just 5 per cent. of PCTs were saying that they could meet that standard. As I have pointed out in previous debates&mdash;I did so before Christmas&mdash;two years after the NSF milestone was missed, 47 per cent. of PCTs were still reporting that they could not conduct six-monthly medicine reviews for over-75s on four or more medicines. That picture of patchy support from PCTs is borne out and repeated in the report published today by the Commission for Social Care Inspection. What is being done to ensure that the missed NSF milestone on medication reviews is finally achieved, and that PCTs engage with care homes to drive up the standards?</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/3">To conclude, I sought this debate to highlight two issues: nutrition and medication. Just one care home starving its elderly residents to death or using chemical straitjackets is too many, but the truth is that, through neglect or wilful intent, thousands of homes make the lives of those whom they are supposed to care for a misery. Thousands of homes are making a mockery of the standards, systems and safeguards that are supposed to protect the vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/4">I hope that the Minister will demonstrate that the Government understand the challenge and accept that there is still much to do, and that they will give the matter the same level of priority and attention that they have rightly given for many years to our systems for protecting the welfare of children.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.187.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="187"  time="009:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.187.2/1">I have been a north Oxfordshire Member of Parliament for more than two decades. During that time I have visited the nursing homes and residential care homes in my constituency on many occasions. After more than 20 years, many friends and neighbours have ended up in nursing homes and one goes and sees them.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/2">I do not recognise <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the picture that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> paints of care homes that do not care for their residents, but I think that there is a reason for that. I represent a relatively &quot;healthy and wealthy&quot; area of England, and I suspect that every nursing home in my constituency has a fair number of residents who pay privately. The homes cross-subsidise residents with local authority placements, and have done so for many years. One of our difficulties is that nursing home proprietors, whether they belong to the voluntary or the private sector, have to manage with the funds with which they are provided. Often, because of the pressures on local government finance and social service budgets, their margins are very tight.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/3">When it comes to nursing care standards, nursing homes are in competition with every other part of the NHS for nurses. Pretty well every nursing home on my patch has had recourse to creative schemes to recruit and train nurses from overseas, and I suspect that it must be difficult to recruit sufficiently well-trained staff in other parts of the country that are not as attractive or as wealthy as north Oxfordshire. I am not an expert, and I rose to my feet to speak about a different issue, but I suspect that there are two pressures that we need to consider: the unit cost per week of providing care in a nursing home for an elderly person and the need to ensure that there are sufficient well-trained nursing staff in our nursing homes. In areas of the country that do not have considerable cross-subsidy from residents who pay the full private rate, those pressures could be much greater.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/4">I want to raise a slightly different issue, however, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not mind my doing so. It concerns a point that he made in respect of the statement on the White Paper on community care the other day, so we are probably at one. Tomorrow, all six Oxfordshire Members are going to see the Secretary of State about funding in Oxfordshire. Our concern is that the Oxford Radcliffe NHS trust has a &pound;15 million deficit. One of the reasons for that is the continuing confusion as to what services are provided free within the NHS and what services are provided by social services, means-tested outside the NHS. If one were to visit the John Radcliffe hospital or the Horton hospital today and do an audit, one would find a number of patients who do not need to be there&mdash;they no longer need to be in acute general hospitals. They are not sufficiently well that they can go home, but their treatment at the John Radcliffe or the Horton has finished; they no longer need expensive acute beds. However, because of the confusion about services, the NHS is unable to move such patients into the non-NHS sector of continuing care. The situation is a nightmare and it is getting worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/5">A recent judicial review on the matter caused further confusion. As a lawyer, I am fortunate, as I am supposed to be able to construe definitions and documents. However, I find the definition of when care should be provided within the NHS and when it should be provided outside almost impossible to construe. As the complexities of people's care needs increase, that becomes even harder to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/6">When I was first elected to Parliament in the mid-1980s and I went around residential care homes at Christmas and other times, most of the people there were spry widows in their 70s. They were mentally alert and were there because their husbands had died, and they needed some care. Now I go into residential elderly care homes and find that practically every resident has Alzheimer's or some form of dementia. I often take my pug dogs with me, and the truth is that the residents are far more interested in seeing my dogs than they are in seeing me&mdash;the pugs are much better looking, and they go off on chocolate biscuit search and rescue missions. Those people are very poorly, and it is difficult to explain to their families that the nature of their illness is such that care should not be provided free at the point of use through the NHS, but has to be means-tested and contributed to in the social services sector. Unless we have much greater clarity about which services are provided by the NHS and which are provided on a means-tested basis in the social services sector, we will continue to have an increasing number of blocked beds in our acute hospitals to the overall detriment of NHS financing.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/7">There also still seems to be complete confusion about community hospitals with interim beds. For many people who do not need to go for long-term care in a residential care home, an interim bed would be brilliant. However, it is quite clear that the Thames Valley strategic health authority does not like community hospitals, simply because they are funded by the NHS. The Thames Valley strategic health authority would far prefer all community health to be provided by Oxfordshire social services. The Secretary of State made it clear in her statement last week that she wants existing community hospitals to be protected, so far as is possible. That will be difficult when strategic health authorities, in trying to balance their books, can say, &quot;Look, we can shift this off to some other funder.&quot; That square will not be circled by joint social services and health commissioning bodies, because there will still be tension about who pays for what.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/8">There will be considerable difficulties and tensions until there is greater clarity. It is unfair that a lot of people find themselves going through the whole appeal process to determine whether they should be entitled to continue in care funded by the NHS, and where it should happen. Collectively, Parliament must get to grips with a new definition. If we expect people to make a means-tested contribution to their long-term care at some stage, it behoves us to introduce a much clearer definition.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.0/1">I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman and agree with much of his analysis of the problem. Will he also note that the definitions are based solely on guidance that is administrative in nature, has no statutory force and yet appears to have redrafted the legal position and changed the law? That has led the courts to be concerned about whether the guidance is flawed.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.1/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, because he follows the subject, there have been a number of matters of judicial review, and the Department has been criticised for lack of clarity. The courts cannot themselves give a statutory definition where none exists. If we are to have beds in acute hospitals that are not blocked, as well as a vibrant and confident care home sector, we need greater clarity about what is provided free by the state through the national health service and what services are provided by local social services and are means-tested.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.190.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="190"  time="010:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew14">
	<p pid="a.190.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> on securing the debate. I apologise, as I assumed that there would be greater interest and have not prepared a lengthy speech, but I am sure that when the Minister responds we will be able to ask her plenty of questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/2">It is timely that the CSCI report on medications has been published today. My hon. Friend has said some of what I wanted to say about the report, but it is disappointing that two years on we seem to be no further forward. That seems to be the story when we consider the provision of services for older people. It is worth remembering that older people do not live only in care homes or hospitals. These days, the Government are driving towards looking after more older people at home, which is quite right. That is where they want to be. Many aspects of care in the home need to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/3">Underpinning all those issues is the national service framework for older people, which was produced in March 2001. It had the dubious distinction of being the first NSF without any attached funds, which immediately created a number of challenges, because anybody trying to achieve the NSF targets had to scrabble for funding. It was also one of the last NSFs to have targets attached. I was curious to see how we were progressing against those targets, so I tabled a number of parliamentary questions and received the perhaps not unsurprising answer that the Government were not collecting routine data on the matters for which targets had been set. It is difficult to determine how progress is being measured, so I decided to carry out my own survey in 2004, which revealed that many targets had not been met, even those that were supposed to have been achieved a year previously. I am disappointed that there has been no comprehensive analysis of the success or failure of the NSF, other than a glossy booklet assuring us that all is well. Clearly, all is not well.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/4">The Government rightly acknowledge that most people would like care at home. There is a problem with that, because although the Government have increased the funding for care at home, it has generally gone into more intensive packages. The casualty has been the funding for lower-level interventions, which may cause significant improvements in quality of life and health. Standard 8 of the national service framework is about the promotion of health and active life in older age. It acknowledges the benefits of a healthy diet but says little about two significant problems that, if addressed, could improve the overall picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/5">First, people who are much older get quite tired. It is an effort to cook and they have less time and energy for food preparation. There is a strong case for teaching them new ways to cook. Those in their generation are used to meat and two veg, which involves quite a lot of food preparation. They tend to resort to tinned foods, which may not be as high in nutritional value. Secondly, where a partner dies, two people would previously have been used to rubbing along together quite nicely, and one might have taken responsibility for food preparation. When someone is left to cope with that on their own, as well as with everything else, there is another need for education.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/6">My hon. Friend has highlighted some of the problems that will arise if we do not address nutrition among the elderly. I also want to quote from a lecture given by Professor Marinos Elia to the Westminster diet and health forum. He pointed out:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The main reason for the high prevalence of hospital malnutrition is that patients are already malnourished when they are admitted to hospital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/8">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/9" class="indent">&quot;In people aged 65 years and over in the community, the prevalence of individual vitamin deficiencies can be as high as 20 per cent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/10">He said that protein-energy malnutrition probably affected 13 per cent. of those aged over 65, and concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Treating/preventing malnutrition in the community, and abolishing major nutritional inequalities there, are important strategies for preventing disease, improving wellbeing, and aiding recovery of patients admitted to hospital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/12">There seems to be some evidence that such action would be useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/13">Standards for care homes have been mentioned, but they are fairly basic and centre around having three meals a day at certain intervals. Although they are welcome, there is no mention of basic things such as the need for five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. That is a Government strategy and has been the subject of a Government campaign, but it does not seem to appear in the guidance for care homes. Although my hon. Friend mentioned the failures of the system, it is disappointing that the statistics have not improved since last year. We have to ask what effect CSCI is having in driving those standards upwards. On the basis of the evidence of the past year, it would seem to be very little.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/14">The European Nutrition for Health Alliance has produced some statistics as well. It points out:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Patients over the age of 80 admitted to hospital have a five times higher prevalence of malnutrition than those under the age of 50&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/16">Clearly the problem is getting worse with increasing age&mdash;a factor that has not been mentioned today. The statistics concerning loss of weight when people enter a nursing home have already been mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/17">Age Concern has also put together some work on the subject. It says that a range of studies have put the prevalence of malnutrition in care homes at levels between 60 per cent. and 100 per cent. I cannot believe that the level is 100 per cent., because there are homes in which the food is excellent, and I know which ones I would like to go to when I am older, if the standards remain the same. Clearly, however, the problem is widespread and wholesale.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/18">What are the Government doing to assess the problem? I was interested in a parliamentary question that my hon. Friend asked in November 2005:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/19" class="indent">&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for Health what research her Department has commissioned into the nutrition of older people (a) in care homes, (b) receiving domiciliary care, (c) in an acute hospital ward and (d) in intermediate care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/20">I am afraid to say that the answer was a bit waffly; it did not really answer the question. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/21" class="indent">&quot;Details of individual projects, including a number concerned with nutrition and older people, can be found on the national research register&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-07">7 November 2005</phrase>; Vol. 439, c. 268W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/22">It then gave the URL where those details could be found. I decided last night to have a look to see what wealth of information was out there. I typed the words &quot;nutrition and older people&quot; into the search engine, and I found only one hit: a study of diet and nutrition in older people comparing the Afro-Caribbean population and other people. I think it considered 30 people in each cohort, which is not great. I tried some more combinations, such as &quot;nutrition in care homes&quot; and &quot;nutrition for geriatrics&quot;, and found zero hits for both.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/23">It would be interesting if the Minister could tell us what research is going on into this important subject. I am sure that the cost-benefit analysis must show that a little investment on the problem will reap dividends. If people go into hospital with malnutrition, they are at risk of developing bedsores and other illnesses, which create a demand on health services and facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/24">Medication in care homes is a significant problem that is generally underestimated. I would like briefly to mention the recent death of a care home patient who had been in a home for less than a fortnight. That home was owned by a GP, who I am pleased to say has now been removed from the register. The GP persuaded the patient to register, saying that it would be easier to register with the local practice. People do not think anything of that in such situations; they want to keep everyone happy. The patient was prescribed very high doses of sedatives, such that they could not eat and went into a steep decline; it can be proved that that was linked to the medication.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/25">That case raises questions about whether a GP who owns a care home should be allowed to prescribe, or whether there should be some sort of arm's-length prescribing process. I am sure that it is not a common problem, but for the protection of medics and the public, it deserves some attention.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.192.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="192"  time="010:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.192.0/1">My hon. Friend makes some important points about the dearth of Government research, not least in respect of nutrition. Does she share my concern that there appears to be a dearth of research on the use of medication in care settings&mdash;particularly care homes&mdash;to understand why prescribing in some cases appears to be inappropriate and to identify courses of action that could change that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.192.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="192"  time="010:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.192.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point about medication in care homes. I have seen that situation at first hand, because I used to work as a pharmacist, and I saw the prescriptions for each home. Things are better than they used to be when I first qualified 20 years ago. At that time, a person could have a pot of 500 sedatives prescribed, which could then be given out willy-nilly. At least that process is now carried out on a named-patient basis. I have seen homes undergo a change of ownership where the prescribing patterns change radically, sometimes for the better and, sadly, sometimes for the worse. There seems to be no overview of the process or the appropriateness of prescribing. The subject needs more research.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/2">I have read my hon. Friend's paper, and a lot of it seemed based on small-scale research with an extrapolation upwards. That can be dangerous, and it would be much better to have an accurate picture of what is going on with clearer guidelines as to when sedation is appropriate. In my opinion, sedation is inappropriate in many cases and is used for the convenience of the care staff, rather than the benefit of the patient. That is one of the biggest hidden scandals and abuses in today's society.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/3">I would like to mention hospitals. I have mentioned that those over 80 admitted to hospital have a five times higher prevalence of malnutrition than those under 50, but many are admitted in an emergency and the food that is given is often inappropriate. A lot of thought has recently gone into food in hospitals, but sometimes it is perhaps not enough. It does not matter what the food is like, because the problem that returns time after time&mdash;it happens in the care home sector as well&mdash;is the lack of basic help for the patient to eat or drink. That form abuse is endemic in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/4">The Minister will be aware of the &quot;Panorama&quot; programme a few months ago in which reporters went undercover into a hospital in the south of England. The programme showed how drinks were put out of patients' reach and food was taken away after a meal with no thought as to whether patients had been able to feed themselves. Sometimes people's arms were in plaster and no thought was given to basic care. There is a real need for a return to basic nursing standards, which seem to be forgotten time and time again.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/5">Sadly, we are dealing with a generation that does not complain. People do not complain because they do not want to be picked on or treated wrongly if they make a fuss. But we owe a lot to that generation. It deserves our attention because it is a generation that deserves better.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.0/1">I add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">my congratulations to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> on securing this important debate; he has raised some very important issues. Caring for those who can no longer care for themselves is one of the greatest challenges facing us, as has been recognised in the good contributions made.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/2">Nutrition is clearly of great importance to the well-being of any elderly person, whether in a care home or private accommodation. That was recognised by the Government in their 1998 study, &quot;National diet and nutrition survey: people aged 65 and over&quot;, which revealed that those living in care homes were more likely to be underweight and also reported that one in six residents were deficient in folate&mdash;a B vitamin&mdash;or were anaemic. Most care homes do a good job, but there are undoubtedly cases of under-nourishment in older people. Such cases are still many and varied, which in many respects is what today's debate is about. According to Age Concern, a range of studies have put the prevalence of malnutrition in care homes at between 60 and 100 per cent. Clearly, that is a matter of great concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/3">I do not propose to repeat everything that has been said about nutrition. Many good points have been made. I will endorse one point made earlier: of course nutrition is terribly important, but it is also important that elderly patients have access to that nutrition. In some cases, older people require special assistance to help them eat. That issue needs to be recognised, as does the issue of those suffering from Alzheimer's, who may become confused about whether they have eaten.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/4">In the light of those concerns, what estimate has the Minister made of the scope of nutritional problems facing many elderly people both inside and outside care homes? Is she entirely confident that that Commission for Social Care Inspection has the capability to enforce rigorous standards? I would like her to consider those points in her response. I intend to keep my speech relatively short, so that there is plenty of time for her to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/5">Problems with nutrition in care homes are mirrored in the use of medication. As we have heard, CSCI's report yesterday revealed that almost half of all nursing and care homes fail to meet national minimum standards for how they give medication prescribed by their doctors. Those results are deeply disturbing. It is vital that patient confidence is restored. The report highlighted significant geographical variations in performance and indicated that council-run homes perform significantly worse that voluntary and private homes. It went on to say that there had been few improvements since a similarly critical report in 2004. What measures are the Government going to introduce to ensure that patients in care homes receive the medication prescribed by their doctors?</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/6">Fear of abuse is a chilling problem that affects elderly people in some care homes and private homes, as was well set out by the hon. Gentleman. Many of the activities involved, including physical attacks, sexual abuse and fraud, are already criminal and would be recognised as such. However, elder abuse also includes psychological bullying and neglect. It does not help the situation that because older people are often vulnerable and suffering from mental or physical illness, unique barriers stand in the way of reporting such abuse. Help the Aged has estimated that a staggering 500,000 people are believed to be being abused at any one time in the UK, and yet nearly 40 per cent. of the public have not even heard the term &quot;elder abuse&quot;. Raising awareness and promoting vigilance is therefore a vital step towards tackling the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/7">I am concerned that, although the Department of Health has published guidance for local authorities on the protection of vulnerable patients, there is no legal requirement for local authorities to adhere to its recommendations. I am conscious that the Government are expected to announce today&mdash;they might have already done so this morning&mdash;proposals for the registration, further training and vetting of the approximately 750,000 care workers who look after elderly people. We have asked questions of the Department of Health about the vetting of staff working with vulnerable adults and the operation of the protection of vulnerable adults list, but as yet, we have not received any answers. Will the Minister address that point?</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/8">It is important that the Government's proposals, whatever they may be, which affect a large number of workers in the social care sector, are properly thought through. Otherwise, there will be a risk that the latest initiative will serve to add to the bureaucracy and cost, without necessarily achieving its aims of helping and protecting older people. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about that. With that in mind, perhaps she will explain her Department's response to the campaign led by Held the Aged and Action on Elder Abuse. I joined the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam at the campaign launch. Will the Minister outline what is being done to tackle this serious problem?</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/9">Taking advantage of the broad nature of the debate, if I may, I should like to address another serious problem facing elderly people. It is one that the Government have so far failed to even acknowledge in replies to my letters or when it has been raised at the Dispatch Box. I refer to the shortage of basic chiropody services for elderly people who cannot look after their own feet. Although nail cutting and routine chiropody treatments might seem insignificant to a large number of people, healthy and comfortable feet are especially important for elderly people. It is an issue not only of independence, dignity and mobility, but of helping to prevent dangerous falls.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/10">Last year, I raised the case of an 82-year-old lady who was partially sighted, suffered from angina and emphysema, had suffered three strokes, and was unable to bend to attend to her feet. She was told that she was no longer eligible for NHS podiatry care after she changed her GP. Before the KT23 statistical measures were discontinued, they showed that 17 per cent. fewer people were being seen by NHS chiropody departments in 2004&ndash;05 compared with eight years previously.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.0/1">My hon. Friend's point goes back to the point that I was making. He is jolly lucky that podiatry care is being provided. In Oxfordshire now, one does not get operated on for a hernia, and varicose veins are not operated on on the NHS, even if, like one of my constituents, one has to stand every day at work in great pain. That is because the primary care trusts, under substantial financial pressure, have had to move the line on what they think the NHS should be funding and what should be funded from social services or one's own resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid point, and I will return to it briefly. I think that it illustrates that there is a black hole between health and social care. We need some joined-up thinking to bridge that gap, but I will come to that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/2">I tried to explore the scope of the problem with regard to the lack of chiropody care in the NHS and undertook a survey of NHS services over the summer of last year. The results were quite disturbing. Some 85 per cent. of the chiropody departments or services surveyed&mdash;this was a nationwide survey&mdash;claimed that the budget for their service had not kept up with increases in demand. On average, respondents needed a 25 per cent. increase in staffing. Four out of 10 respondents told us that the level of need required for access to the service had been raised in the past five years&mdash;a point referred to by my hon. Friend. In other words, the barrier to entry had been raised. In a separate development, East Elmbridge and Mid Surrey primary care trust recently announced that some 3,000 people, or 30 per cent. of its patient base, were being discharged. I fear that it is not alone in discharging such a large number of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/3">As PCTs have the freedom to vary their eligibility criteria and level of need for access to services, I am concerned that a postcode lottery in access to basic chiropody care has been developing largely unnoticed. This issue highlights a wider problem, as my hon. Friend mentioned. Many elderly chiropody patients are falling through the gap that undoubtedly exists between health and social care. Nail cutting may not be the most complex medical operation or the most pressing health need, but its importance must been seen in the context of social factors such as independence, dignity and mobility.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/4">The arbitrary distinction between health and social need has allowed chiropody departments to divest themselves of their responsibilities, preferring to focus resources on, for example, the national service framework for diabetes. So far, social services have failed to pick up the tab and the responsibility, and many people are needlessly suffering as a result. May I invite the Minister to acknowledge the scale of the problem facing chiropody patients? What are the Government going to do about it? So far, there has not even been any recognition of the problem. How do the Government propose to monitor what is happening in that field now that the KT23 statistics are no longer collected? If one were being uncharitable, one might suggest that it was very convenient that the figures were no longer being collected and that the Government did not wish to acknowledge the issue at hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/5">Finally, I should like to bring the Minister back to the issue of the gap between health and social care, as illustrated by the lack of chiropody services in the NHS. One key way of tackling that black hole between health and social care would be to instruct NICE to draw up holistic standards and entitlements regarding care, recognising health and social care needs and benefits. That would ensure that patients did not fall into that gap, and that for all those suffering from long-term medical conditions, the whole care pathway was catered for. That is one key reform that must be introduced if we are to bridge the gap. I cite chiropody only as one example of what is happening in the system and of where so many patients are being failed. I ask the Minister to address those issues, and I look forward to hearing her response.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.0/1">It is a rare pleasure not only to serve under you, Mr. Benton, but to have half an hour to respond to a debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/2">A number of hon. Members have contributed to what has been an interesting and useful debate. I compliment <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> on securing the debate. I know his interest in the area and his commitment to improving the experience and quality of life of people in care homes. I welcome the opportunity to state the Government's position. The Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, is engaged elsewhere, and regrets that he cannot be present to engage in this debate with the hon. Gentleman. Of course, I shall draw my hon. Friend's attention to the length of time that the hon. Gentleman has left me to reply, although I am going to enjoy it none the less.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/3">Given the concerns expressed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> about care for the elderly, I invite them to visit Liverpool, where the Liberal Democrat-run city council consistently refuses to fund the realistic costs of homes for the elderly, so that beautiful and caring homes, such as Christopher Grange in my constituency, continue to stay in business only by relying on charitable support and reducing to the absolute minimum their staff's wages. Christopher Grange is run by the Catholic Church, and it has a loyal complement of staff who stay with it even under circumstances such as those. It might be of interest to the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend to see the difficulties that private homes and those provided by the charitable sector, such as Christopher Grange, have while operating under Liberal Democrat policies in Liverpool.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.0/1">I should not intrude on a local concern raised by a constituency Member, but may I ask the Minister to consider that when many of us from all parts of the House express concerns about the adequacy of funding settlements and resources for the care home sector, one response that Ministers often offer us is that the delivery of good outcomes and quality of care is a question not only of resources?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.197.1/1">I am glad that the hon. Gentleman made that point, because it allows me to reply that CSCI has rung its hands about the state of care for the elderly in Liverpool and criticised the local authority for not passing on to the elderly sector in social services the resources that the Government have provided to the city. I have been longing to get that off my chest. Notwithstanding that, however, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, would without doubt be willing to meet the hon. Gentleman to discuss his concerns further.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.197.2/1">This is not quite a point of order, but it is quite close. Given that no Labour Back Benchers are speaking in this debate, should not the Minister be speaking from two chairs? She might be able to move slightly to the right to make her point as an MP, and then move to the left as a Minister to respond to it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.197.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" speakername="Jane Kennedy" colnum="197"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew23">
	<p pid="a.197.3/1">I thought about that, but I might have fallen over my chair if I had tried it.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/2">The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam questioned why we did not have an older people's rights commissioner in England. I draw to his attention the fact that we already have a national director for older people, Ian Philp, who is responsible for implementation and oversight of the national service framework for older people. We would look to him for advice and guidance on those areas. When older people begin to need support at home or elsewhere, whether it comes from family members or health and social care professionals, we should strive to help them maintain their independence and quality of life. We should do so because that is what we would want for ourselves and those close to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/3">As hon. Members have said, caring for older people can be challenging, as I know from personal experience. The House may not know this, but it may be interested to learn that I used to be a care assistant in a residential home for the elderly in Liverpool, working for social services. I know exactly the pressures and demands on staff, requiring not only expert clinical skill, but an ability to empathise with individuals who require support at a time in their life when they are most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> rightly described the difficulties that people at that stage of their lives often experience. Care must be delivered in a way that maximises their independence, respects their autonomy and meets their quality requirements. We take very seriously the standard of care delivered to older people, and that is why we published in 2001 the national service framework to which Members have referred this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/5">That framework, like others, has the twin aims of raising standards of care and reducing inconsistencies between localities in the levels of care. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked why the national minimum standards say nothing about nutrition and the training of catering staff and others. However, the regulations and the national minimum standards do cover nutrition and they are being reviewed. As he said, there was no doubt that I would draw the House's attention to that. There will be full public consultation as we take the review forward, and plenty of opportunity for him and others to give their views on what they think should be included in the national standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.0/1">The standards and milestones in the national service framework stopped at 2004, and there has been no indication about how the Government plan to take forward the framework. The Minister mentioned consultation. Will she speak further about when the framework will be updated?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.198.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" speakername="Jane Kennedy" colnum="198"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew25">
	<p pid="a.198.1/1">As I said, we are reviewing the framework. I think that the hon. Lady is wrong about the standards ending in 2004, but we shall review the framework and we want to improve on it. The whole purpose of the review is to ensure that the standards that we have set are the best that we can achieve. We can always do better.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.2/1">Having the standards in place is right, but if there is no enforcement of standards or no check on their enforcement, they can be useless. What assurance can the Minister give that there will be consideration not only of the standards, but of how they are enforced?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.198.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" speakername="Jane Kennedy" colnum="198"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew27">
	<p pid="a.198.3/1">The hon. Gentleman made that point in his speech. CSCI can take enforcement action and it does. It is charged with the inspection of care homes and with working with the sector to achieve performance improvements. It has the necessary powers to take action. The commission has the powers that it needs, and it uses them. If I have the opportunity, I shall come on to the report that it published this morning.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.4/1">The Minister will be aware that not all the NSF milestones are those that will be monitored by CSCI, such as the provision of joined-up stroke services and protocols in GP surgeries. How are those monitored by the Government?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.198.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" speakername="Jane Kennedy" colnum="198"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew29">
	<p pid="a.198.5/1">I think that the hon. Lady is mixing up the NSF and the standards. The national minimum standards are also being reviewed, and the NSF will be updated in the light of that review. The next step will be a report from Ian Philp, which we expect to receive in 2006 and which will also cover her point.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.0/1">I am fully aware&mdash;I raised this in my speech&mdash;that CSCI is there. The question that I asked is whether the Minister can ensure that it has the capability and resources to ensure that these issues are dealt with, because at the moment there is a question mark over that area, as is shown by the reports that we are seeing about malnutrition in care homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, and it is one that can always be made. We believe that the commission has the resources that it needs to fulfil its statutory obligations, but we keep the issue of resources constantly under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.2/1">I am grateful to the Minister for giving way so often. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" name="John Baron">The hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase> referred to the ability of inspectors to get traction on some of these issues. One point made in the medication report today is that there is a</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/2" class="indent">&quot;lack of responsiveness to inspectors' follow-up visits&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/3">which it says suggests that there is no</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/4" class="indent">&quot;sufficient incentive to make changes, despite the risk of prosecution.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.199.2/5">That relates to medication standards, but I fear that inspectors face the same dilemma in other cases, because the nuclear option of closing a home is not really an option. That is the problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, and I want to invite the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, to reflect on the range of issues raised this morning and the force with which they have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/2">Let me deal with some of the other points. The hon. Member for Billericay made a firmly argued point about chiropody and said that he had had no response from the Government. There is no excuse for that; we should respond when hon. Members raise issues with us. I acknowledge the force of what the hon. Gentleman said and will invite my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, assuming that he has responsibility for this matter, to respond to him more fully. The hon. Gentleman has previously brought to my hon. Friend's attention the gap between the NHS and social services in respect of podiatry services. The White Paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot; addresses the joint commissioning of services and, crucially, the development of more services in the community, which will include improved chiropody services. However, I personally do not have a great deal of knowledge of that area, so I shall draw it to my hon. Friend's attention.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.199.4/1">I appreciate that this is not the Minister's area of responsibility, so obviously I do not expect a detailed answer now. Nevertheless, when she raises the issue with the Under-Secretary, will she ensure that the issue of taking a holistic approach to the care pathway is also addressed? In my view and that of many other hon. Members, without a holistic view of the whole pathway, particularly when dealing with patients with long-term medical conditions, we shall continue to fail. People will continually fall into the gap between health and social care. I cited chiropody as an example, but as the Minister knows, that happens in many other areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.0/1">I could not disagree with what the hon. Gentleman has just said. We are firmly behind the concept of the patient pathway in improving the whole patient experience, from beginning to end. As the Minister with responsibility for patient safety and for quality, I receive the letters from Members of Parliament when patients fall into the gap that he described, so I, too, take an interest in ensuring that services are coherent and comprehensive.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/2">The hon. Member for Banbury argued cogently about the complexity of the definition of what comprises nursing or residential care. He described the pressures that that is causing in Oxfordshire and said that he would meet my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health later this week. The Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, will read his comments with interest. The hon. Gentleman talked about people in acute hospitals who should not be there. More intermediate care has been available in the past five years. We have worked hard to develop that, and the new national framework for continuing care will be issued for consultation in April, so further work is in the pipeline. Delayed discharges have often been discussed. The number of delayed discharges was reduced by 67 per cent. between September 2001 and September 2005, so I hope that he will take some encouragement from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/3">The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam talked about misalignment of the national service framework standards and GPs' incentives to review medicines. By the end of the first year&mdash;2004&ndash;05&mdash;the majority of GPs were carrying out medication reviews for people who were prescribed repeat medicines under the quality and outcomes framework.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.4/1">I accept the hon. Gentleman's point; we shall have to study the matter further.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/2">Promoting healthy, active ageing is a key element of the national service framework. Improving diet and nutrition in older people is, of course, an integral part of maintaining health and determining a person's well-being. It is also fundamental to the principles of dignity and respect. We recognise that patients should be involved, wherever possible, in all decisions about their care, including nutrition. The hon. Member for Romsey suggested that five portions of fruit and vegetables a day should be one nutritional requirement for older people. I say to her that older people are adults and, like any of us, can be encouraged to participate in healthy eating programmes, but we cannot insist on that. Clearly, choice is what is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/3">Care home residents regard the food that they are given as one of the most important factors in determining their quality of life and their ability to maintain their health and well-being. We acknowledge that fact in the national minimum standards. Failure to eat through physical inability or depression, or because the food is inadequate or unappetising, can lead to malnutrition, with serious consequences for health. Older people are entitled to nutritious, varied, balanced, culturally sensitive and attractively presented meals at times that suit them. I take the point that hon. Members have made about cooks not being available after 4 o'clock.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/4">The national minimum standards state clearly what we expect. As I have said, CSCI inspects and regulates care homes and has statutory powers to take action if those standards are not being met. As I have shown, the principles of respect and dignity are expressed in a practical way in the national minimum standards, through which registered providers of care, assisted by regulators, can ensure that their services are person-centred, appropriate and effective and that their care staff are trained, supervised and supported so that they are competent to deliver high-quality care.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/5">I shall make one or two further comments on the review. The hon. Gentleman said that there was no screening tool in respect of nutrition for people entering care homes. All stakeholders, including CSCI and the FSA, will have an opportunity to contribute to the review that we are undertaking on the national minimum standards. All the contributions that they make, including his point, will be considered seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/6">I should make a point about the report that CSCI has issued today. We acknowledge the findings in its follow-up study&mdash;this is the second study that it has conducted&mdash;and I am disappointed that care homes appear to have made so little progress towards meeting the national minimum standards on medicines management since its last report. However, CSCI has the responsibility for inspection, as well as the powers it needs to take any necessary and appropriate enforcement action to secure improvements in standards of care in care homes. Ultimately, it has the powers to close poorly performing care homes. I read the review of the report with interest; while being briefed for today's debate, I was a little disappointed to learn that it appeared that CSCI had briefed the hon. Gentleman on the details of the report in advance of briefing Ministers&mdash;that is a cause of some consternation.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/7">The national minimum standards leave providers in no doubt about how the Government expect people to be cared for and treated. Providers should respect that older and vulnerable people have preferences and needs that should be met on an individual basis, and care and treatment should provide safeguards to promote health and well-being. It should be respected that a good quality of life is essential to health and well-being. No one should be deprived of a decent quality of life through neglect, omission, malice or ignorance.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/8">Apart from analysis of calls to the Action on Elder Abuse helpline&mdash;the hon. Member for Billericay asked me to respond specifically to that&mdash;and local data collections on the back of the &quot;No Secrets&quot; guidance, there are no credible national statistics on the incidence and nature of abuse. I have noticed that in recent publicity linked to the campaign on awareness of abuse of older people, Help the Aged has claimed&mdash;the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam pointed this out&mdash;that about 500,000 people experience abuse at any one time. We do not recognise that figure. The Government have consistently expressed reservations about it; it was derived from a small community-based study that took a very wide definition of abuse or harm. Importantly, the figure also does not recognise all that we have done since 1997 to prevent and tackle abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/9">However, I accept that lack of knowledge about the nature and prevalence of abuse is a serious flaw. To help remedy that, we have provided AEA with funding of &pound;280,000, with &pound;150,000 for data capture to take stock of the information that is currently being collected by councils. AEA will advise on the validity and reliability of the information, and make recommendations on what data can be routinely and accurately collected. We are awaiting the final report from AEA, which will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/10">Of course, it is important to acknowledge that the vast majority of care staff are dedicated to their work, as I know, having worked alongside them. They are committed to the welfare of those whom they look after. I am very grateful to all those working in care homes, in individuals' own homes as home helps or equivalents, and in other settings, who provide a high-quality service.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/11">It is important to return to the CSCI report that was published today, because it raises matters of serious concern. The report makes a number of recommendations on issues such as staff training and the development and monitoring of patients to safeguard them from abuse through medication mismanagement, and to maximise their well-being. In the coming year, CSCI will also carry out themed inspections into medication management, sampling homes for controlled drugs management, and its inspectors will pay particular attention to medication management in care homes. Through all this activity, the commission will strive to ensure that it works collaboratively and supportively with its stakeholders in the sector to ensure that the messages from its report are acted upon. The hon. Gentleman made a valid point about the nuclear option of closing a home that has become a haven for many residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/12">The hon. Gentleman also said that it appears that there has been little improvement in managing medicines. We will look carefully at CSCI's recommendations, and a deeper analysis of where exactly homes are failing would be helpful. We will feed CSCI's report into the review of the standards and regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/13">The national service framework for older people recommended that medication reviews be carried out for all people over 75 at least once a year, and that those taking four or more medicines should have a review every six months. In that context, we have also supported a number of primary care trusts to identify and share good practice in medicines management through the national medicines management collaborative. Nearly half of all PCTs have participated in this programme to implement local medicines management schemes so that people get more help from their GPs, pharmacists and others in using their medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/14">One of the measures used for assessing improvement was the proportion of people aged 65 years and over on four or more regular medicines who had had a documented medication review carried out in the last 12 months. There was a significant increase in activity, and in some cases the reported rate of reviews more than doubled. Another measure was the percentage of patients in care homes who have had a documented review of their medicines in the last year. I am aware that some people believe that people in care homes do not have their medicines reviewed regularly, but that is not what the data from the collaborative show. There was a similar increase in activity for patients in care homes, compared with those living at home, albeit from a lower starting position.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/15">From a survey of PCTs undertaken in 2004, we know that the majority of PCTs had a written strategy&mdash;I know that things can be put on paper, but they have to be put into practice&mdash;and 60 per cent. of PCTs had agreed local guidelines for medication reviews.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.0/1">A similarly critical report was published in 2004, and this latest CSCI report highlights that very little progress appears to have been made since then. I ask the Minister to give that issue added urgency this time around, as little seems to have been done over the past couple of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/2">Will the Minister also ask the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, to write to me in response to the issues that she has referred to him, specifically including chiropody and the gap between health and social care?</p>

	<p pid="a.203.1/2">In conclusion, I hope that I have demonstrated our commitment to ensuring that all our older people are treated safely, effectively and with respect for their dignity. Through the older people's NSF and other initiatives I have outlined today, we have done much to root out discrimination of older people. However, we are aware that there is more work to be done to ensure that older people are treated with sensitivity, and today's report serves to underline that.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/3">Many reforms are already under way. The improvements described in the White Paper will build on them. By looking at people's whole lives rather than individual problems, and by fitting services around their needs, we will help them live healthier, more independent lives. That is what we would all wish.</p>

	Coal Surface Workers (Compensation)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.204.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="204"  time="010:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h02.htm#60207h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.204.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this important debate on behalf of those Members who have constituents affected by exposure to surface dust and underground dust. This is the third opportunity that the House has had in the past three years to discuss surface workers exposed to dust, and it is the second Adjournment debate that I have secured on this important issue. I know that it will affect many Members who have constituents with coal mining interests, or with former coal mining interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/2">Hon. Members present will congratulate and applaud the Government for putting in place the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease handling agreement, which recognised for the first time that exposure to coal dust damaged people's health. It also meant that lengthy legal action, which would have had to be taken on behalf of individuals exposed to coal dust, could be avoided; it was estimated that that such legal action would have taken 15 to 20 years. That is obviously very welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/3">It is also welcome that the scheme has so far paid out &pound;1.7 billion. In my constituency, some &pound;26 million has been paid out, but that figure is dwarfed by the figure claimed by the constituents of some colleagues present, such as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase>. So I pay tribute to the Labour Government for putting the scheme in place, although I always add the rider that no amount of compensation can compensate the victims, who die slow and agonising deaths. There is also the effect on families who have watched their loved ones gasping for their last breath.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/4">It is therefore with a sense of frustration that I stand here again in a debate on compensation for surface workers. The scheme does not cover those who worked only above ground but who were still often exposed to high levels of dust every day. The scheme also does not cover individuals such as blacksmiths&mdash;including my younger brother&mdash;whose main job was a surface occupation. My brother and others went underground, and were exposed to dust, daily.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/5">One of my constituents&mdash;he is one of many cases, and other hon. Members have them, too&mdash;Mr. Jack Dobson of South Moor, County Durham, was a blacksmith for 30 years in the Morrison Busty pit at Annfield plain. He explained in letters to me that he worked in appalling conditions as a blacksmith, sometimes in 6 in of coal dust, or with the dust swirling around his workplace. I have heard the same from other constituents. Mr. Dobson is 83 and suffers from emphysema and chronic bronchitis. He can walk only 20 yds without getting short of breath, and he needs three separate inhalers just to get his breath. I challenge the Minister and the civil servants who administer the scheme to call in and see Mr. Dobson if they are ever in Durham, to see what effect his condition has on his daily life. It is an agonising death in which people slowly gasp for air, as he does daily. Other hon. Members could highlight similar cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.2/1">As I represent a seat that straddled the former Leicestershire and south Derbyshire coalfields, I know that numbers of people are in the position that my hon. Friend describes. He is frustrated that, despite all the good things we have done, there has been reluctance to acknowledge that there can be serious health implications to working in surface-only occupations, such as on the bank or screening. It may be true that, in a general sense, in terms of medical evidence, it is more difficult to sustain a link to COPD, but will my hon. Friend urge the Minister to consider coal dust in specific pits? The conditions that I saw, as a visiting councillor and parliamentary candidate, seemed to be those that could lead to COPD in later life.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.205.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="205"  time="010:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h02.htm#60207h02_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.205.0/1">I agree, and I will expand on those points later. The worrying thing about the scheme is that although it is very welcome in many coalfields and former coalfield communities, and although, as I said, it has paid out billions of pounds already, it seems that for want of a small amount of extra money, we are ruining what should be a flagship policy for a Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/2">When I spoke in the previous Adjournment debate, I said that the problem could have been solved six years ago. The Department of Trade and Industry laid a minute before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-10">10 July 2000</phrase>. It appeared from that minute&mdash;I am sure this is how other right hon. and hon. Members read it&mdash;that, for the first time, the Department for Trade and Industry accepted that there had been negligence on the part of the National Coal Board in respect of those people who worked only in surface occupations. Alas, we have now discovered that that does not seem to be the case after all.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/3">I want to concentrate on that minute. It is important that the House hears what is in it, and that the Minister takes on board what it says. He has to realise that his own Department wrote it and gathered together the information to produce it. Paragraph 5 says:</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/4" class="indent">&quot;exposure to coal dust on the surface leads to the same lung disease as dust underground&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/5">That is backed up by the World Health Organisation, which in May 2000 stated that 18 per cent. of surface workers developed some form of lung disease. In my mind&mdash;and, I think, in everyone else's&mdash;that makes it quite clear that we are not dealing with different types of dust; we are dealing with the same type. The minute continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The DTI has investigated the level of dust prevailing in surface jobs in British coal mines, measures which could have been taken to reduce dust and those which were taken&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/7">It goes on:</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The DTI proposes to accept that British Coal did not fully meet its responsibilities towards certain categories of workers in dusty jobs on the surface&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/9">Paragraph 8, which considers which group of workers the acceptance of liability would encompass, is important. It says that</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/10" class="indent">&quot;acceptance of this additional liability will mean that current claimants can extend their claim to cover time spent in dusty jobs on the surface&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/11">that is, people who worked underground but had a period of time on the surface. However, the next point is the most important one; the minute says:</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/12" class="indent">&quot;And men who have only&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/13">the &quot;only&quot; is in bold type&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/14" class="indent">&quot;worked on the surface will be able to put in a claim&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/15">So in my mind there is no query or difficulty; the minute states that men who worked only on the surface in dusty jobs could, for the first time, put in a claim&mdash;and to emphasise the point, &quot;only&quot; is in bold.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/16">Finally and perhaps most importantly, the minute states:</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/17" class="indent">&quot;The Treasury have agreed in principle the acceptance of this liability. If during the period of 14 days beginning on the date on which this minute was laid before Parliament, a Member signifies an objection by giving notice of a Parliamentary Question or by otherwise raising the matter in Parliament, final approval to proceed with accepting the liability will be withheld pending an examination of the objection.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/18">I have made extensive investigations, with the Speaker's office and the Journal Office, both of which I thank, and I can tell hon. Members that no objections were raised and there was no instruction from the DTI or any Minister to withdraw the minute from Parliament. I wonder where that leaves us, and whether the Department is now denying liability, although the minute has not been withdrawn or questioned in the House. May I assume that the minute is still in force? As I understand it, no one has taken any steps to withdraw it or question it, and certainly no right hon. or hon. Member has objected.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/19">We need the answers to a few questions. First, I ask the Minister when the policy changed. Secondly, we need to know when the House was informed that the policy had changed. On what information did the DTI base the minute, in the first place? If the Department accepted liability in 2000 on information that it had clearly garnered from somewhere, what changed that information, or what new evidence meant that the minute no longer mattered? Several Ministers have had responsibility for the subject since the minute was published&mdash;they seem to change like the weather. But which Minister took the decision to change the policy, and on what date was it changed?</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/20">How did we get from the Government laying a minute before Parliament saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/21" class="indent">&quot;exposure to coal dust on the surface leads to the same lung disease as dust underground&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/22">to a situation in which the then Minister&mdash;now the Deputy Leader of the House of Commons&mdash;told <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> the following in a written answer?</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/23" class="indent">&quot;The Department's medical advice is that the levels of . . . not visible dust . . . in surface jobs . . . were not sufficient to cause lung disease.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-10">10 February 2005</phrase>; Vol. 430, c. 1795W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/24">How did we get from a position in which the Government said, in the minute that the</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/25" class="indent">&quot;DTI proposes to accept that British Coal did not fully meet its responsibilities towards certain categories of workers in dusty jobs&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/26">to a situation in which my right hon. Friend now the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said, in March 2001, that the minute was never intended to accept blanket liability? How is it that, in our last debate on the subject, the Minister with us today said that the minute was only a &quot;willingness&quot; to accept liability? I have to tell him to look at paragraph 10, which begins:</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/27" class="indent">&quot;The Treasury have approved in principle the acceptance of this liability.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/28">I am quite a simple soul and do not have batteries of civil servants to advise me, so I referred to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; for the definition of principle. It says that it is a fixed or predetermined policy or course of action. To my mind, and to those of a lot of lay people, that shows that the Government have accepted that, in principle, there was liability.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/29">I do not know how we got from a situation in which the Government laid before the House a minute stating that unless an objection was made in 14 days they would proceed with accepting liability to one in which, despite none of those things happening, the DTI claims there is no liability on its part and that people should pursue claims through the civil courts. Litigation is exactly what the COPD scheme was set up to avoid. It is because of that course of action that the claims of many surface-only workers, made through disreputable claims handlers and solicitors, are being withdrawn or shelved. Those workers will never get justice, even if a scheme is put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/30">How can the Minister defend the Government's actions? In the last Adjournment debate on this issue he said that</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/31" class="indent">&quot;solicitors agreed that a strong legal case in relation to surface dust and surface-only workers could not be constructed, and argued instead for compensation on a moral basis.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-20">20 October 2005</phrase>; Vol. 437, c. 1083WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/32">Surely he does not mean to say that as long as an action is not legal, the decision cannot be morally bankrupt? Clearly, this situation is just that.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/33">The minute was never withdrawn from Parliament, so does that mean that it is still in place? No Minister has explained in Parliament why the policy changed. My hon. Friends with coal-mining interests, and constituents such as Mr. Dobson, are not going to go away, so it is no good for civil servants or Ministers to hide behind the situation and the arguments that have been put forward. As a nation, we have a moral obligation to miners and former surface workers who, through no fault of their own, had their dying days and retirements ruined and, in many cases, their lives cut short. If we are to treat them with justice and dignity, we must compensate them.</p>

I share his exasperation; how many Adjournment debates about surface workers must we have before the Government finally resolve the matter? I urge the Minister to get on and resolve it, because, as the hon. Gentleman said, we are not going to go away. Members of all parties who represent mining constituencies are united. We demand justice for this relatively small number of people. I estimate that 30 to 40 people in my constituency are affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.1/1">I refer the hon. Gentleman to the Trade and Industry Committee report on the COPD scheme, which states that solicitors estimate the number of people concerned to be between 3,500 and 5,000, which is a relatively small number.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.208.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1485" speakername="Adam Price" colnum="208"  time="011:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h02.htm#60207h02_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.208.0/1">Indeed, and given the Government's vast resources, the money would not matter a great deal to the Treasury, which is why it agreed in principle five or six years ago. In contrast, the issue is of huge significance to the people concerned and their families. As miners tell us time and again, in many cases it is about not the money, but the principle and the need to secure justice for these men, as it was secured in the majority of cases through the COPD scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/2">I am sure that the Minister well tell us, although I hope that he will not, that the problem is the paucity of evidence. I seem to remember that a certain American politician said that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. There is a paucity of evidence, specifically in relation to surface workers, but that is not <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">their fault. As the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> will tell us, it is the fault of inadequate monitoring of the surface areas of mines, not of those who worked in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/3">Sadly, plenty of evidence points to a causal link between exposure to coal dust and COPD, but there is a lack of specific evidence regarding different components and different jobs, particularly for surface workers. However, some data are available. The Institute of Occupational Medicine has data on 3,930 dust concentration measurements in relation to 13 surface occupational groups at 10 collieries in the UK. Has the Department looked at those measurements?</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/4">As we have heard, there is also international evidence of the adverse effect of exposure to coal dust on the surface. A study of the health of anthracite workers in the United States in 1989 found that after adjusting for factors such as smoking, age and height, the modelling indicated that the predicted decrements for forced expiratory volume per second, which is the relevant measurement, were 120 ml for workers in coal surface jobs and for coal cleaning plant workers. That study is one of the few that have looked specifically at surface workers. Its finding is significant when one considers that a series of studies conducted in UK collieries in the early '70s estimated an average loss of FEV&mdash;forced expiratory volume per second&mdash;of 0.6 to 1 ml per unit of dust exposure. If that is extrapolated, it means that the loss of 120 ml of FEV found among the American anthracite workers is equivalent to a lifetime of exposure at the maximum permitted exposure limit. So the American study shows that surface workers had an average loss of lung capacity equal to exposure at the maximum limit in UK collieries at the time. Clearly that maximum exposure limit was inadequate. That suggests, at the very least, that there is an adverse effect which can be highly significant. I urge the Minister to consider the evidence, as there is evidence to suggest that some surface workers will have contracted COPD as a result of their exposure to coal dust when working on the surface.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/5">There are other relevant factors. A number of studies have discussed the possible relevance of the chemical composition of coal dust in certain parts of the UK and at certain coalfields. Respirable crystalline silica might be a contributory factor for people working in surface areas. There is evidence to show that in a number of cases exposure to coal dust contributes to people contracting COPD.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/6">I am happy to be corrected on this point, but I understand that a miner must have worked underground for five years to qualify. There is evidence in both the US and the UK that loss of FEV is greater among younger miners than older ones and is greater in people who left the industry early than in those who stayed in the industry. One theory is that a certain proportion of people are super-susceptible. Hon. Members who have worked in the coal industry will know of some young miners, who, within a matter of a few months, showed a super-susceptibility to chest problems and were moved to the surface, precisely because they were susceptible to coal dust. Therefore, among that group of workers, there is a concentration of people with a susceptibility. There is evidence of genetic determinants that predispose people to developing COPD. A predisposition does not mean that it is a causal factor, but it does mean that if those people are put in an environment where there is a causal extrinsic factor, they are more likely to develop COPD.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/7">On the basis of the substantial evidence showing the super-susceptibility factor among certain people, the five-year bar is morally wrong and goes contrary to the available scientific evidence. I urge the Minister, on the basis of the data as well as the moral case, to see that the Government do not change their position, as the hon. Member for North Durham said they are, but revert to the one that still exists in the parliamentary minute in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/8">We have had Adjournment debates on a number of occasions, and in the previous one in the Chamber, the Minister said that he would consider the matter again. I hope that he has had an opportunity to do so. Last January, the Deputy Leader of the House&mdash;then the relevant Minister&mdash;said, after an intervention from the former Under-Secretary at the Wales Office that he would revisit this issue. How many times does the Department have to revisit this issue? How many times do we have to have Adjournment debates?</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/9">In the previous debate, the Minister undertook to write to a number of hon. Members on specific matters. I hope that he will be able to relay some of that information to us. May I ask particularly about the issue of a common law case? I understand that the Department's position in October was that it now refuses to accept liability, and it is apparently up to individual miners, many of whom are suffering from crippling lung disease in the latter years of their lives, to bring court cases that may last many years. Why do the Government say that they will enforce an adverse costs order? Such an order would mean that if the Government lost, they would expect the miner's side to pay the costs. That is an inhibiting factors and a reason why a test case is unlikely to be brought. The Government will presumably will use the best Queen's counsel in the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/10">Surely, if there is doubt on this matter&mdash;the evidence that we provided shows that there is at least a scintilla of doubt&mdash;and the Government are prepared to accede to our demands to change their position, the honourable thing would be to say that the case would be neutral in terms of costs. Solicitors have said that they will work for free on the miners' side. Surely, the Government should not impose an adverse costs order against a group of miners who are only asking for justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.0/1">I shall attempt not to repeat anything that has been said, having anticipated what some colleagues have said and may wish to say. However, I should like to make a couple of points and ask a few questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.0/2">On costs, there is something of an unvirtuous circle in relation to how the schedule is operating for claims. It is different from the beat knee claims from 7,000 Nottinghamshire miners which were dropped scandalously by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers in the late autumn, because it was not part of the process and the initial litigation. The unvirtuous circle is based on the fact that common law claims have not been brought. Solicitors have often hidden some of their charging on the pretence that a common law case was proceeding and that funding, whether union funding or other people handling funding, was mentioned to the men at the time and they were sold the myth that there was some external funding of their cases. Therefore, they went with that system, whether or not they were surface workers. Now, for the Government to turn that around and say, &quot;You'll need to bring a common law claim at this stage&quot; to those people who had put in their claims under the scheme that the Government, on behalf of the Coal Board, had conceded and agreed with the claimants' solicitors, is flawed in logic and natural justice and leaves the surface workers totally exposed, because the Government could use a range of legal arguments to attempt to stop any claims coming forward on a common law basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.0/3">There is, however, a sting in the tail for the Government. When the Compensation Bill works its way through the House, some hon. Members will have a number of things to say on the Floor of the House about the miners' compensation and what should be in the Bill. The question of industrial injury, litigation and small claims courts will create an interesting dilemma for the Government, because where there are working collieries with people working on the surface, it will be possible for an MP assisting an individual, as the litigant's friend, to start taking a plethora of small claims court cases to the &pound;5,000 limit, if that is what is agreed, on the basis that the compensation will be up to a maximum of &pound;5,000. The Government could find themselves defending such claims in a wide range of courts throughout the country. That is my intention with my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.0/4">When I have held public meetings&mdash;I held some in November and December&mdash;many hundreds of people have attended each one. They have agreed unanimously that that is one of the actions that I, as their representative, should take forward, along with a range of other things. If we can get pro bono advice from solicitors, we will do so. That will create an organisational and possibly a political problem for the Government in defending each case that will have to be brought in common law exactly as they say we have to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.0/5">Some of the arguments that will come into play&mdash;about what was said to the individuals when they first submitted their claims to the Government&mdash;will rebound on the Government. I am requesting today, on behalf of my constituents, the full file from each solicitor so we can see the paperwork for the surface workers in my area, who I am aware of and who have asked me to assist them, and what claims have gone in. I ask the Minister to ensure that the contents of this debate in <i>Hansard</i> are sent to the two presiding judges for their consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.0/6">There is a double hit on surface workers, in respect of both chest problems and vibration white finger, which particularly grates on people. For example, Mr. Bernard Martin, one of my constituents, used vibrating tools for 15 years and has the same white finger symptoms as someone who worked underground. Precisely what tools would he not be using that someone underground may be using? What is the difference in tools? Is there a difference? If he was working on maintenance, for example, over the weekend, what was he doing if he was not using vibrating tools for that period of time? Regarding those in the blacksmiths, such as Mr. Pat O'Sullivan or Mr. Edward Wesley, or many others, what environment and what tools were they working with? Did the Government concede some claims because their insurers did not realise that those people were working on the surface? The presumption was that they were working underground. The evidence was in the medical records. The Government did not have to concede the principle, but had to write off those cases. What was the process through which the Government insurers then said that this or that particular man had a justifiable claim? I put it to the Minister that the only difference was that someone suddenly spotted&mdash;or failed to spot, in some cases&mdash;the work history. The symptoms were identical, and given that the people had worked in the same industry, using the same tools and breathing in the same dust, that is not surprising.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.0/7">Take the example of the coal preparation plant still operating at Harworth colliery in my constituency. Why have fans been put in there? Why are lung capacity tests taken of those working in that plant, which is an enclosed environment with what many would say is worse dust than people experienced when working underground, particularly in the past decade? For example, Mr. Melvin Fisher's recent test demonstrated that his lung capacity was down by 17 per cent. Nobody in his village was surprised at that, given the environment in which he works. That is just one example, but there are many more in which exactly the same issues resonate.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.0/8">An extreme example is my constituent Ken Brown, who died of emphysema and who had worked in only the one job in the one industry. He got social security payments because of his problems with the disease, so why was he not eligible under this scheme? He self-evidently had an industrial disease caused exclusively by the failure of his employer to ensure safe working practices. Mr. Brown had one job at one colliery and one illness, yet there are other such examples all over the country. It seems to me that the Government are hiding behind weak arguments. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.0/9">I have one final question about the dust reference panel. How many surface workers sit on that panel and look at the evidence? The Government have an obligation to take employers' responsibilities properly, to examine the problem, and to say why people using the same tools, breathing in the same dust and working in dangerous environments in the one industry should not receive the same compensation as those who happen to work underground.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing this important debate. As he says, there have been a number of debates on the subject, but it is important that we keep them going until we persuade the Government to accept that surface workers should be included in the COPD scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">My hon. Friend referred to the moneys that we received in Barnsley, and the Government have greatly assisted mining communities. In my community of Barnsley, which comprises three constituencies, there is a great deal of disability. In 1997, when the local authority carried out a study across the area, it found that there was a disabled person in one in three households. Most of that disability resulted from work in heavy industries, such as mining and steel, and a great deal was due to the chest diseases contracted by miners or former miners.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">After the Appeal Court case of February 1998, the Government accepted their responsibility and they have paid out an enormous amount of money so far. Indeed, at the last count in November, the number of claims stood at 581,495. The Government are paying compensation at the rate of &pound;2 million a day, and we welcome that. However, the scheme is flawed in that it does not include surface workers. Arguments have been put by the claimants' group of solicitors to include such workers and we have heard about the minute laid before Parliament in 2000 that accepted liability for surface workers, but was never acted on.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/4">My hon. Friend asked a number of questions about that minute. It may well be that when the minute was laid, the claimants' group of solicitors was pressing for all surface workers to be included. That may well have been why the liability was not processed from the time that it was put to Parliament that liability would be accepted. I ask the Minister to revisit the minute with the intention of correcting the injustice and including surface workers in the COPD claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/5">I know that you have worked at a colliery, Mr. Cummings, as I have. We are both aware that in coal preparation plants, coal was often bunkered for a whole weekend. Quite often there would be delays during the week, but activity at the bunkers underground would continue so that production at the coal face could continue while the delay was sorted out.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/6">The bunkering of the coal resulted in its being dried out, and dust suppression technology never kept up with the cutting technology introduced into the collieries. That is why British Coal was negligent and has accepted so many claims. The dried coal in the bunkers was released down badly designed chutes into the coal preparation plants, and that used to result in great clouds of dust covering the whole plant, particularly the screens where the coal was sifted by mechanical shakers. Men worked at those screens removing the dirt from the coal and were subjected to enormous amounts of dust.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/7">As you well know, Mr. Cummings, the situation was recognised in the 1974 pneumoconiosis agreement, which accepted responsibility for surface workers, and there are records of men who worked only on the surface contracting pneumoconiosis. The evidence is clear that some men working in dusty areas on the surface would contract COPD. The evidence given by the claimants' group of solicitors to the Trade and Industry Committee last year indicated that the number of people affected was between 3,500 and 5,000, which is a comparatively small number next to the enormous amount of claims registered for underground workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/8">I ask the Minister to consider bringing those 3,500 to 5,000 men into the scheme. As I suggested in our last debate, he could do that in four ways. However, in urging him to consider that, I remind him that those men could be included in a scheme without that being related to the present litigious scheme, which is based on the court case and overseen by judges from time to time. Under the current scheme, claims are registered through solicitors at a cost that the Minister may well want to avoid. If he does, there is a way of introducing a no-fault liability scheme for COPD sufferers&mdash;former miners on the colliery surface. It could be done in a way that is similar to the pneumoconiosis scheme, whereby the Department for Work and Pensions scheme becomes the basis in relation to the diagnosis, and based on that diagnosis a scheme could be drawn up related to a man's degree of disability at the age of onset. The package could be composed of the weekly payment of industrial injuries disablement benefit together with a lump sum. Such a measure would address the injustice and bring some equity to the current system of unfairness.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/9">I urge the Minister to examine the problem, to include surface workers in the scheme, which could be done without enormous cost, and to end the injustice and inequality. It is now up to him.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.0/1">It is a great pleasure to take part in a debate that you are in control of, Mr Cummings. It is probably 20 years since I was last in that situation, but it is good to be back with you.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is important for the people I represent and for the north-east in general. Like others in this room, I worked for a long time&mdash;20 years&mdash;in the coal industry. I mainly worked underground, but I spent a large part of my apprenticeship working on the surface, particularly in coal preparation plants.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/3">A number of points need to be stressed about the real conditions in those workplaces, the first of which concerns the length of shifts. Many surface workers who had long experience of working in the coal industry had to work shifts lasting eight hours and 35 minutes. Over time, that was reduced to eight hours and 20 minutes and finally to eight hours. Whatever the length of shift, though, they were at the workplace and had only a 20-minute break from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/4">A comparison can be made with the men who worked underground, who had a seven and a quarter hour shift. Given that many worked long distances underground, they may have been at their actual place of work for little more than five and a half hours a day. The length of exposure to dust was much greater for people who worked at the surface than for those working underground.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/5">Most coal preparation plants worked continuously throughout <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the week and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> mentioned, at the weekend, too. That led to a major demand for men to work weekends to maintain, repair and replace the machinery; I might add that many men had to work weekends to earn a living wage because of the ridiculously low wages paid in the coal industry in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/6">While no dust was being produced as part of the process, mountains of it were blown into the air as a result of stripping out worn-out, broken-down machinery that needed replacing, repairing or maintaining. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham said, his constituents&mdash;blacksmiths and other craftsmen&mdash;were exposed to massive amounts of coal dust.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/7">Airborne dust is a real killer, a fact that has been recognised for years. Underground, men are totally exposed when the coal is cut as part of the production process and as it is being moved out of the pit to the surface. There seems to be a suggestion that the dust produced at the pick point is different from the dust that lies at the surface. That is nonsense: dust is dust. It is not a living thing; it is inert. It clogs people's lungs and airways, whether they are exposed to it underground or on the surface. It makes no difference whether people are half a mile underground operating a coal-cutting machine or 200 ft up on top of a 5,000 tonne coal bunker on the surface.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/8">Most coal preparation plants had a multitude of transfer points where the dust would be blown around as coal was dropped from one conveyer on to another. As has been said, coal crushers exacerbated that, as did screens, whereby coal was moved through various holes to grade it into difference sizes and once again the dust was moved around.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/9">Points have been made about lack of ventilation and good dust suppression. When coal is cut it produces dust, which is effectively sucked away from the pick point as part and parcel of the process to reduce dangerous gases in the coal mine. That led to the dust being moved away quickly to avoid the men operating the machines being directly exposed to it. The dust was still dangerous, still in the air and still affecting people in its path, but at least it was moving. In coal preparation plants, there were few, if any, real ventilation processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> mentioned what is happening at Harworth colliery, which is obviously one of the few left. People might finally have realised that there is a need to look after people a bit better than they did in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/11">In my experience, ventilation was almost unheard of in coal preparation plants, and the dust suppression equipment was little use, if any. There was no escape from dust. As we tried to do underground, we used dust suppression methods, but they were never anywhere near as good as we had hoped. They could not have been; it is impossible to keep dust totally under control. It was clear that the dust affected the people who worked in coal preparation plants: the many thousands of people dying a horrible, savage death, living out their lives wondering whether their next breath would be their last, and sometimes hoping that it would.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/12">One reason why the case and the compensation scheme were not pursued in 2000 was that there was not enough evidence. One of the main reasons for that was that the records that should have been kept by the National Coal Board, British Coal and the coal owners did not exist. We are saying that we could not compensate the men because the people responsible for taking care of them did not keep adequate records. If that is not negligence, what is?</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/13">A number of comments have been made during the past few years about a compensation culture developing in this country. I have personally, and collectively, as a trade union representative, been involved in claiming millions of pounds in compensation for working men and women in various industries and public services. I could wish for nothing better than never to have to do that again. I wish I had never had to do it in the first place, but I did. I may have to do it again, because people are not treated properly at work and because employers exploit workers and do not look after people properly. It is this Government's responsibility to put the situation right. I praise them&mdash;this has been said before&mdash;for the work they have done in the past decade to redress some of the problems. We must accept that the scandal can go on no longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/14">My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham mentioned what happened in 2000. In that year, a minute was laid in this House that effectively said that we would wait 14 days and, if nobody complained, the compensation scheme would be in place. He might not be aware that seven days after it was laid the Department of Trade and Industry itself changed the rules. Some people say that a week is a long time in politics. That was a long time in politics, and it was a bad week for working people in this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.215.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1470" speakername="Wayne David" colnum="215"  time="011:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h02.htm#60207h02_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.215.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing this important debate. Like him, I recognise that great progress has been made and commend the Government on the fact that some &pound;1.7 billion has so far been paid out in COPD payments alone. I am also pleased that &pound;35.4 million has been paid out in my constituency. That unquestionably represents great progress, but, as other hon. Members have said, there is still one huge injustice: the situation of surface workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/2">I would like to cite two examples of blatant injustices. The first concerns a 95-year-old widow, Mrs. Baker, who lives in the town of Ystrad Mynach in my constituency. Her late husband worked on the screens. As we have heard, working on the screens for a number of years was particularly detrimental to health. He died because of dust&mdash;of that, there is no doubt. In fact, his death certificate states:</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Cardio respiratory failure due to . . . coal workers pneumoconiosis, chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Death due to industrial disease&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/4">However, because he worked on the surface&mdash;on the screens&mdash;his widow is not entitled, as things stand, to a single penny. By any normal evaluation, that is blatantly unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/5">Another example is the case of Mr. Victor Hawkins, also a constituent, who lives in Abertridwr near Caerphilly. He spent all his time at the Windsor colliery in Abertridwr as a surface worker. He retired to find an alternative occupation in 1997, but he spent 23 years, from the time the scheme became operable in 1954 until 1977, on the surface working on the screens. He should be compensated for that period. In his statement of claim, he explained clearly what his experience had been:</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Conditions at the screens were appalling. It was cold in the winter, hot in the summer and incredibly dusty throughout the year. In the summer, you could see the dust in the air rising above the building, escaping from the open ends.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/7" class="indent">Underground workers used to comment on the extraordinary amount of dust escaping from the building, as they crossed the bridge coming off their shift.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/8" class="indent">Occasionally, when we were short-staffed, some underground workers were directed to work at the screens. I can remember many occasions when they walked off because they simply would not put up with the dusty conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/9" class="indent">I have talked to many underground workers over the years, and with the exception of those who worked at the coalface, it is generally accepted, that working in the screens was far worse for dust than working underground.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/10" class="indent">Working at the screens, it took no time at all for you to be covered thickly in dust, and for your face to be black.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.216.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that a double injustice has been done to some surface workers? I have come across some who suffered severe industrial injuries down the pits and could not work there any longer. They were transferred to other jobs such as the screen. Not only were they crippled in the mine through accidents but their health was ruined when they went on to jobs such as the one that he just described.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. All of us from mining constituencies can cite such examples. That was normally done&mdash;it was common practice&mdash;and it reinforces the argument still further.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/2">I go back to the case of Mr. Victor Hawkins of Abertridwr. Not surprisingly, his medical assessment process test, which I have a copy of, was conclusive. It records his total respiratory disability at 20 per cent., and his total disability owing to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at 10 per cent. The results are clear, and the only way he could have contracted that kind of disability, and that kind of reduction in his lung capacity, was through coal dust, yet he worked exclusively on the surface on the screens. It is a straightforward, black and white situation, but Mr. Hawkins is not entitled to anything because of the way that the scheme has been drawn up and interpreted.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/3">Mr Hawkins's solicitor took his case forward as one of the test cases with Thompsons, but, as we heard today, it collapsed. It was withdrawn by the solicitor. The reason was given to Mr. Hawkins in a letter from Thompsons:</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The main difficulty in succeeding in such claims is that the medical experts advice us that the dust level readings which are available would not be sufficient to cause any disability.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/5">Mr. Hawkins's case proves that that is nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/6">I recognise that we must rely on evidence. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> said, technically, there may not be evidence. I would ask the Government, for goodness' sake, whether evidence cannot be gathered from other sources&mdash;from other countries perhaps, not just the British situation. However, if that is also difficult, one thing that the Government clearly could do is make an ex gratia payment to the mine workers who have been affected in this way. They could make a one-off payment that recognises, without any question whatsoever, the moral case, and that also recognises that we are discussing a relatively small number of mine workers&mdash;no more than 5,000. That would be an effective way to recognise the moral position of those individuals, and, at the same time, given that the success of the scheme as a whole is undoubted, it would be a feather in the Government's cap to recognise the need to give a special one-off payment to the surface workers, as we come to the end of the compensation scheme. I sincerely hope that the Government will consider doing precisely that.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.0/1">This has been an informative, persuasive debate. I add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">my congratulations to the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his persistence. He has had a long-standing commitment to addressing compensation for surface workers who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/2">We heard powerful speeches from many Members who represent coal-mining constituencies. We heard many tragic stories of human suffering. Thousands of miners and former miners, and their families, have been compensated for having health ruined because of exposure to coal dust, and I give the Government credit for the scheme. Of course, no amount of compensation can restore the health of those men, or make up for the heartache that many of their families went through, in many cases watching them die slowly and painfully. Nevertheless, as well as going some way to help overcome the problems of disability, compensation is a recognition of the suffering that the miners endured during their employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/3">Despite prolonged pressure from monitoring groups and claimants' representatives, the Department of Trade and Industry has consistently refused to accept claims from workers whose duties were performed completely above ground, or who spent less than five years working underground. As I understand it, the Government appear to justify that rejection on the grounds that the National Coal Board and British Coal did not monitor dust levels on the surface because they were not required to do so by the legislation in force at the time. However, plenty of evidence is available that dust levels on the surface could be high. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> gave a graphic description of what the situation was like for many surface workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/4">It seems that so far the evidence has not been enough to convince the Government. The Trade and Industry Committee was convinced in its investigation last year. It estimated that 3,500 to 5,000 former surface workers have been affected by exposure to coal dust and recommended that they should be included in the scheme, but group litigation on their behalf has been ruled out because the DTI refused to waive its legal costs if it won in court, thereby exposing litigants to being sued for significant costs. The Government have repeatedly suggested that individuals could take legal action on their own behalf, but the same problems would arise as with the group case. The risk of having to pay their own costs if they lose is, clearly, too great for elderly people on low incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/5">Hundreds of thousands of miners worked underground and many suffered appalling consequences to their health. The Government are right to compensate them. However, given the half million registered with the compensation scheme, it seems unfair to reject the claims of a small number&mdash;less than 5,000&mdash;on the grounds, apparently, that their employer did not keep adequate records.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/6">The Government's refusal is also strange because it is inconsistent with the pneumoconiosis scheme, which does cover surface workers. I also find it puzzling&mdash;this has been referred to earlier&mdash;that in a minute placed before Parliament in July 2000, the DTI seemed to accept that surface workers had a case. The document was quoted from earlier, but I shall give some quotes from it for emphasis. Paragraph 5 states that</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/7" class="indent">&quot;exposure to coal dust on the surface leads to the same lung disease as dust underground&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/8">Later, the minute states that</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/9" class="indent">&quot;men who have only worked on the surface will be able to put in a claim&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/10">As the hon. Member for North Durham said, that minute was laid before Parliament and has never been withdrawn. The DTI reached that decision in 2000, and it is puzzling that it changed its mind. Indeed, it did so only six days later in a document that it published. However, the minute has never been withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/11">As many hon. Members have said, surface workers breathe in the same coal dust as underground workers, and many suffer exactly the same illness&mdash;surely, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1485" name="Adam Price">there is a connection. The hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price)</phrase> told us of the American study that seemed to prove that surface workers suffered exactly the same illness from exactly the same causes as workers who went underground. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">The hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> made an important point when he said that miners who had worked on the surface had had their claims accepted. The DTI apparently did not realise that they had worked only on the surface, and the available evidence showed that they were suffering from exactly the same illness, so they were awarded compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/12">One possible way of resolving the situation would be for the Government to withdraw their threat to recover their legal costs by suing claimants who take their case to court. If the Government were willing to waive that right, such claims could be settled by an impartial court.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/13">In conclusion, many surface workers and underground workers are suffering greatly in their later years. Today and in previous debates, hon. Members have made a powerful case for including surface workers in the compensation scheme, and I look forward to the Minister addressing those issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the way in which he introduced it. It has been a moving debate, which has shown the House at its best&mdash;dealing with a serious issue in a serious and constructive way and trying to move matters forward. It has also clearly shown the human dimension. Hon. Members on both sides of the room have told of how constituents have been affected and of how their later years have been made years of considerable pain and discomfort. For those of us who do not represent coal-mining constituencies, that was extremely moving. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">The hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase> gave us a clear exposition of how activities carried out on the surface create a much higher level of dust than one might initially think. All that has led to an extremely thoughtful debate, and although <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> also spoke about vibration white finger, he will understand why the bulk of the debate has focused more on dust inhalation.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.0/2">The core of the case rests on the conflicting views about whether there is evidence to support compensation claims. The claimants' solicitors group says that the dust reaches &quot;quite high levels&quot; in coal preparation plants, but the DTI medical advice, from the Institute of Occupational Medicine, says that that the levels are not high enough to cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, even if people are exposed to dust over the whole of their working lives. We need medical advice and input, and I would be grateful if the Minister could make it clear that COPD is not an illness, but a broad range of illnesses. It was said earlier that people were suffering from the same disease, but COPD covers a broad range of illnesses from bronchitis at one end through to chronic emphysema at the other. We need clarity about the severity of COPD that people are suffering.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.0/3">Much has been made of the fact that the records from the time when the National Coal Board operated the mines are not available. Is that because records simply were not kept or because the records have been lost or perhaps destroyed over the years? Perhaps the Minister can clarify that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.219.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" speakername="David Anderson" colnum="219"  time="012:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h02.htm#60207h02_spnew14">
	<p pid="a.219.0/1">The trouble was that there were no records because no work was done on the issue. Ventilation and dust suppression were not monitored in the way that they should have been.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.219.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" speakername="Charles Hendry" colnum="219"  time="012:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h02.htm#60207h02_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.219.1/1">That indicates that this was not seen as such a problem at the time; there was not as much understanding of the consequences of dust inhalation. As the hon. Member for Bassetlaw made clear, subsequent changes, such as bans and health testing, demonstrate that there is now a much greater recognition of the risks. That shows that not enough was being done historically to address those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/2">Given that there is clearly not enough historical evidence from this country, can the Minister not commission more evidence from overseas? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1485" name="Adam Price">The hon. Member for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price)</phrase> gave a clear exposition of what has been happening in America and talked of the loss of forced expiratory volume. There is clearly substantial evidence in other parts of the world, and we can draw on it to identify exactly the longer-term health consequences for those who work on the surface. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is self-evident that some people will be more susceptible to illness than others as a result of dust inhalation. We should also take on board his point about people with a greater susceptibility to illness being transferred from working below ground to working above the surface. We cannot, therefore, make a simple black and white contrast between those who worked underground and those who worked on the surface; in many cases, people worked underground for some years and on the surface for some years.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/3">Among the other issues that we need to consider is the suggestion that cases should be pursued through the courts so that we can recognise the rights and wrongs. We must, however, understand the prohibitive expense that that would involve. One problem of the legal system in this country is that it is accessible to those who have a lot of money and to those who have no money, but a tremendous number of people in the middle simply cannot afford to use it because they would be liable for their own costs. If they did get a significant award at the end, a large chunk would be taken away to pay for legal costs. We live in the real world, not in a John Grisham world or the Judge John Deed world on television, where the small guy can take on the big multinational corporations and win. We need to recognise that telling somebody who is perhaps elderly and extremely unwell, &quot;You're going to be taking on the Government in a legal case for the next few years of your life and it will probably go to appeal if you win,&quot; will cause such fear that they will back away before they have even started. Will the Minister clarify, however, whether people who do decide to go down that route will be eligible for legal aid? That comes back to the fact that this is not a black and white issue. There are people who worked part of the time underground and part of the time on the surface. Every single case would have to be assessed, and it would be much more difficult to establish the rules of precedent. People considering going down the legal route therefore face a significant deterrent.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/4">We also need a greater understanding of how many people will be affected. The claimants' solicitors group has suggested that somewhere between 3,500 and 5,000 people might be eligible. Does the Minister agree that that is the likely number? What proportion of the number of people who have worked on the surface in the mining industry does that represent? If 5,000 people&mdash;the highest figure&mdash;were found to be eligible, what would be the cost of compensation? My understanding of the compensation scheme as it has operated so far is that compensation works out at an average of about &pound;10,000 per claimant. If we extrapolate from that and multiply 5,000 people by &pound;10,000, we get a figure of &pound;50 million. Does the Minister accept that figure or does he have a different one? It is important that we should have an understanding of the sums involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/5">Several hon. Members have referred to the DTI minute, and it is at the core of the issue. What is the status of that minute? If it is still on the table, does the Minister agree with its contents? How does he plan to take forward what it says?</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/6">Finally, I hope that the issue can be quickly resolved once and for all. Exciting opportunities are opening up for the mining industry in this country. Clean coal offers a new future in a way that would have been unimaginable a few years ago.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has raised an important point. As we move into the energy review, those considering the coal mining industry will probably be sceptical about coal playing a part when they see a compensation scheme embracing more than 500,000 people. However, that has occurred because of British Coal's negligence, in failing to ensure that dust suppression technology kept pace with cutting technology. The result was enormous amounts of dust, with the judge distinguishing between litigious and non-litigious dust. The situation has changed and mining today is somewhat different: the major cutting machines are the same, but dust suppression equipment is very much different. The future of the coal mining industry and those who have worked in it would therefore also be rather different.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman as that is exactly the point that I sought to make. If, as part of the energy review, we want to say that coal potentially has an exciting future in modern electricity generation, we must be able to say that those historical issues need to be consigned to the past, as we look to a modern industry operating in a modern way.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.0/2">The problem has continued for a long time. We have had an impassioned debate, with a lot constructive ideas and questions, to which I am sure we are keen to hear the Minister respond.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.1/1">I agree that this has been an important debate. I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase>. He and others set this still controversial matter against the fact that we have the largest scheme of its kind to compensate former coal miners and their relatives anywhere in the world. It is forecast eventually to pay out some &pound;4 billion, and its total costs will be more than &pound;5 billion. I listened to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase>, but I am proud of the fact that this Government introduced that scheme, not a former Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/2">Having said that, I recognise the nature of the controversy. I should like, albeit briefly, to review the issues presented and to suggest a way forward, although I should be happy to discuss that suggestion with colleagues informally after the debate. At the heart of the issue is whether British Coal&mdash;and now the Department&mdash;had liability for disability suffered by surface workers from exposure to dust. We have heard again this morning that the Department set out in a minute to Parliament that we would accept liability and seek to negotiate a way of dealing with surface workers within the major lung disease scheme. I know that the minute is controversial, but I am more concerned to move forward. The minute was clear that the extent of the liability and the terms of access to the lung disease scheme were to be negotiated&mdash;my hon. Friend quoted chapter and verse, but I refer to paragraph 6 of the now famous minute.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/3">The minute was therefore not an open-ended admission of blanket liability&mdash;an automatic entry to the lung disease scheme for such workers&mdash;but the start of a process of negotiation. It accepted that British Coal did not fully meet its responsibilities towards certain categories of workers in dusty jobs on the surface, but left open the question of which categories of workers were to be included and the level of evidence that would necessary for a successful claim in individual cases. Indeed, it states that agreement would be needed on such issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.0/1">I agree that the minute did not give an open-ended commitment, but it did accept liability. However, the situation now is that the Department do not accept any liability for such workers.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.222.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" colnum="222"  time="012:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h02.htm#60207h02_spnew19">
	<p pid="a.222.1/1">Let me continue. I am concerned that there is a feeling that the Department declined to negotiate on compensation for surface-only workers. The chain of events shows that the Department indeed sought a deal for surface-only workers on the basis of the minute to Parliament of July 2000, albeit taking into account the medical advice that we had received. We negotiated with the claimants' solicitors over several months and agreed how mixed workers, who had worked underground and on the surface&mdash;we have rightly heard about them today&mdash;would be covered in the lung disease scheme. Since then, 84,000 mixed workers have received compensation under the scheme of around &pound;520 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/2">The Department also made an offer to surface-only workers, as I set out in the October debate. However, the solicitors were not able to accept liability on that basis. They considered that every surface worker in dusty jobs should have the right to full medical assessment and the higher levels of compensation for COPD, and instead sought further studies. The House was informed of that in an answer to a parliamentary question in March 2001. Those further studies confirmed the Department's view that incidence of COPD disability was likely to be very small.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/3">The minute was therefore the start of a process, not the end of one. In any event, it was overtaken in 2003 when the claimants group decided to start group litigation to test the issue in the courts. That continued to be the position until the end of 2004, when the claimants announced that they were dropping the litigation for what they described as financial reasons. They have since made it clear that they cannot sustain a legal case and have argued instead that the Government should allow surface workers into the full lung disease scheme on &quot;political and moral&quot; grounds, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1470" name="Wayne David">my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David)</phrase> mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/4">Our difficulty is that it is not easy for the Government to pay out compensation on &quot;political and moral&quot; grounds without any clear liability. Hon. Members would surely accept that there must be thousands and thousands of former workers in many different industries in this country who could argue a similar case on moral grounds, but where there is no evidence. Indeed, I often meet people in my constituency who have never been able to prove anything in court&mdash;they have probably never even been near a court&mdash;but who have real grievances on moral grounds about former occupations that, in different ways, have affected their health.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.2/1">On that issue, I refer the Minister to the working situation of many of the people who transferred from underground to the surface. He mentioned the figure of 84,000 men who had worked underground for five years or more, transferred to the surface, contracted COPD and were paid compensation. Many of those 84,000 will have worked in the large airways underground, where they were not exposed to large amounts of dust, but will then have been transferred to the surface, where they were exposed to dust and contracted COPD. However, someone who worked entirely on the surface, without any underground work, cannot make a claim. That is the anomaly and it must be corrected.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.223.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" colnum="223"  time="012:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h02.htm#60207h02_spnew21">
	<p pid="a.223.0/1">Let us come on to the suggestion that such workers cannot make the claim, because I would contend that they can. I do not doubt for a minute what I have heard today about the experience of dusty conditions among those involved in surface working. However, we are not talking about visible dust; we are talking about the invisible, respirable dust that causes COPD. I have listened to the discussion today about evidence. The Department's medical evidence&mdash;which is not challenged by the experts on the other side and is from the dust readings by the independent Institute of Occupational Medicine, which provided evidence in the main trial&mdash;is that levels of dust would be very unlikely to lead to COPD. We have heard about the inadequacy of data and research, and I know that there were not full series of dust readings on the surface at all pits. However, the readings that we have are sufficient to support that conclusion. Also, as offered by a former Minister, the solicitors were allowed access to the British Coal archives to seek out evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/2">The position now is that the solicitors informed the court that they were not able to pursue litigation. The Deputy Leader of the House, then the Minister involved, looked at further material that they supplied last March, and I wrote to them in May to confirm that there was nothing new there that could cause the Department to change its mind.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.2/1">I should have to write to the hon. Gentleman with chapter and verse on the specific time and date.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/2">We do not deny all liability. Those listening to this debate might be confused about that. I have listened with great care and some concern to colleagues' testimony, but I cannot comment on individual cases. We are unable to deal with compensation on a schemed approach within the framework of the current scheme. We have, however, made it very clear that anybody can bring a common law claim for disability caused by surface work. We understand that some of the denied cases are likely to be put forward on that basis, although none has yet been received.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/3">Following the last debate, I have considered all the issues. We have to move forward. The Government cannot pay out compensation, as I have argued, on political and moral grounds, and cannot revisit the negotiations that have taken place over a long period. Let me repeat that we are not denying liability; we are just saying that compensation cannot be handled within the lung disease scheme which has, anyway, moved on since the original negotiations with the introduction of the fast-track scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/4">The clear way forward is for those who feel that they have a good case to receive compensation now to put in claims on the usual common law basis. The Department will monitor how the cases that it receives are progressed, and their outcomes. We will address any generic issues that arise that affect how the cases might be handled. If that experience leads to a notion of a streamlined process, I will consider it. I undertake to report back to the House, when a reasonable number of cases has been dealt with, on the issues coming from them and the lessons that we take from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/5">On the payment issue, none of us wants the miner or miner's widow to bear the cost should they lose, or to have to face the stresses of that. Some say that the Government should pay. I have another suggestion; it relates to some recent controversies on the coal health scheme. More than &pound;1 billion of the &pound;5 billion-plus has gone to solicitors in the coal health scheme. The solicitors withdrew from group litigation, apparently for financial reasons, but we know of firms of solicitors that have made a great deal of money from the coal schemes. For examples, Hugh James has received &pound;68 million, Thompsons &pound;92 million, Beresfords &pound;65 million and Raleys &pound;56 million. Also, some of the unions have received contributions to their funds from the compensation already paid out, on the understanding that the money was to be used to finance further injury claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/6">With such huge amounts of money being paid through the scheme to solicitors and the unions having had extra money, surely it is possible for those bodies&mdash;for moral and political reasons, if nothing else&mdash;to support individual cases so that the individual claimants are not put at financial risk. I do not believe that the cost should be borne by the general taxpayer. The solicitors and, perhaps, the unions&mdash;after all, what is the purpose of a trade union?&mdash;have a moral duty to do so. When we assess experience, I shall look carefully to see whether a more streamlined process might be the way forward for the many people involved.</p>

	Ambulance Coverage (Forest of Dean)

	<p pid="a.225.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate on the adequacy of ambulance coverage, which is an important issue in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/2">The matter was first raised with me last summer, not long after I was elected, following an incident in the town of Newent. It was drawn to my attention that there was insufficient ambulance coverage. Normally one ambulance and crew was on duty, and sometimes not even that. I took the matter up with Gloucestershire Ambulance Service NHS trust, which confirmed that at times&mdash;specifically, <phrase class="date" code="">Sunday 17 July</phrase>&mdash;only a single responder was on duty at one ambulance station. The decision was taken to team up the member of staff from Newent with the person in Staverton, and the coverage for part of my constituency was therefore provided from Gloucester.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/3">The ambulance trust confirmed in its letter that it used a matrix system, taking historical data as a basis for placing vehicles in the area from which the next call was expected to come while preserving geographical cover. I contend that it might well do the former, but it does not adequately do the latter. It does not preserve geographical cover across the county. One hint of the problems associated with its management information systems was its confirmation that it uses a paper-based system to manage the process, whereas more complex, but more efficient, computer systems are available. To be fair, it also confirmed that the strategic health authority had awarded it &pound;500,000 to invest in the latest technology, which would have more effective facilities for moving ambulances around.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/4">Following that, in January, I received a letter from a concerned paramedic somewhere in the county, expressing the concerns of many paramedics about the matrix system for allocating ambulances. It was clear that resources were being diverted from the Forest of Dean and other rural areas, primarily to cover Gloucester and Cheltenham. I wrote to Philip Selwood, chief executive of the ambulance trust, enclosing a copy of the paramedic's letter, and asked him to comment on some of the areas of concern. I said that it appeared from the letter that the matrix system was not appropriate or that the trust did not have the resources to cover the county properly. I also asked him to comment on how the proposed merger between the ambulance service trusts of Gloucestershire, Avon and Wiltshire would affect emergency coverage.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/5">Mr Selwood comprehensively answered my points in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-20">20 January</phrase>. However, his answers made the situation appear worse rather than better. He confirmed that the trust used a matrix system, saying that it was in place in order to provide optimum cover throughout the county. However, he confirmed that Gloucester and Cheltenham had top place on the matrix, so that they were covered, rather than lower call-volume areas. I asked whether he could say how often my constituency was left without adequate ambulance cover. The situation was a problem, but even more worrying from my point of view was the fact that he was not able to answer that question because the technology and reporting systems were not in place to provide that level of information.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/6">That was worrying in two ways. First, it is always worrying when large organisations that do not have adequate management information to make key decisions about the allocation of resources, make such decisions anyway. That is a concern in the 21st century. Secondly, the matrix system, by its nature, depends on the ability accurately to forecast where emergency calls are likely to arise and therefore where to locate the ambulances across the county. If the trust's management information systems are so poor that Mr. Selwood cannot even tell me how often my constituency is left without adequate ambulance cover, I am not sure how they can operate such a system with any confidence that it will locate ambulances where they are likely to be needed in most cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/7">Mr. Selwood told me that the project to use &pound;500,000 from the strategic health authority to replace the computer-aided dispatch and management information systems and to place mobile data terminals in the accident and emergency vehicles was scheduled for completion in November year. He confirmed that the trust would then have an enhanced reporting system capable of meeting my requests for information.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/8">The letter that I received from the paramedic suggested that if Cheltenham and Gloucester ambulances were busy, vehicles would be pulled in from other areas of the county, which would leave some areas with no ambulances to cover them. Mr. Selwood stated in his letter:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I can confirm that this is the basis of our operating regime; once a vehicle leaves a matrix point that is high in the priority order then an ambulance is moved into the area from an area that is less likely to receive a call. This makes best use of our limited resources.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/10">To be fair, Mr. Selwood also said that the trust has recently introduced an urban response scheme in Gloucester and Cheltenham, with four vehicles based in those city areas, the purpose of which is to reduce the number of occasions when vehicles would have to be moved from rural areas into the urban areas of the county. That has just been done&mdash;or is still in the process of being done&mdash;so I have nothing to show whether it has made any difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/11">The letter from the paramedic also referred to a fatal road traffic collision in the Forest of Dean, in which one person died and six others were injured, treated and taken to hospital. The trust did a good job in one sense. The first vehicle on the scene came from the Cinderford ambulance station and was there within 13 minutes. However, the accident required a further three vehicles, which had to be dispatched from Gloucester and Cheltenham. I am still waiting for the reply about how long those ambulances took, but given the geography involved they would have taken between 30 and 45 minutes to attend the scene.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/12">I would be grateful if the Minister commented on the subject of community responders, where there appears to be a bit of confusion. The paramedic who wrote to me said that ambulance management will argue that community responders provide better patient care, but that they simply give management an excuse to pull ambulances into Gloucester and Cheltenham by having someone who is willing to make the first response in an outlying area. I specifically asked the ambulance trust to comment on that, and Mr. Selwood said:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/13" class="indent">&quot;These schemes are an addition to the normal accident and emergency service we provide not to replace crews or vehicles.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/14">He went on to say that he could confirm that</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/15" class="indent">&quot;the government set standard is to provide an appropriate response to patients within 8 minutes for 75 per cent. of all occasions; this response can be a trained Community Responder with a defibrillator.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/16">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/17" class="indent">&quot;If a responder is sent then this must be backed up by an ambulance within 19 minutes from the time of the initial call for 95 per cent. of all occasions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/18">That seems to contradict what he said.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/19">Community responders mean that the ambulance trust can have the community responder respond in the first instance. The trust then has 19 minutes, rather than eight, in which to supply an ambulance. There is a great temptation for an ambulance trust to put community responders in place, not in addition to, but instead of a properly resourced ambulance network for accident and emergency. I would be grateful if the Minister commented on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/20">Mr. Selwood also said that the ambulance trust is in the process of reviewing its response matrix to make best possible use of the vehicles available. He said that they are seeing a year-on-year increase in activity of 8 to 10 per cent., which is putting a strain on their resources, and that there are times when they would benefit from additional resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/21">The final point in the letter was whether merging the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire ambulance trusts would improve or reduce the service in my constituency. Mr. Selwood said:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/22" class="indent">&quot;The reconfiguration of ambulance services in Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire will provide the Trust with a greater capacity to deliver this new type of service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/23">That new type of service refers to the Government's agenda to recognise that only 10 per cent. of 999 calls are for cases that are truly life-threatening and to help the trusts to deal with those more adequately and to move away from becoming a transport service. Given the level of service at the moment, there is a great deal of scepticism in my constituency about whether that will be successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/24">A number of concerns remain, subsequent to that letter, as the Minister can tell. I wrote to Mr. Selwood again and asked whether, despite the fact that his management information systems do not allow him to confirm exactly how often my constituency is left without adequate ambulance cover, he could give me some idea of that, even if only approximate. As part of the problem is the difference between urban and rural areas and the fact that the more densely populated areas have higher levels of ambulance cover, I have also asked him to comment on whether now that the large urban conurbations of Swindon and Bristol will be included in the new tri-trust area the pressure on rural areas will be exacerbated. Mr. Selwood has unfortunately been away, although I am due to meet him this coming Friday. I hope that I will get the answers to my questions then.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/25">I want the Minister to cover some specific questions. First, can she justify the matrix system used by the ambulance trust? It seems to leave certain areas of the county, particularly rural areas such as my constituency, without proper cover and may put lives at risk. Secondly, how will the merger of the Gloucester trust with the Avon and Wiltshire trusts affect the Forest of Dean? We are on the edge of the county, next to the boundaries with Wales and Herefordshire, so are we particularly likely to lose out, as a number of my constituents suspect?</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/26">I have already drawn attention to the potential effect, linked with the merger, of the incorporation of Swindon and Bristol. If the three ambulance trusts, when merged, have a single method of prioritising cover and a single matrix system, which includes those two extra-large urban areas, will my constituency effectively be left out on a limb with marginal ambulance cover, and will we have to rely on ambulances being sent great distances from those urban areas to respond in emergencies?</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/27">The chief executive alluded to one further area that my constituents find it difficult to understand. I am happy to acknowledge that taxpayers are paying a great deal more tax, which is going into the national health service. If we look at the figures at a national level&mdash;I would be grateful if the Minister told me whether the same is true in my constituency&mdash;there are more ambulance staff and more resources. My constituents find it difficult to understand that, given that resources on the ground seem so patchy. That is one of the central questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/28">Finally, my constituents pay their fair share in tax for the national health service. They deserve proper ambulance coverage and accident and emergency coverage; they deserve the same as in other parts of our county and our country. They do not seem to be getting it, and I would be grateful if the Minister told us what she and the Government plan to do to put the situation right.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.228.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="228"  time="012:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h03.htm#60207h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.228.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> on securing the debate on ambulance coverage in his constituency. It is a matter of concern to him and his constituents. My constituency of Doncaster is not the same as the Forest of Dean&mdash;it is a former mining area&mdash;but the South Yorkshire ambulance service has issues in common with his, both in the urbanised areas of Sheffield and the surrounding rural areas of Sheffield, Barnsley and Doncaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/2">Getting a balance of service in the servicing of rural, semi-rural and urban communities is important. That is one of the reasons why, as I have seen as a constituency MP, the ambulance service has addressed these issues in more recent times by finding better ways of operating, such as parking ambulances in different areas and sharing services with fire stations and others in order to create a service fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/3">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that it is unfortunate that a large number of people still dial 999 in non-threatening situations. In some cases, there are hoaxes; I know this because a few years back, when I was first elected, I spent some time in the control room listening to calls as they came in. There are other reasons for such calls: sometimes people feel that they quickest way they can see someone is to ring 999 and get an ambulance to take them to accident and emergency.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/4">Considerable work is taking place in relation to out-of-hours services and walk-in centres, but also with people responding who can deal with treatment at location. The ambulance service is looking at such different methods around the country and considering its partnership with other health service providers to determine how it can meet needs in the right way.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/5">About 6 million people call 999 each year, and ambulance trusts are the first and most important contact for many people ringing that service, especially if their illness or accident requires it. The range of care provided has been expanded, providing an emergency response but also urgent advice or treatments for patients who are less ill, and care for those whose cannot easily travel to access health care services. The ambulance service has grown in recent times to find different ways of meeting the needs that only their specialist service can provide. I pay tribute to all staff in the hon. Gentleman's area, and throughout the country, who continue to help us to deliver a very good health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/6">Ministers recently approved the merger of three small ambulance trusts to form one trust serving the whole of Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. The new trust should be established from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>, and the three existing trusts&mdash;Avon ambulance NHS trust, Gloucestershire ambulance NHS trust and Wiltshire ambulance NHS trust&mdash;will be dissolved. As part of that process, the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority has been reviewing the configuration of ambulance trusts since January 2005, against a background of weak performance in relation to response targets from all three trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/7">The hon. Gentleman's points are perfectly legitimate, and were part of the reason why it was felt that merging the trusts would help in several different ways. The hon. Gentleman gave an example about management systems for collecting data and asked whether IT systems are being put to the best possible use. It is hoped that a bigger trust will make modernisation and reform in such areas more possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/8">A three-month consultation was undertaken between July and October 2005, ahead of national consultation on ambulance trust configurations. The main driver for merger of services in this area was poor performance by the trusts as regards achieving the category A standard, a point emphasised by the hon. Gentleman. For example, in Gloucestershire in 2004&ndash;05, the percentage of category A calls receiving a response within 8 minutes was 71.2 per cent., falling short of the 75 per cent. target. A performance improvement plan has been developed and implemented to improve response times and patient care in Gloucestershire. For example, in the Forest of Dean, community responder schemes have been developed in partnership with St. John Ambulance, with a scheme in Coleford, and a further two teams planned for Cinderford and Newent.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/9">There is clinical evidence that proves conclusively that early defibrillation and resuscitation saves more lives. We acknowledge the valuable support that community responders offer to ambulance services locally. They are trained in life support and first aid and equipped with defibrillators. The use of first responders can ensure that patients receive advanced life support as soon as possible, which we all welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/10">Although the initial emergency response may be to send a rapid response vehicle or an improved first responder, a fully equipped ambulance vehicle, able to transport a patient in a clinically safe manner, is still required to attend the incident within 14 minutes of an initial call in urban areas and 19 minutes in rural areas. It is a local matter for trusts to decide how or where they use community volunteer responders, or other schemes such as community paramedics, as well as other resources, such as traditional ambulance provision. Rapid response vehicles, or motorbikes, for example, are one way to ensure a timely response, but the most important thing is that aid gets to the person involved as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/11">There has been a review of the operational periods for the Newent, Lydney and Coleford vehicles. The Newent vehicle now operates on six nights a week, when it previously operated on three, and the Lydney vehicle now operates on six nights a week, when it previously operated on four. The Coleford vehicle now operates on seven nights a week, when it previously operated on four as well. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman and will form part of his conversation with the chief executive later this week. Those attempts have been made to ensure that there is better operational coverage by those important vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/12">The trust recently purchased eight new replacement accident and emergency vehicles, one of which will be based at Coleford, with a second vehicle at Newent, both covering the Forest of Dean area. The Lydney ambulance station also has a new patient transport service vehicle. The trust is continuing its work with colleagues in the police and fire service to examine how they can reduce deaths in the Forest of Dean area from road traffic collisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/13">The hon. Gentleman referred to a particular case and expressed concern about the time an ambulance took to arrive at the scene of a car accident, only to be followed up by three ambulances. I asked officials to check that situation, and I understand that the accident was initially reported as a category B incident, rather than category A. That may be one reason for the amount of time the first response vehicle took to arrive. Obviously, once it had arrived, an assessment of the situation could be made, which may have changed between the point at which the call came in and when the ambulance arrived. A further three ambulances were then called for. Technically, it was not necessarily the case that the ambulance exceeded its time target; it was more a question of how the accident category was reported in the first instance.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/14">A performance improvement plan has been developed, and I have outlined a few of the areas in which attempts are being made to improve the service. Action is being taken to improve capacity in Gloucestershire as a whole, including four mobile doctors to respond to category A calls, urban responders in Cheltenham and Gloucester, and emergency care practitioners handling 999 calls in the control room to reduce the need for a face-to-face response. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that that is a valuable service.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/15">It makes more sense for people in urban or rural areas, who need to get an ambulance out as soon as possible after a call is made, if someone in the control room can assess their needs and deal with them over the phone,. I understand why some people make certain calls but they are not always the most appropriate for a 999 response Unlocking some of the jams in the system is one of the ways in which we can try to manage things and ensure that people, wherever they live, get the service fit for their need in an emergency. The new ambulance trust will support those improvements to the level and type of service provided to users, while obviously looking at greater capacity and opportunities for flexibility and shared learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/16">The hon. Gentleman referred to the matrix system used to plan where resources should be used and situated. He is right. It is not new to his area; it is a long-standing system for planning where ambulances should be. It is one of the reasons why, in recent years, we have had more discussions about ambulances being out on location, rather than stuck in ambulance stations, and about resources shared with fire and police services as a means to facilitate the needs of staff, so that they are not just stuck in a lay-by eight hours a day. Part of that process has involved trying to consider the number of calls and where they come from.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/17">The system has been used historically, and it has been helpful, but I understand that work is being done to look more closely at how the matrix works. Returning to my previous point, one area that might be considered is the number of calls that come in from a particular area and how many of them really are category A calls, as opposed to calls that should have been dealt with through health provision in the community. It is worth considering that issue. If we can bring down the number of calls that result in an ambulance being wrongly sent out, that will give more room for management and service providers to think about how they will meet the needs of the more rural areas, which are more difficult to get to in because of the surrounding roads and so on. That would be helpful, and I am sure that it would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman talked about those issues with the chief executive when he meets him later this week.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/18">The national picture has an impact on the local picture. The Government's spending on ambulance services has increased from &pound;617 million in 1997 to &pound;1.2 billion in 2003&ndash;04, an increase of more than 75 per cent. It is always important that people look at what we have now. I can understand people wanting more, but it is important to reflect on the situation in the past, which might not be in their living memory, and the lack of investment then.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/19">We felt that it was right to set a standard that at least 75 per cent. of 999 calls for immediate life-threatening conditions should have an ambulance response within eight minutes. In 2001, fewer than 71 per cent. of those calls were responded to in eight minutes. Over the past two years, performance against that call standard has exceeded 75 per cent. Surveys that we have carried out with patients show that 98 per cent. are overwhelmingly satisfied with the care that they receive. That is in the face of consistently increasing demand for ambulance services. Our funding reflects our understanding of that, but we also understand that the issue is not just about funding; it is about modernising and reforming the service to ensure that it provides the right service for the right sort of need.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/20">I am pleased that there has been a demonstrable improvement in patient care, particularly in cardiac care. We are confident that, while recognising the local issues, larger trusts will deliver a better, more responsive, more efficient service, which people have a right to expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/21">Although progress has been made nationally in the ambulance service, we know that the contribution ambulance trusts could make to the wider health agenda has not been fully utilised. That is why we appointed Peter Bradley to lead a strategic review of ambulance service delivery, &quot;Taking healthcare to the patient: Transforming NHS ambulance services&quot;, which was published last June to widespread support. The review sets out a compelling vision for ambulance services and makes recommendations in five key areas: improving clinical and managerial leadership to match new models of care, improving the consistency and quality of care provision, improving efficiency and effectiveness, supporting performance improvement, and developing the work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/22">The benefits of delivering that vision will include patients receiving improved care, with potentially 1 million fewer unnecessary accident and emergency attendances; greater job satisfaction for staff as they use their additional knowledge and skills to care for patients; a more effective and efficient use of NHS resources; and improvements in self-care and health promotion.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/23">We know that patients calling 999 are a mix of those with clinically urgent needs and those who view their condition as urgent. The report makes it clear that ambulance trusts need to widen the range of services that they provide. They need to work closely with other urgent care providers so that alternatives can be found for patients who do not need an ambulance. Some of those can and should be delivered by the ambulance service, but it is clear that some should not. In taking the report forward, we are building on the excellent service already delivered and the dedication and skills that have made the service what it is today. It is important that our vision sets out a service that will deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/24">The work that has been done in the past 12 months to move to merge the three trusts is a step in the right direction. Clearly, more discussion is taking place on providing services, particularly in the rural parts of the area covered. As I said before, I understand that there is some work considering the matrix, the number of calls, their nature, and what problems that may present for operational management.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/25">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that people need a prompt and efficient ambulance service. Such a service should be based on the need of the individual. We must ensure that other calls do not get in the way of providing that prompt service to his area, my area and the rest of England.</p>

	<p pid="a.233.0/1">I am delighted to have secured the debate. It is an important topic, and I want to make the case for a wider introduction of such schemes, which have the potential to cut congestion dramatically in the rush hour. I understand that with one or two qualifications, the Government are broadly in favour of them, so the need for my powers of persuasion may be limited. Equally, I understand that local education authorities are by and large persuaded of the argument, if not the practicality in some cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/2">We have made some progress on yellow bus schemes, but we need a substantial product. I want to encourage a greater degree of urgency in how we tackle the problems that school transport presents. You, Mr. Cummings, and many hon. Members throughout the country know that constituents regularly and rightly raise with us the concern that between approximately 8.30 and 9 in the morning, some places&mdash;Wirral, South included&mdash;are no-go or, at the very least, go-slow areas. On my patch, I could name many such places. For example, Heath road, Brimstage road around Barnston primary school, Pulford road and many more become extremely congested. It happens not only in the immediate area of the schools. Each school run fills up that precious commodity&mdash;road space&mdash;and each has a knock-on and cumulative effect somewhere along the line.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/3">On Merseyside, for example, a survey found that 9 per cent. of all short car journeys were made for the school run daily, and that more than one quarter of all pupils relied on being driven to school. For some parents, dropping off children at school may require little more than a minor diversion on the way to work, but others will go substantially out of their way, and sometimes to more than one school. For many, the sole purpose of the car journey is the school run. It is an amazingly inefficient system that otherwise might be used on productive activities. I am not saying that taking kids to school is not a productive activity, but other outlets are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/4">National surveys have found that 20 per cent. of traffic on UK roads at 10 to 9 in the morning is on the school run, equating to an extra 2 million car journeys. I have no reason to think that the figure does not apply equally, if not more so, in Wirral and the rest of Merseyside. Businesses and other road users who have no choice are frustrated by gridlock. Those living near schools find what they regard as their spaces occupied. Otherwise peaceful suburban streets are choked with traffic, and the effect is a vicious circle: parents become anxious about their children walking or cycling to school alongside, on or crossing congested and busy roads; and their instinctive reaction tends to compound the problems, because they also resort to using their cars. Given the pressure on the roads during peak hours, we must count every car taken off the road as a small triumph.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/5">The evidence suggests that where yellow bus schemes have been introduced as part of a comprehensive strategy associated with the school run, there has been a dramatic impact. Figures for the first two phases of the flagship large-scale project and pilot scheme in west Yorkshire show that the average shift from car use has been more than 60 per cent., with one school showing a shift as high as 91 per cent. A primary school in Bradford reported a 30 per cent. reduction in cars outside the school gate, and of those pupils using the yellow bus, more than 60 per cent. previously travelled by car.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/6">I took those figures from a West Yorkshire passenger transport executive press release, so they come on good authority. My hon. Friend the Minister has seen the benefits of that pilot scheme at first hand. I am told that parents, teachers and pupils are positively evangelical about the scheme, and schools are clamouring to become involved all the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/7">Granted, the reorganisation needed to make the system work most effectively cannot be overestimated. The optimum effect might be achieved by staggering school opening hours. It would require a willingness from schools to work together to co-ordinate their start and finish times. Staggered opening times would cut costs and improve bus services by allowing the same number of buses to provide a service to many more pupils. Staggering would also allow pupils to access a range of school-based activities and disperse traffic on the school run from a current peak of 10 to 9 in the morning to a slightly longer but less concentrated period. It could have a temporary impact on congestion. I say temporary, because the proportion of school children driven to school grows year on year, and it would soon fill any spare capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/8">I have detected some contradictions in the approach across Departments, however. The Department for Education and Skills is encouraging local education authorities, including the authority in my constituency, to bring clusters of schools' opening hours in sync, so that students may have greater choice to study subjects that, if taught in every school, would not be sustainable. That is valid, but it does not help the problem of school transport. Other potential schemes may be able to learn much from west Yorkshire&mdash;for example, by using yellow school buses for school trips and community projects. I hope that if other providers were to make as convincing a case, they would receive the same encouragement as the pilot in Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/9">There is some ambiguity in what I earlier called the Government's qualified support. First, in written parliamentary answers and correspondence, I have received more often than not a reference to wanting not to discourage children from walking and cycling by introducing yellow bus schemes. No one would disagree with that; it is a central tenet of the Government's strategy and a sensible policy for tackling childhood obesity. Children should take more exercise in the course of their daily routine. However, there is not much danger of discouraging walking and cycling when yellow bus schemes are directed at children who are driven to school. In the United States, buses are provided for children who live more than 1 mile from the school. With such a threshold in place, there may be no reason why walking should be discouraged. In any case, dangerous roads may mean that walking is not an option.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/10">The second qualification made by the Government is that of being careful not to undermine the viability of bus services that are available to the wider public. I understand that, too. I imagine it being a factor&mdash;if no more&mdash;in rural areas, but it need not be generally applicable. In many areas, public transport during the morning peak is stretched on buses, trains and, where appropriate, trams and mass people carriers. If the object is to take traffic off the road, we must think about the best way of doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/11">The question with which we are left, but which may be not within the scope of this short debate, is what school transport framework do we want to promote. Will it be yellow school bus schemes, of which parents and children are in favour, as part of a broad strategy to tackle a range of problems, or the present mixture that pleases few and frustrates many?</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/12">My constituents' No. 1 concern above all others is antisocial behaviour, and it seems that one main benefit of yellow bus schemes is the discipline instilled in young people when they use yellow school buses. They do not need to be yellow, of course; it is the concept rather than the colour. Children travel with seat belts, have an allocated seat that they keep for every journey and have a regular driver. Those measures, modest though they may appear, can have a lasting effect on behaviour. Indeed, for some schemes, as the Minister will be aware, that aspect was the primary reason for their introduction. I think, although I cannot speak with direct authority, that that was the case in Stockport.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/13">Although they are a small minority, some young people cause problems through their unruly behaviour on public transport and on dedicated bus services. I do not malign the people who provide the buses, but sometimes they are of poor quality. Double-decker varieties, for example, are often cheap, but are not well designed in terms of the supervision of children. It is important that a culture of discipline and respect is engendered in young people from when they leave to go to school until they get home after school. As the Steer Davies Gleave evaluation report for the Department for Transport made clear, the benefits of that are felt not only by the community at large, but by the kids themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/14">We are talking about a win-win situation. There is evidence that introducing yellow bus schemes has increased the number of children who are in school to be taught. I am told that in Bristol truancy was cut by 5 per cent. in the first six months of the operation of such a scheme. The headmaster of Henbury school in Bristol said that attendance had improved by 57 per cent. for the children who used the yellow school bus. The Government are rightly committed to reducing truancy, and this initiative could support other initiatives that they have put in place. A further side benefit is that yellow school buses provide a near door-to-door service, and there is less scope for young kids to find distractions on unaccompanied journeys to and from school.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/15">Those are at least some of the benefits, which are being felt in what are small pockets geographically across the UK. I agree that a diverse approach should be taken to tackle the challenge of school transport, dependent on local circumstances, but I do not think that we have given enough power to the elbow of the school bus concept. We may need to give some leadership in that respect. I am not asking for a top-down solution to be presented to local authorities without debate. Obviously, it is up to them to decide how to spend their funding and to develop innovative schemes as they see fit. I know as much as anyone that the Government do not have unlimited funds. They have only taxes, and people do not like their taxes being raised to pay for other things without a consequential reduction in expenditure elsewhere. However, I visited a scheme in Wrexham that is funded from council coffers only, as I recall. I am told that another scheme, in Runnymede, has been financed through an innovative combination of parental contribution, private sector sponsorship&mdash;with a range of sponsorship levels to attract as many offers as possible&mdash;and use of section 106 planning obligations to compel new developments to pay towards the scheme on the ground that it would reduce traffic congestion. That is an example of something that has been done previously and could be done in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/16">It can be a two-way thing. When businesses are relieved of sometimes crippling delays caused by traffic and there is a real productivity bonus, everyone gains. Medway council has committed funding, coupled with parental contributions, and is using it in terms of existing funds to deliver a small but growing yellow bus scheme. At one school, 60 per cent. of yellow bus users were previously driven to school by car. At another school, the figure has risen to 76 per cent. Local authorities, including my own in Wirral, need to find a way around the funding obstacle as well as applying pressure on the Government to be supportive.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/17">Merseyside has a draft school travel strategy operating within the local transport plan. Its preferred option to walking and cycling is public transport, dedicated bus service provision being provided only</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/18" class="indent">&quot;where no other alternatives are available&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/19">That may be a valid view on Merseytravel's part, but it may also require a wasteful catch-all extension to services&mdash;that is, if we assume that the reason for low take-up of public transport in some areas is that it does not serve all the areas that it needs to.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/20">Much more creative thinking is needed. The scheme in Runnymede would be on a small scale compared with a scheme in Wirral and certainly compared with a scheme in Merseyside as a whole. It would be a big undertaking to introduce such a scheme all in one go, but there may be nothing to prevent smaller schemes from being put in place and extending even to individual schools. The start-up costs need not be prohibitive. Some bus companies can, for example, lease the buses so that start-up costs are reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/21">There are, of course, debates to be had about the range of provision for pupils and how much the parental contribution should be. Most schemes that I have examined charge about 50p a journey or &pound;1 a day. I have no doubt that yellow school bus schemes have the potential to enable greater school choice to become a reality. However, what most concerns parents day to day is getting their children to school as safely, quickly and conveniently as possible. What concerns small businesses in my constituency day to day is the free flow of goods and people&mdash;making a delivery on time and meeting clients and suppliers. That is good for productivity and profitability. Of course, we want to encourage more cycling and walking to school, but this is not a zero-sum game. We can have walking buses and we can increase the provision of cycle racks, cycle paths and training, but we must do something about the growing proportion of children who travel to school by car. I am sure that, if there is a will, there is a way.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/22">I am asking for greater urgency. Green shoots have sprouted across the country, and some local authorities and bus operators are making real progress, but those early developments must be nurtured and given more encouragement&mdash;not necessarily cash, although that would certainly help. The benefits are clear. Yellow bus schemes have the potential to eliminate much congestion, to end the school run, to improve air quality, particularly at the school gate, and to provide a safer and more disciplined way to get children to school.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/23">It has been put to me that, in America, the operation of yellow school buses is associated with poor trade union practices. However, that is outwith the points that I am raising. A root-and-branch overhaul is needed of the school transport system, so I am glad that the education White Paper appears to put such a prospect on the table. I appreciate also that, to that end, nothing should be ruled out and nothing should be ruled in. However, the evidence is mounting all the time. I hope that the evaluation of west Yorkshire's large-scale pilot scheme will prove impossible to ignore when it is complete. Although I applaud what the Government have done thus far, we need to do much more. Traffic congestion is growing daily, and the number of children being driven to school continues to rise. I urge providers, small and large, and the Government to work together to come up with solutions to that pressing problem, including imaginative ways to fund schemes. That may be easier said than done, but doing nothing is not an option.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.237.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport"  colnum="237"  time="013:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h04.htm#60207h04_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.237.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1930" name="Ben Chapman">my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South (Ben Chapman)</phrase> on securing the debate. He was right to state at the outset that there is a lot of common ground, and I disagree with very little of what he said. I congratulate him on the powerful case that he made and on his clear enthusiasm for this strategy to tackle the problem. We agree on the analysis of its implications. I am therefore pleased to have the opportunity to outline the Government's approach to yellow buses and to place them in the wider context of the travel-to-school schemes that we are working to deliver with the Department for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/2">I shall start by setting out the background to our joint work with the DFES on school travel and then outline our research on pilot yellow school bus schemes. That includes the support, which my hon. Friend knows we are providing, for the pilot scheme in west Yorkshire. I shall also consider the funding of such schemes and the potential for expanding the yellow bus programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/3">The joint work that we are doing with the DFES on the school journey aims to make it easier and more attractive for pupils to walk, cycle or take the bus to school, as an alternative to travelling by car. We want parents and pupils to have options when travelling to school&mdash;walking or cycling where it is possible and safe to do so and, for longer journeys, taking the bus. We want to encourage independent travel as far as possible, where that is safe and convenient.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/4">By encouraging children to get into sustainable travelling habits early in their lives, we will nurture a new generation of travellers who do not think twice about walking, cycling or using public transport as part of their daily routine. How children travel to school also has an impact on their broader health and welfare. The decline in walking and cycling which has taken place since the 1980s has coincided with a wider reduction in levels of physical activity by children of all ages, and that decrease in activity has contributed to rising levels of obesity in young people. The DFES and the Department of Health have a shared public service agreement target to reverse the upward trend in childhood obesity. In order to deliver on that target, we will need to be successful in making children more active in their daily lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/5">Walking is already an important mode of travel to school, with around 50 per cent. of five to 10-year-olds and 44 per cent. of 11 to 16 year-olds walking. In light of comments about there being very few children who travel much more than a mile by foot or bicycle at present, my hon. Friend may be interested to know that in the last period for which we have statistics&mdash;2003&ndash;04&mdash;of the children who travelled between 1 and 2 miles to school, a third of those aged between five and 10, and almost two thirds of those aged between 11 and 16, walked, and 4 per cent. of those aged 11 to 16 cycled. Cycling and walking&mdash;even walking to and from a bus stop&mdash;are obvious ways in which we could make children more active in their daily lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/6">The travelling to school initiative was launched in September 2003 by the current Home Secretary&mdash;who at that time was the Secretary of State for Education and Skills&mdash;and the Secretary of State for Transport. The key objective of the initiative was to get a good quality school travel plan into every school in England by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/7">A school travel plan is a joint initiative, agreed between schools, pupils, and local authorities, to improve travelling conditions around schools&mdash;to make it easier to walk, cycle or use the bus. The travelling to school initiative includes a number of measures to support and encourage the development of school travel plans. With the DFES, the Department for Transport has funded the appointment of a network of about 250 school travel advisers and regional school travel advisers based in local authorities. Their job is to support schools in developing travel plans, to provide advice on good practice, and to ensure that the plans meet the high-quality standards of the project. As a further incentive to schools to create such plans, the DFES has provided capital grants to schools which have produced agreed travel plans. The grants are worth about &pound;5,000 for a typical primary school and &pound;10,000 for a typical secondary school.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/8">I am pleased to report that progress has been extremely positive. We have exceeded our key project milestone of getting 6,000 plans into place by the end of March 2005, and we are on track to achieve the level of 10,000 schools by the end of March 2006. To date, we have paid out more than &pound;30 million in grants to support the development of travel plans. They have provided a range of sustainable investment in travel initiatives, such as safe and secure lockers, storage facilities and shelters for children bringing their bicycles to school, and improved bus access.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/9">Having set out the broader context of travel to work, I shall talk more specifically about the role of bus services, and in particular the role of dedicated school buses. We recognise that walking and cycling are not the best options for every journey. Where no safe walking or cycling routes are available, or where a pupil lives a long way from school, travelling by bus can be the best option, and it is certainly environmentally preferable to the private car. We are keen that a key objective of the travelling to school initiative should be to make the bus a positive choice for more parents and children.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/10">Bus travel allows children to socialise with each other and to become independent and confident public transport users at an early age. Bus and coach accidents are very rare; they are the safest mode of passenger road transport. They also generally produce fewer emissions. School travel plans can contain a range of measures to encourage bus use, from engineering improvements around schools to revisions to services negotiated with commercial operators. They can build on the wider work being done by local authorities to promote the use of local bus networks, including supporting concessionary fares.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/11">I have explained some of the ways in which local authorities can improve the attractiveness of bus services for the school journey. However, as my hon. Friend is aware, some local authorities have gone beyond that and developed proposals for dedicated networks of school buses on the United States of America model, designed for the exclusive use of pupils on the journey to school. My Department was interested in exploring the potential costs and benefits of dedicated school buses in respect of encouraging more pupils to travel to school by bus. Therefore, in 2002&ndash;03 we carried out an initial evaluation of some of the early yellow school bus pilots, including schemes in Runnymede in Surrey, Hebden Bridge in west Yorkshire and Wrexham in north Wales. We also considered other dedicated school bus schemes. That evaluation exercise confirmed that well designed yellow school bus schemes had the potential to reduce car dependency in terms of the journey to school, and that they were usually popular with parents and pupils. Parents particularly valued the security of having a regular driver, allocated seating and services direct to the school gate. I share the view that they can have a positive effect on antisocial behaviour as well as on pupil safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/12">The evaluation did, however, conclude that unless they were carefully designed, dedicated school bus schemes could have some unintended adverse consequences. In one pilot area, the introduction of the dedicated bus had the effect of driving out of business a key local commercial bus service, which was relied on for a wide range of non-school journeys. We also found that new bus services offered to pupils living only a short distance from schools could reduce levels of walking and cycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/13">Dedicated school buses can offer considerable benefits but they also come at a cost, as my hon. Friend recognised. Our research suggests that while parents are willing to make some payment for dedicated schools buses, that is in effect capped at about &pound;1 a day, which is unlikely to be enough to make them a commercially viable proposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/14">In response to our evaluation report, which was published in 2003, we said that we would welcome proposals from local authorities for well designed dedicated bus schemes where they could demonstrate that they could be effective in meeting local transport and education needs. To date, we have offered &pound;18.7 million of local transport capital funding to the west Yorkshire MyBus scheme, which is a large-scale dedicated bus scheme. Once fully implemented, the scheme will provide about 150 buses serving secondary and primary schools in various locations throughout west Yorkshire. As my hon. Friend knows, I visited there not long ago and I was very impressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/15">Although implementation of the scheme is still at a relatively early stage, it has achieved a 10 per cent. reduction in the number of primary school children who normally travel by car to the schools taking part. The scheme is popular with head teachers, parents, drivers and children, and offers qualitative evidence of positive impacts on behaviour, attendance and children's personal safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/16">We are aware that further dedicated bus schemes are under development around the country. As I have made clear to my hon. Friend, we would not rule out any of these being funded as major schemes in the same way as in west Yorkshire, but we have to be realistic about the level of funding available through that route. I take on board the point about other options for funding being available, but unfortunately very few of them are unlimited.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/17">We are considering advice from regional bodies on their recommended major scheme programmes for the next 10 years. I cannot say anything further on that at present. However, we are keen for such options to be examined and, as long as they are clearly set in a broader context&mdash;of understanding their impact on commercial bus services, and of any perverse consequences&mdash;we would like to explore what possibilities there are for them to be extended.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/18">In the broader context, yellow school buses can play an important role, but they are only one strand in a travelling to school programme on which we are making solid progress, and which chimes in with the objectives and analysis of the problems that my hon. Friend articulated.</p>

	<p pid="a.241.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate after weeks of trying, but I rather regret the need for it. The Minister for Sport will know why I say that, as he was kind enough to attend the previous debate that I obtained on the subject on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-08">8 May 2002</phrase>. Indeed, that was my second debate on the issue; the previous one was on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-20">20 December 2000</phrase>, when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> replied for the Government. I met the Minister after that debate to discuss the problem. Many years on, it remains my concern that organisations in my constituency get very little money relative to the rest of Gloucestershire.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.1/2">I welcome the fact that my neighbours in Gloucestershire get a lot of lottery funding, and I wish them well; they have obviously submitted a lot of good applications, and I hope that they continue to be successful. However, if I go through the figures, the Minister will see the cause of my alarm. Since the start of the national lottery there has been about &pound;125 million in grants&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.241.3/1">To Gloucestershire, I mean. There have been grants of &pound;125 million or thereabouts to organisations in Gloucestershire. If Tewkesbury were to get the same amount as other constituencies in Gloucestershire, it would get some 16.7 per cent. of that money. I accept that there will be variations, but it currently gets only 4.49 per cent. That figure is very slightly up since last time I held a debate on the subject, when it was 3.4 per cent., but at this rate I calculate that it will take us 44 years to get up to the average. We now get the very slightly increased 4.49 per cent., but it is not acceptable that organisations in Tewkesbury should lose out to that extent. Tewkesbury has received only &pound;5.6 million, whereas if we were to get the average, the figure would be something like &pound;21 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/2">Let me compare the figures for the other constituencies in Gloucestershire. Cheltenham has received nearly &pound;23 million; Cotswold &pound;25 million; Forest of Dean &pound;10 million; Gloucester &pound;38 million; Stroud almost &pound;24 million; and Tewkesbury only &pound;5.6 million. The point is that we are not even remotely close to amounts received in other constituencies; if we got 12 or 13 per cent. of the money coming into the county, I probably would not have held three debates on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/3">The natural response, which I have heard in the past, has been to ask whether organisations in Tewkesbury are actually applying for sufficient numbers of grants. Well, it is difficult to tell these days. When I held my first debate, the figures were available from the Government, and they showed that Tewkesbury was applying for plenty of grants. By the second debate in 2002, those figures were not available from the Government, and I have not been able to access them in any way, so I cannot answer whether organisations in Tewkesbury are applying for as many grants as those in other parts of the county. As far as I know, those figures are not available, although they certainly used to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/4">I can cite a number of grant applications that have been turned down. As far as I can see, they were very good applications indeed. Tewkesbury sports centre had two failed bids. It is based at a successful school that takes children from all kind of backgrounds. The school serves some areas that are perhaps a little more prosperous, but it also serves areas such as Priors Park, which is undergoing a great deal of regeneration, and Northway, where there are ongoing problems with youths on street corners. The school is ideally positioned to help those people, yet the sports centre has had two failed bids.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/5">The Jet Age museum has made at least one bid, perhaps two. As the Minister will be aware, it is in the area where the jet engine was invented. There is a good deal of heritage about the museum, which deals with an important part of our history. I have visited it on a number of occasions, and it is very well run indeed. A number of enthusiastic people are involved with it, yet it has not been able to access lottery money. Nor is it based in the most prosperous of areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/6">Tewkesbury and District Council of Voluntary Services had an application turned down. That was to support various voluntary organisations in the borough, such as a support-for-the-elderly day care centre. It would have brought together a whole range of voluntary agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/7">Churchdown sports centre's bid failed, too. I have mentioned that before. The reason given for its failure was that it was within 20 minutes' drive of a similar facility in Gloucester. The point I have made in the past is that children do not drive, or should not, and if they get a lift from their parents, it means four journeys&mdash;that is, going there and back twice. That is at a time when we are supposed to be reducing car journeys and building sustainable communities. The reason given for that failure is not acceptable. As a result of the failed bid, the sports centre is struggling, and the borough council wonders whether it can continue to support the centre, the very existence of which is now in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/8">It would be a very retrograde step if that sports facility were lost; I want to press that home to the Minister. Churchdown is still technically a village, but it has a population of some 10,000 or 11,000, depending on how wide one makes the count. It is an area with a lot of young people, and they need something to do. It is not over-endowed with facilities. I deeply regret that that organisation did not manage to get the grant, and that it is struggling now.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/9">To go back to 2002, Tewkesbury got a little bit of money under the fair share initiative, but it was way, way down on the list. I have looked into the new scheme, and it seems that Tewkesbury will not be one of the areas that will benefit. I am the first to say that the national lottery has been a great success. In my notes, I have put it in brackets that it .was a Conservative success, but it would not be right to dwell on that. The lottery has raised &pound;18 billion for good causes, and I understand that 220,000 projects have succeeded. Indeed, there have been some success in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/10">Only recently in a village called Bishop's Cleeve a new sports area was opened by the very famous Sir Geoff Hurst; it was a great privilege to have him in the village, although he lives in Cheltenham now. It was a successful day and he was very popular, and the new facility is very good. In the village of Twyning, where I happen to live, there is a very good sports facility, although I played no part in attracting the money. I am not in any way knocking the national lottery or saying that we have not had any benefit at all; we certainly have, but not the kind that we deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/11">When I explored this issue in the past, the question was raised of how we determine where the money should go. One of the issues that has been put to me is that of deprivation: areas that are deprived should receive more funding than those that are not. I accept that there is a certain logic to that, but the problem is how we measure deprivation. One problem is that when a fairly large area is assessed, there may well be pockets of deprivation, although the whole area may not be deprived according to all the measures. That is one problem that we have had in Tewkesbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/12">A lot of rural areas are deprived. The area that I represent is very rural; there are some built-up areas, as I have mentioned, but there are pockets of rural deprivation, too. There are many small villages without any shops or facilities at all. Quite often, public transport between villages is very poor. There are quite poor rail links between Gloucestershire as a whole and London, for example. There are trains, but it may be surprising to hear that one often has to change at least once in the journey from Cheltenham to London. That is rather surprising, because Cheltenham is a main town and a lot of things go on there, yet the rail link is poor. There is a better rail link north of my constituency, which goes up to Evesham&mdash;it is not particularly brilliant, but it is better&mdash;but there is not a good link between Gloucestershire and London. We have a problem there.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/13">There are a lot of farmers in my area, and farming incomes continue to fall. Quite a number of rural post offices have closed, and, if I may be controversial for a moment, the hunting ban has not helped the countryside. I put that very gently. A number of rural pubs in my area are also very concerned about the proposed smoking ban.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/14">There are pockets of deprivation in my constituency. People perhaps think of Tewkesbury as a good Tory seat, which must be rich, but that is not so. It is a mixed area: there are prosperous parts, but there are also many areas that are not. If we are using deprivation as a measure of where to send the money, we need to look more closely at Tewkesbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/15">There is also the heritage aspect. The battle of Tewkesbury took place in 1471. As a Lancastrian, I do not want to say the wrong side won when the Yorkists got their last great victory of the war of the roses&mdash;we got our own back at Bosworth field. There is great heritage in the town. The townsfolk got together and collected money to pay off King Henry VIII, and the famous Tewkesbury abbey survived. Two rivers meet there&mdash;the Severn and the Avon&mdash;and we have lots of rich history. However, we need some help from funds, such as the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/16">Even under the Heritage Lottery Fund, however, Tewkesbury comes bottom of the league in Gloucestershire. We cannot get even get the funding for heritage. We are bottom of the league in terms of charitable organisations and arts funding. With millennium funding, we are fifth out of six, but only by &pound;2,000. We are fifth in sports funding, by some &pound;2,000. In health, education and the environment we come fifth, but by only &pound;3,000. In virtually every way we look at it, Tewkesbury comes bottom of the Gloucestershire league. If we look at the six headings&mdash;arts, charity, heritage, millennium, sports and health, education and the environment&mdash;and the six constituencies, making a multiple of 36 different bids, we come last almost every time.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/17">I genuinely do not know why this is so. Organisations in Tewkesbury have submitted applications, but some that failed were good and solid and not in any way frivolous, and an awful lot of work went into preparing them. I can personally vouch for those organisations. Those applications failed, but throughout the county millions of pounds has gone to organisations in other constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/18">I want to finish where I started. I wish the successful organisations well, and I am pleased that they have received funding, but I think that the Minister will agree that the 4.5 per cent. of the funding that we receive in Tewkesbury does not look right&mdash;it seems unfair&mdash;and is only a slight increase on the 3.5 per cent. that we got when I last had this debate. I hope that I do not have to return to the Chamber to take up hon. Members' and the Minister's time by complaining yet again. I am more than happy to meet the Minister or his officials to discuss how we might assess what is going wrong, and how we might decide how to put it right.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/19">Perhaps the Minister or his officials might find time to help me in that respect. For now, I should like him to give me whatever answers he feels he can. I am grateful to him for turning up. I know that he has many other issues to deal with, but I stress that we have seen great benefits coming from the very few projects that have been financed in Tewkesbury and I want to extend that to the other applications that have been made on the part of the people of my constituency.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.244.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" speakername="Richard Caborn" speakeroffice="The Minister for Sport"  colnum="244"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h05.htm#60207h05_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.244.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> on securing the debate. I shall try to answer some of his questions. When we met last night in the Strangers Bar, Sheffield United lost 4&ndash;1 to Watford, so it was a bad evening. I have recovered since then, however, and I shall hopefully give him positive answers.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/2">As the hon. Gentleman said, this is not the first time that he has taken the opportunity to ask questions about his constituency and national lottery funding, and, as he rightly said, this is not the first time that I have had the privilege of speaking on the subject. He obviously cares deeply that his constituency should be taking every opportunity to reap the benefits of lottery funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/3">I should like to put on the record straight away that if the hon. Gentleman writes to me about his concerns about applications being turned down, I shall get my officials to write to the various distributors&mdash;the Heritage Lottery Fund, or whatever&mdash;and find the official reasons why they were refused. That might be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/4">The national lottery has become one of the most successful lotteries in the world. Since 1994, it has raised in excess of &pound;18 billion for good causes and more than 224,000 grants have been made to projects all over the UK. Lottery funding has made the greatest difference in our communities. In fact, 65 per cent. of all lottery grants have been for small amounts of money&mdash;sometimes less than &pound;5,000&mdash;which spreads the benefits of lottery funding far and wide. Although a &pound;5,000 sum probably does not seem a lot, to many organisations such an amount has had major effects and they have done tremendous work with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/5">Nearly half the total amount of money awarded has gone to projects in the 100 most deprived local authorities. The hon. Gentleman is concerned about that. The distribution of national lottery funds was never intended directly to match the population pound for pound in each constituency or region, but it was intended to respond to particular needs by ensuring that grants are made to projects that would not normally be funded through taxation and that areas of significant disadvantage are the first to benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/6">Our policy and the policy of the previous Government is to encourage the fair distribution of lottery funding across the United Kingdom&mdash;not that every county or constituency will receive the same amount. We recognise that not all areas of the country are the same. Rural and urban areas have different needs and these differences can cause a variation in funding which is inevitable, particularly for larger grants. The hon. Gentleman raises a valid point about his constituency and I shall look into it. I shall look in particular at the Churchdown sports centre to see what the reasons were for turning it down.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/7">Throughout the life of the lottery we have recognised that changes needed to be made to ensure that lottery money is spread fairly throughout the country and to reflect the different groups in our society. The hon. Gentleman may be familiar with the measures that we have taken, but I think it is useful to remember how we have responded to make lottery money more accessible for all. We changed the lottery's original emphasis on capital grants to spending on people and activities and we have opened up access to lottery funding. We gave the distributing bodies the power to solicit lottery applications from priority areas to address concerns that some areas lacked the infrastructure or skills to put together an application. I do not know whether that is a problem in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, but we will consider it. We also gave the distributing bodies the power to delegate decision making to regional and local level, enabling them to be more responsive to local needs We tasked the distributing bodies to draw up a strategic plan for funding to ensure that lottery money goes to areas and projects that need it most.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/8">The distributing bodies have also responded to the challenge. The Community Fund's fair share initiative initially delivered &pound;180 million of lottery funding to 77 specially targeted disadvantaged areas in both rural and urban areas of the UK. Other specific initiatives have targeted former coalfield areas and seaside resorts. Those measures have had the right effect. For example, by the end of 1998, Tewkesbury had received just 33 lottery grants worth a total of &pound;722,000; during the following five years, from 1999 to 2005, it received 188 grants totalling &pound;4.7 million, an increase both in the number and value of grants, although, as the hon. Gentleman's figures demonstrate, the area could still do considerably better.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/9">Part of the problem is that the information on lottery grants to individual constituencies does not tell the whole story. For example, if a grant is given to an organisation whose headquarters is in a particular city, it will be credited to that city, although its benefits might be felt in a much wider geographical area, and sometimes across the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/10">The situation can be difficult to gauge. Looking at the statistics for my constituency of Sheffield, Central, it seems that we get many more grants than anybody else. That is not because I happen to be the Minister with responsibility for the lottery, but because grants are made to places in the city centre that benefit not only Sheffield but the whole of south Yorkshire, and sometimes north Derbyshire as well. How the funds are distributed should be factored into our considerations.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/11">Each application is assessed on its merits against criteria laid down by the distributing body, but because there are always more applications than can be funded, the process has to involve an element of competition. Some projects are unsuccessful. Many times my ministerial colleagues and I are asked to intervene in lottery applications, but we are unable to do so because lottery distributors are responsible for making decisions on individual grants and are independent of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/12">Government policy directions set only the broad framework within which the distributing bodies operate. The directions require them, for example, to have regard to the different parts of the UK, encourage sustainable development, and reduce economic and social deprivation, while creating benefits. Often the problem is that particular areas do not put in many applications for lottery funding or apply for small amounts, and although their success rate can be very good, they do not do as well as other areas that have submitted more applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/13">Many of the provisions of the National Lottery Bill, currently under scrutiny in another place, will add to the measures that we have taken to improve the distribution of lottery funding. The Bill will set up a new distributor&mdash;the Big Lottery Fund&mdash;as the one-stop shop for voluntary and community grants; enable all lottery distributors to promote the national lottery as whole, rather than their own good causes; and allow the distributing bodies to involve the public in decision making, so that local people have a say on where lottery money goes. It might go, for example, to good projects with community support that will enhance their community's quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/14">There is no quick fix for constituencies or regions that feel that they are not getting their fair share of lottery grants. However, it is important to remember that lottery funds are finite and dependent on receipts from the national lottery game. That means that the majority of programmes are over-subscribed and that there is always strong competition for grants. The distributing bodies have to make difficult decisions to ensure that the funding available to the good causes is used most effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/15">The national lottery has evolved over the years to meet better the changing needs of applicants and ensure that more communities have access to lottery funding. We will continue to monitor the situation and we will try to deal with problems if they occur. As I said, if the hon. Gentleman writes to me about specific grants that have been turned down, my officials will contact the various lottery distributors to find out why, and I hope that the problem will be rectified. However, that will have to be done within the funding structure under which the lottery operates because the final decisions are taken by the lottery distributors without interference from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/16">I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels reassured. There is no doubt that the lottery is a success story; it is one of the most successful lotteries in the world. I acknowledge that it was brought in by the Conservatives. At the time, some of my hon. Friends voted against it, as did the Liberals, but now we have all accepted that it is an incredible institution that does tremendous good up and down this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/17">We have tried to refine the lottery, and this time we have refined it against a background of wide consultation. The fact that it is played so frequently shows that it is a credible institution in itself. If we continue to refine it as we have over the years, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will not have to bother securing any more debates on the subject, and for that I shall be eternally grateful.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/18" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/19" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at five minutes to Two o'clock.</p>
