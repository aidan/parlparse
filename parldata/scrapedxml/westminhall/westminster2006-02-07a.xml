<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.181.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="181"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.181.3/1">Good morning to you, Mr. Benton, and to other hon. Members. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of the care and nutrition of older people. I think that the Minister will know of my interest in the subject, because I had the opportunity last week to host the launch in the House of a campaign by Help the Aged and Action on Elder Abuse to help raise awareness and promote action to tackle the hidden scandal that is elder abuse in our country. The Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, also took part. The campaign is all about pressing for in-depth research to gauge the true level of the problem of abuse. The most recent figures obtained by the Select Committee on Health, during its inquiry in 2004, show that 500,000 elderly people time at any one may be the victims of abuse, including physical, psychological, financial and sexual abuse. Without a clear picture, however, it is impossible to know whether the current policy and practice, which have developed over the past five to 10 years, really are a fit response to the level of need.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.3/2">Although this morning's title gives scope to raise many issues, I sought the debate primarily to raise two. The first is the nutrition of older people, particularly vulnerable older people in care homes, and the second is the use and management of medication in care homes. Just before Christmas, the British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition&mdash;BAPEN&mdash;published a report into the nutrition of older people in a variety of care settings, and the facts speak for themselves. One in 10 care home residents loses up to 5 per cent. of their body weight within a month of being admitted to the home and 10 per cent. of their body weight within six months. Much malnutrition goes undetected; indeed, many regard it as the norm and as part of the aging process&mdash;it is not.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.3/3">Even on the basis of the available research, it is clear that malnutrition in care homes is at epidemic levels. Based on an analysis of people aged 65 and over by the national diet and nutrition survey, BAPEN found that 20.5 per cent of individuals in care homes&mdash;one in five residents&mdash;were at medium or high risk of falling victim to malnutrition.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.0/1">That is an invitation that I could not possibly refuse. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about the need for an advocate&mdash;particularly for the frail and vulnerable, who might lack capacity to make decisions for themselves&mdash;as a complement to some of the legislation on medical capacity. I hope that he would also support my ten-minute Bill, which is currently before the House, and which would extend the application of the Human Rights Act 1998 to all privately run care homes. It does not currently apply in those circumstances, and anyone who crosses the threshold of a privately run care home can no longer exercise their rights under the Act unless they have a contract with the local authority that specifically stipulates otherwise. The Government acknowledge that anomaly, but it needs to be addressed, and that loophole needs finally to be closed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.182.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="182"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.182.2/1">I can only echo the hon. Gentleman's sentiments. I also have a meals on wheels service in my constituency, and it relies predominantly on voluntary effort to deliver meals. The service makes a huge difference in terms not only of the delivery of food, but of contact; indeed, it is the only contact that some people have, because many of them lead very isolated lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/2">As I said, one in five care home residents is at risk of malnutrition. Today, as many as 63,400 frail elderly people in care homes across England could be malnourished&mdash;that is 63,400 victims of poor nutrition. In the 21st century, it is a scandal that elderly people in some of these homes are, in effect, starving to death. The personal cost of such poor treatment is incalculable and unacceptable, and it includes poorer health, slower recovery from illness, the risk of complications from illness and, above all, a very poor quality of life. According to BAPEN, the cost to the taxpayer of treating malnutrition in long-term care has been estimated at &pound;2.6 billion a year. That really is a shocking waste of public money.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/3">According to figures from the Commission for Social Care Inspection, more than 2,000 care homes out of the 11,000-odd in England fail to meet the most minimal of national minimum standards for meals and mealtimes. As things stand, the national minimum standards say next to nothing about nutrition. It is only thanks to work by the Caroline Walker Trust and the National Association of Care Catering that a more detailed set of guidance is available to practitioners in the field. I very much welcome the news that the commission will publish a report on nutrition later this year, which is not a moment too soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/4">Last month, I had the opportunity to introduce the Care of Older and Incapacitated People (Human Rights) Bill under the ten-minute rule. I drew attention to a case that was reported to me and which illustrates the nutrition problem. It was the case of a care home resident who nearly starved to death. Like many other residents at the same care home, this elderly lady suffered from dementia and needed help with eating, but none was provided. Residents were left to fend for themselves, and relatives were banned from the dining area. When the news came that the care home was to be closed, conditions deteriorated further. Residents were forced to live on a diet of Angel Delight and beans on toast, and sometimes, if they were lucky, pilchards on toast. They were left for up to 16 hours between meals, as cooks went home at 4 pm. When the manager was asked what the residents could eat at night, he told relatives that there was a pot of fish paste in the fridge. Fortunately, the lady in question moved to a new care home, where she received much better attention, and she put on a stone within a month of arriving.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/5">Another lady wrote to me to say that despite years of battling to ensure that her mother was properly looked after, her mother could barely get a spoon to her mouth or reach her drink and had difficulties because she was offered no assistance in doing so. The lady told me that her mum was being fed on tinned corned beef and packets of Smash potato. After a complaint, she was moved on to tinned mince and Smash, and another complaint later led to the provision day after day of a banana for breakfast, tinned stew mixed with tinned soup for dinner and tinned soup for tea. That was a wholly inadequate diet, and relatives were given no explanation&mdash;if there was any&mdash;for why such a diet was provided. The lady's mother was put in a bed so high that she could not reach the water placed by her bedside&mdash;dehydration is also an issue in some care homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/6">It was only after the mother was admitted to hospital with breathlessness and chest pains that the lady was told that her mother was malnourished. Although her mother ate &quot;like a horse&quot;, as the hospital put it, during her stay in hospital, and gained weight in the process, the care home denied any responsibility and argued that she had not been eating due to lack of appetite. If we were served a constant diet of tinned stew mixed with soup every day, we might lose our appetites too. Not every care home is like that, but those that are should not be tolerated, because they are ruining people's lives, putting lives at risk and, in some cases, killing people.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/7">I want to raise three specific concerns regarding the nutrition of older people: training, nutritional screening and co-ordination. On training, there is no requirement in the national minimum standards for care homes regarding training catering staff, in particular, in the specialist task of meeting the dietary needs of care home residents. I understand from the National Association of Care Caterers that no module is available as part of national vocational qualification level 2 on catering to ensure that staff can meet those special dietary needs. A module exists and was drawn up by NACC in the late 1990s, but City and Guilds, the awarding body, has not seen it as a high enough priority to be made a component of NVQ, despite the demand for such a course throughout the sector. What action will the Minister take to ensure that training on special dietary requirements is available as part of any qualification for caterers in care homes?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.184.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="184"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.184.3/1">I have two reactions to that point. First, I should like to see the commission's report, which will analyse performance by sector precisely on nutrition standards, inadequate as they are. Secondly, we are where we are, and we must ensure that the system delivers good quality, fit-for-purpose services, regardless of whether they are publicly, privately or charitably run. That is the purpose of my contribution, but I entirely take the hon. Gentleman's criticism, which I have heard about and share, about the downsides of the regulated but not very well managed system that we have had for too many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/2">After highlighting my concerns about malnutrition in care homes, I have received a great many letters and phone calls. Some have been from angry care home owners, but many have come from care homes wanting to tell me what they do in practice, relatives and residents sharing their personal experiences, and health and care practitioners pointing to good practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/3">An example of good practice that I commend came from Southwark primary care trust, which told me about its care home support team, which works with 40 independent sector nursing homes in the borough. The team has introduced systematic assessment of need, which includes intensive training courses for care home staff, with courses on dementia and nutrition, and working with people with swallowing difficulties&mdash;an issue that the Parkinson's Disease Society is most concerned about in the upcoming review of national minimum standards. Those examples of good practice should become the norm. Making them the norm is the challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/4">Standard 8 of the national minimum standards for care homes makes nutritional screening a requirement. However, that requirement is part of a bundle of other requirements, which means that a home could meet the overall standard but perform poorly on nutritional screening. Without proper screening it is hardly surprising that one in every 10 new care home residents loses up to 5 per cent. of their body weight within one month of being admitted and up to 10 per cent. of their body weight within six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/5">As things stand, there is no agreed screening tool. BAPEN has developed a universal malnutrition screening tool for assessment of individuals across all care settings that is supported by the Royal College of Nursing, the British Dietetic Association and the Royal College of Physicians. NACC has produced its own screening tool for use by care home managers that is designed with individuals with no nutritional or dietary training in mind. Care homes need clear guidance about the assessment tools available and the circumstances in which they should be used. Will the Minister make nutritional screening on admission to care homes a mandatory requirement in the national minimum standards?</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/6">I am sure that the Minister will tell me about the review of the national minimum standards, the work of the Food Standards Agency, the efforts of the Commission for Social Care Inspection and the imminent publication of National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance on the use of nutritional supplements. The review of national minimum standards offers the opportunity to strengthen nutritional requirements. I understand that CSCI is undertaking work on that, as well as developing a toolkit for inspectors, and is due to publish a report on nutrition next month. The FSA is developing recommendations on nutrient-based standards not only for the care sector, but for public institutions across the piece. That work includes developing example menus to assist caterers in menu planning. I understand that the FSA is in discussion with a range of interested parties about its work and will produce a draft report, which will be ready by this summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/7">I do not say that there is not a lot going on; indeed, I acknowledge that there is. However, the more I have researched the issue and talked to people, the more the question arises of where the co-ordination of those different strands of work is. Who is pulling them all together? I and many outside, particularly those in BAPEN and NACC, would like to know whether the Minister or her colleagues in the Department of Health will take steps to ensure that the work of the FSA, CSCI, NACC, the Caroline Walker Trust, BAPEN and other interested parties is effectively joined up, to ensure that the future national minimum standards cover all aspects of nutrition and meal provision. Would she or the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, be willing to meet me and representatives of NACC and BAPEN to discuss our concerns and their recommendations?</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/8">The second issue that I should like to raise is medication, which I mentioned before Christmas in an Adjournment debate to which the Under-Secretary of State responded. This morning, CSCI issued its report on medicine management in care homes. The report is entitled &quot;Handle with Care?&quot;, and it follows a report by the National Care Standards Commission that was published in March 2004. That earlier report identified serious deficiencies in the way care homes managed medicine. In the light of the earlier report, today's report makes worrying reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/9">&quot;Handle with Care?&quot; states that</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/10" class="indent">&quot;homes are still not placing enough importance on this critical area of care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/11">According to the report, 45 per cent. of care homes for older people are failing to meet the national minimum standards on medication. Some 5,140 of the 11,543 care homes in England are not managing medicines according to the national minimum standards. In almost one in three London boroughs, fewer than 40 per cent. of homes meet the medicine management standards. The report states that it</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/12" class="indent">&quot;shows that there has been some slight improvement in performance overall&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/13">it covers not only older people's homes, but children's homes&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/14" class="indent">&quot;with the exception of nursing homes for older people. But the rate of improvement in such a crucial area of care has been disappointingly slow, with nearly half the care homes for older people and younger adults, providing 210,000 places for residents, still not meeting the minimum standard relating to medication. The primary responsibility for this failure rests with the homes themselves.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/15">Some 210,000 people are living in homes that do not meet the minimum standards on medication, and the buck stops with the homes themselves. I am not here to say that the Government have not delivered, but I point out that the owners need to end their constant denial of problems and failings.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/16">It seems that the reasons why homes are failing to manage medication properly have not changed since NCSC reported. Lessons have not been learnt, and attitudes have not been changed. Indeed, the commission says:</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/17" class="indent">&quot;expenditure on training does not seem to have had an impact on this area of quality.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/18">The commission has found that even homes that meet the standard then struggle, slip and fall back. I first raised the issue of poor medication management in my report &quot;Keep Taking the Medicine&quot; in 2001. I have published two more reports since and contributed to the writing of the Health Committee's report on elder abuse. Five years on, there is still an awful lot to do. The level of over-medication and inappropriate medication in our care homes is shocking. It is a scandal that such poor practice, mistreatment and abuse continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/19">When NCSC reported in 2004, it noted:</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/20" class="indent">&quot;The majority of prescribed medicines will be supplied by a GP on a repeat basis at the request of care staff and not the service user.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/21">That places care staff in a powerful position to influence prescribing for good or for ill. Little has changed in nursing homes and progress has been &quot;stagnant&quot;, according to the latest report. That means that some older people are being managed by means of chemical cocktails of drugs, not for their benefit, but for the benefit of the home. It is chilling to think that if the published research on inappropriate medication is right, as many as 22,233 elderly nursing home residents in England could be under sedation without medical grounds. Indeed, commission's findings suggest that the situation could be far worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/22">Action is long overdue. It is time that care homes came out of denial and took action. There is no quick fix, but ensuring that the recommendations of the commission's report are followed through as a matter of urgency must surely be a priority. Perhaps the Minister can explain how those recommendations will be followed up after the commission is abolished in a couple of years' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/23">One way in which the standards could be raised and the quality of life of care home residents improved would be the delivery of the national service framework standard for medication review. The standard is clear. People aged 75 and over on fewer than four medications should have an annual medication review, and those on four or more should have a review every six months.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. There is an apparent misalignment between the GP contract and the QOF, and the NSF standard. That has meant that there has been a lack of incentives in the system for people to get to the milestone for the NSF. The evaluation of &quot;Room for Review&quot; guidance on medication reviews, published last year by the Department, pointed to the fact that progress had been patchy&mdash;only 8 per cent. of PCTs had met the NSF standard for annual medication reviews for patients over 75, and 5 per cent. had met the target for six-monthly reviews for patients over 75 on four or more medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/2">It is worth bearing in mind that that NSF standard was meant to be achieved by 2002. Two years after that, just 5 per cent. of PCTs were saying that they could meet that standard. As I have pointed out in previous debates&mdash;I did so before Christmas&mdash;two years after the NSF milestone was missed, 47 per cent. of PCTs were still reporting that they could not conduct six-monthly medicine reviews for over-75s on four or more medicines. That picture of patchy support from PCTs is borne out and repeated in the report published today by the Commission for Social Care Inspection. What is being done to ensure that the missed NSF milestone on medication reviews is finally achieved, and that PCTs engage with care homes to drive up the standards?</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/3">To conclude, I sought this debate to highlight two issues: nutrition and medication. Just one care home starving its elderly residents to death or using chemical straitjackets is too many, but the truth is that, through neglect or wilful intent, thousands of homes make the lives of those whom they are supposed to care for a misery. Thousands of homes are making a mockery of the standards, systems and safeguards that are supposed to protect the vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.1/4">I hope that the Minister will demonstrate that the Government understand the challenge and accept that there is still much to do, and that they will give the matter the same level of priority and attention that they have rightly given for many years to our systems for protecting the welfare of children.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.1/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, because he follows the subject, there have been a number of matters of judicial review, and the Department has been criticised for lack of clarity. The courts cannot themselves give a statutory definition where none exists. If we are to have beds in acute hospitals that are not blocked, as well as a vibrant and confident care home sector, we need greater clarity about what is provided free by the state through the national health service and what services are provided by local social services and are means-tested.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> on securing the debate. I apologise, as I assumed that there would be greater interest and have not prepared a lengthy speech, but I am sure that when the Minister responds we will be able to ask her plenty of questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/2">It is timely that the CSCI report on medications has been published today. My hon. Friend has said some of what I wanted to say about the report, but it is disappointing that two years on we seem to be no further forward. That seems to be the story when we consider the provision of services for older people. It is worth remembering that older people do not live only in care homes or hospitals. These days, the Government are driving towards looking after more older people at home, which is quite right. That is where they want to be. Many aspects of care in the home need to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/3">Underpinning all those issues is the national service framework for older people, which was produced in March 2001. It had the dubious distinction of being the first NSF without any attached funds, which immediately created a number of challenges, because anybody trying to achieve the NSF targets had to scrabble for funding. It was also one of the last NSFs to have targets attached. I was curious to see how we were progressing against those targets, so I tabled a number of parliamentary questions and received the perhaps not unsurprising answer that the Government were not collecting routine data on the matters for which targets had been set. It is difficult to determine how progress is being measured, so I decided to carry out my own survey in 2004, which revealed that many targets had not been met, even those that were supposed to have been achieved a year previously. I am disappointed that there has been no comprehensive analysis of the success or failure of the NSF, other than a glossy booklet assuring us that all is well. Clearly, all is not well.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/4">The Government rightly acknowledge that most people would like care at home. There is a problem with that, because although the Government have increased the funding for care at home, it has generally gone into more intensive packages. The casualty has been the funding for lower-level interventions, which may cause significant improvements in quality of life and health. Standard 8 of the national service framework is about the promotion of health and active life in older age. It acknowledges the benefits of a healthy diet but says little about two significant problems that, if addressed, could improve the overall picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/5">First, people who are much older get quite tired. It is an effort to cook and they have less time and energy for food preparation. There is a strong case for teaching them new ways to cook. Those in their generation are used to meat and two veg, which involves quite a lot of food preparation. They tend to resort to tinned foods, which may not be as high in nutritional value. Secondly, where a partner dies, two people would previously have been used to rubbing along together quite nicely, and one might have taken responsibility for food preparation. When someone is left to cope with that on their own, as well as with everything else, there is another need for education.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/6">My hon. Friend has highlighted some of the problems that will arise if we do not address nutrition among the elderly. I also want to quote from a lecture given by Professor Marinos Elia to the Westminster diet and health forum. He pointed out:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The main reason for the high prevalence of hospital malnutrition is that patients are already malnourished when they are admitted to hospital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/8">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/9" class="indent">&quot;In people aged 65 years and over in the community, the prevalence of individual vitamin deficiencies can be as high as 20 per cent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/10">He said that protein-energy malnutrition probably affected 13 per cent. of those aged over 65, and concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Treating/preventing malnutrition in the community, and abolishing major nutritional inequalities there, are important strategies for preventing disease, improving wellbeing, and aiding recovery of patients admitted to hospital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/12">There seems to be some evidence that such action would be useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/13">Standards for care homes have been mentioned, but they are fairly basic and centre around having three meals a day at certain intervals. Although they are welcome, there is no mention of basic things such as the need for five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. That is a Government strategy and has been the subject of a Government campaign, but it does not seem to appear in the guidance for care homes. Although my hon. Friend mentioned the failures of the system, it is disappointing that the statistics have not improved since last year. We have to ask what effect CSCI is having in driving those standards upwards. On the basis of the evidence of the past year, it would seem to be very little.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/14">The European Nutrition for Health Alliance has produced some statistics as well. It points out:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Patients over the age of 80 admitted to hospital have a five times higher prevalence of malnutrition than those under the age of 50&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/16">Clearly the problem is getting worse with increasing age&mdash;a factor that has not been mentioned today. The statistics concerning loss of weight when people enter a nursing home have already been mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/17">Age Concern has also put together some work on the subject. It says that a range of studies have put the prevalence of malnutrition in care homes at levels between 60 per cent. and 100 per cent. I cannot believe that the level is 100 per cent., because there are homes in which the food is excellent, and I know which ones I would like to go to when I am older, if the standards remain the same. Clearly, however, the problem is widespread and wholesale.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/18">What are the Government doing to assess the problem? I was interested in a parliamentary question that my hon. Friend asked in November 2005:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/19" class="indent">&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for Health what research her Department has commissioned into the nutrition of older people (a) in care homes, (b) receiving domiciliary care, (c) in an acute hospital ward and (d) in intermediate care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/20">I am afraid to say that the answer was a bit waffly; it did not really answer the question. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/21" class="indent">&quot;Details of individual projects, including a number concerned with nutrition and older people, can be found on the national research register&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-11-07.268"><i>Official Report</i>, 7 November 2005; Vol. 439, c. 268W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/22">It then gave the URL where those details could be found. I decided last night to have a look to see what wealth of information was out there. I typed the words &quot;nutrition and older people&quot; into the search engine, and I found only one hit: a study of diet and nutrition in older people comparing the Afro-Caribbean population and other people. I think it considered 30 people in each cohort, which is not great. I tried some more combinations, such as &quot;nutrition in care homes&quot; and &quot;nutrition for geriatrics&quot;, and found zero hits for both.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/23">It would be interesting if the Minister could tell us what research is going on into this important subject. I am sure that the cost-benefit analysis must show that a little investment on the problem will reap dividends. If people go into hospital with malnutrition, they are at risk of developing bedsores and other illnesses, which create a demand on health services and facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/24">Medication in care homes is a significant problem that is generally underestimated. I would like briefly to mention the recent death of a care home patient who had been in a home for less than a fortnight. That home was owned by a GP, who I am pleased to say has now been removed from the register. The GP persuaded the patient to register, saying that it would be easier to register with the local practice. People do not think anything of that in such situations; they want to keep everyone happy. The patient was prescribed very high doses of sedatives, such that they could not eat and went into a steep decline; it can be proved that that was linked to the medication.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.0/25">That case raises questions about whether a GP who owns a care home should be allowed to prescribe, or whether there should be some sort of arm's-length prescribing process. I am sure that it is not a common problem, but for the protection of medics and the public, it deserves some attention.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.192.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="192"  time="010:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.192.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point about medication in care homes. I have seen that situation at first hand, because I used to work as a pharmacist, and I saw the prescriptions for each home. Things are better than they used to be when I first qualified 20 years ago. At that time, a person could have a pot of 500 sedatives prescribed, which could then be given out willy-nilly. At least that process is now carried out on a named-patient basis. I have seen homes undergo a change of ownership where the prescribing patterns change radically, sometimes for the better and, sadly, sometimes for the worse. There seems to be no overview of the process or the appropriateness of prescribing. The subject needs more research.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/2">I have read my hon. Friend's paper, and a lot of it seemed based on small-scale research with an extrapolation upwards. That can be dangerous, and it would be much better to have an accurate picture of what is going on with clearer guidelines as to when sedation is appropriate. In my opinion, sedation is inappropriate in many cases and is used for the convenience of the care staff, rather than the benefit of the patient. That is one of the biggest hidden scandals and abuses in today's society.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/3">I would like to mention hospitals. I have mentioned that those over 80 admitted to hospital have a five times higher prevalence of malnutrition than those under 50, but many are admitted in an emergency and the food that is given is often inappropriate. A lot of thought has recently gone into food in hospitals, but sometimes it is perhaps not enough. It does not matter what the food is like, because the problem that returns time after time&mdash;it happens in the care home sector as well&mdash;is the lack of basic help for the patient to eat or drink. That form abuse is endemic in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/4">The Minister will be aware of the &quot;Panorama&quot; programme a few months ago in which reporters went undercover into a hospital in the south of England. The programme showed how drinks were put out of patients' reach and food was taken away after a meal with no thought as to whether patients had been able to feed themselves. Sometimes people's arms were in plaster and no thought was given to basic care. There is a real need for a return to basic nursing standards, which seem to be forgotten time and time again.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/5">Sadly, we are dealing with a generation that does not complain. People do not complain because they do not want to be picked on or treated wrongly if they make a fuss. But we owe a lot to that generation. It deserves our attention because it is a generation that deserves better.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.193.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" speakername="John Baron" colnum="193"  time="010:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h01.htm#60207h01_spnew17">
	<p pid="a.193.0/1">I add my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> on securing this important debate; he has raised some very important issues. Caring for those who can no longer care for themselves is one of the greatest challenges facing us, as has been recognised in the good contributions made.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/2">Nutrition is clearly of great importance to the well-being of any elderly person, whether in a care home or private accommodation. That was recognised by the Government in their 1998 study, &quot;National diet and nutrition survey: people aged 65 and over&quot;, which revealed that those living in care homes were more likely to be underweight and also reported that one in six residents were deficient in folate&mdash;a B vitamin&mdash;or were anaemic. Most care homes do a good job, but there are undoubtedly cases of under-nourishment in older people. Such cases are still many and varied, which in many respects is what today's debate is about. According to Age Concern, a range of studies have put the prevalence of malnutrition in care homes at between 60 and 100 per cent. Clearly, that is a matter of great concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/3">I do not propose to repeat everything that has been said about nutrition. Many good points have been made. I will endorse one point made earlier: of course nutrition is terribly important, but it is also important that elderly patients have access to that nutrition. In some cases, older people require special assistance to help them eat. That issue needs to be recognised, as does the issue of those suffering from Alzheimer's, who may become confused about whether they have eaten.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/4">In the light of those concerns, what estimate has the Minister made of the scope of nutritional problems facing many elderly people both inside and outside care homes? Is she entirely confident that that Commission for Social Care Inspection has the capability to enforce rigorous standards? I would like her to consider those points in her response. I intend to keep my speech relatively short, so that there is plenty of time for her to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/5">Problems with nutrition in care homes are mirrored in the use of medication. As we have heard, CSCI's report yesterday revealed that almost half of all nursing and care homes fail to meet national minimum standards for how they give medication prescribed by their doctors. Those results are deeply disturbing. It is vital that patient confidence is restored. The report highlighted significant geographical variations in performance and indicated that council-run homes perform significantly worse that voluntary and private homes. It went on to say that there had been few improvements since a similarly critical report in 2004. What measures are the Government going to introduce to ensure that patients in care homes receive the medication prescribed by their doctors?</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/6">Fear of abuse is a chilling problem that affects elderly people in some care homes and private homes, as was well set out by the hon. Gentleman. Many of the activities involved, including physical attacks, sexual abuse and fraud, are already criminal and would be recognised as such. However, elder abuse also includes psychological bullying and neglect. It does not help the situation that because older people are often vulnerable and suffering from mental or physical illness, unique barriers stand in the way of reporting such abuse. Help the Aged has estimated that a staggering 500,000 people are believed to be being abused at any one time in the UK, and yet nearly 40 per cent. of the public have not even heard the term &quot;elder abuse&quot;. Raising awareness and promoting vigilance is therefore a vital step towards tackling the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/7">I am concerned that, although the Department of Health has published guidance for local authorities on the protection of vulnerable patients, there is no legal requirement for local authorities to adhere to its recommendations. I am conscious that the Government are expected to announce today&mdash;they might have already done so this morning&mdash;proposals for the registration, further training and vetting of the approximately 750,000 care workers who look after elderly people. We have asked questions of the Department of Health about the vetting of staff working with vulnerable adults and the operation of the protection of vulnerable adults list, but as yet, we have not received any answers. Will the Minister address that point?</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/8">It is important that the Government's proposals, whatever they may be, which affect a large number of workers in the social care sector, are properly thought through. Otherwise, there will be a risk that the latest initiative will serve to add to the bureaucracy and cost, without necessarily achieving its aims of helping and protecting older people. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about that. With that in mind, perhaps she will explain her Department's response to the campaign led by Held the Aged and Action on Elder Abuse. I joined the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam at the campaign launch. Will the Minister outline what is being done to tackle this serious problem?</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/9">Taking advantage of the broad nature of the debate, if I may, I should like to address another serious problem facing elderly people. It is one that the Government have so far failed to even acknowledge in replies to my letters or when it has been raised at the Dispatch Box. I refer to the shortage of basic chiropody services for elderly people who cannot look after their own feet. Although nail cutting and routine chiropody treatments might seem insignificant to a large number of people, healthy and comfortable feet are especially important for elderly people. It is an issue not only of independence, dignity and mobility, but of helping to prevent dangerous falls.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.0/10">Last year, I raised the case of an 82-year-old lady who was partially sighted, suffered from angina and emphysema, had suffered three strokes, and was unable to bend to attend to her feet. She was told that she was no longer eligible for NHS podiatry care after she changed her GP. Before the KT23 statistical measures were discontinued, they showed that 17 per cent. fewer people were being seen by NHS chiropody departments in 2004&ndash;05 compared with eight years previously.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.3/1">I thought about that, but I might have fallen over my chair if I had tried it.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/2">The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam questioned why we did not have an older people's rights commissioner in England. I draw to his attention the fact that we already have a national director for older people, Ian Philp, who is responsible for implementation and oversight of the national service framework for older people. We would look to him for advice and guidance on those areas. When older people begin to need support at home or elsewhere, whether it comes from family members or health and social care professionals, we should strive to help them maintain their independence and quality of life. We should do so because that is what we would want for ourselves and those close to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/3">As hon. Members have said, caring for older people can be challenging, as I know from personal experience. The House may not know this, but it may be interested to learn that I used to be a care assistant in a residential home for the elderly in Liverpool, working for social services. I know exactly the pressures and demands on staff, requiring not only expert clinical skill, but an ability to empathise with individuals who require support at a time in their life when they are most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> rightly described the difficulties that people at that stage of their lives often experience. Care must be delivered in a way that maximises their independence, respects their autonomy and meets their quality requirements. We take very seriously the standard of care delivered to older people, and that is why we published in 2001 the national service framework to which Members have referred this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/5">That framework, like others, has the twin aims of raising standards of care and reducing inconsistencies between localities in the levels of care. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked why the national minimum standards say nothing about nutrition and the training of catering staff and others. However, the regulations and the national minimum standards do cover nutrition and they are being reviewed. As he said, there was no doubt that I would draw the House's attention to that. There will be full public consultation as we take the review forward, and plenty of opportunity for him and others to give their views on what they think should be included in the national standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.3/1">I shake my head not because the statistics do not show what has been stated, but because the definition used in the QOF for a medication review is not the standard that was set for the national service framework, and the national service framework is therefore not being adhered to.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.4/1">I accept the hon. Gentleman's point; we shall have to study the matter further.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/2">Promoting healthy, active ageing is a key element of the national service framework. Improving diet and nutrition in older people is, of course, an integral part of maintaining health and determining a person's well-being. It is also fundamental to the principles of dignity and respect. We recognise that patients should be involved, wherever possible, in all decisions about their care, including nutrition. The hon. Member for Romsey suggested that five portions of fruit and vegetables a day should be one nutritional requirement for older people. I say to her that older people are adults and, like any of us, can be encouraged to participate in healthy eating programmes, but we cannot insist on that. Clearly, choice is what is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/3">Care home residents regard the food that they are given as one of the most important factors in determining their quality of life and their ability to maintain their health and well-being. We acknowledge that fact in the national minimum standards. Failure to eat through physical inability or depression, or because the food is inadequate or unappetising, can lead to malnutrition, with serious consequences for health. Older people are entitled to nutritious, varied, balanced, culturally sensitive and attractively presented meals at times that suit them. I take the point that hon. Members have made about cooks not being available after 4 o'clock.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/4">The national minimum standards state clearly what we expect. As I have said, CSCI inspects and regulates care homes and has statutory powers to take action if those standards are not being met. As I have shown, the principles of respect and dignity are expressed in a practical way in the national minimum standards, through which registered providers of care, assisted by regulators, can ensure that their services are person-centred, appropriate and effective and that their care staff are trained, supervised and supported so that they are competent to deliver high-quality care.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/5">I shall make one or two further comments on the review. The hon. Gentleman said that there was no screening tool in respect of nutrition for people entering care homes. All stakeholders, including CSCI and the FSA, will have an opportunity to contribute to the review that we are undertaking on the national minimum standards. All the contributions that they make, including his point, will be considered seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/6">I should make a point about the report that CSCI has issued today. We acknowledge the findings in its follow-up study&mdash;this is the second study that it has conducted&mdash;and I am disappointed that care homes appear to have made so little progress towards meeting the national minimum standards on medicines management since its last report. However, CSCI has the responsibility for inspection, as well as the powers it needs to take any necessary and appropriate enforcement action to secure improvements in standards of care in care homes. Ultimately, it has the powers to close poorly performing care homes. I read the review of the report with interest; while being briefed for today's debate, I was a little disappointed to learn that it appeared that CSCI had briefed the hon. Gentleman on the details of the report in advance of briefing Ministers&mdash;that is a cause of some consternation.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/7">The national minimum standards leave providers in no doubt about how the Government expect people to be cared for and treated. Providers should respect that older and vulnerable people have preferences and needs that should be met on an individual basis, and care and treatment should provide safeguards to promote health and well-being. It should be respected that a good quality of life is essential to health and well-being. No one should be deprived of a decent quality of life through neglect, omission, malice or ignorance.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/8">Apart from analysis of calls to the Action on Elder Abuse helpline&mdash;the hon. Member for Billericay asked me to respond specifically to that&mdash;and local data collections on the back of the &quot;No Secrets&quot; guidance, there are no credible national statistics on the incidence and nature of abuse. I have noticed that in recent publicity linked to the campaign on awareness of abuse of older people, Help the Aged has claimed&mdash;the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam pointed this out&mdash;that about 500,000 people experience abuse at any one time. We do not recognise that figure. The Government have consistently expressed reservations about it; it was derived from a small community-based study that took a very wide definition of abuse or harm. Importantly, the figure also does not recognise all that we have done since 1997 to prevent and tackle abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/9">However, I accept that lack of knowledge about the nature and prevalence of abuse is a serious flaw. To help remedy that, we have provided AEA with funding of &pound;280,000, with &pound;150,000 for data capture to take stock of the information that is currently being collected by councils. AEA will advise on the validity and reliability of the information, and make recommendations on what data can be routinely and accurately collected. We are awaiting the final report from AEA, which will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/10">Of course, it is important to acknowledge that the vast majority of care staff are dedicated to their work, as I know, having worked alongside them. They are committed to the welfare of those whom they look after. I am very grateful to all those working in care homes, in individuals' own homes as home helps or equivalents, and in other settings, who provide a high-quality service.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/11">It is important to return to the CSCI report that was published today, because it raises matters of serious concern. The report makes a number of recommendations on issues such as staff training and the development and monitoring of patients to safeguard them from abuse through medication mismanagement, and to maximise their well-being. In the coming year, CSCI will also carry out themed inspections into medication management, sampling homes for controlled drugs management, and its inspectors will pay particular attention to medication management in care homes. Through all this activity, the commission will strive to ensure that it works collaboratively and supportively with its stakeholders in the sector to ensure that the messages from its report are acted upon. The hon. Gentleman made a valid point about the nuclear option of closing a home that has become a haven for many residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/12">The hon. Gentleman also said that it appears that there has been little improvement in managing medicines. We will look carefully at CSCI's recommendations, and a deeper analysis of where exactly homes are failing would be helpful. We will feed CSCI's report into the review of the standards and regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/13">The national service framework for older people recommended that medication reviews be carried out for all people over 75 at least once a year, and that those taking four or more medicines should have a review every six months. In that context, we have also supported a number of primary care trusts to identify and share good practice in medicines management through the national medicines management collaborative. Nearly half of all PCTs have participated in this programme to implement local medicines management schemes so that people get more help from their GPs, pharmacists and others in using their medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/14">One of the measures used for assessing improvement was the proportion of people aged 65 years and over on four or more regular medicines who had had a documented medication review carried out in the last 12 months. There was a significant increase in activity, and in some cases the reported rate of reviews more than doubled. Another measure was the percentage of patients in care homes who have had a documented review of their medicines in the last year. I am aware that some people believe that people in care homes do not have their medicines reviewed regularly, but that is not what the data from the collaborative show. There was a similar increase in activity for patients in care homes, compared with those living at home, albeit from a lower starting position.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.4/15">From a survey of PCTs undertaken in 2004, we know that the majority of PCTs had a written strategy&mdash;I know that things can be put on paper, but they have to be put into practice&mdash;and 60 per cent. of PCTs had agreed local guidelines for medication reviews.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.208.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1485" speakername="Adam Price" colnum="208"  time="011:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h02.htm#60207h02_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.208.0/1">Indeed, and given the Government's vast resources, the money would not matter a great deal to the Treasury, which is why it agreed in principle five or six years ago. In contrast, the issue is of huge significance to the people concerned and their families. As miners tell us time and again, in many cases it is about not the money, but the principle and the need to secure justice for these men, as it was secured in the majority of cases through the COPD scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/2">I am sure that the Minister well tell us, although I hope that he will not, that the problem is the paucity of evidence. I seem to remember that a certain American politician said that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. There is a paucity of evidence, specifically in relation to surface workers, but that is not their fault. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> will tell us, it is the fault of inadequate monitoring of the surface areas of mines, not of those who worked in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/3">Sadly, plenty of evidence points to a causal link between exposure to coal dust and COPD, but there is a lack of specific evidence regarding different components and different jobs, particularly for surface workers. However, some data are available. The Institute of Occupational Medicine has data on 3,930 dust concentration measurements in relation to 13 surface occupational groups at 10 collieries in the UK. Has the Department looked at those measurements?</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/4">As we have heard, there is also international evidence of the adverse effect of exposure to coal dust on the surface. A study of the health of anthracite workers in the United States in 1989 found that after adjusting for factors such as smoking, age and height, the modelling indicated that the predicted decrements for forced expiratory volume per second, which is the relevant measurement, were 120 ml for workers in coal surface jobs and for coal cleaning plant workers. That study is one of the few that have looked specifically at surface workers. Its finding is significant when one considers that a series of studies conducted in UK collieries in the early '70s estimated an average loss of FEV&mdash;forced expiratory volume per second&mdash;of 0.6 to 1 ml per unit of dust exposure. If that is extrapolated, it means that the loss of 120 ml of FEV found among the American anthracite workers is equivalent to a lifetime of exposure at the maximum permitted exposure limit. So the American study shows that surface workers had an average loss of lung capacity equal to exposure at the maximum limit in UK collieries at the time. Clearly that maximum exposure limit was inadequate. That suggests, at the very least, that there is an adverse effect which can be highly significant. I urge the Minister to consider the evidence, as there is evidence to suggest that some surface workers will have contracted COPD as a result of their exposure to coal dust when working on the surface.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/5">There are other relevant factors. A number of studies have discussed the possible relevance of the chemical composition of coal dust in certain parts of the UK and at certain coalfields. Respirable crystalline silica might be a contributory factor for people working in surface areas. There is evidence to show that in a number of cases exposure to coal dust contributes to people contracting COPD.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/6">I am happy to be corrected on this point, but I understand that a miner must have worked underground for five years to qualify. There is evidence in both the US and the UK that loss of FEV is greater among younger miners than older ones and is greater in people who left the industry early than in those who stayed in the industry. One theory is that a certain proportion of people are super-susceptible. Hon. Members who have worked in the coal industry will know of some young miners, who, within a matter of a few months, showed a super-susceptibility to chest problems and were moved to the surface, precisely because they were susceptible to coal dust. Therefore, among that group of workers, there is a concentration of people with a susceptibility. There is evidence of genetic determinants that predispose people to developing COPD. A predisposition does not mean that it is a causal factor, but it does mean that if those people are put in an environment where there is a causal extrinsic factor, they are more likely to develop COPD.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/7">On the basis of the substantial evidence showing the super-susceptibility factor among certain people, the five-year bar is morally wrong and goes contrary to the available scientific evidence. I urge the Minister, on the basis of the data as well as the moral case, to see that the Government do not change their position, as the hon. Member for North Durham said they are, but revert to the one that still exists in the parliamentary minute in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/8">We have had Adjournment debates on a number of occasions, and in the previous one in the Chamber, the Minister said that he would consider the matter again. I hope that he has had an opportunity to do so. Last January, the Deputy Leader of the House&mdash;then the relevant Minister&mdash;said, after an intervention from the former Under-Secretary at the Wales Office that he would revisit this issue. How many times does the Department have to revisit this issue? How many times do we have to have Adjournment debates?</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/9">In the previous debate, the Minister undertook to write to a number of hon. Members on specific matters. I hope that he will be able to relay some of that information to us. May I ask particularly about the issue of a common law case? I understand that the Department's position in October was that it now refuses to accept liability, and it is apparently up to individual miners, many of whom are suffering from crippling lung disease in the latter years of their lives, to bring court cases that may last many years. Why do the Government say that they will enforce an adverse costs order? Such an order would mean that if the Government lost, they would expect the miner's side to pay the costs. That is an inhibiting factors and a reason why a test case is unlikely to be brought. The Government will presumably will use the best Queen's counsel in the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/10">Surely, if there is doubt on this matter&mdash;the evidence that we provided shows that there is at least a scintilla of doubt&mdash;and the Government are prepared to accede to our demands to change their position, the honourable thing would be to say that the case would be neutral in terms of costs. Solicitors have said that they will work for free on the miners' side. Surely, the Government should not impose an adverse costs order against a group of miners who are only asking for justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.0/1">It is a great pleasure to take part in a debate that you are in control of, Mr Cummings. It is probably 20 years since I was last in that situation, but it is good to be back with you.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is important for the people I represent and for the north-east in general. Like others in this room, I worked for a long time&mdash;20 years&mdash;in the coal industry. I mainly worked underground, but I spent a large part of my apprenticeship working on the surface, particularly in coal preparation plants.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/3">A number of points need to be stressed about the real conditions in those workplaces, the first of which concerns the length of shifts. Many surface workers who had long experience of working in the coal industry had to work shifts lasting eight hours and 35 minutes. Over time, that was reduced to eight hours and 20 minutes and finally to eight hours. Whatever the length of shift, though, they were at the workplace and had only a 20-minute break from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/4">A comparison can be made with the men who worked underground, who had a seven and a quarter hour shift. Given that many worked long distances underground, they may have been at their actual place of work for little more than five and a half hours a day. The length of exposure to dust was much greater for people who worked at the surface than for those working underground.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/5">Most coal preparation plants worked continuously throughout the week and, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> mentioned, at the weekend, too. That led to a major demand for men to work weekends to maintain, repair and replace the machinery; I might add that many men had to work weekends to earn a living wage because of the ridiculously low wages paid in the coal industry in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/6">While no dust was being produced as part of the process, mountains of it were blown into the air as a result of stripping out worn-out, broken-down machinery that needed replacing, repairing or maintaining. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham said, his constituents&mdash;blacksmiths and other craftsmen&mdash;were exposed to massive amounts of coal dust.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/7">Airborne dust is a real killer, a fact that has been recognised for years. Underground, men are totally exposed when the coal is cut as part of the production process and as it is being moved out of the pit to the surface. There seems to be a suggestion that the dust produced at the pick point is different from the dust that lies at the surface. That is nonsense: dust is dust. It is not a living thing; it is inert. It clogs people's lungs and airways, whether they are exposed to it underground or on the surface. It makes no difference whether people are half a mile underground operating a coal-cutting machine or 200 ft up on top of a 5,000 tonne coal bunker on the surface.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/8">Most coal preparation plants had a multitude of transfer points where the dust would be blown around as coal was dropped from one conveyer on to another. As has been said, coal crushers exacerbated that, as did screens, whereby coal was moved through various holes to grade it into difference sizes and once again the dust was moved around.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/9">Points have been made about lack of ventilation and good dust suppression. When coal is cut it produces dust, which is effectively sucked away from the pick point as part and parcel of the process to reduce dangerous gases in the coal mine. That led to the dust being moved away quickly to avoid the men operating the machines being directly exposed to it. The dust was still dangerous, still in the air and still affecting people in its path, but at least it was moving. In coal preparation plants, there were few, if any, real ventilation processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/10">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> mentioned what is happening at Harworth colliery, which is obviously one of the few left. People might finally have realised that there is a need to look after people a bit better than they did in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/11">In my experience, ventilation was almost unheard of in coal preparation plants, and the dust suppression equipment was little use, if any. There was no escape from dust. As we tried to do underground, we used dust suppression methods, but they were never anywhere near as good as we had hoped. They could not have been; it is impossible to keep dust totally under control. It was clear that the dust affected the people who worked in coal preparation plants: the many thousands of people dying a horrible, savage death, living out their lives wondering whether their next breath would be their last, and sometimes hoping that it would.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/12">One reason why the case and the compensation scheme were not pursued in 2000 was that there was not enough evidence. One of the main reasons for that was that the records that should have been kept by the National Coal Board, British Coal and the coal owners did not exist. We are saying that we could not compensate the men because the people responsible for taking care of them did not keep adequate records. If that is not negligence, what is?</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/13">A number of comments have been made during the past few years about a compensation culture developing in this country. I have personally, and collectively, as a trade union representative, been involved in claiming millions of pounds in compensation for working men and women in various industries and public services. I could wish for nothing better than never to have to do that again. I wish I had never had to do it in the first place, but I did. I may have to do it again, because people are not treated properly at work and because employers exploit workers and do not look after people properly. It is this Government's responsibility to put the situation right. I praise them&mdash;this has been said before&mdash;for the work they have done in the past decade to redress some of the problems. We must accept that the scandal can go on no longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/14">My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham mentioned what happened in 2000. In that year, a minute was laid in this House that effectively said that we would wait 14 days and, if nobody complained, the compensation scheme would be in place. He might not be aware that seven days after it was laid the Department of Trade and Industry itself changed the rules. Some people say that a week is a long time in politics. That was a long time in politics, and it was a bad week for working people in this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.225.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="225"  time="012:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h03.htm#60207h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.225.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate on the adequacy of ambulance coverage, which is an important issue in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/2">The matter was first raised with me last summer, not long after I was elected, following an incident in the town of Newent. It was drawn to my attention that there was insufficient ambulance coverage. Normally one ambulance and crew was on duty, and sometimes not even that. I took the matter up with Gloucestershire Ambulance Service NHS trust, which confirmed that at times&mdash;specifically, <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-17">Sunday 17 July</phrase>&mdash;only a single responder was on duty at one ambulance station. The decision was taken to team up the member of staff from Newent with the person in Staverton, and the coverage for part of my constituency was therefore provided from Gloucester.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/3">The ambulance trust confirmed in its letter that it used a matrix system, taking historical data as a basis for placing vehicles in the area from which the next call was expected to come while preserving geographical cover. I contend that it might well do the former, but it does not adequately do the latter. It does not preserve geographical cover across the county. One hint of the problems associated with its management information systems was its confirmation that it uses a paper-based system to manage the process, whereas more complex, but more efficient, computer systems are available. To be fair, it also confirmed that the strategic health authority had awarded it &pound;500,000 to invest in the latest technology, which would have more effective facilities for moving ambulances around.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/4">Following that, in January, I received a letter from a concerned paramedic somewhere in the county, expressing the concerns of many paramedics about the matrix system for allocating ambulances. It was clear that resources were being diverted from the Forest of Dean and other rural areas, primarily to cover Gloucester and Cheltenham. I wrote to Philip Selwood, chief executive of the ambulance trust, enclosing a copy of the paramedic's letter, and asked him to comment on some of the areas of concern. I said that it appeared from the letter that the matrix system was not appropriate or that the trust did not have the resources to cover the county properly. I also asked him to comment on how the proposed merger between the ambulance service trusts of Gloucestershire, Avon and Wiltshire would affect emergency coverage.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/5">Mr Selwood comprehensively answered my points in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-20">20 January</phrase>. However, his answers made the situation appear worse rather than better. He confirmed that the trust used a matrix system, saying that it was in place in order to provide optimum cover throughout the county. However, he confirmed that Gloucester and Cheltenham had top place on the matrix, so that they were covered, rather than lower call-volume areas. I asked whether he could say how often my constituency was left without adequate ambulance cover. The situation was a problem, but even more worrying from my point of view was the fact that he was not able to answer that question because the technology and reporting systems were not in place to provide that level of information.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/6">That was worrying in two ways. First, it is always worrying when large organisations that do not have adequate management information to make key decisions about the allocation of resources, make such decisions anyway. That is a concern in the 21st century. Secondly, the matrix system, by its nature, depends on the ability accurately to forecast where emergency calls are likely to arise and therefore where to locate the ambulances across the county. If the trust's management information systems are so poor that Mr. Selwood cannot even tell me how often my constituency is left without adequate ambulance cover, I am not sure how they can operate such a system with any confidence that it will locate ambulances where they are likely to be needed in most cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/7">Mr. Selwood told me that the project to use &pound;500,000 from the strategic health authority to replace the computer-aided dispatch and management information systems and to place mobile data terminals in the accident and emergency vehicles was scheduled for completion in November year. He confirmed that the trust would then have an enhanced reporting system capable of meeting my requests for information.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/8">The letter that I received from the paramedic suggested that if Cheltenham and Gloucester ambulances were busy, vehicles would be pulled in from other areas of the county, which would leave some areas with no ambulances to cover them. Mr. Selwood stated in his letter:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I can confirm that this is the basis of our operating regime; once a vehicle leaves a matrix point that is high in the priority order then an ambulance is moved into the area from an area that is less likely to receive a call. This makes best use of our limited resources.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/10">To be fair, Mr. Selwood also said that the trust has recently introduced an urban response scheme in Gloucester and Cheltenham, with four vehicles based in those city areas, the purpose of which is to reduce the number of occasions when vehicles would have to be moved from rural areas into the urban areas of the county. That has just been done&mdash;or is still in the process of being done&mdash;so I have nothing to show whether it has made any difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/11">The letter from the paramedic also referred to a fatal road traffic collision in the Forest of Dean, in which one person died and six others were injured, treated and taken to hospital. The trust did a good job in one sense. The first vehicle on the scene came from the Cinderford ambulance station and was there within 13 minutes. However, the accident required a further three vehicles, which had to be dispatched from Gloucester and Cheltenham. I am still waiting for the reply about how long those ambulances took, but given the geography involved they would have taken between 30 and 45 minutes to attend the scene.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/12">I would be grateful if the Minister commented on the subject of community responders, where there appears to be a bit of confusion. The paramedic who wrote to me said that ambulance management will argue that community responders provide better patient care, but that they simply give management an excuse to pull ambulances into Gloucester and Cheltenham by having someone who is willing to make the first response in an outlying area. I specifically asked the ambulance trust to comment on that, and Mr. Selwood said:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/13" class="indent">&quot;These schemes are an addition to the normal accident and emergency service we provide not to replace crews or vehicles.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/14">He went on to say that he could confirm that</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/15" class="indent">&quot;the government set standard is to provide an appropriate response to patients within 8 minutes for 75 per cent. of all occasions; this response can be a trained Community Responder with a defibrillator.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/16">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/17" class="indent">&quot;If a responder is sent then this must be backed up by an ambulance within 19 minutes from the time of the initial call for 95 per cent. of all occasions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/18">That seems to contradict what he said.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/19">Community responders mean that the ambulance trust can have the community responder respond in the first instance. The trust then has 19 minutes, rather than eight, in which to supply an ambulance. There is a great temptation for an ambulance trust to put community responders in place, not in addition to, but instead of a properly resourced ambulance network for accident and emergency. I would be grateful if the Minister commented on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/20">Mr. Selwood also said that the ambulance trust is in the process of reviewing its response matrix to make best possible use of the vehicles available. He said that they are seeing a year-on-year increase in activity of 8 to 10 per cent., which is putting a strain on their resources, and that there are times when they would benefit from additional resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/21">The final point in the letter was whether merging the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire ambulance trusts would improve or reduce the service in my constituency. Mr. Selwood said:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/22" class="indent">&quot;The reconfiguration of ambulance services in Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire will provide the Trust with a greater capacity to deliver this new type of service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/23">That new type of service refers to the Government's agenda to recognise that only 10 per cent. of 999 calls are for cases that are truly life-threatening and to help the trusts to deal with those more adequately and to move away from becoming a transport service. Given the level of service at the moment, there is a great deal of scepticism in my constituency about whether that will be successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/24">A number of concerns remain, subsequent to that letter, as the Minister can tell. I wrote to Mr. Selwood again and asked whether, despite the fact that his management information systems do not allow him to confirm exactly how often my constituency is left without adequate ambulance cover, he could give me some idea of that, even if only approximate. As part of the problem is the difference between urban and rural areas and the fact that the more densely populated areas have higher levels of ambulance cover, I have also asked him to comment on whether now that the large urban conurbations of Swindon and Bristol will be included in the new tri-trust area the pressure on rural areas will be exacerbated. Mr. Selwood has unfortunately been away, although I am due to meet him this coming Friday. I hope that I will get the answers to my questions then.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/25">I want the Minister to cover some specific questions. First, can she justify the matrix system used by the ambulance trust? It seems to leave certain areas of the county, particularly rural areas such as my constituency, without proper cover and may put lives at risk. Secondly, how will the merger of the Gloucester trust with the Avon and Wiltshire trusts affect the Forest of Dean? We are on the edge of the county, next to the boundaries with Wales and Herefordshire, so are we particularly likely to lose out, as a number of my constituents suspect?</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/26">I have already drawn attention to the potential effect, linked with the merger, of the incorporation of Swindon and Bristol. If the three ambulance trusts, when merged, have a single method of prioritising cover and a single matrix system, which includes those two extra-large urban areas, will my constituency effectively be left out on a limb with marginal ambulance cover, and will we have to rely on ambulances being sent great distances from those urban areas to respond in emergencies?</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/27">The chief executive alluded to one further area that my constituents find it difficult to understand. I am happy to acknowledge that taxpayers are paying a great deal more tax, which is going into the national health service. If we look at the figures at a national level&mdash;I would be grateful if the Minister told me whether the same is true in my constituency&mdash;there are more ambulance staff and more resources. My constituents find it difficult to understand that, given that resources on the ground seem so patchy. That is one of the central questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/28">Finally, my constituents pay their fair share in tax for the national health service. They deserve proper ambulance coverage and accident and emergency coverage; they deserve the same as in other parts of our county and our country. They do not seem to be getting it, and I would be grateful if the Minister told us what she and the Government plan to do to put the situation right.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.228.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="228"  time="012:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h03.htm#60207h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.228.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> on securing the debate on ambulance coverage in his constituency. It is a matter of concern to him and his constituents. My constituency of Doncaster is not the same as the Forest of Dean&mdash;it is a former mining area&mdash;but the South Yorkshire ambulance service has issues in common with his, both in the urbanised areas of Sheffield and the surrounding rural areas of Sheffield, Barnsley and Doncaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/2">Getting a balance of service in the servicing of rural, semi-rural and urban communities is important. That is one of the reasons why, as I have seen as a constituency MP, the ambulance service has addressed these issues in more recent times by finding better ways of operating, such as parking ambulances in different areas and sharing services with fire stations and others in order to create a service fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/3">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that it is unfortunate that a large number of people still dial 999 in non-threatening situations. In some cases, there are hoaxes; I know this because a few years back, when I was first elected, I spent some time in the control room listening to calls as they came in. There are other reasons for such calls: sometimes people feel that they quickest way they can see someone is to ring 999 and get an ambulance to take them to accident and emergency.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/4">Considerable work is taking place in relation to out-of-hours services and walk-in centres, but also with people responding who can deal with treatment at location. The ambulance service is looking at such different methods around the country and considering its partnership with other health service providers to determine how it can meet needs in the right way.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/5">About 6 million people call 999 each year, and ambulance trusts are the first and most important contact for many people ringing that service, especially if their illness or accident requires it. The range of care provided has been expanded, providing an emergency response but also urgent advice or treatments for patients who are less ill, and care for those whose cannot easily travel to access health care services. The ambulance service has grown in recent times to find different ways of meeting the needs that only their specialist service can provide. I pay tribute to all staff in the hon. Gentleman's area, and throughout the country, who continue to help us to deliver a very good health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/6">Ministers recently approved the merger of three small ambulance trusts to form one trust serving the whole of Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. The new trust should be established from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, and the three existing trusts&mdash;Avon ambulance NHS trust, Gloucestershire ambulance NHS trust and Wiltshire ambulance NHS trust&mdash;will be dissolved. As part of that process, the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority has been reviewing the configuration of ambulance trusts since January 2005, against a background of weak performance in relation to response targets from all three trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/7">The hon. Gentleman's points are perfectly legitimate, and were part of the reason why it was felt that merging the trusts would help in several different ways. The hon. Gentleman gave an example about management systems for collecting data and asked whether IT systems are being put to the best possible use. It is hoped that a bigger trust will make modernisation and reform in such areas more possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/8">A three-month consultation was undertaken between July and October 2005, ahead of national consultation on ambulance trust configurations. The main driver for merger of services in this area was poor performance by the trusts as regards achieving the category A standard, a point emphasised by the hon. Gentleman. For example, in Gloucestershire in 2004&ndash;05, the percentage of category A calls receiving a response within 8 minutes was 71.2 per cent., falling short of the 75 per cent. target. A performance improvement plan has been developed and implemented to improve response times and patient care in Gloucestershire. For example, in the Forest of Dean, community responder schemes have been developed in partnership with St. John Ambulance, with a scheme in Coleford, and a further two teams planned for Cinderford and Newent.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/9">There is clinical evidence that proves conclusively that early defibrillation and resuscitation saves more lives. We acknowledge the valuable support that community responders offer to ambulance services locally. They are trained in life support and first aid and equipped with defibrillators. The use of first responders can ensure that patients receive advanced life support as soon as possible, which we all welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/10">Although the initial emergency response may be to send a rapid response vehicle or an improved first responder, a fully equipped ambulance vehicle, able to transport a patient in a clinically safe manner, is still required to attend the incident within 14 minutes of an initial call in urban areas and 19 minutes in rural areas. It is a local matter for trusts to decide how or where they use community volunteer responders, or other schemes such as community paramedics, as well as other resources, such as traditional ambulance provision. Rapid response vehicles, or motorbikes, for example, are one way to ensure a timely response, but the most important thing is that aid gets to the person involved as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/11">There has been a review of the operational periods for the Newent, Lydney and Coleford vehicles. The Newent vehicle now operates on six nights a week, when it previously operated on three, and the Lydney vehicle now operates on six nights a week, when it previously operated on four. The Coleford vehicle now operates on seven nights a week, when it previously operated on four as well. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman and will form part of his conversation with the chief executive later this week. Those attempts have been made to ensure that there is better operational coverage by those important vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/12">The trust recently purchased eight new replacement accident and emergency vehicles, one of which will be based at Coleford, with a second vehicle at Newent, both covering the Forest of Dean area. The Lydney ambulance station also has a new patient transport service vehicle. The trust is continuing its work with colleagues in the police and fire service to examine how they can reduce deaths in the Forest of Dean area from road traffic collisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/13">The hon. Gentleman referred to a particular case and expressed concern about the time an ambulance took to arrive at the scene of a car accident, only to be followed up by three ambulances. I asked officials to check that situation, and I understand that the accident was initially reported as a category B incident, rather than category A. That may be one reason for the amount of time the first response vehicle took to arrive. Obviously, once it had arrived, an assessment of the situation could be made, which may have changed between the point at which the call came in and when the ambulance arrived. A further three ambulances were then called for. Technically, it was not necessarily the case that the ambulance exceeded its time target; it was more a question of how the accident category was reported in the first instance.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/14">A performance improvement plan has been developed, and I have outlined a few of the areas in which attempts are being made to improve the service. Action is being taken to improve capacity in Gloucestershire as a whole, including four mobile doctors to respond to category A calls, urban responders in Cheltenham and Gloucester, and emergency care practitioners handling 999 calls in the control room to reduce the need for a face-to-face response. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that that is a valuable service.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/15">It makes more sense for people in urban or rural areas, who need to get an ambulance out as soon as possible after a call is made, if someone in the control room can assess their needs and deal with them over the phone,. I understand why some people make certain calls but they are not always the most appropriate for a 999 response Unlocking some of the jams in the system is one of the ways in which we can try to manage things and ensure that people, wherever they live, get the service fit for their need in an emergency. The new ambulance trust will support those improvements to the level and type of service provided to users, while obviously looking at greater capacity and opportunities for flexibility and shared learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/16">The hon. Gentleman referred to the matrix system used to plan where resources should be used and situated. He is right. It is not new to his area; it is a long-standing system for planning where ambulances should be. It is one of the reasons why, in recent years, we have had more discussions about ambulances being out on location, rather than stuck in ambulance stations, and about resources shared with fire and police services as a means to facilitate the needs of staff, so that they are not just stuck in a lay-by eight hours a day. Part of that process has involved trying to consider the number of calls and where they come from.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/17">The system has been used historically, and it has been helpful, but I understand that work is being done to look more closely at how the matrix works. Returning to my previous point, one area that might be considered is the number of calls that come in from a particular area and how many of them really are category A calls, as opposed to calls that should have been dealt with through health provision in the community. It is worth considering that issue. If we can bring down the number of calls that result in an ambulance being wrongly sent out, that will give more room for management and service providers to think about how they will meet the needs of the more rural areas, which are more difficult to get to in because of the surrounding roads and so on. That would be helpful, and I am sure that it would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman talked about those issues with the chief executive when he meets him later this week.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/18">The national picture has an impact on the local picture. The Government's spending on ambulance services has increased from &pound;617 million in 1997 to &pound;1.2 billion in 2003&ndash;04, an increase of more than 75 per cent. It is always important that people look at what we have now. I can understand people wanting more, but it is important to reflect on the situation in the past, which might not be in their living memory, and the lack of investment then.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/19">We felt that it was right to set a standard that at least 75 per cent. of 999 calls for immediate life-threatening conditions should have an ambulance response within eight minutes. In 2001, fewer than 71 per cent. of those calls were responded to in eight minutes. Over the past two years, performance against that call standard has exceeded 75 per cent. Surveys that we have carried out with patients show that 98 per cent. are overwhelmingly satisfied with the care that they receive. That is in the face of consistently increasing demand for ambulance services. Our funding reflects our understanding of that, but we also understand that the issue is not just about funding; it is about modernising and reforming the service to ensure that it provides the right service for the right sort of need.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/20">I am pleased that there has been a demonstrable improvement in patient care, particularly in cardiac care. We are confident that, while recognising the local issues, larger trusts will deliver a better, more responsive, more efficient service, which people have a right to expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/21">Although progress has been made nationally in the ambulance service, we know that the contribution ambulance trusts could make to the wider health agenda has not been fully utilised. That is why we appointed Peter Bradley to lead a strategic review of ambulance service delivery, &quot;Taking healthcare to the patient: Transforming NHS ambulance services&quot;, which was published last June to widespread support. The review sets out a compelling vision for ambulance services and makes recommendations in five key areas: improving clinical and managerial leadership to match new models of care, improving the consistency and quality of care provision, improving efficiency and effectiveness, supporting performance improvement, and developing the work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/22">The benefits of delivering that vision will include patients receiving improved care, with potentially 1 million fewer unnecessary accident and emergency attendances; greater job satisfaction for staff as they use their additional knowledge and skills to care for patients; a more effective and efficient use of NHS resources; and improvements in self-care and health promotion.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/23">We know that patients calling 999 are a mix of those with clinically urgent needs and those who view their condition as urgent. The report makes it clear that ambulance trusts need to widen the range of services that they provide. They need to work closely with other urgent care providers so that alternatives can be found for patients who do not need an ambulance. Some of those can and should be delivered by the ambulance service, but it is clear that some should not. In taking the report forward, we are building on the excellent service already delivered and the dedication and skills that have made the service what it is today. It is important that our vision sets out a service that will deliver the best possible care to patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/24">The work that has been done in the past 12 months to move to merge the three trusts is a step in the right direction. Clearly, more discussion is taking place on providing services, particularly in the rural parts of the area covered. As I said before, I understand that there is some work considering the matrix, the number of calls, their nature, and what problems that may present for operational management.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/25">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees that people need a prompt and efficient ambulance service. Such a service should be based on the need of the individual. We must ensure that other calls do not get in the way of providing that prompt service to his area, my area and the rest of England.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1930" name="Ben Chapman">the Member for Wirral, South (Ben Chapman)</phrase> on securing the debate. He was right to state at the outset that there is a lot of common ground, and I disagree with very little of what he said. I congratulate him on the powerful case that he made and on his clear enthusiasm for this strategy to tackle the problem. We agree on the analysis of its implications. I am therefore pleased to have the opportunity to outline the Government's approach to yellow buses and to place them in the wider context of the travel-to-school schemes that we are working to deliver with the Department for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/2">I shall start by setting out the background to our joint work with the DFES on school travel and then outline our research on pilot yellow school bus schemes. That includes the support, which my hon. Friend knows we are providing, for the pilot scheme in west Yorkshire. I shall also consider the funding of such schemes and the potential for expanding the yellow bus programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/3">The joint work that we are doing with the DFES on the school journey aims to make it easier and more attractive for pupils to walk, cycle or take the bus to school, as an alternative to travelling by car. We want parents and pupils to have options when travelling to school&mdash;walking or cycling where it is possible and safe to do so and, for longer journeys, taking the bus. We want to encourage independent travel as far as possible, where that is safe and convenient.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/4">By encouraging children to get into sustainable travelling habits early in their lives, we will nurture a new generation of travellers who do not think twice about walking, cycling or using public transport as part of their daily routine. How children travel to school also has an impact on their broader health and welfare. The decline in walking and cycling which has taken place since the 1980s has coincided with a wider reduction in levels of physical activity by children of all ages, and that decrease in activity has contributed to rising levels of obesity in young people. The DFES and the Department of Health have a shared public service agreement target to reverse the upward trend in childhood obesity. In order to deliver on that target, we will need to be successful in making children more active in their daily lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/5">Walking is already an important mode of travel to school, with around 50 per cent. of five to 10-year-olds and 44 per cent. of 11 to 16 year-olds walking. In light of comments about there being very few children who travel much more than a mile by foot or bicycle at present, my hon. Friend may be interested to know that in the last period for which we have statistics&mdash;2003&ndash;04&mdash;of the children who travelled between 1 and 2 miles to school, a third of those aged between five and 10, and almost two thirds of those aged between 11 and 16, walked, and 4 per cent. of those aged 11 to 16 cycled. Cycling and walking&mdash;even walking to and from a bus stop&mdash;are obvious ways in which we could make children more active in their daily lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/6">The travelling to school initiative was launched in September 2003 by the current Home Secretary&mdash;who at that time was the Secretary of State for Education and Skills&mdash;and the Secretary of State for Transport. The key objective of the initiative was to get a good quality school travel plan into every school in England by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/7">A school travel plan is a joint initiative, agreed between schools, pupils, and local authorities, to improve travelling conditions around schools&mdash;to make it easier to walk, cycle or use the bus. The travelling to school initiative includes a number of measures to support and encourage the development of school travel plans. With the DFES, the Department for Transport has funded the appointment of a network of about 250 school travel advisers and regional school travel advisers based in local authorities. Their job is to support schools in developing travel plans, to provide advice on good practice, and to ensure that the plans meet the high-quality standards of the project. As a further incentive to schools to create such plans, the DFES has provided capital grants to schools which have produced agreed travel plans. The grants are worth about &pound;5,000 for a typical primary school and &pound;10,000 for a typical secondary school.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/8">I am pleased to report that progress has been extremely positive. We have exceeded our key project milestone of getting 6,000 plans into place by the end of March 2005, and we are on track to achieve the level of 10,000 schools by the end of March 2006. To date, we have paid out more than &pound;30 million in grants to support the development of travel plans. They have provided a range of sustainable investment in travel initiatives, such as safe and secure lockers, storage facilities and shelters for children bringing their bicycles to school, and improved bus access.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/9">Having set out the broader context of travel to work, I shall talk more specifically about the role of bus services, and in particular the role of dedicated school buses. We recognise that walking and cycling are not the best options for every journey. Where no safe walking or cycling routes are available, or where a pupil lives a long way from school, travelling by bus can be the best option, and it is certainly environmentally preferable to the private car. We are keen that a key objective of the travelling to school initiative should be to make the bus a positive choice for more parents and children.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/10">Bus travel allows children to socialise with each other and to become independent and confident public transport users at an early age. Bus and coach accidents are very rare; they are the safest mode of passenger road transport. They also generally produce fewer emissions. School travel plans can contain a range of measures to encourage bus use, from engineering improvements around schools to revisions to services negotiated with commercial operators. They can build on the wider work being done by local authorities to promote the use of local bus networks, including supporting concessionary fares.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/11">I have explained some of the ways in which local authorities can improve the attractiveness of bus services for the school journey. However, as my hon. Friend is aware, some local authorities have gone beyond that and developed proposals for dedicated networks of school buses on the United States of America model, designed for the exclusive use of pupils on the journey to school. My Department was interested in exploring the potential costs and benefits of dedicated school buses in respect of encouraging more pupils to travel to school by bus. Therefore, in 2002&ndash;03 we carried out an initial evaluation of some of the early yellow school bus pilots, including schemes in Runnymede in Surrey, Hebden Bridge in west Yorkshire and Wrexham in north Wales. We also considered other dedicated school bus schemes. That evaluation exercise confirmed that well designed yellow school bus schemes had the potential to reduce car dependency in terms of the journey to school, and that they were usually popular with parents and pupils. Parents particularly valued the security of having a regular driver, allocated seating and services direct to the school gate. I share the view that they can have a positive effect on antisocial behaviour as well as on pupil safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/12">The evaluation did, however, conclude that unless they were carefully designed, dedicated school bus schemes could have some unintended adverse consequences. In one pilot area, the introduction of the dedicated bus had the effect of driving out of business a key local commercial bus service, which was relied on for a wide range of non-school journeys. We also found that new bus services offered to pupils living only a short distance from schools could reduce levels of walking and cycling.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/13">Dedicated school buses can offer considerable benefits but they also come at a cost, as my hon. Friend recognised. Our research suggests that while parents are willing to make some payment for dedicated schools buses, that is in effect capped at about &pound;1 a day, which is unlikely to be enough to make them a commercially viable proposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/14">In response to our evaluation report, which was published in 2003, we said that we would welcome proposals from local authorities for well designed dedicated bus schemes where they could demonstrate that they could be effective in meeting local transport and education needs. To date, we have offered &pound;18.7 million of local transport capital funding to the west Yorkshire MyBus scheme, which is a large-scale dedicated bus scheme. Once fully implemented, the scheme will provide about 150 buses serving secondary and primary schools in various locations throughout west Yorkshire. As my hon. Friend knows, I visited there not long ago and I was very impressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/15">Although implementation of the scheme is still at a relatively early stage, it has achieved a 10 per cent. reduction in the number of primary school children who normally travel by car to the schools taking part. The scheme is popular with head teachers, parents, drivers and children, and offers qualitative evidence of positive impacts on behaviour, attendance and children's personal safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/16">We are aware that further dedicated bus schemes are under development around the country. As I have made clear to my hon. Friend, we would not rule out any of these being funded as major schemes in the same way as in west Yorkshire, but we have to be realistic about the level of funding available through that route. I take on board the point about other options for funding being available, but unfortunately very few of them are unlimited.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/17">We are considering advice from regional bodies on their recommended major scheme programmes for the next 10 years. I cannot say anything further on that at present. However, we are keen for such options to be examined and, as long as they are clearly set in a broader context&mdash;of understanding their impact on commercial bus services, and of any perverse consequences&mdash;we would like to explore what possibilities there are for them to be extended.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/18">In the broader context, yellow school buses can play an important role, but they are only one strand in a travelling to school programme on which we are making solid progress, and which chimes in with the objectives and analysis of the problems that my hon. Friend articulated.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.241.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" speakername="Laurence Robertson" colnum="241"  time="013:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h05.htm#60207h05_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.241.3/1">To Gloucestershire, I mean. There have been grants of &pound;125 million or thereabouts to organisations in Gloucestershire. If Tewkesbury were to get the same amount as other constituencies in Gloucestershire, it would get some 16.7 per cent. of that money. I accept that there will be variations, but it currently gets only 4.49 per cent. That figure is very slightly up since last time I held a debate on the subject, when it was 3.4 per cent., but at this rate I calculate that it will take us 44 years to get up to the average. We now get the very slightly increased 4.49 per cent., but it is not acceptable that organisations in Tewkesbury should lose out to that extent. Tewkesbury has received only &pound;5.6 million, whereas if we were to get the average, the figure would be something like &pound;21 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/2">Let me compare the figures for the other constituencies in Gloucestershire. Cheltenham has received nearly &pound;23 million; Cotswold &pound;25 million; Forest of Dean &pound;10 million; Gloucester &pound;38 million; Stroud almost &pound;24 million; and Tewkesbury only &pound;5.6 million. The point is that we are not even remotely close to amounts received in other constituencies; if we got 12 or 13 per cent. of the money coming into the county, I probably would not have held three debates on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/3">The natural response, which I have heard in the past, has been to ask whether organisations in Tewkesbury are actually applying for sufficient numbers of grants. Well, it is difficult to tell these days. When I held my first debate, the figures were available from the Government, and they showed that Tewkesbury was applying for plenty of grants. By the second debate in 2002, those figures were not available from the Government, and I have not been able to access them in any way, so I cannot answer whether organisations in Tewkesbury are applying for as many grants as those in other parts of the county. As far as I know, those figures are not available, although they certainly used to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/4">I can cite a number of grant applications that have been turned down. As far as I can see, they were very good applications indeed. Tewkesbury sports centre had two failed bids. It is based at a successful school that takes children from all kind of backgrounds. The school serves some areas that are perhaps a little more prosperous, but it also serves areas such as Priors Park, which is undergoing a great deal of regeneration, and Northway, where there are ongoing problems with youths on street corners. The school is ideally positioned to help those people, yet the sports centre has had two failed bids.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/5">The Jet Age museum has made at least one bid, perhaps two. As the Minister will be aware, it is in the area where the jet engine was invented. There is a good deal of heritage about the museum, which deals with an important part of our history. I have visited it on a number of occasions, and it is very well run indeed. A number of enthusiastic people are involved with it, yet it has not been able to access lottery money. Nor is it based in the most prosperous of areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/6">Tewkesbury and District Council of Voluntary Services had an application turned down. That was to support various voluntary organisations in the borough, such as a support-for-the-elderly day care centre. It would have brought together a whole range of voluntary agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/7">Churchdown sports centre's bid failed, too. I have mentioned that before. The reason given for its failure was that it was within 20 minutes' drive of a similar facility in Gloucester. The point I have made in the past is that children do not drive, or should not, and if they get a lift from their parents, it means four journeys&mdash;that is, going there and back twice. That is at a time when we are supposed to be reducing car journeys and building sustainable communities. The reason given for that failure is not acceptable. As a result of the failed bid, the sports centre is struggling, and the borough council wonders whether it can continue to support the centre, the very existence of which is now in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/8">It would be a very retrograde step if that sports facility were lost; I want to press that home to the Minister. Churchdown is still technically a village, but it has a population of some 10,000 or 11,000, depending on how wide one makes the count. It is an area with a lot of young people, and they need something to do. It is not over-endowed with facilities. I deeply regret that that organisation did not manage to get the grant, and that it is struggling now.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/9">To go back to 2002, Tewkesbury got a little bit of money under the fair share initiative, but it was way, way down on the list. I have looked into the new scheme, and it seems that Tewkesbury will not be one of the areas that will benefit. I am the first to say that the national lottery has been a great success. In my notes, I have put it in brackets that it .was a Conservative success, but it would not be right to dwell on that. The lottery has raised &pound;18 billion for good causes, and I understand that 220,000 projects have succeeded. Indeed, there have been some success in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/10">Only recently in a village called Bishop's Cleeve a new sports area was opened by the very famous Sir Geoff Hurst; it was a great privilege to have him in the village, although he lives in Cheltenham now. It was a successful day and he was very popular, and the new facility is very good. In the village of Twyning, where I happen to live, there is a very good sports facility, although I played no part in attracting the money. I am not in any way knocking the national lottery or saying that we have not had any benefit at all; we certainly have, but not the kind that we deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/11">When I explored this issue in the past, the question was raised of how we determine where the money should go. One of the issues that has been put to me is that of deprivation: areas that are deprived should receive more funding than those that are not. I accept that there is a certain logic to that, but the problem is how we measure deprivation. One problem is that when a fairly large area is assessed, there may well be pockets of deprivation, although the whole area may not be deprived according to all the measures. That is one problem that we have had in Tewkesbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/12">A lot of rural areas are deprived. The area that I represent is very rural; there are some built-up areas, as I have mentioned, but there are pockets of rural deprivation, too. There are many small villages without any shops or facilities at all. Quite often, public transport between villages is very poor. There are quite poor rail links between Gloucestershire as a whole and London, for example. There are trains, but it may be surprising to hear that one often has to change at least once in the journey from Cheltenham to London. That is rather surprising, because Cheltenham is a main town and a lot of things go on there, yet the rail link is poor. There is a better rail link north of my constituency, which goes up to Evesham&mdash;it is not particularly brilliant, but it is better&mdash;but there is not a good link between Gloucestershire and London. We have a problem there.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/13">There are a lot of farmers in my area, and farming incomes continue to fall. Quite a number of rural post offices have closed, and, if I may be controversial for a moment, the hunting ban has not helped the countryside. I put that very gently. A number of rural pubs in my area are also very concerned about the proposed smoking ban.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/14">There are pockets of deprivation in my constituency. People perhaps think of Tewkesbury as a good Tory seat, which must be rich, but that is not so. It is a mixed area: there are prosperous parts, but there are also many areas that are not. If we are using deprivation as a measure of where to send the money, we need to look more closely at Tewkesbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/15">There is also the heritage aspect. The battle of Tewkesbury took place in 1471. As a Lancastrian, I do not want to say the wrong side won when the Yorkists got their last great victory of the war of the roses&mdash;we got our own back at Bosworth field. There is great heritage in the town. The townsfolk got together and collected money to pay off King Henry VIII, and the famous Tewkesbury abbey survived. Two rivers meet there&mdash;the Severn and the Avon&mdash;and we have lots of rich history. However, we need some help from funds, such as the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/16">Even under the Heritage Lottery Fund, however, Tewkesbury comes bottom of the league in Gloucestershire. We cannot get even get the funding for heritage. We are bottom of the league in terms of charitable organisations and arts funding. With millennium funding, we are fifth out of six, but only by &pound;2,000. We are fifth in sports funding, by some &pound;2,000. In health, education and the environment we come fifth, but by only &pound;3,000. In virtually every way we look at it, Tewkesbury comes bottom of the Gloucestershire league. If we look at the six headings&mdash;arts, charity, heritage, millennium, sports and health, education and the environment&mdash;and the six constituencies, making a multiple of 36 different bids, we come last almost every time.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/17">I genuinely do not know why this is so. Organisations in Tewkesbury have submitted applications, but some that failed were good and solid and not in any way frivolous, and an awful lot of work went into preparing them. I can personally vouch for those organisations. Those applications failed, but throughout the county millions of pounds has gone to organisations in other constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/18">I want to finish where I started. I wish the successful organisations well, and I am pleased that they have received funding, but I think that the Minister will agree that the 4.5 per cent. of the funding that we receive in Tewkesbury does not look right&mdash;it seems unfair&mdash;and is only a slight increase on the 3.5 per cent. that we got when I last had this debate. I hope that I do not have to return to the Chamber to take up hon. Members' and the Minister's time by complaining yet again. I am more than happy to meet the Minister or his officials to discuss how we might assess what is going wrong, and how we might decide how to put it right.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.3/19">Perhaps the Minister or his officials might find time to help me in that respect. For now, I should like him to give me whatever answers he feels he can. I am grateful to him for turning up. I know that he has many other issues to deal with, but I stress that we have seen great benefits coming from the very few projects that have been financed in Tewkesbury and I want to extend that to the other applications that have been made on the part of the people of my constituency.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-07a.244.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" speakername="Richard Caborn" speakeroffice="The Minister for Sport"  colnum="244"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060207/halltext/60207h05.htm#60207h05_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.244.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> on securing the debate. I shall try to answer some of his questions. When we met last night in the Strangers Bar, Sheffield United lost 4&ndash;1 to Watford, so it was a bad evening. I have recovered since then, however, and I shall hopefully give him positive answers.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/2">As the hon. Gentleman said, this is not the first time that he has taken the opportunity to ask questions about his constituency and national lottery funding, and, as he rightly said, this is not the first time that I have had the privilege of speaking on the subject. He obviously cares deeply that his constituency should be taking every opportunity to reap the benefits of lottery funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/3">I should like to put on the record straight away that if the hon. Gentleman writes to me about his concerns about applications being turned down, I shall get my officials to write to the various distributors&mdash;the Heritage Lottery Fund, or whatever&mdash;and find the official reasons why they were refused. That might be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/4">The national lottery has become one of the most successful lotteries in the world. Since 1994, it has raised in excess of &pound;18 billion for good causes and more than 224,000 grants have been made to projects all over the UK. Lottery funding has made the greatest difference in our communities. In fact, 65 per cent. of all lottery grants have been for small amounts of money&mdash;sometimes less than &pound;5,000&mdash;which spreads the benefits of lottery funding far and wide. Although a &pound;5,000 sum probably does not seem a lot, to many organisations such an amount has had major effects and they have done tremendous work with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/5">Nearly half the total amount of money awarded has gone to projects in the 100 most deprived local authorities. The hon. Gentleman is concerned about that. The distribution of national lottery funds was never intended directly to match the population pound for pound in each constituency or region, but it was intended to respond to particular needs by ensuring that grants are made to projects that would not normally be funded through taxation and that areas of significant disadvantage are the first to benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/6">Our policy and the policy of the previous Government is to encourage the fair distribution of lottery funding across the United Kingdom&mdash;not that every county or constituency will receive the same amount. We recognise that not all areas of the country are the same. Rural and urban areas have different needs and these differences can cause a variation in funding which is inevitable, particularly for larger grants. The hon. Gentleman raises a valid point about his constituency and I shall look into it. I shall look in particular at the Churchdown sports centre to see what the reasons were for turning it down.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/7">Throughout the life of the lottery we have recognised that changes needed to be made to ensure that lottery money is spread fairly throughout the country and to reflect the different groups in our society. The hon. Gentleman may be familiar with the measures that we have taken, but I think it is useful to remember how we have responded to make lottery money more accessible for all. We changed the lottery's original emphasis on capital grants to spending on people and activities and we have opened up access to lottery funding. We gave the distributing bodies the power to solicit lottery applications from priority areas to address concerns that some areas lacked the infrastructure or skills to put together an application. I do not know whether that is a problem in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, but we will consider it. We also gave the distributing bodies the power to delegate decision making to regional and local level, enabling them to be more responsive to local needs We tasked the distributing bodies to draw up a strategic plan for funding to ensure that lottery money goes to areas and projects that need it most.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/8">The distributing bodies have also responded to the challenge. The Community Fund's fair share initiative initially delivered &pound;180 million of lottery funding to 77 specially targeted disadvantaged areas in both rural and urban areas of the UK. Other specific initiatives have targeted former coalfield areas and seaside resorts. Those measures have had the right effect. For example, by the end of 1998, Tewkesbury had received just 33 lottery grants worth a total of &pound;722,000; during the following five years, from 1999 to 2005, it received 188 grants totalling &pound;4.7 million, an increase both in the number and value of grants, although, as the hon. Gentleman's figures demonstrate, the area could still do considerably better.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/9">Part of the problem is that the information on lottery grants to individual constituencies does not tell the whole story. For example, if a grant is given to an organisation whose headquarters is in a particular city, it will be credited to that city, although its benefits might be felt in a much wider geographical area, and sometimes across the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/10">The situation can be difficult to gauge. Looking at the statistics for my constituency of Sheffield, Central, it seems that we get many more grants than anybody else. That is not because I happen to be the Minister with responsibility for the lottery, but because grants are made to places in the city centre that benefit not only Sheffield but the whole of south Yorkshire, and sometimes north Derbyshire as well. How the funds are distributed should be factored into our considerations.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/11">Each application is assessed on its merits against criteria laid down by the distributing body, but because there are always more applications than can be funded, the process has to involve an element of competition. Some projects are unsuccessful. Many times my ministerial colleagues and I are asked to intervene in lottery applications, but we are unable to do so because lottery distributors are responsible for making decisions on individual grants and are independent of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/12">Government policy directions set only the broad framework within which the distributing bodies operate. The directions require them, for example, to have regard to the different parts of the UK, encourage sustainable development, and reduce economic and social deprivation, while creating benefits. Often the problem is that particular areas do not put in many applications for lottery funding or apply for small amounts, and although their success rate can be very good, they do not do as well as other areas that have submitted more applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/13">Many of the provisions of the National Lottery Bill, currently under scrutiny in another place, will add to the measures that we have taken to improve the distribution of lottery funding. The Bill will set up a new distributor&mdash;the Big Lottery Fund&mdash;as the one-stop shop for voluntary and community grants; enable all lottery distributors to promote the national lottery as whole, rather than their own good causes; and allow the distributing bodies to involve the public in decision making, so that local people have a say on where lottery money goes. It might go, for example, to good projects with community support that will enhance their community's quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/14">There is no quick fix for constituencies or regions that feel that they are not getting their fair share of lottery grants. However, it is important to remember that lottery funds are finite and dependent on receipts from the national lottery game. That means that the majority of programmes are over-subscribed and that there is always strong competition for grants. The distributing bodies have to make difficult decisions to ensure that the funding available to the good causes is used most effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/15">The national lottery has evolved over the years to meet better the changing needs of applicants and ensure that more communities have access to lottery funding. We will continue to monitor the situation and we will try to deal with problems if they occur. As I said, if the hon. Gentleman writes to me about specific grants that have been turned down, my officials will contact the various lottery distributors to find out why, and I hope that the problem will be rectified. However, that will have to be done within the funding structure under which the lottery operates because the final decisions are taken by the lottery distributors without interference from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/16">I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels reassured. There is no doubt that the lottery is a success story; it is one of the most successful lotteries in the world. I acknowledge that it was brought in by the Conservatives. At the time, some of my hon. Friends voted against it, as did the Liberals, but now we have all accepted that it is an incredible institution that does tremendous good up and down this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/17">We have tried to refine the lottery, and this time we have refined it against a background of wide consultation. The fact that it is played so frequently shows that it is a credible institution in itself. If we continue to refine it as we have over the years, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will not have to bother securing any more debates on the subject, and for that I shall be eternally grateful.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/18" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.0/19" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at five minutes to Two o'clock.</p>
