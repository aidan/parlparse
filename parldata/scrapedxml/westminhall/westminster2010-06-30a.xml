<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-06-30a.223.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40636" speakername="Sharon Hodgson" colnum="223"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100630/halltext/100630h0001.htm#10063026000226">
	<p pid="a.223.2/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate on free school meals because it allows me to highlight a shameful decision by the coalition Government. Despite the current financial situation facing our country, an extremely strong case can be made for the provision of universal free school meals. The fact that the Government are choosing to limit and cut that provision instead of widening it seems to be a step in the wrong direction, not just because of the provision's health and educational benefits to pupils, but because of its the financial benefits for the least well off in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/2">My involvement and that of my hon. Friends in the Chamber started in 2006, not long after I was elected to the House. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40174" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods)</phrase> and I, with around a dozen other hon. Members, went on a fact-finding visit to Sweden, primarily to find out more about the Swedish health and education systems, and particularly free schools. While in Sweden, my attention was captured not by free schools, but the country's school meals policy. Free school meals have been available there to all children for several years. The take-up is approximately 85%, and we were amazed to see children not only tucking into a healthy, nutritious meal, but serving themselves from a buffet and working together to help to clear away plates and wipe the tables. Those children were seven.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/3">Pupils and teachers eat together as a class on a rota system so that there are no huge crowds at lunch time, which is an important part of the day for continued learning and socialising, not only with one other, but with the teacher. The system provides an opportunity for teachers to have time to themselves-they spend 40 minutes in the staff room when the children go out to play-and the children do not load up on sugary snacks and then sit down to afternoon study while metaphorically swinging from the lampshades. It was interesting that although my hon. Friend and I returned from Sweden excited and convinced of the benefits of universal free school meals, the new Secretary of State for Education returned from his visit to Sweden considerably more excited about free schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/4">Since 2005, there has been a sea change in our attitude to the healthiness of school meals, thanks partly to the high-profile campaign by Jamie Oliver. The changes since then have been crucial. The food provided to children who choose school meals is, more often than not, fresh, nutritious and locally sourced. That is a far cry from the profit-driven mentality that previously dominated school meal provision and led to children eating such monstrosities as turkey twizzlers. That was only the first part of the necessary change, and when we had made school food healthy, it was our duty to ensure that as many children as possible ate it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-06-30a.224.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40636" speakername="Sharon Hodgson" colnum="224"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100630/halltext/100630h0001.htm#10063026000228">
	<p pid="a.224.1/1">Exactly. I shall come to that, and it is why I call for universal free school meals.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/2">Last week, an Ofsted report found that although the quality of school meals had increased, the take-up of free school meals by those entitled to them remained low because of stigma, complexity and some families' constant movement in and out of entitlement. I received free school meals from the day I started school until the day I left, so I can speak about the stigma from personal experience. Even today, a significant stigma is attached to receiving free school meals, and expanding access to all is the fairest way of eradicating that stigma.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/3">One in five children who are eligible for free school meals do not receive them. In addition, a swathe of forgotten children is not entitled to them, although they definitely live in poverty. A healthy packed lunch might be too expensive for their parent or parents, who might be in a low paid, full-time job and rushing about doing their best to look after their children. Universal free school meals are undoubtedly the best way to address all those problems, but they would do more than that; they would ensure that all children had a healthy meal during the school day. Some parents may be able to shop at Waitrose or Marks and Spencer, but it does not follow that their child's lunch box is healthy. A ready meal from Marks and Spencer may cost more than a ready meal from Asda or Tesco, but it is still a ready meal, and we should not assume that all children go home to healthy food just because they have an upmarket postcode.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/4">That is why my colleagues and I have campaigned so strongly on the matter for the past four years. We have lobbied incessantly. We lobbied the Child Poverty Action Group to take up the cause, and I am delighted to see my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40589" name="Kate Green">the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green)</phrase> in the Chamber today and look forward to hearing her valuable contribution to the debate. Believe it or not, the issue was not always popular. There were objections even in my own party to rolling out free school meals regardless of household income. However, it remains the fairest way to ensure that all children below the poverty line, however that is measured, receive a healthy meal during the school day.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/5">I chased Cabinet Ministers through the voting Lobby to try to convince them of our crusade to such an extent that they pre-empted me before I had even said a word by telling me that the matter was still being considered, and eventually to tell me that it was with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40208" name="Edward Miliband">the Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband)</phrase>, who was writing our manifesto. I need not say what happened next, as I am sure that hon. Members can imagine, but I became his shadow and was always ready to extol the virtues of universal free school meals.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/6">The first big success for our campaign came at the Labour party conference in 2008 when my right hon. Friends the Members for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) and for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson) announced the introduction of three pilots for free school meals, all to be local authority match funded. Two pilots were for universal free school meals; Durham and Newham bid for them and were lucky enough to secure them. My hon. Friends the Members for City of Durham and for West Ham (Lyn Brown) played a great part in that. The further pilot involved raising the threshold to the agreed poverty line to ensure that more children in poverty qualified for free school meals, and that went to Wolverhampton.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/7">Those pilots have been under way for nearly a year. They have been hugely successful, especially those involving universal free school meals in Newham and Durham, where take-up is 75% and more than 80% respectively. That means that the majority of primary school pupils in those boroughs receive a hot, healthy, nutritious meal instead of the sugary, additive-laced snacks that some children are given in their packed lunches.</p>

	<p pid="a.225.1/1">My hon. Friend is right, and I will come on to the Hull experiment.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/2">The quality of packed lunches is usually dependent on cost, but do not take my word for that, Mr Weir. Research by Professor Derek Colquhoun of the university of Hull showed that it is not always possible for families to access, let alone afford, fresh food for their children. The alternative of paying for school meals may cost almost &#163;20 a week for a family with two children-money which those still living below the poverty line do not have.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.1/3">I look forward to hearing more about the success of the Durham and Newham pilots from my hon. Friends the Members for City of Durham and for West Ham. Unfortunately, due to the recession, universal free school meals did not make it into our manifesto, but our party gave a commitment in the 2009 pre-Budget report to extend the universal free school meals pilots to at least one in every region, and permanently to raise the access threshold everywhere else to &#163;16,190 to enable a further 500,000 children to have a free, hot and healthy lunch every day. That approach would also lift a further 50,000 children out of poverty, which was welcome news as far as my colleagues and I were concerned. Such a measure would also be an important first step on the way to universal entitlement, and I welcome it as still affordable, even during a recession.</p>

	<p pid="a.226.0/1">My hon. Friend raises an issue that I was coming to-I fear that she makes the point better than I would have done. A lot of hon. Members in the coalition Government are not getting that point, but hopefully the contributions that my hon. Friends and I make today will put paid to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/2">Confusingly, although the new Government committed themselves to meeting the child poverty targets set by the previous Government, the Secretary of State for Education announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-09">9 June</phrase> that the coalition Government would not be going ahead with the additional pilot schemes, or the extension of schemes to include more low-income families. That is devastating news for the families concerned. The extension would have eased the transition into work for many parents-my hon. Friend has just spoken about that-and supported the Government's wider drive to improve educational and health outcomes among the least well off in our society. It seems that the Education Secretary wants to follow in the footsteps of a former Conservative Education Secretary, who became well known-indeed infamous-overnight with the tag of &quot;milk snatcher&quot;. Today's Education Secretary shall for ever more be known as the &quot;meal snatcher&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/3">Entitlement to free school meals usually ends when a family moves off benefits and into low-paid employment. That gives rise to an extra cost of around &#163;300 a child per year, just when families are trying to make themselves better off through work. Furthermore, 60% of children in poverty have at least one parent in work, so the majority of children who live in poverty today do not benefit from free school meals. That is a shocking statistic, but it is true.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/4">The decision announced by the Government is spectacularly short-sighted and I urge the Minister to reconsider it as a matter of urgency, particularly considering that the coalition's stated aim is to decrease the number of people on benefits and increase the number of people in work. That is a laudable goal, but it will never be reached with such poorly thought out policy decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/5">A measure that would have raised 50,000 children above the poverty line has been scrapped, thereby exposing the Government's claims to promote fairness as nothing but empty rhetoric. How can increasing the number of children living in poverty in 2010 help the Government to meet their 2020 target for eradicating child poverty, especially after a Budget that, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows, disproportionately affects the very poorest? I was even more disturbed to see a leaked memo suggesting that money that would have been directed to the poorest families for free school meals is now being redirected to help the middle classes to parachute their children out of mainstream schools and into free schools. That is a particularly galling example of money being directed away from the disadvantaged towards the comfortably off, and away from a scheme that would have lifted children out of poverty to one that will do nothing of the sort but will pander to middle-class parents who still bemoan the loss of grammar schools in leafy London boroughs.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/6">Following this debate, and with the successful campaign that is being led by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40411" name="Edward Balls">the Member for Morley and Outwood (Ed Balls)</phrase>, the Government will choose to reinstate the changes to free school meal provision that were announced by the previous Labour Administration. That would be welcome news, but I would like the Government to go even further and seriously consider the case for universal free school meals. It is all too easy to dismiss the argument by saying, &quot;We haven't got the money to do it&quot;. Tough spending decisions should be a matter of prioritising, not slashing budgets for ideological reasons.</p>

	<p pid="a.227.1/1">That well-made point is another that I was about to come to. I am sure that hon. Members from all parties agree that the education and health of our children is of utmost importance. That more than justifies the-admittedly considerable-spending commitment that such a policy would entail. It is estimated that obesity costs the NHS &#163;3.5 billion a year and the figure is set to rise, so this is a cost worth paying to save money in the long run.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/2">Even at a time when the deficit needs to be cut, we cannot forget the social implications of the decisions that are made by the Government-by a coalition Government no less. They are a broad church that goes from left-leaning Liberal Democrats to right-leaning Thatcherite Conservatives through all colours in between. One would think that a coalition with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40618" name="Vincent Cable">the right hon. Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable)</phrase> at its heart would produce fiscally sound social policies, and that the last thing that it would do would be to increase child poverty. Alas, I fear not. One only has to look north towards Hull to see that the Liberal Democrats have form on such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/3">In 2004, the Labour council in Hull introduced universal free school meals. It had to get a dispensation from the then Labour Government to do so as that took place prior to the passage the Education and Inspections Act 2006 which, by changing &quot;shall&quot; to &quot;may&quot; in a line of legislation, made it possible for universal free school meals to be introduced by any local authority anywhere in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/4">That first pilot scheme was a huge success. Those successes were chronicled by a number of academic papers, the most notable of which is the work I mentioned earlier by Professor Derek Colquhoun from the university of Hull. If I started to go into detail about how positive that evaluation was, there would be no time for anyone else to speak in the debate. I will therefore not do so, but I strongly suggest to the Minister that he looks it up-it is a very good read.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/5">What happened next? Sadly for the children of Hull, Labour lost control of the council after three short years to the Liberal Democrats, who promptly and savagely, and without remorse, scrapped the free school meals initiative. Once again, there was a charge for access to the lovely hot and healthy school meals to which the city's children had become accustomed. That was greeted with outrage from local parents, who had not realised that that was what the Liberal Democrats would do. Does not this all sound strangely familiar? Lo and behold, here we are again. What happens as soon as they are in government? The Liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by their Tory masters, are at it again. Time and again, they are literally taking food out of the mouths of society's poorest children.</p>

I hope that the Liberal Democrats are proud of themselves and of the fact that such policies are what they seem to have come into politics for-they do it time and time again. I hope that their ministerial salaries and cars are worth it, and that all the hard-working people up and down the country who voted Liberal Democrat are happy with the decisions that their elected representatives are taking on their behalf. In future, the mantra will not be, &quot;Vote Lib Dem, get Tory&quot;; it will be, &quot;Vote Lib Dem, increase child poverty&quot;. I look forward to hearing the Minister's explanations.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.2/1">It is an absolute pleasure to speak in the debate, and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40636" name="Sharon Hodgson">the Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson)</phrase> on securing it. She and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40174" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods)</phrase> have been long-standing collaborators of mine on this subject. I was very pleased to work with them on it when I was the chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, and I am delighted that we will continue to work together on it in the House. I guess that I should declare that I remain a member of the CPAG, and I am a strong supporter of its work and what it stands for. I am pleased that, following my departure, the CPAG remains as committed as ever to the cause of free school meals, as part of its wider &quot;2 skint 4 school&quot; campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/2">I very much welcomed the announcements that the previous Labour Government made over a number of years to improve the quality of, and eligibility for, free school meals. One of the most important years in the development of policy was 2005, with the establishment of the School Food Trust, which heightened awareness of the importance of this issue on a number of policy fronts. We should pay tribute to the trust for also playing an important role in driving up nutritional standards, which is something that every Member will want to applaud.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/3">Of course, the Labour Government's policies were important in other ways. Investment in our school infrastructure enabled a number of schools significantly to improve catering facilities, which could increasingly be brought back in-house. I was recently delighted to have the opportunity to visit the wonderful new kitchen at Acre Hall primary school in my constituency. To my great delight, Theresa, the school cook, has offered me the chance to join her and cook lunch for the children. I am very much looking forward to doing that in the next few weeks, when I expect that I will learn a great deal about how to peel carrots in bulk.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/4">Perhaps the Labour Government's most important initiative was the extension of eligibility for free school meals. With my hon. Friend the Member for Washington and Sunderland West, I strongly welcomed the direction of policy travel that that represented. I am deeply concerned that the announcement that the Secretary of State for Education made the other day represents a reversal of that direction of policy travel, which is something that we must all be very anxious about.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/5">I was particularly interested when the Secretary of State explained that the pilots would not be further extended because the evidence of a link between the provision of free school meals and educational attainment remained unproven. It is certainly important that educational attainment is one of the gains of extending the right to free school meals, and the evidence does in fact suggest that there are improvements in cognitive ability, concentration and learning behaviour. Early on in the Hull experiment-researchers confirmed this later-teachers reported a calmer learning environment, with children more engaged, including in the often difficult classroom period in the early afternoon. It is therefore wrong to suggest that the educational gains are unproven. Moreover, it is wrong to judge the provision of universal free school meals on educational attainment grounds alone, important though those of course are.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/6">We must also be aware of the health gains, because standards of nutrition in school meals have risen significantly since 2005. Hon. Members should contrast that with the packed lunches that many low-income parents are still forced to provide to their children, only 1% of which meet the standard of today's school meals.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/7">We have also heard about the importance of the socialising and behavioural gains that we see in our schools when more children eat lunch together. Children learn to converse and to look out for one another, and they learn good courtesy and table manners. Importantly, children who are having lunch in school are not hanging around the chip shop at the end of the road-something that is particularly significant in secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/8">It is also important to consider school lunch in the context of the broader curriculum, as my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham said. There is the opportunity to link lunch to education about diet, nutrition and cooking. Many schools have used the extension of school meal programmes to bring more parents into schools, so that they and their children learn to enjoy cooking healthy meals together.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/9">There are important sustainability gains in extending the reach of free school meals and in the opportunity that that creates for cooking locally, on-site, with less transport of ingredients. It also offers schools the opportunity to source from local producers, which boosts the local economy. The extension of free school meals is an important job-creation opportunity. Working in school kitchens is a particularly desirable form of employment for many parents, especially mothers. The flexibility of the work-the fact that it takes place in term time and obviously coincides with the times when the children are in school-makes it a good source of additional local jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/10">It is highly regrettable that those additional gains were not mentioned by the Secretary of State when he said that the gains on educational attainment grounds were unproven. Even if that had been true-in my view the evidence shows that it is not-it is highly regrettable that the much broader social and environmental gains were not considered, too. Most importantly, I guess, for many of the families whom I have talked to, are the economic and financial consequences for family budgets of extending eligibility for free school meals.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/11">School meals represent good value, and many hon. Members present in the Chamber will believe that a hot lunch at &#163;1.90 or &#163;2 a head is good value; and that is right. Still, however, for many low-income working parents, who may perhaps be raising two or three children, that &#163;1.90, &#163;2 or &#163;2.20 added up over the week can be unaffordable. Larger families are a group already at higher risk of child poverty. Undoubtedly, for some of those families, the cost of providing lunch for their children is a component of that greater risk. It is a matter of regret that we are not taking the opportunity to deal with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/12">As my hon. Friends have said, one of the most significant concerns for us is the position of low-income working families. I very much regret the decision not to roll out the provision of free school meals to more children in such families. Even the pilots under the previous Government were, I confess, limited and did not go far enough in my view in relation to provision for secondary school kids. Almost no secondary school child in this country in a low-income working family has been able to get a free school meal. The recent announcement by the Secretary of State means that we have lost substantial potential gains to do with creating work incentives and ending child poverty-as has been mentioned, the measures would have lifted a further 50,000 children out of poverty; there would have been wider social and economic gains, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/13">The opportunities and options for extension are quite numerous. Many MPs have long argued that, as a first step, free school meals should be extended to all families on working tax credit. That would make a significant difference. We could also consider families in receipt of housing benefit and council tax benefit. As the Minister knows, those are in-work benefits, too. We have significant reasons for supporting the Government's own back-to-work and work incentivisation agenda, with extending the entitlement to free school meals.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/14">I alluded to take-up in an intervention earlier. The wider the eligibility, the greater the take-up across the board, including among those children who would be entitled to free school meals even on the most limited eligibility criteria used some years ago. I think I am right in saying that the rate nearly doubled in Hull among such children-those who would have been entitled anyway. That significant increase in take-up shows the absolute power of universal provision; some of us find that we are making that argument repeatedly in different contexts. We can understand why take-up increases when eligibility is widened; my hon. Friends have alluded to the reasons. There is less stigma: if their friends are having lunches, children will go along, too, and have lunch with their mates. Administrative simplicity is another factor. It is as true in this context as in any other that means-testing brings complexity and shuts out people who should be entitled. Of course, schools-hard-pressed to meet budgets-will be very pleased about anything that reduces administrative costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/15">I want to explore the extension of free school meals into the wider educational environment, which is another thing mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham when she talked about extended schools. Many schools have in recent years extended their support to families by providing longer hours, with out-of-school breakfast clubs and after-school events. It is of great concern to me that pressures on funding resulting from the Budget and other cuts being announced will put those extended school activities at considerable risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/16">The Minister has long been a strong proponent of the benefits of out-of-school and extended school activities. I remember hearing him say early on that schools in his constituency would want to take advantage of such moves and would be unwise not to. We will not necessarily lose extended school activities completely, but I am concerned that the poorest children may not be able to afford to participate: the children who could benefit most from those activities will be exactly those who will be shut out. We need some guarantees about funding for extended and out-of-school provision, and that must include providing for the children taking part to eat together-healthy snacks, breakfast or supper-where that is part of the plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/17">Breakfast clubs have a particular significance in that context. They play an important role for many low-income families, and hon. Members should welcome several aspects of those clubs. They have attracted considerable support in many areas-in the private sector as well as the voluntary sector. In my constituency, a major employer is Kellogg's, which has put millions of pounds of support into helping school breakfast clubs. It is incredibly committed to their future and extremely anxious about what the Government intend for them. It has highlighted to me its concerns about some of the language used by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase>, who suggested that breakfast clubs might not be desirable for a number of kids. I am sure that it would be good for children to have healthy breakfasts at home, wherever possible, but for all sorts of reasons at all sorts of times that is not possible for every parent. We must be able to build on provision that has proved a considerable success in many schools and that has given some of our most deprived kids a strong start to the school day. I hope that we shall receive assurances from Ministers in the next few weeks about extended school activities-funding for them and enabling the poorest children to participate in them more broadly-and about the role that free school meals will play in offering that.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/18">I think that everyone understands the financial pressures and the fact that we can expect public spending cuts. However, the pain of those cuts, as my hon. Friends have repeatedly told the Government, must not be borne by the poorest; but I very much fear that that will be the exact consequence of not extending the provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/19">I am concerned, too, that we are seeing a massive policy step backwards; although the direction of travel in recent years has been at times hesitant or a little stop-go, it has none the less been broadly progressive and positive. Having seen such progress, it is a matter of huge regret to find things suddenly being put in reverse.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/20">My concluding plea is for Ministers to consider again their plans for the provision of free school meals, and to do so with fully open minds. I want their minds to be open in the context of child poverty; I want their minds to be open in the context of improving working centres; and I want their minds to be open in the context of children's health-and, of course, their learning and educational attainment. Unfortunately, the Conservative-Lib Dem Government has a bit of a track record in not having an open mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/21">Several hon. Members have spoken of the fate of the programme in Hull. One of the most shameful aspects of the Lib Dem attempt to stop that programme early was that they did not wait for a proper evaluation to be made; only after the campaigning efforts of parents and others were they forced to finish the programme, so that a proper research basis could be established for the success that it had enjoyed. The governing parties have form for not evaluating programmes properly, and I know that the Minister will not want to be associated with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.2/22">I hope that the Minister will offer some reassurance-for a start, to the many working families who are anxious about the many financial pressures that they already face. In that context, extending free school meals to more of those low-income working families would be a step towards the long-term provision of universal free school meals. That would be widely welcomed, and I hope that the Government will consider doing so.</p>

	<p pid="a.239.0/1">It was indeed a pleasure to have my hon. Friend come in her ministerial capacity to Gladstone primary school in my constituency to meet lunchtime supervisors and staff from across my constituency. Does she recall some of the comments made by those staff about situations in which children were passing out in the playground because they had not eaten, in some cases for a couple of days? Situations such as that are horrific. We are in the 21st century, not in Victorian times, and yet we sometimes have to wonder what time we are in. Does she recall those conversations with staff?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-06-30a.246.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40069" speakername="Nigel Dodds" colnum="246"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100630/halltext/100630h0004.htm#10063026000264">
	<p pid="a.246.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Weir. I want to focus attention on something that I believe represent one of the greatest errors of the previous Government: the special treatment that has been given to abstentionist Members of Parliament that enables them to claim Westminster allowances and the Short money that is supposed to be used for the purposes of parliamentary activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/2">There is only one elected party in the House that refuses to take its seats, so that policy is not driven by a need to address a general problem. The problem is one single party seeking and getting preferential treatment. There is now a special status of MP, and the principle that the same is expected of and awarded to all Members of the House equally has been abandoned. A number of us have been absolutely consistent on the issue. We opposed the original decision to grant these allowances, we supported the attempts by the then Conservative Opposition to overturn them, and we believe that now is an opportune moment-in a new Parliament, with new politics and with the public concern that rightly exists about the wastefulness of public expenditure, value for money and so on-to turn our attention once again to the issue, particularly given the promises made by senior members of the Conservative party in the run-up to the election.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/3">The issue arose in 1997 and in 2001, with the respective Speakers of the House at those times ruling that Sinn Fein should not be granted allowances. On <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-14">14 May 1997</phrase>, the then Speaker, Betty Boothroyd, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/4" class="indent">&quot;those who choose not to take their seats should not have access to the many benefits and facilities that are now available in the House without also taking up their responsibilities as Members.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1997-05-14.35"><i>Official Report</i>, 14 May 1997; Vol. 294, c. 35</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/5">Sinn Fein challenged that ruling in the courts. Indeed, it took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, no less, and was unsuccessful both in the domestic courts and in Europe, which demonstrated that the decision was perfectly just and correct. Given the courts' dismissal of the various legal challenges, it is spurious to defend the present situation by saying that it recognises of the rights of a section of the electorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/6">In 2001, the then Labour Government presented a motion to reverse the decision of the Speaker, although that motion did not apply to Short money. It is now worth reminding those who sit on the Government Benches what they said while they were in opposition. I exclude from that the Liberal Democrats, including the Deputy Leader of the House, who will respond to the debate, because I understand that they abstained or did not take a particular position one way or another throughout the discussion of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/7">I hope that Conservative Members who are now in government will clearly spell out the opposition to the position that was evinced during the Conservatives' days in opposition. One Conservative spokesman-Quentin Davies, the then shadow Secretary of State-denounced the proposal when it was first introduced, saying that it involved</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/8" class="indent">&quot;more unreciprocated concessions to Sinn Fein-IRA&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/9">and</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/10" class="indent">&quot;treating the rules of the House of Commons as the currency for such concessions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/11">The argument that Sinn Fein received comparable allowances in the Northern Ireland Assembly was advanced as a justification, but the then shadow Secretary of State said rightly:</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/12" class="indent">&quot;There is in fact no comparison at all between the position in Stormont and that in the House, because Sinn Fein-IRA have agreed to take their seats in the Assembly at Stormont and in the Executive there&quot;.-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2001-12-18.160"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 December 2001; Vol. 377, c. 160-162</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/13">When an equivalent to Short money was provided to Sinn Fein, such opposition in principle was restated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" name="Theresa May">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)</phrase>-now Home Secretary-when she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/14" class="indent">&quot;The issue before us is not about the Northern Ireland peace process or about the resumption of the Assembly; it is about the role of Members of parliament, what it means to sit in the House and the nature of the job of being an elected representative of this place. It is primarily on that basis that we oppose the action that the Government are seeking to take and will be voting against the motions.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-02-08.912"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 February 2006; Vol. 442, c. 912</phrase>.]</p>

	<p pid="a.255.2/1">I am grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention. She makes a powerful point, and we shall indeed find out what the Minister has to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/2">In my constituency, local people were occasionally consulted. However, all too often, it was clear that the decisions had already been made and that lip service was being paid to local people through sham public consultations. Indeed, two years ago, I came to this Chamber to try to convince the then Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40302" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright)</phrase>, that his Department's decision to impose 4,500 extra homes in rural north Buckinghamshire completely out of the blue was a mistake. It went against not only local residents' wishes, but the advice received from Milton Keynes Partnership and the Department's own advisers, all of whom felt that the decision was not in the interest of the city or its rural residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/3">Thankfully, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40517" name="Hazel Blears">the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears)</phrase>, the then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, listened to reason and the decision was eventually overturned. I was grateful to her for reversing it, but we should not have had to go through that process in the first place. Common sense was finally seen, but that was a clear example of how the previous Government, with their Whitehall-decreed targets and unelected quangos, tried to run roughshod over the desires of local people. That is why I am so pleased that the new coalition Government have listened, and I hope that the days of top-down targets are limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/4">Despite that minor victory in this Chamber two years ago, we have still seen house-building targets that were too large for local economic needs. As I said, there is no blanket opposition in Milton Keynes to the expansion of the city, but there is a feeling that it must be done at a sustainable pace and following the I before E philosophy. For example, 1,300 new homes were completed in Milton Keynes in 2009-10, but only 600 jobs were created. The current requirement is that 1.5 jobs are created per new home built.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/5">It was therefore with great relief that on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-27">27 May</phrase> I received a letter from the new Secretary of State outlining his plans to abolish regional spatial strategies. I am pleased to say that it is not only me who welcomes the move; it is broadly supported by Milton Keynes council and local residents. Of course, there is a minority who view any change as a threat, and I called for the debate precisely so that the Minister would have an opportunity to put meat on the bones of the Secretary of State's announcement, and to allow local authorities up and down the land to begin to plan ahead as a result of the Government's decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/6">In effect, the abolition of the regional spatial strategy makes Milton Keynes council the policy maker for planning in central Milton Keynes, while Milton Keynes Partnership remains in charge of development on the eastern and western flanks of the city. However, the reality is that because the principal expansion areas are under the control of Milton Keynes Partnership, it is the Homes and Communities Agency, through Milton Keynes Partnership, that has dictated the amount, direction and speed of growth in Milton Keynes, not the democratically elected local council.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/7">My first question to the Minister is: how will that relationship change? Will there be only one planning authority for Milton Keynes in the future, and will it be the council? To that end, does he intend to revoke the statutory instrument that gives Milton Keynes Partnership its development powers, and what future role does he anticipate for the partnership?</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/8">Secondly, will the scrapping of the regional spatial strategies be achieved through existing regulations or via a forthcoming Bill? Thirdly, will the Government put in place an interim mechanism that will allow local planning authorities to resist or defer planning applications for development above a certain size during the transitional period so that they are able to take stock and revisit their sustainable growth requirements?</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/9">Fourthly, and in line with that, will the Minister consider implementing a framework that ensures that the building and land assets of the Homes and Communities Agency and Milton Keynes Partnership are managed in line with the policy set by Milton Keynes council? Fifthly, how will the Government ensure that local councils take another look at their current housing plans and modify them if that is in the best interests of local people? On the flip side of the coin, how will the incentives and rewards to local authorities for building more homes and promoting greater economic growth be implemented?</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/10">Sixthly, will the Minister explain the funding mechanism for the future infrastructure projects that will be necessary for future residential properties? At present, Milton Keynes has a local tariff that is based on a per-property financial contribution to infrastructure, but that accounts for only a relatively small percentage of the amount that is required. Where will the remaining funding come from?</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/11">Finally, Milton Keynes lies on the border of three counties-Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire-and three regions: the south-east, east midlands and eastern regions. Can the Minister outline what mechanism will be available to ensure that the various stakeholders from those authorities can and will work together to come up with a consensus position that would benefit everyone in the cross-regional area?</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/12">I welcome the Secretary of State's decision to abolish regional spatial strategies and commend him for the leadership that he has shown in this matter. The Minister will, however, appreciate that the decision actually raises several important questions, some of which I have tried to outline this afternoon. I know that I speak for local authorities up and down the country when I say that the sooner we have answers, the sooner local authorities will be able to move forward in implementing local wishes.</p>

	<p pid="a.257.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40403" name="Mark Lancaster">the Member for Milton Keynes North (Mark Lancaster)</phrase> for initiating this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/2">The abolition of regional spatial strategies by the new coalition Government is extremely welcome and cannot come soon enough. Returning powers on where to build housing to local communities and democratically elected local councillors, rather than unelected quangos and Whitehall bureaucrats, is the right thing to do. For too long, local people have felt trampled on by central Government decision making and have felt that decisions have been done to them and imposed on them, rather than being made with their consent. For too long, local people have felt that their voice has gone unheard. It is time to change this.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/3">In my constituency of Kingswood, there is an urgent case for the abolition of the regional spatial strategy as soon as possible. As a direct result of the previous Government's south-west regional spatial strategy, green belt land in my constituency is coming under threat from development through speculative applications in Oldland Common, Mangotsfield and Longwell Green. Two applications-to build on green belt land on Barry road, Oldland Common, and on Cossham street, Mangotsfield-have already been fought off at a local planning level, and I am about to launch a campaign against a new application to build on green belt land at Williams Close, Longwell Green, which has only just been submitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/4">For me and my constituents in Kingswood, it has been a familiar pattern: thousands of letters have been written and thousands of signatures against these applications have been collected. I have been working alongside the fantastic Save Our Green Spaces groups in Oldland Common, Warmley and Mangotsfield, whose tireless commitment to saving their local green belt has been humbling. I am proud to represent such constituents, whose sense of pride, dedication and duty towards protecting their local community for future generations is startling. The Save Our Green Spaces group will be writing to the Minister, requesting a meeting to discuss the forthcoming legislation and, if at all possible, I should like to facilitate that request.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/5">We have won every battle so far, but while the RSS remains unrevoked by statute, we have yet to win the war. Developers are still keen to chance their luck and build on green belt land, which is why the RSS must be abolished as soon as possible. The link between scrapping the RSS and preserving our green belt is clear. To this end, I tabled early-day motion 168, which I am delighted to say has been signed by many hon. Members.</p>

	<p pid="a.260.2/1">I thank you, Mr Benton, and my hon. Friend. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40403" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes North (Mark Lancaster)</phrase> on raising this important matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/2">Adel in my constituency is one of the many communities throughout the country that were overjoyed when the coalition Government announced that it would scrap regional spatial strategies and restore power over such matters to local councils and communities. The announcement in the Queen's Speech of the decentralisation and localism Bill resonated hugely, unlike some of those previously announced.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/3">Yorkshire and Humber regional spatial strategy's H1 policy is headed &quot;Provision and distribution of housing&quot;, and has determined a target leading to annual average net additions to the dwelling stock between 2004 and 2026 of 4,300. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40660" name="Steve Brine">The hon. Member for Winchester (Mr Brine)</phrase> has commented on the five-year supply, and in Leeds city council area that leads to 21,500 housing plots as part of its forward planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/4">A development off Holt avenue in Adel has been vigorously opposed by Leeds city council and local residents. The Adel Association led a wonderful campaign showing the importance of what is an historic site. Adel has been a settlement since Saxon times, and is next to Adel's historic St John the Baptist church, which dates from 1150. It is one of the finest examples of Norman architecture in the country. David Wilson Homes has ploughed on with its attempt to obtain planning permission and, having had it refused by Leeds city council, has gone to the Planning Inspectorate. The simple reality is that the unrealistically high targets for housing demanded in Leeds have provided until now, and will do so until regional spatial strategies are abolished, a legal loophole for developers to exploit. In communities throughout the country, we are seeing developers deliberately making a beeline for greenfield plots when they should focus on brownfield plots instead.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/5">The irony in Leeds is that the city centre has hundreds of empty flats, which are ideal for first-time buyers, but developers try to build on important greenfield against the wishes of local residents. The frustration of the council's planning department and local residents has turned to a feeling of empowerment now that that unnecessary and over-centralised target will go. I warmly welcome the Minister to his job. The planning appeal by David Wilson Homes has, thankfully, been postponed pending the announcement. Will the Minister tell us the timing, and will he say whether this will be given as a reason for this or any other development being forced through? Clearly, it was the intention of David Wilson Homes to use the five-year rule and the regional spatial strategy to demand the right to go ahead, even against such opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.2/6">That is my only question for the Minister. I know that other hon. Members want to speak. The news is great and is warmly welcomed in Adel, as well as throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.264.2/1">Let me reassure hon. Members that I will be brief. Many of my colleagues have already raised points that are similar to mine and I want to allow as much time as possible for the Minister to respond. Let me add my thanks to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40403" name="Mark Lancaster">the Member for Milton Keynes North (Mark Lancaster)</phrase> for securing a debate on a topic that was of great significance to people in the constituency of West Worcestershire during the general election.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/2">I also thank the Government for moving so quickly to send letters to councils explaining that they can take the intention to abolish regional spatial strategies into account as a material consideration, as that has certainly greatly relieved local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/3">Let me explain a couple of the specific issues that have arisen in West Worcestershire so that the Minister can perhaps use the debate to give some guidance to my local councils-Malvern Hills district council and Wychavon district council. During the regional spatial strategy planning process, Worcester, which is represented by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40671" name="Robin Walker">the Member for Worcester (Mr Walker)</phrase>, was designated a regional growth point, and the three south Worcestershire councils were allocated 25,500 homes to find room for.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/4">The county town of Worcester is bordered on the one side by the M5 and on the other by the River Severn, so there is no room inside the city boundaries for it to expand as a growth point. The south Worcestershire joint core strategy was therefore obliged to look at Malvern Hills district council territory to find room for the 25,500 homes. The council would thus be given more than 10,000 homes under the regional spatial strategy. That caused great resistance in communities where only 1,500 people are on the waiting list for housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/5">Let me describe the impact on the village of Lower Broadheath, which is the birthplace of the great composer Elgar. The village is about four miles west of Worcester, but it is, importantly, on the other side of that significant geographical barrier, the River Severn. The village, which was designated Worcester West, has only about 800 homes, but it would be obliged to have between 3,500 and 4,000 more built on the green fields that separate it from Worcester.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/6">I have some specific questions for the Minister. First, what guidance can he give Malvern Hills district council? Bloor homes has applied for outline planning permission to build the 4,000 homes in west Worcester, which is causing severe blight and concern. Planning permission was applied for at the beginning of the year, before the proposed abolition of the regional spatial strategy, and the council is looking for guidance on whether that proposed abolition is a material consideration and on what the next stage of the plans is. Secondly, will the abolition of the regional spatial strategy automatically abolish the characterisation of Worcester as a new growth point? Will the Minister clarify exactly how we will go forward on that?</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/7">On behalf of my constituents, I thank the Government for taking things forward this far, but I agree with many of my fellow speakers that it would be helpful to have swift further clarification of the other matters that we have raised.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.2/1">I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr Benton. May I say how much I enjoyed the debates that you chaired in the previous Parliament and how much I look forward to such debates in this one? I congratulate the Minister on achieving his place on the Front Bench. I must say that I felt a little frisson as hon. Members said, &quot;I look to the Minister for answers on these questions,&quot; or, &quot;I look forward to the Minister's response on this,&quot; and then realised that it was not me this time but him.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/2">I particularly congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40403" name="Mark Lancaster">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes North (Mark Lancaster)</phrase> on introducing the debate in a very measured and well-informed way. As he said, the answers from the Minister are more important than the questions, so I intend to give the Minister as much time as possible to answer the questions that hon. Members have asked. I have five questions for him to answer, however.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/3">The hon. Members for Milton Keynes North and for Milton Keynes South (Iain Stewart) both argued, rightly, that Milton Keynes is a town that has always been committed to growth and has always seen growth as part of its future, so the arguments that they make on behalf of their town, just like those of their predecessors-particularly the predecessor of the hon. Member for Milton Keynes South, who was a very distinguished Member of the House-carry a lot of weight.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/4">I have been very impressed by the quality of this afternoon's debate. Most of the contributions have been measured and incisive, and there have been many of them. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40356" name="Greg Mulholland">The hon. Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> talked about the Yorkshire and Humber regional plan. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40603" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">The hon. Member for The Cotswolds (Geoffrey Clifton-Brown)</phrase> talked about the importance of building in all areas of the country, particularly if we are concerned about the opportunities for first-time buyers and young families to get a start in life in their own area. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40654" name="Harriett Baldwin">The hon. Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)</phrase> talked about incentives, while <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40168" name="Duncan Hames">the hon. Member for Chippenham (Duncan Hames)</phrase> talked about energy efficiency and asked questions about it. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes South is concerned about design standards, which are important.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40660" name="Steve Brine">The hon. Member for Winchester (Mr Brine)</phrase> talked about the problem with the Pickles letter, which is a significant aspect of the debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40635" name="Chris White">The hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Chris White)</phrase> talked about the importance of democracy in the planning system, which is an essential feature. Even in only an intervention, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40479" name="Stewart Jackson">the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)</phrase> managed to make a very important point on affordable housing. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40163" name="Martin Horwood">The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> managed to mention most of the people on his RSS constituency mailing list.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/6">I got the job of housing and planning Minister a year ago-that was all. I inherited the regional spatial strategies and quickly found that they had very few friends, as has been underlined clearly in the debate. In most regions, the regional spatial strategies have been agreed and are in place, and they were agreed by a combination of elected local council leaders from the region, in the region. Beyond that, what was clear to me-it is still clear now-was that our regional spatial strategies and our approach to planning were too inflexible to reflect some of the differences between regions. Our approach was too top-down, but it is clear that the new Government's approach is simply a charter for nimby resistance to new homes, which should concern us all because it could have worrying consequences. My associated concern is that it is a signal of the Government stepping back at national level from any role and responsibility in securing the new homes that are needed in all parts of the country for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/7">The consequences of the changes are already clear. It is not so much about greater local powers but fewer new homes. In many areas, that will result in the blocking rather than the building of new homes. Although the contributions to the debate have been measured, the comments of some council leaders have been clear. For instance, in response to the Government's announcement about the abolition of regional spatial strategies, the Conservative leader of Adur district council said:</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/8" class="indent">&quot;It will reduce the number of new homes significantly&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/9">which he said was to be welcomed. The National Housing Federation said that the number of new affordable homes would &quot;fall off a cliff&quot;, while the chief executive of one of our leading house building companies described the impact of the changes as being &quot;scary as hell&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/10">I am concerned that on this matter, as with other policy areas, we are seeing a gap between what the Government are saying and what they are doing. The new housing Minister says that he and the Government want Britain to be a nation of house builders. That is either top-of-the-range spin or grand self-deception. If that is the case, why was the one incentive system-the housing and planning delivery grant-swept aside as part of this year's &#163;6 billion cuts? Why, as part of those cuts, was &#163;230 million taken from the Homes and Communities Agency budget for building affordable homes, through housing associations, in several disadvantaged areas? Why is it that all the affordable housing investment programmes for which funding was agreed, set aside and put in place now on hold? Will the Minister-this is my first question-tell us when the money for those affordable housing programmes be released so that building can start again?</p>

As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40347" name="Chris Skidmore">the hon. Member for Kingswood (Chris Skidmore)</phrase> said, until Parliament passes legislation to revoke RSSs, they will not be abolished-they will remain in place. I fear that the Pickles letter does little to help the situation. Indeed, it creates a legislative limbo in which councils, planners and the Planning Inspectorate are uncertain of their principal reference points. At a conference at which I was speaking this morning, a distinguished academic who knows a lot about the matter described the planning system-the result of two months of Government announcements-as a vacuum and in a state of chaos. That should surprise no one, because the new Secretary of State has been having a go at every part of the planning system like a bull in a china shop. My second question to the Minister is therefore: what is the legal planning status of the Pickles letter? When will the Government publish the legislation that will allow them to do what they wish?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-06-30a.273.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" speakername="John Healey" colnum="273"  time="015:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100630/halltext/100630h0009.htm#10063028000195">
	<p pid="a.273.1/1">The hon. Gentleman misses the point. The framework for regional spatial strategies had been legislated for by the House and that remains the case. However, questions arise about the extraordinary letter sent by the new Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/2">I turn to a point that at least two Members raised this afternoon: the desire to move from a planning-led system to an incentive-based system. There is certainly a case for incentives in the system. It can be said that the housing and planning delivery grant and the extra funding for growth areas and growth points were insufficiently sharp to do the job on their own, but they were an important part of the system and I am sorry to see this year's housing and planning grant go. However, the Government's idea of a council tax match at 100% for every new home built is an 18-carat con-just consider the money!</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/3">The idea is that that would cost &#163;250 million in the first year. It was meant to be funded by switching the housing and planning delivery grant, but that amounted to &#163;135 million this year and it went in the Chancellor's first swathe of cuts. There is no new money for this proposed incentive scheme. In years two, three, four, five and six-the scheme is meant to last six years-it will be top-sliced from local government grant through the formula system at a rate of about &#163;250 million a year. A &#163;250 million cut in the local authority grant system is the equivalent of a 1% rise in council tax. It is not only &#163;250 million a year, however. The effect is cumulative, so the cost in the second year will be &#163;250 million plus another &#163;250 million. In year three it will increase again; and the total over the six years will be &#163;5.25 billion-the equivalent of an extra &#163;320 on the average band D property council tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/4">The system will rob some councils in order to pay others. Those hon. Members whose constituencies include county council areas should remember that although county councils are not planning authorities and are not responsible for housing, they will bear the brunt of the cuts through the switch to district councils, which will get the cash. It must be obvious to anyone that if the scheme ever sees the light of day-if DCLG Ministers can persuade the Treasury to put it in place-it will lead to council tax chaos. It will blow the Chancellor's Budget promise of a council tax freeze out of the water. My fourth question to the Minister is therefore: when will the scheme be in place? My fifth question is this will there or will there not be new money for the scheme, or will it be top-sliced as in previously published plans, and taken from local government budgets?</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/5">I shall answer my sixth question myself to save the Minister the trouble. What is the new Government's policy on housing for the future, and what are they saying to those young people who want to move out of their parents' house and set up home for themselves? The answer is clear: no new homes, and a capital &quot;NO&quot; to new affordable homes. Since the two parties got into Government, they have been waving two fingers at those who need decent, affordable, secure homes for the future, and at those who aspire to move into and buy their own homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/6">We are right at the start of this Parliament, but within three, four or five years-before its end-the consequences of the changes that we are discussing this afternoon will be serious for many young families across the country, and very clear to them when they consider how to vote at the next election.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that. I can assure him that I do not want to cause him any difficulties, but would he do whatever he can to encourage planning inspectors to get on and hear cases rather than adjourning them, so that the emerging position becomes clear?</p>

	<p pid="a.276.1/1">I understand my hon. Friend's point, and I take his question in the spirit in which it was intended. The Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local Government, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" name="Greg Clark">the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase> and I are in discussion with the Planning Inspectorate, and we will ensure that such a factor is taken on board. Everybody wants to move as swiftly as possible but, because the arrangements for planning regulations under the previous Government were so complex, we have something of a legal minefield to walk through to ensure that we get it right. If we make important changes, we are determined that we do not have any false starts. I hope that Members will understand our reasons for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/2">There will be further guidance. I am sorry that I am not able to say to hon. Members that I have it here today, but when I say that my right hon. Friend will issue the guidance soon, I mean it. I hope that people understand that a good deal of work is being done at the moment, and that we intend to move very swiftly to set it out. I am conscious that such guidance should involve both the transitional arrangements and some of the implications that follow therefrom. We have already made it clear that the abolition of the regional strategies is emerging Government policy and, therefore, a material consideration, and that local planning authorities should not feel intimidated from getting on with adopting those parts of their local plans that are appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/3">Moreover, we will give local authorities the opportunity to revise partially those plans to reflect the abolition of the regional strategies and the imposed targets that went with them. Sometimes it is felt that the revision of a local plan is a long-winded process and rather daunting, but let me assure Members that a focused revision of the plan that concentrates on certain aspects, such as the housing aspects that are affected by the removal of the regional strategies, need not take that degree of time. I hope that hon. Members will take back that important message to their constituencies. The revision can be done swiftly and without great expense to the local authorities. Some local authorities are already taking that on board. Those are key steps that we are keen to take at an early stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40635" name="Chris White">the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Chris White)</phrase> on securing the debate and raising what I know is an important issue for him and the other hon. Members who have spoken, as well as their constituents. The fire service is important, as it deals with people's lives, and it is therefore particularly appropriate that this debate has been so well attended by hon. Members from the county of Warwickshire. I take on board the points made by my hon. Friend, whom I listened to with care. I also take on board the points made by hon. Members in interventions, as well as those that have been made to me by the Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40339" name="Jeremy Wright">the Member for Kenilworth and Southam (Jeremy Wright)</phrase>, who, as a member of the Government, is not in a position to speak in this debate, but has taken the trouble to contact me on behalf of his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/2">Against that background, I understand my hon. Friend's pride in Warwickshire's fire stations and the services that they provide. Local pride in services is one reason why we as a Government are committed to localism for the fire service as well as the rest of local government. Local providers are best placed to know how to serve their local communities and, importantly, to know what level of service that might entail and the best means of delivering that service.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/3">I associate myself with the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington for the work of firefighters in Warwickshire, particularly the retained firefighters to whom he referred, who work hard to keep the people of their communities safe. We should be immensely proud of them. I had the pleasure to meet officials of the Retained Firefighters Union earlier today. The retained service has the full support and confidence of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/4">The background to the proposals is based in the governance and statutory arrangements controlling the fire services in England. Fire and rescue authorities are required to produce and regularly update an integrated risk management plan, sometimes called an IRMP, which identifies and assesses a local need and sets out plans effectively to mitigate existing and potential risks to communities. The Warwickshire fire and rescue authority's plan was produced by that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/5">The process epitomises localism by enabling each fire and rescue authority to decide how best to provide fire and rescue-related services. That, of course, includes prevention and protection as well as response. Resources are allocated on the basis of an evaluation of risk and where risks are greatest. The evaluation includes such strategic and operational issues as the siting, manning and equipping of fire stations and their hours of operation, and should also take into account cross-border arrangements with neighbouring authorities. Local requirements are thus determined by local people according to local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/6">An evaluation under that process has led to specific considerations by the Warwickshire fire and rescue authority to change the fire cover arrangements in its area in light of both the assessed risk and the availability of resources. It is fair to say, of course, that fire and rescue authorities, like all other public services, must be cognisant of constraints on budgets in the circumstances of the economic crisis inherited by this Government. Equally, of course, it is the Government's determination that priority should be given to services at the front line. It is therefore right that many of the proposals in IRMPs-this applies across the country, not just in Warwickshire-aim to increase efficiency. By so doing, fire and rescue authorities can maximise the amount of risk-reducing activity they can deliver from the resources available. That is clearly the right approach, and the aim must always be to ensure excellent service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/7">I know that that sometimes involves difficult decisions. Having served as a member and leader of a fire authority myself, I am conscious that, in such circumstances, there are often contrary arguments that are advanced in good faith that must be weighed up. I have read Warwickshire fire and rescue authority's improvement plan proposals, which cover many areas besides fire station changes, such as the promotion of public fire safety, increased firefighter training, enhanced flood response, the introduction of a specialist road traffic collision unit, and the deployment of small fires units and target response vehicles. I note that Warwickshire contends that, overall, the plan will ensure that current fire cover is maintained across all areas and that, in some areas, it will be improved. It also contends that there will not be an adverse effect on response times.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/8">Of course, I have heard a number of counter-arguments in today's debate that have echoed the concerns expressed locally in the past six months or so. I am also aware that the inquiry into the tragic deaths of firefighters at Atherstone on Stour remains outstanding. An argument can be advanced for bearing in mind the outcome of that inquiry before coming to any final conclusions on the shape of the service although, as I will make apparent, that decision is not for me to make as Minister; it is for the fire and rescue authority to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/9">It is a requirement that the IRMP and any significant changes to it are subject to full consultation with the local community prior to agreement and implementation, and I am aware of the amount of debate that has already been generated about these proposals. At one level, that degree of interest is a good thing. One never likes to see controversy, but the process has generated a real sense of engagement in the communities concerned about the importance of the fire service in their area. As someone who believes passionately in the fire service-as I did before I became Minister-that is something I welcome. Although such a process is healthy, it is right that both sides of the debate are heard, and therefore I recognise and commend the role of my hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington in ensuring that counter-arguments are appropriately focused and conducted, and presented to the fire and rescue authority before it takes its decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/10">Against that background, I come back to the crucial point that it is not the place of central Government and Ministers to intervene in the operational proposals of a local authority's IRMP or the associated balancing of competing local demands on available resources. The consideration of such proposals and the assessment of the benefits to the communities that are served are rightly the role of elected members of the authority concerned. They should make the appropriate decisions on the basis of the professional advice of the principal officers of the fire and rescue service and, as we have seen, following due consultation with the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/11">It might well be that members wish to come to a view on the material that they already have, that they will wish to consider options that are being put forward by various interested parties, or that they wish to consult across the areas of advice available to them about the options that are appropriate. I am sure that they will bear in mind the broader background to these proposals. That said, because of the statutory position and the correct political process of localism that applies here, I am sure that you, Mr Benton, and my hon. Friend will understand that I am unable to comment directly on the specific proposals that are being put forward and consulted upon by Warwickshire fire and rescue authority. The very principle of local determination and local solutions for local circumstances means that it would not be appropriate for me to attempt to influence the decisions with which the fire and rescue authority will be faced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-20">20 July</phrase> in the light of representations made to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/12">There is still a period of time between this debate and the decision on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-20">20 July</phrase> during which representations can be made. I am sure that all hon. Members who have spoken and others who are interested will continue to take the opportunity make such representations. My hon. Friend's case was made powerfully and with admirable succinctness-such admirable succinctness that I am in the dilemma in which Ministers sometimes find themselves by wondering whether I should repeat my remarks until 4.30 pm.</p>

	<p pid="a.285.1/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr Benton. It is particularly appropriate that you are in the Chair for this important debate, because you represent my neighbouring constituency of Bootle. I also welcome the Minister to the Chamber and congratulate him on his appointment to one of the most interesting and enjoyable jobs in Government. I am delighted that all four of my colleagues from Liverpool are here for this debate because that demonstrates the incredible strength of feeling across the city on the issues that I will raise and that my colleagues will, I am sure, mention in interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.1/2">The focus of the debate is the importance of investment in education in Liverpool. It is important for the life chances of children and young people, for social mobility and justice, and for the future economic prospects of the city. A vibrant knowledge economy is absolutely crucial for a city such as ours, and that is especially the case if we are to meet the challenge of increasing the role of the private and voluntary sectors in the city region's economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.1/3">I shall quote from two business leaders in the city of Liverpool. First, Chris Musson, chief executive of the Liverpool science park, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.285.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The future for cities like Liverpool has got to be in higher value economic sectors. Investing in education and creating a generation of state of the art new schools is a vital element in the bigger economic picture. At Liverpool Science Park we are providing support to new knowledge-based businesses. If we, in conjunction with our partners, are to continue to grow the commercial knowledge economy it is vital that this there is a qualified and capable supply of talent from which knowledge-based companies can recruit.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.285.1/5">Another business leader, Frank McKenna, who chairs Downtown Liverpool in Business, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.285.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The Building Schools for the Future programme is as important to our future economic success as the Liverpool One retail development or the Capital of Culture. Investment to transform education is essential to the development of a high-skill, high-value economy in Liverpool.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.285.1/7">Over the past 13 years we have seen a remarkable improvement in attainment in Liverpool's secondary schools. In 1997, the city had one of the lowest attainment rates at GCSE; just 32% of 16-year-olds achieved five or more A* to C grades. The most recent figures available show that in 2009 that attainment rate had grown from 32% to 74%, which is 8% higher than the national average. I pay tribute to the hard work of staff and students, backed by their parents, and the local authority in achieving that incredible transformation. Liverpool's Building Schools for the Future programme is designed to learn from that educational progress over the past 13 years so that we can promote excellence in all Liverpool schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.1/8">I want to say a few words about Building Schools for the Future nationally. I had the privilege of serving for three years as a Minister in what was then the Department for Education and Skills, when my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40552" name="David Miliband">the Member for South Shields (David Miliband)</phrase> led the original proposals for Building Schools for the Future. We looked at decades of low investment in school buildings under Governments of both main parties, frankly, through the '70s, '80s and '90s. We looked not only at the physical fabric of schools, important though that certainly is, but at a programme that, more importantly, would support improvement, innovation and change in all our schools. That is a massive challenge, so we had to decide where to start. We made a deliberate policy decision to give priority to those areas with the highest levels of social and economic deprivation. That is why Liverpool is one of the first beneficiaries of Building Schools for the Future, the biggest ever investment in education in the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.1/9">There are six schemes already under way as part of a &#163;135 million wave 2 investment, and I am pleased that three of them are in my constituency: West Derby school, including Ernest Cookson school; Broughton Hall high school; and Cardinal Heenan high school. I have had the opportunity to visit all three of them. They are already excellent schools and have hugely impressive plans. What is most striking is the ambitious education vision at the heart of their plans. I am especially pleased to have been invited to open the brand new West Derby school in September.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend and hope that in the course of my speech all my colleagues will have the opportunity to intervene so that all the schools benefiting from Building Schools for the Future in Liverpool can be mentioned in the debate. The programme is about education transformation, led by the schools themselves; it is not some central Government initiative being handed down from on high. Many of the schools in the programme are already high achievers, but they are being constrained by their buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/2">Wave 6, the next wave of Building Schools for the Future, involves 26 Liverpool schools, with a promised investment of &#163;350 million. The council has identified two sample schools: Archbishop Beck school, which is in the constituency of the my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40371" name="Steve Rotheram">the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram)</phrase>; and St John Bosco school. Five years ago, Archbishop Beck school was in special measures, but it has made huge progress since then and its results are now above the national average. Ofsted has judged the school to be &quot;good, with many outstanding features&quot;. St John Bosco school, which is in Croxteth in my constituency, was last month judged by Ofsted to be &quot;outstanding&quot;. I visited the school last month and was hugely impressed by the focus on standards, the high proportion of the girls who are going on to university in what is a very deprived community, and by the active involvement of the students themselves in the development of the Building Schools for the Future plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/3">Five other schools in my constituency are in wave 6, two of which are special schools: Clifford Holroyde school, a wonderful school for children with severe behavioural difficulties; and Sandfield Park school, which has plans under Building Schools for the Future to increase the school roll from 70 to 100, which will mean fewer Liverpool children with disabilities having to leave the city for their education. De La Salle school in Croxteth is also an outstanding school, and it is due to become an academy as part of the programme. Holly Lodge school in West Derby is a fantastic school that desperately needs that investment. It has exciting plans that it has worked on for four years, and the head teacher has told me that they will be devastated if the investment falls through. St Edward's college, a well-known, highly renowned and popular local school, is also in wave 6.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/4">For all those schools, Building Schools for the Future brings benefits to the schools and also to the wider community, such as better sports and arts facilities-the Holly Lodge school proposal includes plans to open a local cinema, in partnership with FACT cinema in the city centre-adult learning opportunities and extended schools services. The programme will bring high-quality education to many of the communities in Liverpool that we represent, which provides the best hope for social mobility. That is an argument of social justice, but it is also an argument of hard economics. Liverpool's Building Schools for the Future proposals offer a systematic and structured new set of relationships between every secondary school and an identified business partner. That builds upon existing links between a range of Liverpool businesses, such as Jaguar, Everton football club and Merseytravel, and schools, first, to support learning and teaching in the schools and, secondly, to help shape the skills of the future work force.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. In my constituency we were due to start phase 1 of Building Schools for the Future this year, but that has been put on hold until the review is carried out. He will recognise that many students from Liverpool attend schools in both our constituencies. In mine, Crosby high school and Chesterfield high school are due to be collocated, and I hope that he will join me in saying how important it is that that goes ahead, as Crosby high school is a specialist school and its children, who have special needs, will benefit from being on the same campus as a mainstream school.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.3/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase> on his return to the House and on securing the debate. He always showed great commitment to and ambition for children and young people as an education Minister, and he is a great advocate for Building Schools for the Future. I am happy to add my congratulations to his. I congratulate the schools throughout Liverpool that have made such great advances on their educational achievements and I also congratulate the teachers and students on what they have achieved in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/2">It is the Government's ambition to raise the quality of education for every child. As the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, I am a passionate believer in high quality education, and so are the Government. We want to raise the standard of education in every school. Too many children still leave primary school without having achieved the basic standard in reading. We need to sharpen the curriculum, restore confidence in our exam system, ensure that young people go on to work, further or higher education with the skills and qualifications that are valued by colleges, universities and employers, and create a platform for success for the pupil. A first step toward that ambition was the introduction of the Academies Bill, which aims to give more schools the opportunity to enjoy the freedoms that academies have, so decisions about what is taught, how it is taught and how the school is run are placed back in the hands of the professionals.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/3">As has been said, school buildings have a real place in our ambitions for school improvement. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40370" name="Louise Ellman">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman)</phrase> said, it is vital for all schools in Liverpool. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40267" name="Maria Eagle">the hon. Member for Garston and Halewood (Maria Eagle)</phrase> said, building new schools helps to tackle disadvantage and educational underachievement. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40522" name="Bill Esterson">the hon. Member for Sefton Central (Bill Esterson)</phrase> said, new schools can bring in things such as co-location between mainstream and special schools, and as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40372" name="Luciana Berger">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Luciana Berger)</phrase> said, every child and teacher deserves to be in a building fit for education and for the 21st century. Finally, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40371" name="Steve Rotheram">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram)</phrase> emphasised the importance of educational transformation and the need to tackle health inequalities. All those were important points to make in this debate, and I agree with all of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/4">Teaching is probably the most important factor bearing on pupils' outcomes, but it is right to say that the environment must be conducive to and must support education as far as possible. Good buildings, classrooms and equipment are necessary for children to learn, and to make their school a place where they feel happy and secure. Schools will continue to need rebuilding and refurbishing in the future, and, with a rising birth rate, more school places will be needed, which will, of course, require capital spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/5">However, we also have to acknowledge, as the Chancellor made clear in his Budget last week, that we are living in a difficult fiscal climate in which &#163;1 of every &#163;4 that we spend is borrowed, and, increasingly, professionals across all public services are being asked to do more with less. That is the reality of the times in which we live, but, despite the deficit that this Government have inherited and the need to make &#163;6 billion of savings this year, we have protected front-line funding for schools, sixth forms and Sure Start, and we remain committed to investing in the schools estate to ensure that pupils are educated in buildings of a good standard where they feel safe, comfortable and ready to learn.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/6">We need to ensure that we are securing for teachers, head teachers and the taxpayer the best possible value for money as we seek to bring expenditure under control. That will mean some tough decisions. BSF was a flagship programme of the previous Government, who aimed to rebuild or refurbish every secondary school in the country by 2023. Where it has delivered, some impressive new buildings have been built, but that has been at great cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/7">Rebuilding a school under BSF is three times more expensive than building a commercial building, and twice as expensive as building a school in, say, Ireland. The programme simply has not delivered as it should have. Of 3,500 secondary schools, only 5% have been rebuilt or refurbished, or received BSF funding for information and communications technology. That is just 178 schools-astonishingly few, considering how much has been spent.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/8">The programme never really got off on the right foot. In February 2004, the Department's goal was to build 200 schools by 2008, but, of those 200, only 42 were completed by the end of that year. Ambitions for the programme started out as unrealistic and then became unfeasible. Last year's National Audit Office report on BSF said that for the programme to realise the ambition of rebuilding or refurbishing every secondary school,</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/9" class="indent">&quot;250 schools will need to be built a year and the number of schools in procurement and construction at any one time will need to double&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/10">from the next year. That clearly is not sustainable, particularly in the current climate.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/11">The NAO report also documented the tremendous waste that has become synonymous with BSF. The budget bulged from &#163;45 billion to &#163;55 billion, and the time scale increased from 10 years to a projected 18 years. Of the &#163;250 million spent before building began, &#163;60 million was spent on consulting or advisory costs, supporting layer upon layer of process. There are eight official stages to the BSF process, but each one contains its own substrata of complexity. The second stage, strategic planning, has a further nine stages that lead to the completion of a strategy for change. Process upon process, cost upon cost-BSF and its administration and procurement processing have not represented good value for money. We support capital investment, but we need to ensure that procurement minimises administration and consultants' costs.</p>
