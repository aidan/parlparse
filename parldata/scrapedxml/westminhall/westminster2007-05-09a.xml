<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-09a.69.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" speakername="Iain Duncan Smith" colnum="69"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070509/halltext/70509h0001.htm#07050993000465">
	<p pid="a.69.2/1">I rise because other hon. Members and I requested this debate, and Mr. Speaker granted it as his personal choice. We have several different concerns relating to reports about the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, some of which have been in the newspapers and some of which concern the chairman, although I shall discuss the UKAEA's handling of events at Dounreay and its aftermath.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">Let me say at the outset that I have generally been a supporter of using atomic power to generate UK energy. I have generally been open to the idea that we should increase the amount of energy produced by nuclear means as part of our control and reduction of harmful greenhouse gases. Although I do not come here to make a major case in that respect, I should add one caveat. For some time, I have been dealing with the concerns of my long-term friend Geoffrey Minter and his family, whose deeply troubling involvement with the UKAEA regarding the pollution of their land in Caithness and of surrounding areas has lasted several years. In that time, I have often been forced seriously to question my previous acceptance of many, it not all, of the nuclear industry's assurances about the safety of nuclear installations and its sense of responsibility towards them.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3">Although others may want to make particular comments about the UKAEA's chairman, I shall not do so, because that is not my concern today. I simply note in passing that Lady Judge was asked in an interview in the <i>Daily Mail </i>the other day about her qualifications for the job. There are many qualifications that one needs to be a chairman, but&mdash;perhaps this should be a lesson to us all not necessarily to give interviews to newspapers&mdash;she said that when she was offered the job, she prepared for her unique role by studying her son's physics books. After the Deputy Prime Minister resigns, he could presumably put in for the job of chief scientific adviser to the Government on the basis of such qualifications, although I am not sure that we would be too happy to see that come about.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/4">I simply want to raise the case of Mr. Geoffrey Minter, which highlights the abuses that have taken place and the UKAEA's terrible failure in terms of its duty of care towards the land around Dounreay and the people whose livelihoods depend on what goes on there. In May 1997, the first hot particle&mdash;for those who are not aware of it, hot refers to metallic contamination&mdash;was found on the 4 miles of coastline at Sandside beach. The pollution continues to this day, and its effects will continue long into the future. Since that find, 91 items of nuclear waste have been removed from Sandside. In 2006, 19 were removed. Already, in the past four months, 14 have been removed, including the most radioactive ever. The UKAEA has strict liability in law.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/5">I shall return to 1997 later in the chronology of what has been going on, and colleagues will be shocked to learn what has and has not been happening. In 1977, a shaft containing a cocktail of nuclear detritus exploded, but that was kept secret until 1996. In 1983, metal particles were found on Dounreay's foreshore, which were presumed to be of the MTR&mdash;material test reactor&mdash;type.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/6">In 1984, the UKAEA said in the <i>Caithness Courier</i> that non-metallic radioactive material found on Sandside beach was comparable</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/7" class="indent">&quot;to that of a luminous dial of a clock&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/8">On or about <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-28">28 April</phrase>, the Lyall team&mdash;the people responsible at Dounreay&mdash;found big radioactive metallic fragments of live nuclear fuel in the east bay using a Geiger counter, some of which were 18 in deep in the sand. The particles were between 10 and 100 times the magnitude of any found since 2005. No public announcement was made, and the find was kept secret until 2004. Such particles are simply not comparable to the luminous dial of a clock. The items that are being found are very dangerous and would kill somebody if ingested.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/9">On <phrase class="date" code="1984-05-30">30 May 1984</phrase>, the director of Dounreay stated in the <i>Caithness Courier</i> that some of the non-metallic matter at Sandside was</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/10" class="indent">&quot;radiologically insignificant and no more harmful than that&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/11">emerging&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/12" class="indent">&quot;in 3 seconds from a coal fired power station&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/13">I have to say that I was not aware that coal-fired power stations produced fission materials. Such statements are good indications of the terrible way in which those charged with responsibility set about, essentially, to lie to the public and to those who need them to act with the necessary care.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/14">In 1990, my friend Mr. Minter contracted to buy Sandside. He carried out full diligence and even contacted Sir Gerard Vaughan&mdash;an MP at the time&mdash;who, having checked with the Ministry and carried out voluntary checks, told Mr. Minter that there was no record of particular problems. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" name="John Thurso">The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> has been diligently working on this issue&mdash;he may want to say some words later&mdash;and he is fully aware that that was the case, as he has made clear on several occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/15">In May 1997, the first hot particle was finally found at Sandside beach, although, as I said, many others had already been discharged and were found but kept secret. In October, an emergency food exclusion zone was imposed 2 km around the sea outfall, but it did not extend into the bay, where metallic fragments are found to this day. In November, another fuel fragment was found, but the director of Dounreay told Mr. Minter that he should not worry, because a lobsterman stored shellfish in the centre of the bay. He added that the lobsterman would not do that if it was not safe, but I am not sure that we should judge the nuclear safety of areas on the basis of what lobstermen do. Even the fishing zone was not properly policed, and, as a result, people went in and out of it. In any case, I am not aware that fish read safety notices too well, and bottom-feeding fish tend to move out of exclusion zones, although that does not seem to have occurred to anybody at Dounreay.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/16">Mr. Minter was advised to cease a number of activities and did so as a result. They included wild salmon fishing, cattle calving on dunes and using shell sand from the beach and harbour for farm fertiliser&mdash;for the lime equivalent that is extracted from them&mdash;or for roads, building purposes, cattle courts, grouse and so on. In other words, the whole area could no longer be part of a normal productive estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/17">Mr. Minter also met the UKAEA's then chairman&mdash;I hasten to add that it was not the present chairman&mdash;who, as witnessed at the time, told him:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/18" class="indent">&quot;Anything I say I shall deny in a court of law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/19">At the same time, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace called for Sandside beach to be closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/20">It is interesting that as early as 1998, Donald Dewar, the then Secretary of State for Scotland, called for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to ensure that</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/21" class="indent">&quot;any particle arriving at Sandside Bay be promptly detected and removed&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/22">Importantly, SEPA also called for Sandside</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/23" class="indent">&quot;to be restored to a clean and pristine condition as a matter of urgency&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/24">but that has never happened. As hon. Members will see in a second, Donald Dewar's clear statement has never been properly followed through at all. The detection and checking never covered more than half the beach, and even then, the level of detection was very low, with many of the more radioactive particles deeper in the sand simply being ignored.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/25">I shall rush through the next part of my speech a little, but I want to give hon. Members a flavour of the abuse that has taken place. It is no good saying that these things are all history, and I hope that the Minister will not do that. I must tell him and the Department of Trade and Industry that history is about what happens now as much as about what happened then. The effects of what happened, which are referred to as history, are destroying Mr. Minter's estate, and the family has suffered enormously without receiving any serious reparation.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/26">In 1999, from July to December, five more radioactive fragments were found, and in 2000 hundreds more fuel fragments were found on the sea bed. UKAEA monitoring was found, by key officials, including Dr. Day of Manchester university, who was also employed, I understand, by the UKAEA, to be less than 1 per cent. efficient in detecting and removing those particles. Six more MTR fragments were found in that year. In 2001 a peculiar statement was made by the UKAEA solicitor, D. J. West, who promulgated a very false choice. He wrote from Harwell to the local newspaper:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/27" class="indent">&quot;Every additional pound spent on monitoring is a pound which will not be spent on decommissioning, nor on building schools, roads and hospitals. Public money must be spent properly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/28">It is such statements that must leave the public with a very peculiar sense of the priorities. This is not a matter of a Labour or Conservative Government; this is about the responsibility to be discharged by all Governments and their officials. The very idea that there is a choice to be made between schools and hospitals and returning the environment to a usable state is a strange one.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/29">The chairman resigned in 2001 and the chief executive officer then offered to buy the coast at valuation plus. Mr. Minter refused that, on the simple basis that he did not trust the authorities in question. The idea that once any of them were to take over an area they would become diligent and careful, and clean it up, is shown to be nonsense by the history of their involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/30">More particles were found in 2002. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-17">17 November 2002</phrase> Dounreay finally admitted that hundreds of thousands of hot particles&mdash;irradiated fragments&mdash;were now located on the sea bed in the bay. It took those responsible that long to admit, absolutely, what was happening. In 2003 Mr. Minter had to proceed to a court hearing, because he was getting nowhere with the UKAEA. Finally the UKAEA admitted to groundwater pollution from the shaft as well. On <phrase class="date" code="">8 August</phrase> the judge in the case, Lady Paton, ruled in favour of Sandside&mdash;Mr. Minter&mdash;that the public were not being protected. She was highly critical of the UKAEA's behaviour throughout, and its deceit. Dr. Day, of Manchester university, to whom I referred earlier, produced some raw data analysis showing that only half of Sandside beach was being monitored. Thus, in October, Mr. Minter simply withdrew access to the beach, because it was pointless and allowed the UKAEA to engage in a cosmetic process in which it told people that it was dealing with matters when it was not. There were 23 more hot particles found in that year.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/31">In March 2004 Dounreay agreed to fit a filter on the discharge outlet, after pressure from a number of people, including Mr. Minter. It is worth reminding the House at this point that all other Scottish nuclear plants, which do not even discharge into the sea, have filters already fitted. Had a filter been fitted at Dounreay in the first place, particles would never have been discharged as they were into the bay. I remind hon. Members of the date that I gave at the outset: the problems had been going on for nearly 10 years, when it was finally decided to fit a filter on the discharge in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/32">In 2005 the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, sadly, tried to suggest a lack of due diligence, in an inquiry and interview with the then chairman. Mr. Minter wrote to the Committee to correct that, and I am sad to say that the Committee never responded to his letters. I hope that one day it will. I understand that in that year the then Minister, the present Minister for Science and Innovation, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" name="Malcolm Wicks">the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase> wrote to the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross that he wished for a new spirit of openness and co-operation and to learn from the mistakes of the past. He also wrote to me in 2006, saying much the same thing and hoping that he would put right all that had gone wrong in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/33">I shall return to what happened then, but I want to complete the litany that I have been engaged in. Despite all the assurances from the then Minister, and, after he moved on, the present Minister, Lord Truscott, it is fascinating that even at the beginning of the year, at the time of Mr. Minter's meeting with the new Dounreay management&mdash;who are infinitely more positive and constructive than their predecessors&mdash;and even as some agreement is reached about the heads of terms under which a resolution can be reached, and as that decision is passed on to the UKAEA board and then, as I understand it, to the Ministry, Mr. Minter is informed of an issue that the Department of Trade and Industry is now raising. I shall return to that, because it is quite important in relation to the final discussions and what should have been happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/34">In May 1997, Harwell sought consent to access to the 500 acres of land. That was subject to a formal agreement. I remind the House that rights of property have always been enshrined in common law, and are only ever overturned with real reason. Governments should hesitate to do anything of the sort, so it is right that any agreement to gain access to someone's land should come with some financial arrangement and reparation. To this day the UKAEA has never stuck to the agreement or paid any such reparation.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/35">In 2001, following the difficult mediation that the owner of Sandside, Mr. Minter, had agreed to, the UKAEA offered, peculiarly, to buy the demised land on surrender of all his legal rights. He does not want to sell, as I said earlier, because he has always been concerned that once it is sold the land will be shut up, no one will ever know more about it, and no pressure will be brought to bear to clean up the effects of the damage. Anyway, that damage will go on affecting him whether he sells the land or retains control of it, unless it is cleaned up.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/36">The important thing about the monthly collecting at the beach is that on average removal is less than 10 per cent. efficient. The points made by Dr. Day are still relevant. Mr. Minter has always been allowed to deal directly only with the polluter&mdash;never with those who hold the purse strings or the decision-making capacity at the Ministry. It would be far better if the Ministry would engage directly with him to resolve the matter; it seems, at this stage, to be the sticking point for any further resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/37">Mr. Minter has always been the recipient of considerable public vilification, throughout the process that I have recounted. The part of it that really concerns me is that the UKAEA has too often tried to shoot the messenger&mdash;to try to deal with him, because he is a pain in the neck, will not go away, and cares about his land and the environment. He has been subjected to the force of the UKAEA publicity machine, which has been turned on him. I find it unbelievable that an organisation of that kind should have attempted to use its power to crush someone who was simply worried and making complaints, and who wanted a resolution of the situation, and reparation for damages resulting from its action.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/38">The three ministerial letters that I referred to are relevant to what I want to say about the position today. They all seemed to me&mdash;and, I suggest, to the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross&mdash;to refer to the positive resolution that would be in everyone's interest. In fact, in correspondence of 6 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-26">26 March</phrase>, Lord Truscott, the Minister for Energy, wrote of wanting to ensure a settlement that would be in everyone's interest, and positive. The problem is that despite such public expressions of good will, I have been horrified in the past few weeks&mdash;this was the catalyst for my application for the debate&mdash;by the fact that something else seems to be going on at the DTI, which undermines those statements by the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/39">At Dounreay, after all these years and all the problems and false starts, some sort of agreement to settle the matter, at least in the framework, appears to have been reached. However, behind the scenes at the DTI, where the matter now rests, notwithstanding the earlier statements of good will, someone is trying to figure out a way of not having to deal with Mr. Minter; in fact, they have decided on that. They believe that the Radioactive Contaminated Land (Scotland) Regulations 2007, which come into force in October, will allow them access to the land without any further discussion. There is an attempt to settle this problem and deal with this awkward individual by bypassing the whole concept of property rights and simply dispossessing him of his normal and acquired rights over his land purchase.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/40">Mr. Minter has taken the matter up with the dean of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh, who is, arguably, Scotland's most senior QC. The dean makes it very clear to the DTI that it is barking up the wrong tree and that the delay is a complete nonsense. We know what it is all about, but I will come back to that. The dean said, categorically, that under section 15 of the enabling Act, the Radioactive Contaminated Land (Scotland) Regulations 2007 do not apply to Sandside beach and never will. I shall not get into a legal debate with the Minister today, but if that is what the DTI is doing, the relevant Ministers are breaching expressed articles of good faith. Ministers should be ashamed if they have been saying those things while attempting to reach a back-door settlement by seizing the land. I have even heard, from a reliable source, that when this case was passed back to the DTI, an official said, when they were told of the dean's advice, &quot;Well, that section can be altered by the Government, so it doesn't matter.&quot; In other words, if the Government do not like a law, they simply change it so that they can abuse it and the individual concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/41">I hope that the Minister will understand why I consider this case to be an appalling breach of duty of care. The DTI has expressed a desire to settle, but at the 11th hour is looking for a cheap way around the problem. That raises questions about who is really running the show. We cannot have the Minister writing and making those sorts of statements while others attempt to trample over Mr. Minter's land rights. I remind the Chamber that the concept of property rights was established by an Englishman, the Bishop of Chartres, in the 11th century. Those rights have always set English law pretty much above others; the same applies to Scotland and Scottish property laws.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/42">After years of the UKAEA's prevarication, deceit and deliberate delay, which have resulted in it being found guilty of four charges of breaching the Radioactive Substances Act 1993, this issue should have been settled, but still has not been. All that has led to concerns about the UKAEA, which, I suspect, it could have done without. Even after those years of deceit, prevarication and delay, it wants a settlement, but it is now up to the DTI to get on with things and agree a settlement. The current chairman, Lady Judge, wrote to Mr Minter on this matter. In her letter, she made an interesting statement that shows what has been the problem with the UKAEA's mindset. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/43" class="indent">&quot;UKAEA has invested significant time, effort and expense in investigating and attempting to resolve the issues that you have raised over the years&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/44">That is a bland statement of fact, but I remind hon. Members that none of this is his fault. Why has the UKAEA had to expend so much energy, time and effort? Because it polluted the bay in the first place. Why has it all taken so long? Because the UKAEA lied about things and refused to accept responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/45">That mindset seems to have percolated through to the DTI. It is time to settle this case, to accept what has happened and to deal with it, but one can almost see officials at the DTI wonder whether to drag it out a bit more. They might think that Mr. Minter is a private individual with limited means and that if they drag the case out and go to court and make him go through all that, at some point he will break himself, because he does not have very deep pockets. They might think, &quot;He is just an ordinary individual: the Government are always going to win in the end,&quot; so the UKAEA will also win in the end. That is a critical point because this case is about the abuse of power.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/46">What was Mr Minter's crime? It was simply to care about the land that he owns and loves. If he did not love and care about the land, he would surely have taken up one of the purchase offers and walked away from it, but he cares about what will happen. He cares about the next generation, to whom he wants to hand on his land, and about others in the area who will have to pick up the pieces of the appalling deceit.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/47">I have three words to say to the Minister: &quot;Shame on you.&quot; Shame on the Government, shame on the UKAEA and shame on those people who have deceived, cheated, delayed, prevaricated and refused to settle. Shame on those who polluted the land and shame on those who have lied about it and attempted to hide things. I know that the Minister is not directly responsible&mdash;the responsible Minister is in the other place&mdash;but I ask him to reconsider the case. I ask him to imagine himself in this position and that someone had dumped radioactive material on his land, which was consequently being damaged. Would he be quite so blas&eacute; or circumspect in those circumstances? Would he care quite so little about the outcomes and pressures not only on the Minter family, but on other families whose livelihoods are at stake?</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/48">If the UKAEA cared about this case enough, it would drive it to a settlement and would apologise absolutely for everything that has gone on. It must ask real questions about the care, safety and environment of every site that it has controlled throughout the relevant period. I started by saying that I am generally a supporter of nuclear energy, and I remain so, but I have had that belief severely tested when dealing with this case. People who I believed and trusted have shown that they did not deserve that trust. I now say to the Government simply that if someone has dumped the garbage, it is time to pay to clear it up.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.0/1">I begin by declaring an interest. I am not sure if I need to declare it, but it is worth doing so. I recently served on the steering group for the public consultation to find the best practicable environmental option for dealing with the particles that we are debating, which gave me access to a considerable amount of independent advice on the particles. The UKAEA is engaged in a widespread consultation, which is guided by the steering group's work, into who they should see and how things should be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">The right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> is right to say that the particles could prove fatal if ingested. The information that I saw showed that risk is a measure of the severity of an incident multiplied by its probability, and I wish to reassure those who plan to spend happy times touring the north coast that the risk is relatively small. I say that not to take anything away from what has been said, but to put matters into context.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/3">I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on securing this debate on the UKAEA's legacy. He concentrated largely on the disturbing case of my constituent, Mr. Geoffrey Minter, on which I shall remark. However, I shall also discuss the UKAEA's legacy generally, which is, in large part, beneficial and one to be proud of. It is no secret that I am in no way opposed to the nuclear industry, but I am sure that we will hear a different view from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">my Front-Bench colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase>. I believe that nuclear power may prove to be the least worst option in addressing climate change, and it is one that should certainly not be ruled out.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/4">The legacy of the UKAEA's work at Dounreay is some of the best scientific and engineering work that has taken place in the field. The UKAEA and the UK were top of the tree in fast-breeder technology in the 1960s and 1970s, although we have now given all that away. Many patents came out of that work, such as the one for the battery that is in most people's mobile telephones&mdash;the lithium ion battery. That battery makes up part of the power for the Bowman 2 communications system and is made in the battery factory in Thurso. Those things are all part of the asset side of the legacy balance sheet, but there is also a liability side to it, and we cannot and should not shy away from that, because it must be dealt with. The right hon. Gentleman raised one particular liability: the particles arriving on Sandside beach.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/5">I should make the quick general comment that it is important to put comments into the perspective of time. It is easy to look back on past events and judge them in the light of today, as happened recently on the question of the tissue samples. It is important to put that in the context of the time. When X-rays were first invented people did extraordinarily stupid things that we would not even countenance today, but that does not lead us to throw away X-rays. That brings me on to the fact that today is different; as the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, there is a more open and positive culture, and the current management at Dounreay are to be congratulated on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/6">I first became involved in the specific case of the particles on Sandside bay in 2000&mdash;before I was elected to this place&mdash;at the invitation of Mr. Minter, when I accompanied my predecessor, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, to what became known as mediation one. It involved a meeting in London attended by the then chief executive of the UKAEA, John McKeown, and some legal advisers, the outcome of which was that Mr. McKeown said that there was no liability, that they were completely covered, that they had insurance for anything that might come up and that, in any case, Mr. Minter must have known what he was getting into when he bought the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/7">After my election, I spoke to Mr. McKeown, whom I met several times to discuss this issue, and I believe that I had reached the point of persuading him that a settlement was in order. He went off to talk to his board, but unfortunately he left his post shortly thereafter, so that process came to an end. I then spoke at considerable length to the new chief executive officer, Mr. Dipesh Shah, pointing out to him the damage that the repeated publications about this issue were having in the local community and the fact that it was imperative for my constituent to have a just settlement and for the community to have a resolution. Both Lord Maclennan and I worked hard to persuade Mr. Shah&mdash;who then agreed&mdash;and Mr. Minter that the best way to deal with this was through a mediation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/8">That process became mediation two. As that has largely been covered, I shall not go into detail, suffice it to say that it ended with a unilateral offer that was not based on the discussions that had taken place. I am sorry that that happened, because during the process there were moments when I thought that both sides were close to dealing with this. The great frustration that I have had as the constituency MP seeking the best for my constituent and for my wider community is that we have so often been within a fingertip of sorting this matter and somehow we have slipped away from doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/9">Last September, I had a chance meeting with members of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority on another subject and I raised the fact that I thought that a settlement was possible and should be attempted. In the light of that, a non-executive director of the UKAEA was invited to meet Mr. Minter. That process began in October or November and culminated in a wish to recommend an offer. I understand that it was discussed at the Department of Trade and Industry in February and has remained there more or less since then. I have had a number of meetings with various people in the UKAEA, and their view is that they would like this matter resolved, because it is a big drag on them, it has a huge cost, and they would like it to be gone. I was therefore very disappointed to be told yesterday that the offer recommended by the UKAEA has been rejected by Ministers. I ask them to re-examine it, because I feel that there are grounds for a settlement and that it remains by far the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/10">I turn to the general issue of the UKAEA's legacy, which, as I have said, contains many positive parts. I shall touch on one specific aspect of it: the socio-economic legacy. To date, one of the legacies in Caithness of the UKAEA's involvement is a larger, more prosperous and better educated population than would have been the case without it. For 50 years, the Dounreay drive-to-work area has had the highest gross domestic product in the highlands, and that has resulted in infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/11">I remember my mother taking me as a four-year-old to watch the cranes digging the estate where the &quot;atomics&quot;, as the milk rounds people named them, were going to live. The point being that the local council at the time, of which my father was a prominent member, decided that it would welcome them with open arms and integrate them into our community. The result is that Thurso and Caithness is a cosmopolitan community that has high levels of education and skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/12">Whether that legacy is a good one will depend on whether the work currently being done on the socio-economic legacy can be brought to fruition and on whether this challenge is the opportunity that it could and should be. I have been chairing the socio-economic strategy taskforce for the area. Let us try to understand the scale of the problem. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority now accepts that this is, in relative terms, the biggest socio-economic challenge that it has faced. If we consider the percentage of the community's GDP and the percentage of the work force involved, it is, relatively, the single biggest challenge that it has.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/13">We have worked to help ourselves. Our strategy group has produced an excellent strategy, the result of which is a partnership between Highland council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the NDA, with a specific body set up&mdash;an action board&mdash;to deliver results, and new people and money to make things happen. A couple of months ago, we even had a visit from the enterprise Minister in Scotland. I hope that, whatever the shade of the new Administration, we may look forward to similar attention from the new enterprise Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/14">Last July, I spoke to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, inviting him to visit Dounreay. I did so because morale is fragile&mdash;we are losing people to Aberdeen&mdash;and we need to show that the Government are as committed to the socio-economic legacy of decommissioning as they were to the experimental stage that took place all those decades ago. I am sad to say that despite an agreement in principle to come, notwithstanding a multiplicity of invitations and reminders, since then no Minister has been able to find themselves in Caithness. The signal that that has sent to our community is not a good one, so I gently urge the Minister to take back to his Secretary of State the fact that we are having a conference in the week of <phrase class="date" code="">5 September</phrase>&mdash;the exact date can be of his choosing&mdash;and if he would be good enough to attend that, I am sure that all would be rectified.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/15">Our community is working hard to find solutions to our problems. We are doing our bit, but we now need the active and positive interest of the DTI to help us find them. The points have been made on the constituency case. It has been unfortunate that much of this has been fought out publicly in the press. Will the Minister put all those considerations aside and do what our community would like and what the UKAEA management would like&mdash;find a proper settlement of the case?</p>

	<p pid="a.80.0/1">No. I am not inferring that. I am merely stating the fact, which is clear, that Mr. Minter bought the land knowing that Dounreay was next door. That is all I am saying, and nothing more. I am also trying not to use any of the words about Mr. Minter which one might wish to use, having read the details, because I do not believe that any debate is advanced by using words such as &quot;deceit&quot;, &quot;cheats&quot; and &quot;lies&quot;. I do not believe that that is the way to debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/2">The issue is that on a number of occasions, Mr. Minter has been offered ways in which the problem might be solved. It is clear that there is difficulty on both sides in coming to an agreement. I have had many constituency problems during the 30 years that I have been a Member of this House and often it is not a question of one side or the other. People get themselves into a mess, and begin to dislike each other because they both feel that the other person did not do what they said they would do, and by the time one gets to the present stage, it does not help to dig over the past. What matters is that an agreement is made, and that would have been the better way to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/3">I do not have a very high opinion of the Department of Trade and Industry, and I think it is the most reactionary Department in the Government. It is the least environmental; it largely holds up any policies that would be good and finds good reasons why things should not be done. It is a dreadful Department, and the sooner we get rid of it and put trade into the Foreign Office and industry into a Department for the environment, the better. I hope that the new Prime Minister will do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/4">I do not believe that there should have been attacks on the individuals concerned. Quoting and referring to officials who cannot answer for themselves is unfair and unacceptable. There should be access for the UKAEA across the land to carry out the decommissioning properly. That is the first thing that is necessary. The second is that there should be a clean-up process that ensures that the land is returned to its pristine condition. Thirdly, it is necessary to ensure that we retain and protect the contribution that the UKAEA has given to the area over many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/5">I support the words of the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. We do not help by exaggerating the concerns, or by pretending that there are no concerns. Hon. Members with such constituencies, who must deal with these issues day in, day out, must strike a careful balance. We must choose our language carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/6">Will the Minister hurry the matter up, because the long delay has not helped, and it is a great pity that we are still at the same stage? I want to hurry him up for two reasons: first, for the area itself and, secondly, for constituencies such as mine. I have come straight off an aeroplane to this debate because of my constituency. I want my constituents to feel that when such issues arise they are dealt with rapidly, cleanly and clearly, and that the UKAEA has greater power to make decisions. One matter about which I am concerned and with which my right hon. Friend struck a chord is the long time it takes the Ministry to do anything. I am surprised that it manages to find its way to the House of Commons without special guidance, because it takes so long. Why are we still waiting, month after month, since earlier this year for a decision on a perfectly simple matter?</p>
	<p pid="a.80.0/7">Could we have a new spirit abroad in the Ministry? When it gets a letter, can it reply within a week, and when there is a problem, can it reply within a fortnight, but can it not leave it to fester? If the Minister could make that change, there would be a big difference, so I hope that he will tell all of us who represent constituencies with nuclear power stations that we can expect the DTI to move at the pace of private industry, to answer questions when they are asked, and to recognise that compensation paid in due time and changes made rapidly usually cost a great deal less than what must be paid after 10 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.1/1">In my estimation we have never truly had close relations with Russia, certainly not during my lifetime, yet it is such an important country. It has a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and a huge influence in the middle east and other parts of the world where we are seeking to solve long-standing problems. I have visited Russia on a number of occasions and been in awe of it, but it has huge cultural differences from us that we must learn to understand and appreciate. We must learn to respect the fact that Russians think differently from us and do things in a different way. We need to achieve greater mutual respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/2">Russia faces many foreign problems including in the Kaliningrad enclave, which borders Lithuania and Poland. Russia has borders with 14 countries and there are various problems with some of those neighbours, ranging from diplomatic spats to outright confrontation. I wish to mention a couple of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/3">Russia has a long-standing dispute with the Japanese over the Kuril islands, which were seized after the second world war, and that has led to a lack of Japanese investment in Russia. Recently we have read about the growing tensions between Russia and Estonia, because the Estonians have taken down a statue commemorating the tremendous sacrifices of Russian soldiers during the second world war in liberating that country. That has led to some serious intimidation of Estonian diplomats in Moscow and, as an ally of Estonia in NATO, Great Britain has shown serious concern about the treatment of Estonians over the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/4">Belarus is, in my estimation, the last dictatorship in Europe&mdash;a most appalling, dreadful regime in the heart of Europe with which Russia is having to grapple. President Lukashenko is commonly known to have instrumented some of the worst human rights abuses and is causing the Russians a great deal of problems by blackmailing them to pay for the transit of Russian oil to Europe through the pipelines in his country.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/5">Of course Russia has relations with North Korea, which is near Vladivostok on its far eastern border. Both Russia and ourselves are extremely concerned about nuclear proliferation in North Korea, which has an unstable regime that is extremely cruel to its population but is pursuing an extremely expensive programme of nuclear weapons production.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/6">Russia has many problems but I have time to mention only a few, of which the last is Chechnya. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1984" name="Menzies Campbell">The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase> has written an open letter to the Russian authorities, together with others including the Conservative former Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase>, and the former leader of the Liberal Democrats, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2011" name="Charles Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy)</phrase>, outlining their concerns about the atrocities in Chechnya. It is an ongoing, terrible problem for Russia and there are appalling human rights abuses on both sides. That is happening in Europe, which is of great concern to us as well as to the Russians.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/7">I wish to talk about the areas in which we need Russian support and why it is so important to have good relations with Russia. We need Russian support in the war on terrorism. Russia has a huge influence over Syria and Iran, and we know that there is an ongoing problem with border-crossing between Syria and Iraq. Insurgents and terrorists are coming from Syria and other countries across the Syrian border into Iraq, directly threatening the lives of serving British soldiers there because of the porous border. I know that Russia has long-standing trading and diplomatic relations with Syria.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/8">On the other side of Iraq, Iran has allegedly been assisting insurgency in Basra and the rest of the south. Russia has huge influence over Iran and has been supplying it with a great deal of nuclear technology, ostensibly for a peaceful programme of nuclear power generation. We in Great Britain and others are concerned about the possibility that Iran may use that technology to produce nuclear weapons. Russia is at the forefront of supplying such countries with nuclear technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/9">Just today we learn that Russia is allegedly selling attack helicopters and gunships to Sudan. An article from today's <i>Daily Telegraph </i>states that Russia has</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/10" class="indent">&quot;broken a United Nations arms embargo by supplying Sudan with attack helicopters, bombers and other weapons in the knowledge that they are being used against civilians in Darfur, Amnesty International said yesterday.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/11">It concerns me greatly that a country such as Russia, which has a permanent seat on the Security Council, is allegedly selling such appalling weapons to Sudan to enable the Sudanese Government to carry out some of the worst human rights atrocities imaginable. We should be putting a great deal more pressure on Russia and seeking explanations as to why it is breaking a UN embargo, which is totally unacceptable behaviour. I return to my point that we need a better relationship with the Russians in order to lobby them and put pressure on them. Many people in our own country feel strongly about what is happening in Darfur and look to us to stop the atrocities. We must use our influence as a major military and economic power in the world to lobby the Russians to try to prevent such exports.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/12">What more needs to be done? I look forward to listening to the Minister, who will hopefully explain what he is doing to draw Russia ever closer to the European Union and into our camp to be our close allies. We must consider the Kaliningrad enclave, which is a remnant of the settlement of the second world war and is cut off from the rest of Russia, sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland. It has significant problems through being surrounded by European Union countries but not having the benefits of being in the EU. I am sure that we in the EU could do more to give special status to that part of Russia, which is almost encased within the EU, to assist with trade and better transport links. We want to encourage trade between the Baltic states, Poland and Russia. I would certainly urge the Minister to spend some time considering what could be done about that anomaly in Europe, and about whether Kaliningrad's status could be modernised.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/13">We need to engage more directly with Moscow. That is the key point that I want to get across in this debate. When I speak to my friends in the Russian Foreign Ministry, they tell me that they get hardly any visits by British Ministers. That may or may not be true, but they also tell me that French and German Ministers are pounding on their doors all the time. Russia gets a huge number of delegations led by French and German Foreign Ministers, and also cultural and trade visits. My friends say to me, &quot;We look to Great Britain as potentially a key strategic ally, yet you seem to ignore us. There are far fewer visits by your Ministers than there are by French and German Ministers, who seem to take us more seriously.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/14">I would like more visits not just by Ministers from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office but by Ministers from the Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Trade and Industry, particularly the Minister for Trade. He should be leading far more delegations of British companies to Russia to look for business and start to make contacts with Russian companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/15">One project that I am particularly interested in is the Sakhalin oil project off the far east coast of Russia. British Petroleum and Shell, among other British companies, are involved in one of the largest oil exploration programmes to date&mdash;there could be a huge oil find in Sakhalin&mdash;but I do not know how much help they are getting from Ministers. I would be interested to hear what the Government are doing to help BP fight its corner in Russia. The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has had high-level meetings with BP. The Russians are tough negotiators, and I know that BP&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.96.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> on securing this debate. I would like to emphasise, as he has already done, why it is important for the UK to work with Russia, and why we do so. We should not lose sight of the fact that Russia is an important player in enabling us to achieve our international objectives. I shall add to the examples that the hon. Gentleman rightly set out.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/2">Russia remains a key player and an important partner in the United Nations Security Council. It is a major energy supplier to Europe. We need Russian assistance to tackle climate change&mdash;indeed, strong leadership from Russia will be required to do so&mdash;and Russia offers real potential as an important market for UK trade. Those are just a few of the reasons why we should engage with Russia to promote international security, stability, and prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/3">We work with Russia in the UN to address challenges to international peace and security. We discuss issues such as Iran's nuclear programme, Kosovo and the middle east peace process. We have worked with Russia through the G8 to address, among other things, the challenges of climate and energy security, international development and avian flu. We are working with allies through the NATO-Russia Council to discuss plans for a ballistic missile defence system in Europe, and we are working with our European Union partners towards a new framework for EU-Russia relations. Negotiating a successor to the current partnership and co-operation agreement will give us a mechanism for discussing and resolving any disagreements on issues of key interest to the UK, including trade, energy and human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/4">In working to achieve the Government's international priorities, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office spends considerable time, effort and resources engaging with Russia. Russia's chairmanship of the G8 resulted in a particularly high level of contact in 2006, with 15 ministerial visits to that country. I visited last autumn, and I hosted Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Titov for talks in London in March this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/5">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry visited Russia in February with a high-level business delegation, and Ministers with responsibility for international trade and for energy have visited in the past two years. Notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman's assertions, the truth is that there has been high-level and high-quality engagement with Russia at ministerial level in recent times.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/6">It is important to emphasise that engagement with Russia does not always mean agreement with Russia. Its status as a global player means that it must abide by international commitments and operate from the same international rulebook. We want Russia to be strongly committed to the rule of law, and to provide a just home for its citizens as well as a predictable partner for Governments and businesses to deal with. If we believe that Russia is falling short of the international standards to which it has subscribed, we will say so. Let me give some examples of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/7">On energy security, which the hon. Gentleman referred to, the British Government were at the forefront of efforts in the G8 that led to the St. Petersburg principles on energy security that were agreed in July 2006 under Russia's G8 presidency. The principles of transparency, predictability and stability of global energy markets and supply should underpin global energy markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/8">On numerous occasions since the G8 summit in St. Petersburg, we have reminded Russia of the important principles to which it signed up. We have done so not least in the context of seeking protection of British investors' interests in the oil and gas sectors in Russia. We have repeatedly underlined to the Russian Government the importance of ensuring an operating climate that encourages investors to invest for the long term in that country, which in itself will help Russia to meet global energy security needs. I conveyed that message to all the Russian interlocutors who I met last autumn, and I continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/9">On the specific agreements and contracts affecting British companies, it is important that the companies themselves should make decisions as to the right way forward. They have received strong and consistent support from the British Government, but, ultimately, it is for them to make judgments as to the best way to secure their own arrangements with and in Russia.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/10">Furthermore, as we have stated on many occasions, the Government welcome investment in the UK by companies and individuals from Russia or, indeed, anywhere else who are transparent in their business, and who are prepared to operate in markets governed by competitive, liberal market principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/11">The Government believe that respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law promotes stability and economic development. That is as applicable to Russia as to any other country. As such, where we have concerns about Russia's human rights record, we will raise them. We do that through formal consultation mechanisms, such as the European Union and the Council of Europe, as well as bilaterally. For example, EU-Russia human rights consultations raised such issues only last week and in the Council of Europe we continue to work with Russia and others to ensure that all member states, including Russia, uphold their commitment as signatories to the European convention on human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/12">The hon. Gentleman referred to Russia's relations with its near neighbours and we believe that it is in our and Russia's interests to have stable and prosperous countries on Russia's borders. We regularly discuss the common neighbourhood with Russia and raise issues of concern, such as Russia's embargo on Georgia and the economic restrictions placed on Georgians living in Russia. Equally, we believe that Russia must treat our EU partners fairly and with respect. I mention that in the context of recent difficulties in relation to Estonia.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/13">Another issue on which we do not see eye to eye with Russia is its attitude to the asylum or refugee status of individuals in the UK, and their continued presence here. Despite our continuing efforts to explain the nature of judicial independence in this country, the Russian Administration have not fully accepted that such questions are matters of UK law, not of politics or diplomacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/14">Nevertheless, having set out the areas of critical concern, we should not lose sight of the positive aspects of the relationship between the UK and Russia. On trade, during the first three quarters of 2006, the UK was the largest foreign investor in Russia and accounted for about 18 per cent. of Russia's total foreign investment. Our trading relationship reached an all-time high in 2005 when annual exports were nearly &pound;3 billion. In terms of people-to-people contact, the number of Russians visiting the UK has risen by 20 per cent. a year over recent years. The number of Russians who have visited the UK now exceeds 170,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/15">The Government regard Russia as an important international partner and, as such, we expect Russia to meet its international commitments. As I have said, relations with Russia are underpinned by active, and, where necessary, critical engagement. When we disagree with Russia we say so, and where obstacles and disagreements exist, our aim will continue to be to seek to resolve them through a transparent, open and honest dialogue. It is a balanced approach that is aligned to British interests and I hope that the hon. Gentleman can support it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-09a.112.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1529" speakername="Tim Boswell" colnum="112"  time="015:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070509/halltext/70509h0007.htm#07050993000528">
	<p pid="a.112.1/1">It is a fine diplomatic judgment, but my view is that states that accede to the Council of Europe should meet its standards, and its parliamentary representatives should meet those standards as well. We need to consider the situation firmly, robustly and briskly. We do not have to accept it just because a particular nomination has been made. On the other hand, of course, we do not start with the presumption that people are delinquent, without having the opportunity to discuss the matter with them. However, the hon. Gentleman is of course right to raise that point. I shall come to some practical aspects of intolerance shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/2">The second main virtue of the Council is its huge geographic spread. I mentioned in an intervention on the hon. Gentleman the fact that observer status takes us almost around the globe, but even membership itself enables us to project what we might loosely, and perhaps rather arrogantly, call western values as far, at least, as the Caucasus and beyond. That is a huge strength. Wherever the final boundary of the European Union is set, it is likely to be much nearer to us than that, and membership of the Council enables us to widen our influence to the east.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/3">The third point to be made about the Council, which has not yet been made explicitly, is that while it is understandable that as politicians we concern ourselves with peace and war, politics, diplomacy and immediate security threats&mdash;those are proper and right concerns, as is the threat to individuals' or groups' life and limb&mdash;there are, particularly in the committee work, a great many opportunities for wider discussion. It was put to me by one of the ambassador's officials that in their experience the Council of Europe operates as a high-grade think tank in which issues that cannot be discussed in the House, where we are usually too busy with party politics, can be developed and thought about, experiences can be shared and a view can be distilled.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/4">To give one example of what I mean about committee work, I am on the equal opportunities committee. I realise that there are people in this country for whom those words come with the automatic assumption that everything is deeply dripping with political correctness, and that no good can come from it. I had a slight feeling of that kind, if I am honest, when I first considered a report, with an Azerbaijani female rapporteur, on the feminisation of poverty. However, on reading the report I came across extremely interesting perspectives, on, for example, women's position in relation to pensions, which is a matter that concerns many people here. I was able to pass that report on to colleagues here to think about.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/5">Some hon. Members present today may be aware of the work that is being done in this Parliament on anti-Semitism. Coincident with that there is also a Council of Europe initiative on anti-Semitism, and I have taken some steps to see that the two initiatives are joined up, and that our work will feed into the concerns of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the Council; the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase>, who attended the debate briefly, is also concerned about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/6">The final point that I should like to emphasise is the personal aspect of the matter. We come here to talk to one another and share experiences, and to communicate feelings across the party divide. We are all familiar with that process, which is a good one. We extend that, in the Council of Europe, to a much wider constituency. We meet people whom we might not otherwise meet, and establish contacts that we might not otherwise be able to keep open. I have mentioned the presence in my own party grouping of the Party of the Regions, from Ukraine, and United Russia, from Russia itself. Those are valuable links that we should use, and they are in a sense also available for wider diplomatic purposes, if that is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/7">Where should we take matters next? We need to emphasise that the Council of Europe is distinct; it has a distinct role and needs to stick to that, without wandering into other territory, and to defend its competence in the areas that we have mentioned of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and the functioning of the Court. We are aware of the unfinished business on the European Convention and the interest of the European Union in the fundamental rights agency. We need to be a little firmer than we have been so far on that matter. We need also to remember that there are other important aspects of the work of the Council that are not coincident with the work of the EU, and which provide it with a distinctive character. I should put it this way, on behalf of the Council: &quot;We are not the European Union and we are not a waiting room for the European Union either. There may be states that want to join us because they now sign up to the values, and will subsequently wish to join the European Union, but we have a distinctive role.&quot; Coincident with that, we need to sharpen our own relevance to the issues that are proper for the Council to deal with, and be ready to put more, not less, pressure on non-compliant member states to monitor what they are doing, and put some holly under them.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/8">Neither should we forget what I might call the cultural hinterland. Defining the role of the Council as democracy, human rights and the rule of law is fine, but we also meet as Europeans, or as near Europeans, in some cases. We should be able to extend our role and, as we do with the European museum of culture, adopt slightly wider interests. However, those are not the general political concerns that are normal in exchanges between states, and which make some dealings with the European Union frankly rather predictable and cynical, in my experience. We do, actually, perhaps rather better than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/9">I feel quite strongly that we need to bring the work of the Council of Europe here, as the hon. Gentleman has done in initiating the debate, and ensure that hon. Members are aware of relevant debates. I was very glad when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1371" name="Graham Brady">my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady)</phrase> came to see for himself what was happening at the Council. We should encourage our parliamentary colleagues to do that. An aspect of our position&mdash;hon. Members have been frank in the debate about the fact that we are not faultless or above scrutiny&mdash;is that we should expect more inward interest in United Kingdom activity. The Council of Europe is already examining aspects of our postal voting system. If we want someone entirely objective about the current political argument on the difficulties of the Scottish election&mdash;someone who is outside that argument&mdash;it would be an admirable possibility to invite the Council in, and say, &quot;You look at it, and see how it went. You understand elections, so look at the difficulties and compare and contrast.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/10">There is, of course, a constant dialogue about pressures in the European Court of Human Rights. In my role in Public Bill Committees I enjoy teasing Ministers. If, as happened the other day, a Minister tells me that something does not come under article 3, I say, &quot;But we may get you under article 2, if you are prepared to be that cynical.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/11">My next point is our non-ratification of treaties, and I am delighted that the Minister for Europe will respond to this debate because we have had a genteel correspondence about it. We all know that there are different practices and different attitudes to the importance of ratification. Some people will sign anything with the intention of doing nothing, but on the whole Britain has been more open and honest in saying that we will sign when we are ready and have looked at the difficulties, and that we will ratify when we have our dots in a row and not with our fingers crossed. That will apply, quite properly, to the convention on trafficking, and I am delighted that Her Majesty's Government have now signed that and that we have acceded to it. We now need to move, as the Prime Minister said, to early ratification, but we cannot do that overnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/12">In the course of my inquiries, I discovered that we have signed, but not ratified, more than 19 other such conventions. Some may have become inappropriate, impossible or out of date, and we should not ratify them. I have suggested to the Minister that he might like to produce an annual report, but I see his reluctance. However, I would like him to take away the need to manage the process and see if we can get our strike rate up and the number of bits of unfinished business down. That would be an important courtesy to the Council and an example to others.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/13">I conclude simply by saying that if colleagues are ever tempted to be cynical about the Council, I would invite them to come and look at our European democratic group. On the first occasion I was there, I saw an Armenian sitting between two Turks, and I suddenly realised the significance of that. That says a great deal about the Council, its virtues and why it has a distinctive role.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> on securing this debate. I want to say at the start that I agree entirely with what he said, particularly his closing comments and thanks to the staff who work for the delegation here in the House. It is an amazing tribute to their patience and forbearance that they tolerate us as they do.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/2">I also echo the support for and good wishes to the retiring ambassador and the staff in Strasbourg, as well as previous ambassadors and, as hon. Members have rightly said, the staff of the House who do so much to facilitate the Assembly's work. The Clerk alongside you today, Mr. Weir, is a formidable person to come across in Strasbourg when one is trying to get something past the Table Office. It is always a welcome sign to see the staff here.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/3">The importance of this debate is to plead the case for the non-separation of the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe. They are fundamentally linked, and I know from talking to colleagues from other delegations that they are under pressure to see that separation take place. Funding of the ECHR is essential. If no more cases were submitted to it, there would be a 10-year backlog, so it has a formidable task.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/4">The role of the Council of Europe over the 50-odd years of its existence has not diminished. There are new countries and fledgling democracies that we hope to see manifest themselves as proper democracies, not simply managed democracies, but democracies that are prepared to challenge each other from within, to allow a change of Government without major disputes or conflict arising, and to deal with human rights, the rule of law, and the role of democratic processes at all levels. The Council's task is still as relevant today as it was 50-odd years ago. It is essential that we look sympathetically, understandingly and realistically at the Council's role.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/5">The funding issue is a great burden, and we are lucky that our Secretary-General, Terry Davis&mdash;a former colleague&mdash;who has the unenviable task of trying to keep all the Council's balls in the air and to keep everyone happy, has done a very good job, but he is up against the zero budgeting situation year on year. The pressure on the Assembly and the Council's Executive to cut back, cut back and cut back is an ongoing struggle and will not serve any good purpose to anyone in Europe. We need from the Council of Ministers and the 47 states in the Council a more realistic approach to the way in which it is funded. How easy it would have been for the EU to have diverted much of the money that it put aside in creating, to all intents and purposes, a rival to the Council if it had voted those resources to supporting the ECHR more fully.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/6">The issue of the Serbian Speaker is a concern, but if we believe in democratic processes we cannot suddenly say that we do not like the results of elections, whether inside a Parliament or outside. We can criticise it, but we cannot draw a line in the sand and say that a country can no longer attend or should not take up a post when it is their turn under the system. I am sure that many of us have serious concerns about a number of Governments that are ruling member states, but as democrats we must accept that the people in those states have, albeit sometimes in not-too-free elections, arrived at a decision that we do not like. If we are genuinely trying to instil democratic processes, we must work with them and not ostracise them or kick them out.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/7">That is why I opposed the removal of our Russian colleagues when everyone was up for removing their credentials. The position of the 36 Russians who represent the Duma and the Commonwealth of Independent States in the Council of Europe would have been seriously eroded, and I doubt whether they would have attempted to come back if we had gone through with that. We have had to learn the hard way some of the lessons about the building of democracies, and that must continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/8">We must find a way, as hon. Members have said, to bring the Council of Europe into our Parliament here. A negative issue is that, as all hon. Members who have spoken have said, so few people in the UK know what the Council does. We should be able to find a mechanism to have a regular debate in parliamentary time on the Floor of the House about the issues of the Council. Former Members of the House&mdash;John Wilkinson and David Atkinson&mdash;tried in different ways to bring debates to the House, but were not successful in bringing the whole House behind them so that there was a common purpose to ensure that we had regular debates on the institution, which so many of our colleagues in Europe treat as the biggest and most serious player, and which is changing the way they govern themselves. We should be conscious of that and make more of it.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.2/1">However much Members are dying to hear the Minister, they will have to wait a few minutes longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> on securing the debate. It goes some small way to fulfil the call that several Members have made to provide more information and make more reports to Parliament about the excellent work that goes on in the Council of Europe, particularly in the Assembly on which colleagues sit.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/3">The hon. Gentleman referred to the present Minister as being Council of Europe-friendly. Unfortunately, I fear that we may lose him before too long, which he may regard as justice denied or at least justice delayed. I can reassure the hon. Member for Manchester, Central that the Opposition and I are also Council of Europe-friendly, and I am very pleased to pay tribute to the organisation and its excellent work.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/4">The hon. Gentleman spoke about the Council's relatively low profile in the United Kingdom, which is regrettable but interesting when contrasted with the way in which the Council is perceived in other member states. On my recent visit, I was struck by how very seriously the Russian representatives took the Council. That is an important situation, and we ought to work with it and take full advantage of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/5">The hon. Gentleman spoke about the Council's role in promoting human rights, justice and democracy, and he welcomed the fact that those standards are applied throughout all 47 member states. We, too, should welcome that fact, even when it is slightly embarrassing for ourselves, given the current investigation into postal voting. It is a timely reminder that we are not in a position always to lecture others, and that we must pay heed to maintaining high standards in our own democracy and in our own observation of the rule of law.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/6">I mentioned earlier the role of the European Court of Human Rights, which is one of the most important parts of the Council, and the courage that a number of justices show, sometimes in the face of pressure, when dealing with cases that are highly controversial in their own countries. If people knew more about such work, they would regard it highly and they would be keen to know that it is being maintained and carried forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/7">I pay tribute to the British members of the Assembly of the Council of Europe. When I visited, I had many conversations with members from other countries, staff and people involved in all aspects of Council work. It was clear that the contribution, activities and the amount of work put in by United Kingdom members are very highly regarded. That point applies to all parties, and all Members should be grateful and show their appreciation to those colleagues who serve with such distinction. They are a credit to our country and the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/8">We have heard from a number of colleagues who sit on the Assembly. Some cannot be present: <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1832" name="David Wilshire">my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)</phrase> wished to be present, but he is elsewhere in the House attending to parliamentary business with a strong constituency focus on airports; and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase> travelled to Athens this morning where he is chairing a meeting on migration.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/9">However, we have had excellent contributions from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase>, who nodded as I said &quot;excellent contributions&quot; and modestly stopped when I referred to him. He noted the importance of the work on migration and he described the way in which the Council works so effectively without the political integration that in some ways intrudes on the operation of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1529" name="Tim Boswell">My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)</phrase> spoke about the strong commitment to free and fair elections, the Council's election monitoring work and the importance of its equal opportunities work. The hon. Member for Manchester, Central will agree that equal opportunities is not a matter of political correctness. Representing Manchester constituencies, we know about the Pankhursts' excellent record in the city, that one of them stood as a Conservative candidate there, and that equal opportunities has always been important to all parts of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/11">I do not want to keep the Minister from colleagues for very much longer, but I reiterate the call that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made for more information, and for an update from the Minister on when the Government anticipate ratifying the convention on against trafficking in human beings. The Government's signing of the convention was welcome, but we would like them to ratify it in the near future. I hope that the Minister will enlighten us&mdash;perhaps while he is still in his current position.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/12">The hon. Member for Manchester, Central also drew attention to the role of British parliamentarians from both Houses and all parties, and their important role in Azerbaijan, Chechnya and elsewhere in the past. Several colleagues referred to concerns that arise from time to time about the future role of the Council of Europe, and in particular the potential conflict with the role of the European Union. It has become a problem recently because of the development of the fundamental rights agency, the danger of duplication of effort, and indeed, the diversion of resources, which could be better spent on the Council of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/13">The Council's great strength is its extra geographical spread over countries such as Russia, which does not wish to be a part of the European Union, and Turkey, Ukraine and the Balkans, which do. That spread is of enormous importance to the United Kingdom and all our European colleagues. It provides us with extra reach and with further persuasive abilities to try to achieve improvements throughout the continent and throughout the Council's 47 member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.2/14">In conclusion, this debate has given us all an opportunity to focus a little more on the important work of the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights. We must also recognise the difference between the Council of Europe and the European Union, and the Council's vital ongoing role in spreading democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-09a.123.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" speakername="Diane Abbott" colnum="123"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070509/halltext/70509h0009.htm#07050993000545">
	<p pid="a.123.1/1">Unusually for a Member securing a debate such as this, I am not a lawyer&mdash;I never have been, nor have I ever trained as one. My point of departure for bringing this debate to the Chamber is the issue of access to justice for my constituents, who are among the poorest people in society and make up a highly ethnically diverse community.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/2">It is common now in smart circles to speak disparagingly about lawyers&mdash;&quot;fat cat lawyer&quot; is the phrase; the words run one into another. It is even common to be disparaging about the importance of the meticulous application of the rule of law. So it is important to remind colleagues that legal aid is one of the pillars of the welfare state of which we are so proud. The Legal Aid and Advice Act 1949 made reference to:</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/3" class="indent">&quot;assistance...and legal advice...so that no one will be financially unable to prosecute a just and reasonable claim or to defend a legal right&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/4">Legal aid needs defending just as all on my side of the Chamber would, I hope, defend free access to the health service at the point of use. Legal aid is one of the essential pillars of the welfare state.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/5">It is to the credit of the Government that legal aid spending should have risen in recent years. However, that rise in expenditure and costs has been the basis for the Government's legal aid reforms. It is true that in England and Wales we spend more per capita on legal aid than almost anywhere else in the world. Legal aid expenditure has gone from &pound;1.5 billion in 1997 to nearly &pound;2 billion today&mdash;extraordinary figures. We might say, &quot;Gosh, all these fat cat lawyers in their limousines are carrying away bagfuls of money.&quot; The Government are doing something about that&mdash;and only too right.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/6">However, although the costs have risen and the Government are absolutely right to try to obtain value for money for the taxpayer, I draw people's attention to the fact that the rise in legal aid costs is a complex subject. A recent study commissioned by the Law Society pointed out:</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/7" class="indent">&quot;It is correct that total legal aid costs have increased significantly over the past decade. However, it is...important to recognise that the increases do not apply to all areas of legal aid...In the past three years, 2002-06, costs in most areas of criminal and civil work have increased only slowly if at all, and on a per case basis have often decreased.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/8">Yet the Government are bringing in changes in the fee arrangements and reforms that are designed to apply across the piece, in spite of research that reveals that the inflation in costs has occurred only in certain areas&mdash;notably criminal defence in the Crown court, with the famous &pound;1 million-a-year barristers. I hope that there are none in the Chamber today. Cost inflation has also occurred in litigation advice and child care proceedings. I ask Ministers why, if the cost inflation applies to very specific areas of legal aid practice, they are applying a remedy across the piece. That will have a detrimental effect, to which I shall come later.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/9">In leaving the issues of costs, of the complexity of cost inflation and of the over-simple remedy that the Government are applying, I could do no better than quote from a distinguished QC who spoke in a debate on criminal legal aid in October 2005. She spoke about costs and countered the argument that they were all down to fat cat defence lawyers, from whom we had to take money away. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The costs of the criminal justice system generally, leaving aside legal aid, have increased by 46 per cent. in the same period that we are talking about legal aid having increased. It is hardly surprising that defence costs have increased as well.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-26">26 October 2005</phrase>; Vol. 438, c. 74WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/11">That logical point was well put by a distinguished QC, who also happens to be the Minister replying to this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/12">Everybody accepts that it is important that the Government should get value for money. However, given that the cost inflation is specific to certain areas of legal aid, one of the questions asked by the Law Society and other representative organisations is about why we are engaging in such an across-the-board remedy. There are many critiques of the Government's legal aid reforms and many are valid. However, in the short time available, I want to focus on the issue of the reforms' effect on black and minority ethnic lawyers. I want to do that not because it is the only problem, but because it has become increasingly clear that the legal aid reforms will bear particularly heavily on such lawyers. One might ask, &quot;Why should that be? The Government are not putting forward legislation designed to be deliberately discriminatory.&quot; The problem is that black and minority ethnic lawyers are more likely to be in legal aid and to have smaller, newer companies.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.0/1">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">my hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase>, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> on obtaining this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/2">We debated the main thrust of our proposals for legal aid in this Chamber a short time ago and I shall not retread old ground. However, today is the first day of the new Ministry of Justice and it is important to reiterate our commitment to a legal aid system that serves 21st century Britain in all its diversity. It is central to a properly functioning justice system in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/3">As my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said, we have the best funded legal aid system in the world. Running closely behind us&mdash;we pay about &pound;100 a head while they pay about &pound;30&mdash;are the continental systems that have an inquisitorial process. All the other adversarial systems are further behind again. Without doubt, we have a well-funded system. My hon. Friend is right to say that there is an odd mixture of pride that the cost of legal aid has gone up and of difficulty, and that the drivers are complex. I do not change a word of what I said in the debate that she quoted from, and I am grateful for her use of the word &quot;distinguished&quot; to refer to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/4">The drivers are complex, of course, but it is necessary to manage costs in the ever-spiralling legal aid fund, and in particular to manage them as they relate to crime. My hon. Friend talks as though it were totally a cost issue, but it is not. At least part of the reform involves changing the way in which lawyers are paid so that we can guarantee that we get appropriate value for money for a quality service, moving from hourly rates, which are likely to support inefficiency rather than efficiency, to fixed fees. That is part of the structural changes, and such measures are necessary in areas where there is not a huge overspend. That means that when we move money across we are sure that we are getting value for money in the places where we locate the new funds. The changes have a number of purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/5">We are looking for a system that is fair to clients, defendants, practitioners and the taxpayer. Since this is day one of the Ministry for Justice, I stress again the Government's commitment, and my own, to diversity in the legal profession. In the judiciary, at the Bar, or in the front-line offices of solicitors' firms across the country, a diverse legal profession is essential for a quality legal service for all the clients who will and must be served by our justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/6">I am well aware of the kinds of concerns that my hon. Friend has raised. One of my earliest meetings when I got this aspect of my ministerial portfolio was to meet the Black Solicitors Network and the Society of Asian Lawyers with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>. I told them then that the reforms will not be discriminatory; I say that again today.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/7">When I delivered the third annual lecture to the Black Solicitors Network, I said that I was impressed that its members had come to see me straight away and that they do not mince words any more than I do. I emphasised that I was their ally in making the legal profession one that represents Britain in the 21st century, and I reiterate that today.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.2/1">I am pleased that I was able to secure this debate. It is particularly timely, as the International Whaling Commission is meeting in Anchorage right now. The Scientific Committee meeting has already started, and meetings will continue until the end of the month, with decision making happening between the 28th and the 31st.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/2">The issue of international whaling is of great concern to many people in this country. I am sure that I am not alone in having had dozens of constituents write to me on the issue, and that other Members will have had similar postbags. I would like to thank the Minister for his helpful responses to constituents who raised the issue with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/3">During the debate, I would like to outline the history of the issue, give some background and explain the problem. I shall discuss the changes made last year by the IWC and explain why the issue is rapidly moving up the agenda of animal welfare organisations, then perhaps touch on the UK's response so far and turn to the challenge of the meeting at the end of this month. Finally, I shall pose some questions for the Minister about the UK's activities to secure the outcome that we all want at that meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/4">Whaling has occurred on a small scale throughout history. I believe that there is broad agreement among most nations of the world and even among animal welfare organisations that small-scale whaling by indigenous peoples can be supported and sustained, and that it involves sufficiently small numbers that it will not greatly affect world whale populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/5">However, the advent of large-scale commercial whaling in the 20th century has resulted in literally hundreds of thousands of these beautiful, majestic creatures being killed. Some estimates of the number of whales killed in the past century are as high as 2 million. In fact, some species were hunted almost to extinction; for example, the blue whale is only now recovering and still has a very small population. It is estimated that there are as few as 1,700 are in the southern hemisphere.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/6">But there was a chink of light 25 years ago with the International Whaling Commission, and a reprieve for the whales when it agreed on a moratorium on commercial whaling. To some extent, whale populations have been allowed some respite and the ability to recover. I believe that many scientists agree that the moratorium helped to halt the rapid decline in whale stocks, although the IWC Scientific Committee is not without its internal politics: there is not always agreement on specific whale numbers and the size of whale stocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/7">Why is it important to maintain the moratorium? There is a very strong argument in terms of the animal cruelty involved. There is no humane way to kill a whale. Whales are killed by methods that would not be allowed for any land-based mammal. Whaling fleets go out armed with all their technological equipment to find the whales, and harpoons are shot from cannons. A six-foot iron spear goes into the whale. Often, it will have a grenade with a timer on the end of it. The grenade explodes shortly after impact, blowing the animal's insides apart, but, unfortunately, death is not immediate. Seldom is it possible to fire the spear into the animal's brain, so the whale may then thrash around in agonising pain for up to 10 minutes until it finally dies. The horrors of that have been well documented by a variety of non-governmental organisations and charities.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/8">Apart from the animal cruelty aspect, I would argue that there is just no economic sense to commercial whaling. Whales may be hunted for human consumption, but there are well-documented health hazards because of heavy metal content. Indeed, even the Japanese, who have undertaken so-called scientific whaling and who have used the meat for food, have huge stockpiles of meat that they cannot get rid of. Few people want to eat whale meat, and the Japanese are trying to sell it off for school dinners or, in some cases, even pet food.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/9">So there is no economic case for commercial whaling. However, there is a great economic case for whale watching, which is a non-intrusive activity that allows people to see the beauty of the creatures in their natural environment. It has been estimated that last year nearly 8 million people took part in that activity, providing $800 million of revenue to those countries where they are able to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/10">Those are reasons for keeping the moratorium, but the problem is that Japan in particular has been actively lobbying to resume commercial whaling. Given that there is no economic case for it, the reasons why the Japanese are so determined to maintain it completely escape me. Perhaps whaling is some kind of cultural totem or tradition.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/11">Japan has had some success in signing up members of the IWC, particularly small countries that have been tempted by promises of aid packages. There are well-documented cases of the amounts of money that have gone to different countries: more than &pound;2.5 million to St. Kitts and Nevis, more than &pound;8.5 million to Nicaragua and more than &pound;4 million to Palau. It is estimated that over the past 12 years Japan has given $750 million of so-called fisheries aid to smaller countries which have then ended up voting on a pro-whaling basis on the IWC. Japan has now started having pre-meetings in Tokyo, to prepare for IWC meetings. It did so in 2006 and again this year, and paid for small countries to attend.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/12">Last year, 66 countries were present at the IWC meeting. For the first time, as we all know, there was a pro-whaling majority on one motion in the St. Kitts and Nevis declaration, which included a statement that the</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/13" class="indent">&quot;International Whaling Commission is therefore about managing whaling to ensure whale stocks are not over-harvested rather than protecting all whales&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/14">That is a clear message that Japan is not keen on the role of protecting whales.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/15">The declaration also includes the words:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/16" class="indent">&quot;Further noting that the moratorium which was clearly intended as a temporary measure is no longer necessary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/17">It does not have legal, binding status, but Japan hopes that it will give credibility to its case for resuming commercial whaling. The motion was passed on a knife edge of 33 to 32 votes.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/18">Other votes last year did not command a simple majority but still give cause for concern. There was a vote to prevent discussion on steps to protect small cetaceans, or dolphins, which was narrowly defeated 32 to 30. There was a resolution to permit minke whale catch in the Okhotsk sea, which was defeated by 31 to 30. Perhaps most worrying was a proposal by Japan that votes of the IWC should be held in secret. It was defeated by just 31 to 30. Given the allegations of bribery&mdash;the votes of specific countries being bought by Japan&mdash;that is obviously of special concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/19">What has been the UK's response to the issue? First, I very much welcome the work of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on the issue. I believe that the work of DEFRA Ministers and officials is very much praised by interested groups in the UK. The document &quot;Protecting Whales&mdash;A Global Responsibility&quot;, with a foreword by the Prime Minister and David Attenborough, has been sent to the countries on the IWC. It was certainly a very good initiative. Strong diplomatic means of showing our views on the issue, such as the summoning of the Icelandic ambassador last October, have helped to make the UK stance quite clear and to show a lead in Europe and globally.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.2/20">However, I would like to press the Minister on some points and seek an assurance from him that all of the Government as well as his Department are doing everything that they can to secure a victory at the IWC at the end of this month for the anti-whaling countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point about the distinction between DEFRA and higher levels of Government. Does she share my concern about the slightly ambiguous answer I received from the Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-26">26 April</phrase>, which mentioned that the highest diplomatic levels were being used and that Foreign and Commonwealth Office posts in the relevant capitals were being briefed? Would she welcome confirmation of whether his Department has asked the Prime Minister to make his views known to countries, such as Denmark and the smaller Commonwealth nations, and would she also welcome confirmation that the Prime Minister has done so?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-09a.133.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="133"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070509/halltext/70509h0010.htm#07050993000557">
	<p pid="a.133.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point and I would welcome some clarification from the Minister on that issue. Obviously, it is welcome that the Prime Minister has written the forward to the document, &quot;Protecting Whales&mdash;A Global Responsibility&quot;, but that is not enough on its own. The Prime Minister should be encouraged to write to all the nations concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/2">I urge the Minister to emphasise to the Prime Minister the importance of using occasions when he meets other world leaders to press the matter. We know that the Prime Minister met the Japanese Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-09">9 January</phrase> this year and a written parliamentary question on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January 2007</phrase>, <i>Official Report</i>,<i></i>column 151W, asked whether they discussed whaling. In the answer we are directed to the website, which states what was discussed at the meeting. However, there is no mention of whaling on the website. When the Prime Minister had the opportunity to press the Prime Minister of Japan on the issue it seems that he did not rise to the challenge and ask him about whaling.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/3">Although the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs may press the issue, in terms of diplomacy within the wider world, surely the Foreign Secretary has a role to play. Yet in a written question on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-27">27 February 2007</phrase>, <i>Official Report, </i>column 1205W, the Foreign Secretary was asked what discussions she has had with Ministers and officials in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs about whaling in the past 12 months. In answer she said</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/4" class="indent">&quot;I have no current plans in this regard.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-27">27 February 2007</phrase>; Vol. 457, c. 1205W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/5">It seems that she is passing the issue onto DEFRA. The Foreign Secretary should have plans in that regard. She should be involved in efforts to deal with the issue and it should be taken forward at Cabinet level.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/6">Can we really take the Government's anti-whaling credentials seriously if, despite the good work of DEFRA, the issue is not receiving the priority attention that it should at the highest level? I urge the Government to recognise that Japan never misses an opportunity to involve its highest profile Ministers from the Cabinet and the Prime Minister of Japan in the issue. That can be countered only by a similar level of effort from the UK Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/7">On a similar point, I note that it will be the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" name="Barry Gardiner">the hon. Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner)</phrase> attending the IWC on behalf of the UK at the end of month. I know that the Minister has previously attended and has great experience in this area so I am curious to know why he is not attending this year. That may be a matter of concern in terms of sending a message that the highest levels of Government are involved in the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/8">We have the meeting at the end of the month and there are more than 70 members of the IWC. We hope that there will be a slim majority of anti-whaling countries, but the process moves quickly and countries have up to the last minute to join, so the situation could change. What steps are the Government taking to convince more of the current members to switch if they are anti-whaling or if they are wavering? What are the Government doing to encourage more countries to sign up? There has been some great success with Croatia, Slovenia and Cyprus, but is there likely to be any progress in getting Greece to sign up before the end of the month? From the documents I have read, I understand that secrets ballots are unlikely to be an issue at the meeting. However, I would welcome the Minister's understanding of the situation and if we could at least have some reassurance about whether that will come to the table at the forthcoming meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/9">In some circles, there is a fear that the US, which, of course, is usually anti-whaling might be tempted to do a deal with Japan to ensure that there are enough votes to secure aboriginal hunting of bowhead whales off Alaska. That is of concern because the US is an influential country that could carry others with it. Has the Minister anticipated that happening? What is being done to use our influence, particularly with the smaller countries that we have strong historic ties with&mdash;for example through the Commonwealth, as my hon. Friend mentioned? What UK diplomatic efforts are being made to exert influence on those countries?</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/10">Denmark is particularly a matter of concern because, as the Minister will know, last year it voted in favour of whaling. That was against EU policy, although it is a member of the EU, and was against the wishes of its own people who are overwhelmingly anti-whaling. Will the UK use its influence to strongly point out to Denmark that its responsibility should lie with its people and the EU, and that it should not repeat its pro-whaling vote of last year?</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/11">One further concern is that of sustainable whaling, which may be mooted by Japan to muddy the waters by introducing a new category of coastal whaling. That would be the thin end of the wedge and should be strongly resisted by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/12">In conclusion, there is much agreement about the issue and DEFRA has done some excellent work to preserve these majestic animals. I commend the good work that has been done, but am concerned about support for the issue at the highest levels of Government. I urge the Minister to do all that he can to gain high level support for the issue and to exert his influence over the next few weeks.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-09a.135.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" speakeroffice="The Minister for Local Environment, Marine and Animal Welfare"  colnum="135"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070509/halltext/70509h0011.htm#07050993000558">
	<p pid="a.135.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> on securing this debate. I know from my post bag that the issue concerns many hon. Members and their constituents. I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her help in highlighting the plight of whales&mdash;animals that hon. Members from all parties would agree are in need of protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/2">Not only whales, but the world's oceans and the life that they support are under serious threat from pollution, over-exploitation, the damage and destruction of habitats, and climate change. Despite those pressures, three nations in the world continue to hunt whales on a large scale, which is why the UK places great importance on the protection of whales and all cetaceans. That is supported through my Department and our membership of international conventions, such as the IWC, as well as the convention on international trade and the convention on migratory species.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/3">I agree with everything that the hon. Lady said about the substance of the issue and why the anti-whaling cause commands so much support from hon. Members. However, her attempt to drive wedges between parts of the Government was somewhat churlish. It is widely recognised, not just in the House, but internationally, by other Governments and among the main non-governmental organisations that are involved in the issue&mdash;such as WWF&mdash;that no country has done more than the UK in recent years to hold back the tide of pro-whaling nations, led by Japan.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/4">I assure the hon. Lady that Government at all levels have engaged in the issue. The Foreign Secretary wrote joint letters with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to a number of important countries following the publication of &quot;Protecting Whales&mdash;A Global Responsibility&quot;. I was grateful that she praised that document, which we decided to publish after the worrying development last year of Japan managing to win one vote with a majority of one. I am satisfied that the joint letter has been important in helping with the recruitment of a number of new members.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/5">I also assure the hon. Lady that the Prime Minister was ready and primed in the wings to engage if he and we felt that was necessary. I hope that she would also agree that one keeps one's most powerful and secret weapon in reserve until it is absolutely necessary and that it should not be deployed unless that is the case. As things stand, we are quietly confident that we have been successful enough to regain a simple majority in Anchorage, but we will wait and see. We certainly have not ruled out the possibility of engagement at a higher level should that be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/6">Last week, I spoke to my US counterpart who was visiting this country in relation to these issues and she gave me a strong reassurance that the US would be solid on the matter to which the hon. Lady referred and that no deals would be struck. After last year's vote, I made the UK's displeasure quite clear to the Danish Environment Minister, both on the telephone and in person. The hon. Lady is right to point out the oddness of the Danish position.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/7">It is not just up to Governments and NGOs, however. I am always urging Members&mdash;as I think that I did in the letters that I sent to the hon. Lady&mdash;in any activity in which they take part, whether parliamentary visits abroad as part of Select Committees or parliamentary groups, to take with them a list of countries on the wrong side of the whaling issue. They should never lose an opportunity to make it clear that we think that this is an abhorrent activity that belongs to a bygone age and that it is not acceptable anymore. Often, such low-level, bottom-up parliamentary and political activity can have a significant effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/8">Events in Iceland in recent months have been very interesting. Much to everybody's horror, last year Iceland resumed commercial whaling, against the spirit and, we believe, the letter of the convention. Iceland faced quite a strong backlash from the international community. The UK led a diplomatic d&eacute;marche against the Icelandic Government. A number of senior Icelandic business people and politicians spoke out against their country's decision because they were worried about the impact that it was having on Iceland's international image and on tourism and whale watching.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/9">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire is absolutely right to point out that even for whaling countries, whale watching is a far more significant economic earner than whale killing. She was right to say that countries that continue to kill whales do not find markets for their products and spend a great deal of taxpayers' money desperately trying to do so. Excuse the pun, but I suspect that they are flogging a dead horse. The public in all of those countries, particularly the younger generation, are turning against whale consumption in a very big way.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/10">We are in a difficult period in the history of the IWC. We had that setback last year, although it does not pose a threat to the moratorium because a three-quarters majority in the IWC would be needed to over turn the moratorium. However, as the hon. Lady said, it would allow Iceland and the pro-whaling countries to take control of the agenda and to influence important issues, such as the protection of small cetaceans, whale sanctuaries in the southern oceans and procedure in the IWC, which could include secret sessions and ballots, which we think would be disastrous and completely indefensible. How can any democratic country recommend that such issues be discussed behind closed doors and that their own public should not have any idea about their Government's position and how they voted? It is completely unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/11">As I said earlier, and as the hon. Lady kindly acknowledged, we have had some success&mdash;more in the last year than in the last few during which I have been responsible for this policy area&mdash;in recruiting extra members. I would like to pay tribute to the EU Fisheries Commissioner. Last autumn, I raised this matter at an Environment Council. Joe Borge was very keen and picked up on it. In fact, he issued a statement in that Council condemning Iceland's decision and urging all EU members to join the IWC. A significant number of those recruits are EU members. A couple of countries that did not pay their subscriptions last year have now been persuaded to do so. That is extremely welcome. We are still not quite sure about Greece. We were led to believe that it would be there, but there is still some uncertainty about it. We are trying to clarify such things all of the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/12">I pay tribute&mdash;perhaps unexpectedly&mdash;to the former Conservative party treasurer, Lord Ashcroft, who is a passionate defender of whales. He helped to fund a very powerful, short advert that would be shown more widely in a number of Caribbean countries were it not for disgraceful censorship by some of them. If reports that I have read are true, even television channels such as MTV have been intimidated into not showing it in some of those countries. That is a disgraceful example of self-censorship. We will write to MTV, asking for an explanation for why it has not shown the advert. Nevertheless, Lord Ashcroft has been very effective, particularly in central American countries, helping them to come on board on the right side of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/13">We are perhaps more confident than we have been for a while that the tide is turning in the right direction again, but we will be very vigilant. One never really knows what will happen at the IWC. Its procedures are perhaps more ruritanian than those of any other institution or event in which I have ever been involved. I am very sorry not to be going this year. There is a simple reason: as I explained to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase>, I have had a long-standing family commitment since before the date of the IWC was set. However, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who is responsible for biodiversity&mdash;and after all, whales are animals&mdash;will do a tremendous job with our very strong team. We send one of the biggest teams of any country in the world and we are one of three countries that religiously are represented at ministerial level, along with Australia and New Zealand.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/14">I am very glad to say that&mdash;I would like to think, partly at my instigation&mdash;the Germans will also this year be sending representation at ministerial level, which they have not done for a number of years. Given that they have the EU presidency, that sends a very good signal. I am quite confident that the pro-whale nations will be strongly represented; we will do our best, as we always do, to make a strong case and to beat off the advance of the whale-killing nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/15">I would like to say a little about what has been happening in the past year in relation to whale killing. It is particularly worrying that the Icelanders began to kill the endangered fin whales as well as minke whales. As I said, we led a d&eacute;marche against the Icelandic Government. We heard some very interesting comments a week or so ago from the Icelandic Prime Minister&mdash;Iceland is in the middle of an election campaign, which may be relevant&mdash;who said that Iceland's decision was not final and that they might revisit it. I hope very much that it does when its elections are out of the way, and I urge all hon. Members to use any influence that they have, either in London with the Icelandic embassy or through contacts that they may have, to keep up that pressure. It would send a clear signal. I do not think that public opinion in Iceland is in favour of the killing. It is being conducted by a single operator.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/16">The hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire speculated, which is something I often do, about why the whale-killing countries continue to do that when there is no economic benefit. She put her finger on one important reason: there is a feeling that it is part of their tradition; it is almost a cultural obstinacy. Dealing with that is quite difficult, because the harder the international community pushes, in many ways the more some people tend to dig in. The feeling is, &quot;We don't want the rest of the world telling us how to conduct our affairs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/17">Another interesting fact is that the phenomenon is relatively recent in Japan. Large-scale commercial whaling in Japan really kicked off only after the second world war, because it was a source of readily available and cheap protein. Many countries, including the United Kingdom, which used to whale until relatively recently, have long since abandoned it. I hope that those other countries do so as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/18">As Sir David Attenborough said in the foreword to our excellent brochure, which has been widely welcomed and acclaimed through the House:</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/19" class="indent">&quot;It's not just the future of the whale that today lies in our hands: it's the survival of the natural world in all parts of the living planet. We can now destroy or we can cherish. The choice is ours.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/20">The UK has made its choice already: we have chosen to cherish. It is now time for all countries to make theirs. Future generations will judge us harshly if we fail the whale.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/21" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.0/22" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Five o'clock.</p>
