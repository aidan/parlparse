	<p pid="a.308.0/1">We know that, and I might come to that point later. I could retort to the hon. Lady that Israel is illegally occupying a significant piece of territory that does not belong to the state of Israel, and yet it does not always suffer the same degree of international condemnation for so doing, but I do not want to justify one wrong against another. I shall address her point in slightly more detail later.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/2">Like all hon. Members, I am sure, I very much welcome the release of Alan Johnston this week. His kidnapping was deeply stressful and was damaging to the Palestinian cause. Clearly, Hamas will want to take credit for the release, or at least to tell the world that it indicates that it has control of the security situation in Gaza. We were unable to visit Gaza because of the security situation. The previous Secretary of State managed to get in shortly afterwards, but others have found it difficult. It is effectively a prison, sealed off by land, air and sea, with virtually no resources and no functioning economy. The question that we have to concern ourselves with is: how is the basic essence of life to be maintained there?</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/3">Our former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is to take up the role of Quartet representative. He faces an awesome challenge and a crisis of credibility with the Palestinians given his close ties to the Bush Administration and to Israel. How can he mobilise international assistance, as he has been specifically asked to do, let alone develop the economy of Gaza in those circumstances without talking to Hamas? He will have to do so sooner or later. If he were here, I would say to him that Hamas will have to be involved in talks at some stage, as part of the wider process, just as on the path to peace in Northern Ireland he had to talk to Sinn Fein and the IRA.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/4">Our report, and its timing, were motivated by the fact that while international aid and the UK's contribution to the occupied territories was rising, incomes were falling and poverty was increasing, with the most vulnerable&mdash;older people, women and children&mdash;suffering the most. I shall not go into the statistics now, but they show how deeply people were affected in practical ways. As our report says, that situation was directly attributable to two facts, the first of which was the withholding of revenue from the Palestinian Authority: both the customs revenue collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian Authority and budget support from international donors. The second fact was the effective blockade of Gaza and the total disruption of access and movement around the west bank, both of which were imposed by the Israeli Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-05a.311.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" speakername="Richard Burden" colnum="311"  time="015:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070705/halltext/70705h0001.htm#07070556000311">
	<p pid="a.311.0/1">I, too, welcome the Minister to his new position, and to this debate in particular. This is an area of the world in which I know he has a genuine personal interest. Both he and I were observers to the Palestinian parliamentary elections in January 2006. All the international observers agreed that those elections were fair and democratic. That is remarkable, given that they were taking place under conditions of occupation.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.0/2">I want to endorse everything said by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1993" name="Malcolm Bruce">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase>, Chairman of the Select Committee on International Development, in introducing our report. The elections to which I just referred have, in many ways, formed the backdrop to its contents and to the Government's response.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.0/3">I found the Government's response to our report most disappointing. It seemed to come from a script that was written before anyone had read our report and that representatives of the Departments concerned rehearsed before us during evidence sessions. As a result of those evidence sessions, we produced a report that challenged some fundamental inconsistencies in the approach hitherto adopted by not only the UK, but the EU and the Quartet. The inconsistencies and challenges that we outlined were not based on prejudice or conjecture but on the evidence that we had received in our evidence sessions and what we saw with our own eyes when we went to the area. When we produced those challenges, we got back a response that simply repeated that script complete with the same inconsistencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.0/4">Since our report was published, significant developments have taken place, particularly arising from the Hamas takeover in Gaza two or three weeks ago. The right hon. Gentleman made the point well that, if anything, such developments make our report even stronger.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.0/5">I hope that the Minister will not take this personally, but I must warn him that some of what I say will be critical. I say that not because I want to have a go, but because I want change. Yesterday's release of Alan Johnston opens up a window of opportunity for change, if only we are prepared to grasp it. With willingness to change being a watchword of our new Government in the UK, I hope that we will grasp it.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.0/6">As the right hon. Gentleman said, at the centre of our comments was the contention that the boycott has been counter-productive. We do not say that it has caused the suffering of the Palestinian people, because it has not. The cause of that suffering is occupation; movement restrictions; closures; Israel's construction of a wall and of settlements on land that does not belong to it; the economic and military blockade of Gaza by Israel; and the withholding of millions of dollars of tax revenues. Our report makes it clear that although those are the causes of the suffering, the imposition of a boycott policy on Hamas and then on the national unity Government by the Quartet has made that bad situation even worse and even more dangerous.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.1/1">That is a very fair point. The British Government started saying that we would talk those members of the national unity Government who accepted the conditions, but not to others. That is madness; we say we want to move forward and engage in dialogue, but we once again put barriers in the way of our ability to allow dialogue to take place.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.3/1">On the second point, we will wait and see. I welcome any release of money, but I am not sure that the money that my hon. Friend mentions has actually been released yet. Similarly, the Israelis gave a commitment to release 250 prisoners, but I am not sure that that has happened yet either, although I am aware that more arrests have been made. On the question of why no money was released, let us be clear that the boycott was put in place and maintained during a Hamas ceasefire; it was introduced not in response to terrorism, but in the context of a ceasefire. So what my hon. Friend says is simply factually incorrect.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/2">I am clear that Hamas's military takeover in Gaza a few weeks ago was not justified, even if it does, ironically, appear to be bringing order to the streets of Gaza. However, the EU, the Quartet and ourselves are in a state of denial about our contribution to the creation of the very circumstances that unleashed the bloodshed that we have seen in recent weeks. We told the Palestinians to go down the path of democracy, but then shunned the Government who came out of the elections that we supervised. We told Hamas to turn away from violence and to commit to democracy, so it stood for election, suspended its attacks on Israel and offered a long-term ceasefire. When that happened, we ignored those changes and, as my hon. Friend made clear, we are still not admitting that they took place. Instead, we boycotted Hamas, telling it that its election would be disregarded by the outside world unless it signed up, without qualification, to the full renunciation of violence, the full recognition of Israel and the full acceptance of international agreements between Israel and Palestine.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/3">We are absolutely right to say that all those ingredients are essential to a long-term solution, but we made them preconditions to even talking to the elected Hamas Government. We have never applied similar preconditions in other situations and we certainly do not apply them to Israel, despite the fact that it does not live up to them, as was proved in evidence before the Committee. For example, Israel has never, in practice, renounced violence in pursuit of its objectives. It also continues to violate its own obligations under international law and existing agreements through its continued occupation of Palestinian land and its construction of a wall, not along its own lawful borders, but beyond them. That was confirmed in evidence that the Committee received.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/4">The trouble is that our boycott has provided a cover for the economic and military blockade of Gaza, which has cut off most Palestinian trade access by land, sea and air. Last month, Christian Aid reported that more than 80 per cent. of the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza are without a regular income. Are we trying to address that through measures such as the temporary international mechanism? Of course we are, but the bitter irony is that we are now having to spend more on emergency food and medical aid to a Palestinian population caged in by the boycott and by isolation than we ever did before we imposed the boycott. That aid is more expensive and less effective than it would have been, because we have insisted on bypassing the very institutions that we would need to use to deliver it effectively. That has helped to increase unemployment among public sector workers and to deepen poverty across the west bank and Gaza. As a result, we now have to put in even more aid to offset the effect of our own policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/5">The crisis in Gaza is getting even worse. Only last week, a mother of five, aged 31, died because she was one of thousands of people who were stuck at the Rafah crossing after Israel closed the border. People were stuck outside in the searing heat, in some cases without any shelter. We should remember that the border is not between Israel and Gaza, but between Gaza and Egypt. If we are to help the people of Gaza, we must do something about that. The international community and indeed the EU are meant to have monitors there, but our ability to affect the situation seems to be hampered by whether Israel allows the border to be opened.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/6">If we want to help President Abbas, as I think we should, we should really do something about the continuing conditions of occupation in the west bank. We should insist that the release of tax revenues happens in practice and that it goes further. We should do more about prisoners; even some of our colleague parliamentarians&mdash;some of those who were elected in the elections that my hon. Friend the Minister and I supervised&mdash;have been abducted by Israel, in contravention, once again, of international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/7">Our report makes a many recommendations about what Israel should do to solve such problems, and the Government assure us in their response that they regularly raise most of the issues that we have raised in our report, including illegal settlement building, the demolition of Palestinian homes and the fact that, under the EU-Israel association agreement, Israel continues to claim trade preferences for goods imported into the EU that are produced on illegal settlements, not in Israel. Apparently, such issues are regularly raised, so let us test what that has meant in practice recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/8">The middle of June was a tumultuous time in Gaza and the west bank. A few days later, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">18 June</phrase>, the Israeli Foreign Minister met EU Foreign Ministers, including the then Foreign Secretary, at the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council. I tabled some questions asking what issues had been raised with the Foreign Minister of Israel. One of my questions was:</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/9" class="indent">&quot;To ask the Secretary of State...what discussions she has had with the government of Israel in the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">18 June</phrase> on the situation in the West Bank and Gaza; and if she will make a statement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/10">I was assured:</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/11" class="indent">&quot;My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary discussed the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories with Israeli Foreign Minister Livni on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">18 June</phrase>. In the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">18 June</phrase>, our Ambassador in Tel Aviv had extensive discussions with the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defence, amongst others.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-06-25.212"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 June 2007; Vol. 462, c. 212W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/12">That was very good news. So what did they talk about?</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/13">Another of my questions was</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/14" class="indent">&quot;whether she held discussions with EU partners in the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">18 June</phrase> on Israeli settlement building on the E1 plan&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/15">which is a particular problem,</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/16" class="indent">&quot;and elsewhere in the West Bank; and if she will make a statement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/17">The answer was:</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/18" class="indent">&quot;My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary did not hold any discussions about settlement activity in the West Bank with her EU counterparts in the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">18 June</phrase>.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-06-25.209"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 June 2007; Vol. 462, c. 209W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/19">It then repeated the mantra that settlement building is illegal.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/20">I asked whether there had been any discussions with EU partners in that week</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/21" class="indent">&quot;regarding the effectiveness of EU arrangements for monitoring the importing into the EU of goods produced in Israeli settlements built in the Palestinian territories but labelled as made in Israel; and if she will make a statement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/22">The answer was:</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/23" class="indent">&quot;EU Foreign Ministers did not discuss settlement goods at the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">18 June</phrase>.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-06-25.210"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 June 2007; Vol. 462, c. 210W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/24">I asked what discussions there had been about the EU-Israel association agreement and its future. The answer I got back was:</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/25" class="indent">&quot;At the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">18 June</phrase> my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, along with other EU Foreign Ministers, discussed the peace process with Israeli Foreign Minister Livni. They discussed the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and next steps. There was no discussion of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-06-25.213"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 June 2007; Vol. 462, c. 213W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/26">I asked whether there had been any discussion at that meeting of the</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/27" class="indent">&quot;demolition by Israel of homes in the Occupied Palestinian Territories; and if she will make a statement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/28">The answer that I received was:</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/29" class="indent">&quot;My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not discussed house demolitions with the Israeli government in the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">18 June</phrase>.&quot; .&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-06-25.210"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 June 2007; Vol. 462, c. 210W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/30">I asked whether there had been any discussion of the labelling of goods on which trade preferences were claimed but which were produced in settlements built in the occupied Palestinian territories. The answer was:</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/31" class="indent">&quot;The Government have not had any discussions with the Government of Israel on these issues during the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-18">18 June</phrase>.&quot; .&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-06-25.210"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 June 2007; Vol. 462, c. 210W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/32">That is really not good enough. I therefore ask my hon. Friend the Minister to look again at the Committee's recommendations. Let us start again, because change is possible. The Government should look at our report from scratch. Let us see what we can do to fulfil in practice, and not simply in theory, the reassurances that we got in the response to our report.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.3/33">The recent speech by the then Economic Secretary to the Treasury on an economic road map was very positive. Let us take that logic forward. Dialogue works. We are rightly committed to dialogue with the Israelis, but let us also have more evidence about how to take that forward in practice with the Palestinians, not because we want to support one Palestinian faction against another, but so that we can help, from our end, to rebuild the national consensus under the legitimate President of Palestine, President Abbas. That will be vital to securing a durable peace between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>

	<p pid="a.320.1/1">There are obviously many examples of constructive co-operation between Palestinian and Israelis in a business context, but does the hon. Lady not accept that, for such co-operation to deliver real economic benefits, all the restrictions need to be removed to enable economic transactions to take place? After all, Wolfensohn put his personal money into greenhouses in Gaza, and the people had to throw the produce away, because Israel would not allow them to the market. We had many examples of businesses on the west bank that simply could not get their people to work or their products even to the local markets, because of the restrictions. If Israel will not withdraw from the west bank and allow freedom of movement, none of that economic co-operation will deliver long-term benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.321.0/1">I also welcome my hon. Friend to his new role as a Minister in the Department for International Development, and I wish him every success. As a member of the International Development Committee, I endorse the report's recommendations, which our Chairman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1993" name="Malcolm Bruce">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase>, set out and amplified in his own contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/2">I am reminded not only of the Committee's visit to the west bank last November, but of my earlier visit to the Gaza strip as part of a parliamentary delegation organised by the Labour Middle East Council a few years ago. Visiting Gaza, one is struck by how small a piece of land it actually is. It is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, and it is strewn with rubbish and graffiti. People literally live on a rubbish tip. It is a place of constant fear, tension and suspicion, but the fate of the children of that area has made an indelible mark on me, and it is something that I shall never forget.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/3">Many children had visible signs of malnutrition, and many were psychologically scarred by the continuous violence that surrounded them, as one could witness in the frequent aggressive behaviour of small boys in the street. There were also fading signs of any hope for their future. That was three years ago, so I struggle to imagine how much worse the situation has become for those children over the past 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/4">In the unique political debate that applies to the Palestinian territories, the international community has struggled to align the recognised principles of humanitarian relief and development. Those principles, which are applied elsewhere, have to come up against some very undesirable Governments and political Administrations. Sudan and Zimbabwe are just two that spring to mind, and only this week, the Committee took evidence on the continuing conflict in northern Uganda, where the international community has to engage in dialogue with the Lord's Resistance Army&mdash;an organisation that has committed some of the worst atrocities known to man. At times, we must make difficult decisions with organisations and Governments who lie on different parts of the scales on issues such as democracy, human rights and corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/5">However, we are discussing Palestine, so we apply a different set of principles to that situation. The international community took an immediate, absolutist approach by withdrawing all direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, even though it was widely recognised that public sector employment was a key element in maintaining the economy. The public sector was the largest employer and the biggest spender, employing more than 161,000 people, who, in turn, it was estimated, supported more than 1 million people in the population. The inevitable plummet to disaster, which we are witnessing, does not give the international community any credit. We have to ask whether we need to make some fundamental changes. Not paying up to 80,000 security staff proved to be catastrophic; it meant letting loose 80,000 people with guns on the streets. Imagine being a woman or a child in Gaza, faced with that situation on an hourly and daily basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/6">Yesterday in Parliament, Mr. Alastair Crooke, the UK director of Conflicts Forum, gave a talk to the Council for Arab-British Understanding. He has worked with, among others, former President Bill Clinton and Senator Mitchell to try to find solutions to the middle east problem. His analysis was particularly depressing, but he pointed out that the election result was very difficult for Fatah to cope with, because it believed that it had a natural leadership of the Palestinian Authority. It also proved difficult for anyone in the international community to accept the result of an election that it had encouraged.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/7">The international community's reaction precluded the necessary dialogue to try to form a transition to a secure environment and a peaceful democracy. It encouraged Fatah to claw back powers from the Palestinian Government, and it funded an increase in the presidential forces and their training. That shows us that aid is not necessarily neutral; it certainly was not in Palestine. We must assess whether we made the right decisions, because as Mr. Crooke said, throughout the whole middle east region, tension is building upon tension, fear upon fear, suspicion upon suspicion. If we do not step back and try to relieve the tension, mistrust and fear, we will move towards a potential world catastrophe on a level that we have not seen since the world wars that afflicted the 20th century. That must make us step back.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/8">Yesterday, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> stated, the release of Alan Johnston represented one small step and one small sign of hope. I commend the remarks of our new Foreign Secretary yesterday. They represented a nuanced and balanced approach, and I hope that we can build on that and on the statements by other new members of the Cabinet, such as the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, who, in his former position as Economic Secretary, made last month a very good speech about economic development in Palestine.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/9">The Government and other members of the international community should consider three small steps now. There is the issue of the temporary position, which cannot prevent the social and economic collapse that is happening now. It is by definition temporary. There have been welcome changes involving work with the Ministry of Finance this year. We must consider further that situation and the question of public employees and their salaries, which is vital to the stability of the economy, particularly in the Gaza strip.</p>
	<p pid="a.321.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> mentioned the situation regarding border posts, which is an absolutely key point. We witnessed on the west bank last November the utter madness of so-called back-to-back crossings, whereby people have to unload their lorry and carry their goods by hand or in a small trolley to another lorry across the road. The process was chaotic and actually seemed to be insecure&mdash;at one point, someone was told, &quot;Well, it's just bags of flour. Don't bother opening them, just carry them across anyway.&quot; There was no electronic testing or physical testing of the products. My impression was that the system was designed simply to frustrate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-05a.326.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" speakername="Lynne Featherstone" colnum="326"  time="015:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070705/halltext/70705h0004.htm#07070556000329">
	<p pid="a.326.1/1">No, of course I am not; perhaps I did not explain myself brilliantly. I was saying that because the withdrawal was unilateral and had not been negotiated between the Palestinian authorities and Israel, it offered Hamas the opportunity to claim credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/2">We also need to realise that Hamas is a movement with many voices, and the voices inside the occupied territories often disagree with the leadership in Syria. The Government must not rule out dialogue and discussion with all elements. On the issue of the recognition of Israel, we must note that Hamas had been doing well in the municipal elections in the occupied territories before its victory in the Palestinian legislative elections. Several Palestinian mayors have been Hamas members who have had no choice but to deal with the Israeli authorities, given the state of occupation under which the Palestinians live. I regard that as a hopeful sign: if we can get the process started now, Hamas may one day recognise and work with Israel at the other end of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/3">Let us remember that before the Israeli-Palestine Oslo accords were signed, Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organisation were also classed as terrorist. At that time, various international actors started dialogues with the PLO, which was offered incentives and moderated. Israel herself was talking to the PLO behind closed doors at Oslo, and the declaration of principles was signed. What has happened since has not been perfect for various reasons&mdash;including internal failings on both sides&mdash;but it has been a step in the right direction and has showed that listening, dialogue and exchange are the only way forward and the only way to avoid further radicalisation and marginalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/4">After President Abbas expelled Hamas from Government and set up an emergency Administration, the United States, Israel and the European Union chose to restore direct funding to the Palestinian Authority and its emergency Government. We welcome that resumption of funding. However, we cannot ignore the reality on the ground: there are now two de facto Governments, in Gaza and the west bank. The influence of the emergency Government is of little or no consequence in Gaza; it is therefore essential that aid should be delivered to avert humanitarian catastrophe. The European Union must play its part in that. At this point, I should raise the issue of the Rafah crossing. Whatever the politics, that involves cruel and unusual treatment for those stuck in an impossible situation on the border.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/5">The already difficult economic situation in the occupied territories was made worse by the withdrawal of funding to the Palestinian Authority Government. The international community has a duty to find a way of ending the economic and political marginalisation of the political wing of Hamas. Otherwise, we will simply exacerbate the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/6">The temporary international mechanism was flawed. It was, of course, better than nothing at all, but without the Government apparatus it had little chance of delivering meaningful impact. Given that many essential workers are going unpaid and that the organs of government are being starved of funds, the resulting situation should surprise nobody. Financial aid is essential to the ordinary Palestinians of Gaza, who are most affected by those events but have least say in them. New efforts are needed to persuade the Israelis to release more of the money that they have been holding back for the past year, although we are delighted that some of it is now to be released.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/7">Europe has an immense role to play in the region; arguably, it has never maximised its influence. The European Union is both Palestine's largest aid donor and Israel's largest trading partner. Europe must find a strong common position on Israel-Palestine and use a singular voice to help find a solution to the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/8">The report paints a stark picture of economic growth and private-sector development. The current state of play in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires that the Palestinian people, their basic services and what exists of their institutions, are supported through donor aid. That position is untenable. The Government have to realise that the simple provision of aid, on which the Palestinian population so heavily depends, relates to the lack of a viable economy. Aid can help to bring a resolution to the conflict only if it is channelled into projects that promote economic growth and institution building in the occupied Palestinian territories and is complemented by a serious effort by the international community to bring about a fair and sustainable resolution to the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/9">Such a resolution might not&mdash;perhaps could never&mdash;give each side what it wants, but it could be enough for both sides to have peace and prosperity. Economic growth in the occupied Palestinian territories is essential and could show the benefits of peace. Collective sanctions against all Palestinians just create more desperation, lack of faith in the international community as peace brokers and lack of faith in the future. They also create an atmosphere in which extremists can thrive and prosper by providing basic services such as food aid, hospitals and schools. Nobody else is providing those services, so dependency ties are created.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/10">What I have learned from looking at such situations around the world is that intransigence delivers nothing&mdash;it means that absolutely nothing can change. Recently, I visited the middle east, both Israel and the west bank, and my overriding sense was that it is the ordinary people on both sides who suffer greatly. To respond to an issue raised today, I should say that one thing that surprised me was that although the security blocks on the Palestinian west bank were indeed awful, the Palestinians whom I talked to still put the blame on the Palestinian Authority for deliberately retaining the better passes for those in senior positions. I am concerned that there is still a degree of corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.1/11">I went to a school by the Kalandia refugee camp to visit some 15-year-old girls who were having a workshop that aimed to build their capacity to vocalise their feelings. We are influenced by the media around us, and when I asked them what was the biggest barrier in their lives, I was expecting them to say that it was the corrupt Palestinian Authority or the Israelis who were making their lives a misery. However, they actually said that the biggest barrier was their culture; they were expected to get married and have babies at age 15. That brought home to me that in such territories people are trying to live lives with all sorts of issues to counter. I hope that the international community can take the process forward without intransigence on any side. If we in this Chamber can agree on that, perhaps there is a way forward.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-05a.330.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" speakername="Mark Simmonds" colnum="330"  time="016:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070705/halltext/70705h0004.htm#07070556000334">
	<p pid="a.330.1/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman's points, and argue in return that an issue needs to be addressed. Of course, things need to take place in stages, but it would be difficult for the UK Government to have a direct conversation with an organisation such as Hamas. Other players in the region should be having that dialogue: Syria is one and Iran is possibly another, although it has perhaps been involved in a negative way with what has happened recently in Gaza. The regional players and the Arab quartet need to be involved in far greater detail and to a greater degree than they have been to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/2">We welcome the resumption of the transfer of taxes to the new Palestinian Authority, as well as the unfreezing. I understand that some money was sent on Sunday, that more was sent yesterday and that some will be disseminated through the public sector&mdash;but only in the west bank, not in Gaza. We need to return to that and it would be helpful if the Minister could explain the UK Government's position. It is essential that some money should circulate in the economy, or the people of Palestine will have no chance of generating economic growth and decent reasonable livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/3">It needs to be acknowledged that DFID has made a contribution in Palestine. Since 1996, it has provided &pound;372 million of aid. In 2006-07 alone, DFID allocated &pound;30 million for the Palestinian territories, of which &pound;24 million has been disbursed via the temporary international mechanism, non-governmental organisations and international agencies. DFID has also allocated funds via the global conflict prevention pool for water resource management, policing advisory services and strengthening the capacity of civil society.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/4">Only last month, the then Secretary of State for International Development announced that &pound;1 million would be channelled through the International Committee of the Red Cross for immediate humanitarian need. It would be helpful if the Minister could say whether that money has been allocated and whether it is actually reaching the people for whom it was intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/5">Poverty alleviation, economic growth and foreign direct investment are impossible without the ability to trade. The Palestinian territories are hindered in their ability to trade by restrictions on the movement of people and goods. That point has already been made. Steps must be taken to ensure that at checkpoints there are legitimate, fair and efficient means to enable the swift movement of people and goods, while defending Israel's right to security. The lack of such means is a major reason why Gaza's economy shrank by up to 10 per cent. in 2006 and poverty rates are growing.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/6">The Government's response to the Select Committee report states that they accept that</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/7" class="indent">&quot;shrinking market access and lack of free movement are the main constraints to growth in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/8">DFID funded the investment climate assessment, which concludes that progress must be made in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/9" class="indent">&quot;re-establishing movement and access, while maintaining Israeli security...improving the investment climate; and...developing the capacity of enterprises.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/10">Has any progress been made since that assessment was undertaken, despite the current change of circumstances in Gaza? If not, what change of policy is DFID putting in place to cope with the new Hamas regime?</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/11">The report concludes that the European Union's association agreement in the Palestinian territories is ineffective and hinders the movement of goods in and out of the territories. It states that steps need to be taken to ensure that the procedure at checkpoints is legitimate and efficient. What are the Minister and his officials doing to put pressure on the European Union to ensure the effective operation of the association agreement?</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/12">The report also states that there are discussions with the European Commission about how best to take forward the World Bank's finding that the Rafah trade corridor, referred to earlier, could be used to provide high returns for Palestinian exports. Has any progress been made on greater use of the Rafah trade corridor to negate the suffering that many people are undergoing because of the closure of the limited access through it?</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/13">The Karni crossing used to handle between 200 and 300 trucks a day and is a vital trade route to Gaza. Is DFID still working with the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence to support the US security co-ordinators' work there, for both commercial goods and people? Another fundamental factor in the depression of the Palestinian economy has been the fact that while almost 45,000 Palestinians used to work in Israel every day, for security reasons that figure is now almost zero.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/14">We accept that events have overtaken much of the report, but it would be helpful if the Minister addressed the following points about the current humanitarian situation, UK funding and DFID's strategy on the Palestinian territories. As I have said, Israel has agreed to resume the monthly transfer of taxes to the new, Fatah-led Palestinian Authority. We welcome that step. The Quartet has agreed to lift the economic embargo on direct assistance to the Palestinian Authority. Will the Minister provide more details? Will the direct budgetary support begin immediately? If so, how much of DFID's budget will be given? Will it be in addition to the temporary international mechanism, or will it act as a replacement? How will DFID monitor the money to ensure that it is spent for the purposes for which it was originally intended?</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/15">Currently, the money delivered under the temporary international mechanism is channelled through the office of the President. However, the greatest poverty exists in Gaza, and the whole purpose of the mechanism was to circumvent the Hamas structures of government. How will the funds that are being put into the mechanism be delivered in Gaza if the circumvention of the Hamas political apparatus is to continue? The mandate for the mechanism ends on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-20">20 September</phrase> and has already been extended four times. Does the Minister expect it to be extended again and, if so, for what period?</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/16">There is clearly an immediate necessity to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza in particular. What is the Minister's assessment of the humanitarian situation, and are the funds being sent through various mechanisms, whether the Red Cross or the United Nations, reaching the front line? He will be aware that there was a UN appeal for roughly $450 million. Of the money that was pledged, how much did the UK contribute and how much was delivered by other international donors?</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/17">The initial country assistance plan put together by DFID stated its objectives as</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/18" class="indent">&quot;more effective, accountable and inclusive Palestinian institutions...humanitarian and development assistance delivered more effectively&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/19">and enhanced prospects for peace. I am sure that all hon. Members would agree about that. DFID claims that those objectives have not changed since the election of Hamas in January 2006. Is that still DFID's view, and is it making progress towards those objectives in the changed circumstances, particularly in Gaza?</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/20">The priority for the Palestinian territories and Israel must be security and stability in the middle east. There is a blueprint as to the way forward, which was almost agreed at Taba. Palestine in particular must ensure economic growth and the ability to trade, which will contribute to the alleviation of poverty. Sadly, recent events in Gaza make a two-state solution less likely in the immediate future, more complex and more difficult to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/21">The fact has been highlighted that there is no one person any more who represents the Palestinian people. I urge the Government to provide well targeted, accountable development assistance that is carefully monitored to ensure that it reaches those who most require support and assistance. They should also work with the international community to not just deliver humanitarian assistance but rebuild Palestinian public services and assist in the development of trade, economic growth and security. Those are the combining factors that will ultimately lead to a satisfactory political solution and the significant alleviation of poverty that is much needed in the Palestinian territories.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-05a.338.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1542" speakername="Shahid Malik" colnum="338"  time="016:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070705/halltext/70705h0006.htm#07070556000349">
	<p pid="a.338.2/1">Given that some of the Foreign Secretary's team are here today, I am quite sure that that important message will be conveyed.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/2">The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green was right to talk about the desperation that can push people to extremism, but I must say also that nothing can ever justify violence. I am not suggesting for a second that that is what she was saying, but it is an important statement that we cannot make often enough. It must be our job in part to try to eradicate the hardship that leads to such desperation and vulnerable people engaging in extremism and ultimately violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/3">After the Good Friday agreement, I had the privilege to be appointed by the late Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as a commissioner for the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. Those three years taught me that peace and prosperity go hand in hand, which is why it is correct that we are having this debate at this time, given the new reality that potentially exists in that part of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/4">Last but by no means least, I shall turn to the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness. In my prepared text, I hope that I shall deal with many of his points. His reputation precedes him&mdash;and I do not mean that negatively. I was told to expect machine gun questions, but it was not as bad as I had expected. Maybe he was being kind and gentle because this is my first time speaking for the Government. Everybody in DFID welcomes the Committee's stance on the number of DFID Ministers. Personally, of course, I have much for which to be grateful. With my inclusion, we have doubled the capacity of the ministerial team&mdash;although I am not so sure that we have doubled the intellectual capacity. There is a new political reality, but the truth is that we do not really know what that holds. We know that there is a real opportunity to get things moving in a way in which, over the past year and a half or so, we have been unable to do for a host of reasons. That in itself will generate much discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/5">The hon. Gentleman asked a question about the involvement of Arab states. I think that it would be in everybody's interests to attempt to revive the 2002 Beirut declaration. I know that he and his party support that position. That potentially gives us an opportunity to begin some of that incredibly important work. The International Committee of the Red Cross has a well-established programme in the Gaza strip and the &pound;1 million that has been signalled has already gone to those in the Gaza strip who will benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/6">There is now a significant opportunity to look at budgeting. Since June 2006, in addition to that &pound;1 million, another &pound;15 million of bilateral Government aid has gone in via the TIM to support front-line Palestinian health services, allowances for Government workers and the operation, maintenance and repair of water, sanitation and electricity services. In April, an additional &pound;15.6 million went to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which has helped to provide essential services such as health, education and housing to 4.1 million Palestinian refugees in the west bank, Gaza, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. Some 70 per cent. of the population of the Gaza strip are refugees who will benefit directly from that assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/7">On DFID's objectives, the country assistance plan has not been changed. We are supporting and looking constantly to further peace and humanitarian assistance, but better aid remains critical to poverty reduction for Palestinians. DFID continues to support Lieutenant-General Dayton, the US security co-ordinator, in his efforts to improve movement across the Karni crossing.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/8">Let me belatedly congratulate the International Development Committee on its report. It was an excellent read, or at least the summary of the summary was an excellent read. On a serious note, it was an excellent read. I congratulate it also on securing this really important debate at a crucial time. I welcome its work on this important issue and am pleased to say that the Government agree with many of its conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/9">I would like to take the opportunity to join hon. Members in welcoming the release of Alan Johnston. I extend our best wishes to his family, friends, work colleagues and loved ones. It is welcome news from a part of the world where, sadly, good news is rather scarce. I acknowledge the role played by President Abbas and, indeed, Ismail Haniya and Hamas.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/10">I thank hon. Members for their kind remarks on my new appointment. I shall speak from the heart: by and large, I think that all parliamentarians, and especially members of the International Development Committee, get involved in politics because they want to, and believe that they can, change the world. I am so privileged and utterly humbled to be playing a small role in a Department whose mission is nothing less.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/11">This is a deeply troubling time for the occupied Palestinian territories. The political uncertainty, economic decline and worsening insecurity of the last year culminated in June, in the violent takeover of Gaza by Hamas, which has had serious political and humanitarian consequences. The majority of people want a peaceful two-state solution. I believe that even those who seem less keen on one must realise in their hearts of hearts that it is the only show in town.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/12">I want to make it clear that violence&mdash;especially the violence that we have seen recently&mdash;is completely unacceptable; summary executions, attacks on hospitals, the abuse of captives and so on have no role to play in the occupied Palestinian territories or indeed anywhere else.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/13">Along with my Government colleagues, I want to express my full support for President Abbas and his emergency Government headed by Prime Minister Fayyad. The priority for us now is to help in the best way we can. The former Secretary of State for International Development, who is now my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, spoke to Prime Minister Fayyad to explore how we can do that. We fully support the conclusions of EU Foreign Ministers on the need to develop the conditions necessary for urgent practical and financial assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/14">We must ensure that help reaches the 1.3 million people of Gaza. In that context, the Israeli decision to allow humanitarian access is most welcome. Since <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-15">15 June</phrase>, more than 130 truckloads of basic food and humanitarian supplies have got through. That will help, but for Gazans to start rebuilding their lives, they need more than the very basics. They need to be able to buy fruit and vegetables, fresh milk and baby formula. For Gaza's people to have money in their pockets, the economy needs to function. That means not only importing but exporting goods. We are pressing Israel to ensure full humanitarian access to Gaza and to allow trade as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/15">What about the future? In many ways, the destiny of Hamas is in its own hands. We continue to call on Hamas to adhere to the Quartet principles: committing to non-violence, recognition of the state of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements. Ultimately, all parties must surely realise that sustainable peace can be attained only through dialogue that helps to create a common understanding. Bullets, bombs, killings and mayhem are exactly what ordinary people on all sides wish would cease.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/16">Despite the current crisis in the occupied Palestinian territories, we must not forget the underlying problems that have prevented peace with Israel. Blame for the violence in Gaza lies with those who have chosen to pursue their aims through violence, but as we know too well, the responsibility for bringing a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is spread much more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/17">For Israelis, the consequence of militant Palestinian violence is a life marred by fear. Last year, 23 Israelis were killed by the violence both inside and outside the occupied territories. In the past six years, 3,500 rockets have fallen on the Israeli town of Sderot&mdash;I hope that I pronounced that correctly&mdash;causing 10 deaths. Many people in Israel feel under attack. The threat is reinforced by the failure of Hamas to meet international principles, and its violence in Gaza has merely exacerbated the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/18">In 2006, 661 Palestinians died as a result of Israeli military action. In the same period, the Palestinian economy contracted by about 10 per cent. One of the main causes was Israel's decision not to pass on the VAT and customs revenues that it collects for Palestinians&mdash;about $55 million a month. That starved the Palestinian Authority of more than half their revenue, leaving them unable to pay their workers, on whom one quarter of Palestinians depend for their family's livelihood. Businesses suffered because the Palestinian Authority simply could not pay bills. This week, Israel made its first payment in 15 months, of $120 million, to the emergency Palestinian Government. We call on Israel to release the remaining funds as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/19">Withheld revenue has been the immediate cause of Palestinian economic decline, but the longer-term cause is Israeli security restrictions on movement. The average west bank Palestinian has been unable to visit friends or family in Gaza since 2000. Almost 550 roadblocks and checkpoints in the west bank limit the movement of goods and people from one town to another. That makes trade impossible: the cost of transporting a container from Gaza to the west bank is as much as that of moving it from the west bank to China. That has huge consequences for the economic, cultural and social fabric of Palestinian life.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/20">Israel's security concerns are legitimate and must be addressed, but the presence of almost 500,000 Israeli settlers throughout the occupied west bank, including East Jerusalem, means that the security restrictions affect the whole west bank economy. The barrier winds its way around settlements, placing 10 per cent. of west bank land inside Israel, as has been said. Roads reserved for settlers make transport between cities for Palestinians in the west bank virtually impossible. Many colleagues have had the misfortune to witness that at first-hand; mercifully, we do not have to witness it every day.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.2/21">One challenge for the international community is to show the Palestinian people that we have not forgotten them&mdash;we have not. We are providing support through the EU's temporary international mechanism. Built on initial work by the UK, that has helped 150,000 Palestinian families&mdash;about 1 million people. It has ensured that health and education services have continued and it has provided fuel to ensure that power is provided to medical facilities, water and sewerage plants serving 1.3 million people.</p>

	<p pid="a.342.1/1">I thank the hon. Member for&mdash;his constituency escapes me for a split-second, but only for a split-second, I promise&mdash;Edinburgh, West, of course. It is better to check than to get it wrong. For the record, that comment was not aimed at anybody. The hon. Gentleman is right: the settlements are completely unacceptable. The Government's position is, as I have already stated, for pre-1967 borders. I hope that that gives him some comfort regarding where we are coming from.</p>

	<p pid="a.343.1/1">I am not going into the detail today, but am speaking about the principle. The detail will be negotiated and discussed between the parties who are directly involved. I am making a basic point about our position. We want to see a viable Palestinian state, on the pre-1967 borders, side by side with a secure, safe and confident Israeli state.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> has helped me to move to my next point. Ultimately, only the Israelis and Palestinians can make peace. The Palestinian leadership must work hard to resolve the current situation. It must restore calm, it must open internal dialogue and it must demonstrate that it is capable of providing a competent Administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.1/3">Israel must also play its part. As a first step, it must urgently release the remaining Palestinian revenues and provide adequate access into and out of Gaza. It should then ease movement and access restrictions in the west bank, and take a hard look at its policies on settlements, which are contrary to international law and threaten the viability of an agreed two-state solution. Actions from both Governments are needed. The current crisis might suggest that peace is further away than ever, but they could also choose to see it as an opportunity. For the sake of both ordinary Palestinians and Israelis, it is an opportunity that they must not fail to grasp.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.1/4">I end by sharing an anecdote with the Chamber, which is about being positive. There is a lot of negativity around this subject, for obvious reasons. I was there as part of a delegation back in 1993. You are probably thinking that I was too young to be there, Mr. Bercow, or perhaps you are not, but I was there none the less. It was day seven, and the Oslo peace accord had just been announced. When one is there when something like that is happening, one thinks, &quot;Is this really happening? Is it momentous, is it big, is it small?&quot; At the time we relied on the seven o'clock news or the nine o'clock news to tell us what was going on in the world, or I certainly did, so when one is there and something like that happens, one thinks that it is too much of a coincidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.1/5">It was day seven. We had visited a number of Israeli organisations in Jerusalem and elsewhere, and we were in the Gaza strip in the unofficial headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. At the time, Arafat et al. were in Tunis and the delegates were in New York. We were with the PLO official who was the most senior in Gaza at the time, unofficially, when a camera crew came bursting in and a journalist thrust a mike in his face and said, &quot;This peace&mdash;people are saying that it's nothing and that the PLO have sold out. What do you say to that charge?&quot; The PLO leader composed himself and said, &quot;You are right; it is nothing, but the Palestinian people have never even been offered nothing before. We are going to take this nothing and we are going to build something with it.&quot; If they can be as positive now as they were then, and God knows they need to be, we can make some progress. The tunnel is long and dark, but if we intend to get through it, we need to focus on the light at the other end.</p>
