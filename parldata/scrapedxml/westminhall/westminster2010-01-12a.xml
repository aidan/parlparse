	<p pid="a.167.2/1">Good morning, Mrs. Humble. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue and I hope that my voice will last long enough for me to place my concerns on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/2">Simon Morgan e-mailed me just before Christmas. He told me that his father had died on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-12">12 December 2009</phrase>. Chris Morgan and his wife had lived in Alicante in Spain and were endeavouring to secure the payment of exportable benefits. Let me quote from an article written by Chris Morgan for the <i>Costa Blanca News</i> in May 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/3" class="indent">&quot;In the past, the Department of Work and Pensions...decided that anyone who was receiving a disability living allowance, carer's allowance or attendance allowance and moved to another EU country would not receive this allowance. In 2005, a 'test' case was put before the European Court of Justice...in an attempt to&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/4">secure these benefit payments for</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/5" class="indent">&quot;non-UK residents. On the 18th October 2007, the ECJ ruled against the UK but for the next 18 months the DWP procrastinated,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/6">saying</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/7" class="indent">&quot;'We are considering the legal implications of a decision by the European Court of Justice and will inform you of the outcome when the result is known.' In March this year&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/8">that is, 2009-</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/9" class="indent">&quot;we were informed by the DWP...that they were now able to look at our case. The letter went on to say, 'The ECJ have decided that certain UK disability benefits are to be considered sickness benefits. This means that they will be paid to some people who leave the UK to live in another EEA state or Switzerland.' The letter-</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/10">to Chris Morgan-</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/11" class="indent">&quot;then states, 'The decision affects Disability Living Allowance (care component only), Attendance Allowance and Carer's Allowance. These benefits can now be paid'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/12">if you satisfy</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/13" class="indent">&quot;'certain eligibility conditions'...from a letter we received at the end of April...it would appear that the DWP have shut the door on ALL those, like us, who are already living abroad because this latest letter states, 'As you had not been present...in Great Britain for 26 weeks out of the previous 52 on the day you asked us to look at the decision again, you cannot get Attendance Allowance'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/14">The late Chris Morgan, eight months ago, summed up the Government's shameful position precisely and they have been wriggling on the hook ever since.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/15">The UK/EU Disability &amp; Carers Group, based in Northern France, wrote to the Prime Minister recently, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/16" class="indent">&quot;While you are busy deciding when you are going to comply with the European Court of Justice ruling...we...have received...the following message from the wife of one our members who resides in Spain, having gone there on doctor's&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/17">orders</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/18" class="indent">&quot;with the hope that it would prolong his life-as it did.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/19">The letter says:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/20" class="indent">&quot;I am writing on behalf of my husband.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/21" class="indent">They do not think he will last until next week. We are just waiting for the Army to fly in my two sons tomorrow and then they will increase the morphine and he will not be lucid. They say he is fading fast.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/22" class="indent">The first thing he said this morning was, 'The DWP has won. I am going to die before they cough up...' The rest is unprintable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/23">My first question to the Minister is how many more UK citizens now living within the EU or in Switzerland will have to die without receiving the benefits to which they are entitled, while this Government remain in breach of the law?</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/24">The Minister is aware that this is not the first occasion on which I have raised this issue in debate. He is aware that I have tabled parliamentary questions to his Department and have challenged the Prime Minister orally on the subject at Prime Minister's Question Time.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/25">The Minister may find that he has a personal interest in this matter. Another claimant has written from his home in France to Revenue and Customs, declining to pay his tax. That claimant says:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/26" class="indent">&quot;For over six years I have been denied the Disability Living Allowance to which I am entitled under judgement of the European Court of Justice. I am very disabled and losing my sight, yet the DWP continues to squabble with the European Commission, which is now taking&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/27">Her Majesty's Government</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/28" class="indent">&quot;to court for failure to pay British citizens living in the EU the sickness benefits to which they are entitled under Community law. This sickness benefit would be tax-free, and exceeds the amount of my private pension, which you tax-like rubbing salt into an open wound.&quot;</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.168.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" speakername="Peter Atkinson" colnum="168"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0001.htm#10011238000504">
	<p pid="a.168.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate and on the work he has done over a considerable length of time in sticking up for the unfortunate British citizens who have been so shamefully and dishonourably treated by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/2">Several of my constituents reside in Spain on doctor's orders-my hon. Friend mentioned that earlier-because living in a warmer climate helps their disability. Recently, with the collapse of the pound against the euro, their financial situation has become much more urgent and that has added to the trouble faced by my constituents, my hon. Friend's constituents and those of all other Members.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.168.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" speakername="Roger Gale" colnum="168"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0001.htm#10011238000505">
	<p pid="a.168.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his kind comments and his support: he, in common with a number of Members on both sides of the House, is seeking justice for that group of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/2">As I said in the summer Adjournment debate-I will put it on the record again because it is relevant-setting aside the matter of law, which we will come to in a moment, there is an impression abroad that the people we are talking about are rich, have gone to the sun, saying, &quot;The hell with the United Kingdom&quot;, and live in splendid retirement with big yachts and lots of drink, and that they do not need any benefits. My hon. Friend has made the point that a huge number of those people have gone south for the benefit of their health, because they have respiratory or other conditions, and are eking out an existence. The other important point, to which I will return, is that they have been UK citizens and taxpayers, and many still are.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/3">The chap I mentioned a moment ago who wrote to Revenue and Customs lived-his family and all their friends still live-in the parliamentary constituency of Chatham and Aylesford. Some 50 Members of Parliament from all parties have a constituency interest in this subject, and I hope and believe that more of them will join us later this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/4">Many of the claimants have appealed against the DWP ruling. That is why they have sought the support of their UK Members of Parliament. I believe that the appeal process has been deliberately spun out by the Department. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-03">3 December 2009</phrase>, my constituent, John Hamilton, noted that the Directgov website had been revised to read:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/5" class="indent">&quot;The Department for Work and Pensions...has selected a small number of these appeals...(known as lead cases). These have been sent for tribunal hearings. The DWP has requested that similar cases are suspended until the tribunal has made a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/6" class="indent">It is expected that the tribunal will not hear these cases until January 2010 at the earliest.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/7">That is despite the fact that on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-20">20 November 2009</phrase>, tribunal Judge Jeremy Bennett ruled:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The Tribunal Service at Sutton shall establish the availability of the parties and their representatives before listing, subject to the proviso that the hearing must take place in January 2010 unless directed otherwise by a Judge hearing this case.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/9">That was translated by Daniel Vickery, Social Security and Child Support Appeals tribunals team leader at Sutton into the following request:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/10" class="indent">&quot;Could you please provide me with your availability for January and February.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/11">My constituent, John Hamilton, has now been told to look at dates at the beginning of March, so Judge Bennett's ruling is effectively being pushed into the long grass.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/12">In the meantime, what of the grounds for the Government's continued defiance of the ECJ ruling-the so-called past presence test, requiring a claimant to have lived in the United Kingdom for 26 of the previous 52 weeks to be eligible to claim? In response to one of my earlier parliamentary questions back in June, the Minister asserted:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/13" class="indent">&quot;The Department is already complying with the European Court of Justice ruling on the payment of exportable disability benefits.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-06-22.680"><i>Official Report</i>, 22 June 2009; Vol. 494, c. 680W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/14">We now know that statement to have been ill-advised.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/15">The European Commission website states:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The European Commission has decided to take legal action against the United Kingdom for not paying certain benefits&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/17">exportable DLA, attendance allowance and carer's allowance-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/18" class="indent">&quot;to EU citizens residing abroad.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/19">Abroad in this case means within the European Union or Switzerland. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-09">9 October</phrase>, the Commission addressed a letter of formal notice to the UK authorities. The British Government had two months to respond. That is the first stage of what is called the infringement procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/20">The British Government did reply within two months-just. However, in response to my question asking for sight of that response, the Minister for Pensions and the Ageing Society said:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/21" class="indent">&quot;Correspondence between the European Commission and the member states...on such cases is generally regarded...as confidential&quot;.-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-12-08.249"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 December 2009; Vol. 502, c. 249W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/22">I should like to know why. The infringement proceedings are in the public domain; why is the Government's response not in the public domain?</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/23">The clue might be found in the tardy answer, sent on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-17">17 December</phrase>, from the Prime Minister in response to my oral question to him on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-11">11 November</phrase>. It took the man in No. 10 more than a month to be able to tell me:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/24" class="indent">&quot;We have carefully considered the application of the 26 out of 52 weeks 'past presence' requirement and believe it to be compatible with European Community law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/25">So I guess that is what we said in reply to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/26">Perhaps it is a pity that instead of relying on his hapless junior Minister for advice, the Prime Minister did not read the Commission website for himself. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/27" class="indent">&quot;British authorities require the claimant to have spent 26 of the previous 52 weeks in the UK...This requirement goes against the European rules coordinating social security benefits and justifies the Commission's decision to start an infringement procedure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/28">Nothing could be clearer. The Government of the United Kingdom are coldly and deliberately acting outside European law. That fact is confirmed by Jackie Morin, a member of the Commission's staff, in a letter to my constituent John Hamilton dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-03">3 December 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/29">Quite simply, the Government are in breach of the law and they are disingenuously using weasel words and artifice to try to deny to sick, elderly UK citizens who have served this country-many of them in the armed forces-and who have paid their dues throughout their working lives the money owing to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/30">The situation gets worse. Overnight, I received an e-mail on the matter. Unfortunately, I have not been able to go back to the person who sent it to me to secure consent to name them, so I shall have to hand it to <i>Hansard</i> on the understanding that for the moment their anonymity is protected. The e-mail states:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/31" class="indent">&quot;In June last year (2009) I received a letter from the DWP Debt Collection for what they describe as an overpayment of &#163;3,800 for Carers Allowance...I explained...that I had not left the UK permanently in August 2004&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/32">the date to which the attempted reclaim related-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/33" class="indent">&quot;had sold our property then, rented afterwards, and the pensions department were informed of change of address, and&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/34">that I</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/35" class="indent">&quot;had taken permanent residence in France at the beginning of March 2006. The lady I spoke to said she would call me back the following week, but did not...I received no phone call. I have received no correspondence until today.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/36">That was <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-11">11 January</phrase>. The e-mail continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/37" class="indent">&quot;My allowance was stopped at that time&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/38">March 2006-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/39" class="indent">&quot;and my husband, who is 72 years old and had suffered a massive heart attack (leaving his heart working at 70 per cent.), has diabetes, diverticular disease, asthma, arthritis and...mobility problems as a result...was awarded Attendance Allowance for life in 2003. I had to leave my full time job to become a &#163;50 a week full time carer. Today I received a letter stating if I do not repay this amount&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/40">&#163;3,800-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/41" class="indent">&quot;by the 19th of this month legal action will commence...we do not have any money, the house we live in belongs to our daughter&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/42">and we</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/43" class="indent">&quot;have no savings. We receive &#163;160 per week which includes an allowance for me as a 'wife', and our daughter and son in law help us out financially. We do not even own a car. There is no way we can afford to repay...money, which I believe I do not owe anyway...as we are waiting for reinstatement of our benefits, which we have pursued since August 2006&quot;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.171.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" speakername="Peter Atkinson" colnum="171"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0001.htm#10011238000506">
	<p pid="a.171.0/1">In the case of my constituent, who comes from Northumberland and moved to Spain a long time ago, when the move took place, he was told that disability living allowance would have to stop and he accepted that as one of the penalties of moving abroad. Then, when he discovered the result of the European judgment and reapplied for the allowance, he was told that he was out of court because of the past presence test; he had not lived in the UK for 26 weeks out of 52. This is a classic Catch-22 situation. He thought he had been deprived of disability living allowance, only to be told that if he was entitled to it, he could not have it because he did not pass the test as he had already moved from the United Kingdom.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.171.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" speakername="Roger Gale" colnum="171"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0001.htm#10011238000507">
	<p pid="a.171.1/1">I fear that the situation my hon. Friend describes applies in many cases and I shall come in a moment to what I believe may prove to be the Government's fall-back position, because I can see another area of wriggle room developing if we are not careful.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.1/2">I believe that the Minister is not only an honourable but a decent man. I know him very well as a Kent Member of Parliament, and outside the Chamber as a friend. I also know that Ministers have to do the bidding of their civil servants, the Secretary of State and the Cabinet, and I know that the Cabinet is in turn leant on by the Treasury, which is seeking to save, for blindingly obvious reasons, every penny that is available. However, I hope that the Minister will believe that it is quite wrong of his Department to send out threatening letters to elderly and infirm people, seeking to claw back money that they do not owe; not only that, they are owed money by the United Kingdom Government.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.171.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" speakername="John Randall" colnum="171"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0001.htm#10011238000508">
	<p pid="a.171.2/1">I, too, pay tribute to my hon. Friend's doughty crusade on this matter. Has he any idea of the number of people involved and the sums involved?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.171.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" speakername="Roger Gale" colnum="171"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0001.htm#10011238000509">
	<p pid="a.171.3/1">Information is very hard to come by. The Minister may be able to shed more light; he has access to figures that I do not have. I know roughly the number of appeals that have been lodged. We are probably looking in total at between 2,000 and 3,000 cases across the whole European Union and Switzerland. The majority are in France and Spain or Majorca, and there are some in Greece and one or two others dotted around the European Union, but not many. With regard to the sums involved, the Minister is on record, I think, as saying that this situation could lead to a sum rising to &#163;50 million annually. I am not quite sure what the justification for that figure is, so I hope that the Minister will have time to explain to my hon. Friend, the expatriate community and me how those figures are arrived at.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.3/2">However, that is not really the point, is it? The point is that there is a legal requirement on the Government to pay the money. The point is that we are not dealing with people who have come from overseas to the United Kingdom and claim every benefit known to man, or the kind of people who are reported on the front page of the <i>Daily Express </i>today as using the United Kingdom as a social benefits milch cow by obtaining a national insurance number for future benefit use. We are not talking about people like that. We are talking about people who have devoted their entire working lives to the United Kingdom, who have paid their taxes, paid their dues, done everything right, served in the armed forces, given their lives to this country-for this country in some cases-and in retirement have chosen to live somewhere warmer and slightly more comfortable to end their days.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.3/3">Those are the people we are talking about. Those are the people we are damaging. They are not ciphers or numbers-2,000 or 3,000. I do not care if there is only one of them; they deserve what the law says they are entitled to, and that is what the Government-our Government, my Government, the United Kingdom Government-are denying. I am ashamed of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.3/4">I want to hear from the shadow Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase>, that a Conservative Government will honour their legal undertaking, and ensure that those people receive the money that is due to them or sadly, in some cases, to their estates. It is open to the Minister, even now, to recognise that the Government have acted shamefully and that they are wrong, and to agree this morning that his Department will pay all the money due to those who have had benefits terminated when leaving the UK, and have subsequently submitted fresh claims from the EU country of their current residence.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.3/5">I want to clarify one further issue. For the avoidance of doubt or misunderstanding, and to satisfy the claimants and the European Commission, any such payment, which I believe will have to be made, will have to be backdated to the date of termination or of first claim. The Government can either choose to do that honourably and graciously now, or wait for the European Commission's infringement proceedings to take their course, be taken back to the European Court of Justice-during which time more claimants will die-be ruled against, and then fined and forced to pay. I hope that the Government choose to settle.</p>
	<p pid="a.171.3/6">I said earlier that I could see wriggle room appearing if we did not nail the matter down now, and I shall not settle for back payment to the date of the most recent claim. Those payments should not have been terminated when people left the United Kingdom; they were lawful then. To be fair, the Government did not know that they were lawful then and nor did we, which is why so many people did not appeal at the time. We now know, however, that they were lawful; that is what the European Court of Justice said in its ruling. Any payments made will, therefore, have to be backdated to the date of termination or of first claim. The Government have been caught breaking the law, and they have to pay the bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.0/1">I commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> on his passionate speech, in which he described many detailed and moving cases. I also congratulate him on his long track record on this matter, and on everything he has said today. He has done more than anyone to highlight what is an all too familiar tale of a Department that is willing to use every trick in the book to avoid meeting its legal and moral obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/2">The hon. Gentleman has done an excellent job in framing the issue today, and I do not wish to go over ground that he has already covered. However, it is worth re-emphasising what we are not dealing with here. As he said, this is not a tabloid-friendly tale of people from other European countries arriving in the UK and claiming benefits, as has been reported in some quarters. The men and women affected are from here and have paid their taxes here, but are having their entitlement denied to them when they need it most. As has been said, they are not wealthy people. This cannot be spun as part of a wider Government crackdown on wealthy non-doms; the 2,000 to 3,000 or so people who are affected are generally elderly and manifestly in poor health with advancing disability. They have paid their taxes and national insurance contributions and have earned the right for help with their disabilities. Many of them have moved abroad not out of choice but on medical advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/3">The reason to move to some place with warmer weather at this time of year should be self-evident-it is tempting for the younger and the able-bodied, let alone for those who have worked all their lives, such as an older couple I know who lived in Scotland. The man had worked for the Ministry of Defence until he retired at 65. When he retired he was living in MOD housing, and he and his wife decided to look around for warmer weather and a reasonably economical place to live; they decided to head for Spain. He had paid his dues all his life and had never asked for a penny, and for the Government now to put so much effort into avoiding their responsibilities to them in this way is shameful. The Government are avoiding those responsibilities, but the job of Government is to provide fair and decent treatment, particularly to the vulnerable and the disabled.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/4">When I was a local councillor, I had experience of a local authority trying to deny individuals fair treatment. When elderly people fell in the streets, the first response they would get would be from loss adjusters who would try to put them off and imply that it was their fault. Most people gave up and went away. We have a Government with a track record of denying for years a fair deal to investors in Equitable Life, despite the ruling of the ombudsman. Today we are dealing with benefits paid for by those who have worked all their lives-many of them never taking a penny. Many of them are ill and some are disabled, and they have gone to live abroad, many for health reasons. They are being denied not something that can be argued about, but an entitlement. The question has been taken up at European Court level. This is an entitlement, not something that is up for debate. The Court has decided: the Government were found guilty, and in the run-up to the election the Minister has a lot of explaining to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/5">The European Court of Justice ruling on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October 2007</phrase> was very clear. It said that those eligible and in receipt of the care component of DLA, attendance allowance and carer's allowance should be able to continue to receive those benefits when they leave the UK. That was because they were classed as &quot;sickness cash benefits&quot; under EU law. That ought to have been the final word on the issue, and the Government should have accepted the ruling and paid out the benefits. Instead, it seems that the ruling itself has been warped by the Department to create yet another loophole.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/6">We are now in the farcical position whereby claimants cannot have their benefits reinstated if they had them removed before the European Court of Justice ruling, because the Government will not admit that their decision to remove benefits before then was wrong. The ruling by the European Court was that people should be entitled to receive those benefits. People who had their benefits removed by the Government before the date of the ruling should have them reinstated immediately, with backdating and a full apology. Instead, they are told that unless they appealed within 13 months of losing their benefit, they have no grounds for their benefit to be reinstated. Essentially, if they took the Department for Work and Pensions at its word and made the mistake of assuming that the Government would act within EU law, they would miss out. Not only that, but when someone writes to the Government to request that their benefit be reinstated they have to meet the eligibility criteria of having been resident in the UK for at least 26 weeks out of the past 52. The very fact that their benefits were removed, means that they are already living abroad, so there is little prospect of meeting that criteria at any time.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/7">If I have misunderstood the situation, I invite the Minister to clarify it, but it seems as if every possible effort has been made to construct artificial loopholes and roll after roll of red tape to keep vulnerable people from receiving the help to which they are entitled. I agree with the hon. Member for North Thanet that the Minister is a decent individual, but he is trying to defend the indefensible. It seems that Ministers have been making up the rules as they go along, and that is quite deplorable behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/8">In the Minister's winding-up speech, we need to hear that this shameful saga will not be allowed to drag on into the next Parliament, although I doubt he will have much say in that matter. It is an embarrassment that the European Commission has seen no other option but to take the UK Government to court to try to force us to meet our obligations. I appeal to the Minister to save the time, expense and embarrassment of battling another court case, and to instead announce today that the benefits will be reinstated without further argument or details hidden in the small print. I would also like a firm answer on how many people stand to be affected, and how much this will cost the Government-how much money the Government have withheld from them so far. I would not be at all surprised if the money spent fighting a legal battle in the European Court of Justice, and now fighting the Commission, was not too different a sum from that being held back from UK citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/9">Will the Minister also publish a copy of the Government's response to the Commission's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-09">9 October 2009</phrase>, giving formal notice of legal proceedings? The Government have refused to make the letter public, citing confidentiality. Frankly, it is not a matter of national security. Those people-possibly thousands-missing money that is rightfully theirs deserve to know whether the Government are still attempting to wriggle out of their obligations. The Government have so often professed to be interested in fairness; it ought to be a matter of shame for Labour Members here today that the matter has still not been resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/10">People on low incomes who depend on such benefits to make ends meet do not have time for endless pontification from the DWP. As we heard this morning, some who have fought the battle have lost not only the battle but, in the meantime, their lives. I hope that today's debate will have pressed home to the Minister how far there is to go before fairness is delivered to those people. I cannot help but feel that if the time and energy spent by civil servants and the Government in devising ways to avoid their obligations had been invested in finding a fair solution, we would not be debating the issue today. I hope that this is the last time that we do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble. I know that you take a great interest in matters relating to the Department for Work and Pensions, given the nature of your constituency. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">the Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase>, who has been a long-standing campaigner on this subject. He demonstrated his usual doughty fighting spirit on behalf of all who depend on Members of the House to speak for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/2">I shall mention, as did my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet, the UK/EU Disability and Carers Group, a group of those affected by this problem. I mention it for the Minister's benefit. It e-mailed me late last year, saying that no member of the group at the time-more than 100 people-had received the legal reinstatement of their disability living allowance or even had the opportunity to have their case heard by the Tribunals Service. That brings me to a point made by my hon. Friend. Even once the law was established, it seems that the Government did not move with appropriate speed. I shall say a little more about that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/3">It is worth setting out a little of the background-I shall try not to repeat what was said by my hon. Friend-and saying something about the benefits. I shall also ask the Minister about the thinking behind the Government's stance. The three benefits are the care component of the disability living allowance-the mobility component is not included in the European Court of Justice ruling of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October 2007</phrase>-the attendance allowance and the carer's allowance. The Court decided that those benefits should be removed from the list of non-exportable special non-contributory cash benefits, but should be classed instead as sickness benefits and therefore paid, as my hon. Friend said, to those who live elsewhere in the European economic area or Switzerland.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/4">I shall give the House an idea of the scale involved. Slightly more than 3 million people in the United Kingdom receive the care component of DLA, less than 1.6 million receive attendance allowance, and about 500,000 people receive carer's allowance. I mention that because I shall be asking the Minister to give us an idea of the number affected by the ruling and the Department's estimate of how many might be affected in future. I shall give an example: in 2008-09, about &#163;4.7 billion was spent on attendance allowance for the 1.6 million who received it; it is a significant sum.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/5">To put matters into context, it would be interesting to hear from the Minister how much is involved in the present case. My hon. Friend said that a parliamentary answer gave an estimate of &#163;50 million. That is a large sum, but it pales into insignificance when put next to the total amount of benefits paid. I shall have some specific questions on that aspect for the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/6">It is worth spending a brief moment to consider the chronology of this case, as it is one reason why those overseas who are affected are so agitated. They may think that things are clear after the ECJ ruling, but they believe that the Government have moved at a slow pace. My hon. Friend set that out well. However, the Government have not only moved a slow pace but have looked for every opportunity to delay making a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/7">The ECJ judgment was delivered on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October 2007</phrase>. The Government responded reasonably quickly with a written statement to Parliament, saying that they would carefully consider the implications of that judgment. Within a week, one could not expect them to say anything else. In December, two months later, we heard only that the disability and carers service was &quot;preparing guidance&quot;, and would give full details of eligibility criteria in April. Not an awful lot had happened, especially given what we had been told publicly, in two months.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/8">At the beginning of April 2008, five months after the ECJ judgment, Parliament received a third written statement. Again, we were told that details would be set out on the website, and that officials were continuing their discussions with the European Commission. We still had to wait. Even five months after the decision, the Government were still not able to set out the eligibility criteria, either for those who had been claiming the benefits before moving abroad or those who lived abroad and were claiming for the first time. Later that month, the criteria were eventually published.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/9">In December 2008, more than a year after the ECJ judgment, the Government admitted that they had received 1,700 requests for payment of DLA, attendance allowance or carer's allowance from people who had previously lived in the UK. That information was gained in response to a question from my hon. Friend, who has been questioning the Government on the matter for some time. In January 2009, my hon. Friend followed up that question, asking the Minister how many of those 1,700 had been settled. He was told that the implications were still being considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/10">Later that month, again in response to a written question, the Minister said that the Government had set out their estimate of the increased case load and expenditure due to the ECJ ruling. He said that in 2010-11 they expected that the case load would reach 20,000 people at an annual cost of &#163;50 million. That was assumed to be the first full year following full implementation of the judgment. That estimate is broken down into &#163;30 million for DLA, &#163;10 million for attendance allowance and &#163;10 million for carer's allowance. I am not clear, however, whether that is for those who were claiming benefits before leaving the UK or whether it includes those living abroad who were claiming for the first time. That estimate gives no indication of whether the Government expect those numbers to change.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the matter would be helped along if the DWP were to speak to the Department of Health on the matter? Considering the cost of claims to be a matter exclusively for the DWP would be to look at only part of the picture. Many who go abroad are not using GPs or health workers; they are not using NHS services, which has an impact on the Government's budgeting. The cost of claims may be a matter for the DWP, but the costs to the NHS would dwarf that figure.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I am dwelling on the cost because it is our view that once the law is clear, the Government should move quickly to implement it. The Minister will doubtless be able to make clear the reason for the use of the past presence rule to limit the number claiming for the first time from abroad. I presume it is because an estimate has been made of the potential number, and that that number is significant. I am simply trying to get a handle on what that might be.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.177.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" speakername="Roger Gale" colnum="177"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0002.htm#10011238000514">
	<p pid="a.177.0/1">My hon. Friend cites a figure of 20,000 claims. It is the first time that I have heard that figure. It is a phenomenal increase on the 3,000 that we believe are in the system now. Where on earth are these figures coming from? We ought to know that, too.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.177.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="177"  time="010:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0002.htm#10011238000515">
	<p pid="a.177.1/1">The straightforward answer from my point of view is that they come from a written answer; the Minister can tell us where the numbers come from. It is difficult to reach a total. The estimated case load for disability living allowance is 20,000, but in an excellent piece of Government speak, no numbers are given for attendance allowance and carer's allowance because they equal</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/2" class="indent">&quot;less than 5,000 and therefore&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/3">equal</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/4" class="indent">&quot;zero when rounded to the nearest 10,000&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-01-28.563"><i>Official Report</i>, 28 January 2009; Vol. 487, c. 563W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/5">Only someone in government could, on seeing that 5,000 people were entitled to something, round the figure down to zero, but that is what we are told has happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/6">To put the figures in context, the &#163;50 million estimated expenditure is about 0.1 per cent. of the total spent on such benefits, while the number of people affected is about 0.4 per cent. of the number on such benefits. Those numbers do not seem that dramatic or significant, given the Department's estimates for the growth of disability living allowance, attendance allowance and carer's allowance over time. I do not understand why the Government are working so hard to limit the number of claims, and I would be grateful if the Minister filled us in on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/7">At the end of February 2009, a month after the Minister answered that question, we had the fourth written statement to Parliament. That was 10 months after the previous one and one year and four months after the original judgment. On a Government website, Ministers finally published details of the eligibility criteria for those who were not claiming disability benefits when they left the UK, but who wished to claim them when they moved abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/8">In a parliamentary written answer, the Government stated that the past presence test had been modified for those claiming from another EEA state so that they had to have been in Great Britain for not less than 26 of the previous 52 weeks. The Government also said that the test would be applied only once, on the date on which the entitlement to benefit was established. In other words, someone who claimed more than six months after having moved abroad would not be eligible for benefits. It would be helpful if the Minister told us how many people living abroad would be eligible for such benefits if the past presence test was not in place and what estimates the Department has made of the number who will be eligible over time. The Department must have done some thinking about that when deciding on its implementation of the ECJ ruling.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/9">In June last year-these things move very slowly-the Government said that they had had 2,100 requests for payment or reinstatement of awards from people living in EEA states. At that point, decisions had been made on 1,100 requests, with 1,000 pending a decision. For the benefit of hon. Members, will the Minister give us the latest information on how many requests for payment of benefits have been received and how many have been processed and had a decision made on them? Of those on which a decision has been made, how many have resulted in a benefit being awarded? In other words, how many requests for benefit have been successful?</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/10">There is another disappointing aspect to the lack of dispatch in the Department's approach. In June last year, the Government said that 1,400 people who lived abroad were in receipt of benefits, but that the DWP had only &quot;started to process&quot; claims for DLA from other states following the statement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-24">24 February</phrase>. It therefore took a year and four months after the ECJ ruling for the DWP to start processing claims. Given that we are talking largely about disabled and elderly claimants living abroad, such a period can be significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/11">The issue has obviously attracted great interest. There has been an e-petition on the No. 10 website, the media have given the subject a lot of coverage, and colleagues such as my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet have raised the issue in Parliament. As he said, the Prime Minister wrote to him saying that the 26 out of 52 weeks past presence rule was</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/12" class="indent">&quot;compatible with European Community law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/13">I have been through the ECJ judgment carefully-it is not riveting reading-and it would be helpful if the Minister set out why the Department thinks that the past presence test is compatible with the ruling, given that the European Commission does not think so and has indicated to the Department that it intends to introduce infringement proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/14">On the issue of openness and transparency, I can understand why the Minister does not want to share specific correspondence, but given the information that has not been provided to the House-my hon. Friend drew attention to it-it is disappointing to see what is available on the European Commission website. There, the Commission clearly sets out that it is taking legal action against the UK for not paying benefits and that it</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/15" class="indent">&quot;addressed a Letter of Formal Notice to the UK authorities. The British authorities have two months to respond&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/16">as my hon. Friend said. Again, the Department took the full two months, so it did not exactly act with all due speed. The Commission then sets out the benefits and the ECJ ruling. It also says that the past presence test</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/17" class="indent">&quot;goes against the European rules coordinating social security benefits and justifies the Commission's decision to start an infringement procedure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/18">We can get all that information from the Commission website, but when we ask Ministers to set out the discussions that they have had and the position that they have taken, we get rather less information. This is not something that I thought that I would say, or that we hear often in the House, but the European Commission is being more open and transparent than the British Government, and the Minister should rectify that.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/19">I have asked the Minister to set out the number of claimants abroad. Just to be clear, will he tell us what estimate the Government have made of the predicted case load and expenditure for existing claimants who move abroad, claimants who already live abroad and both sets of claimants combined? The Minister has talked about 2010-11, which is assumed to be the first full year for implementation of the ruling, but what does full implementation actually mean and why has it taken two years to reach this stage?</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/20">It is worth making one final point, which my hon. Friend and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase>, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, have touched on. One reason why the issue has attracted attention and annoyed some of those living abroad is that the same European Union rules that say that British citizens who lived here all their lives, paid taxes, contributed, worked and then moved abroad should get the benefits under discussion, also say that people who come here from other European countries are entitled to other benefits. We read all the time in the papers-the stories are not made up, but are backed by parliamentary answers-about people who have come to the UK from other European countries and have not worked here or paid taxes, but who, under EU rules, can claim benefits for themselves and their children. People find that extraordinary. We hear stories about Polish workers coming to the UK who can claim child benefit for their children, when their children do not even live here, but in Poland.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/21">The Government never seem to look for clever loopholes to avoid paying such people, who never seem to have any trouble claiming benefits. I do not suggest that they should not get those benefits-under EU rules, these things work in both directions-but it is strange that the Government have looked for every opportunity to deny money to those who have worked here, paid their taxes and gone abroad. Ministers never seem to make similar efforts with those who come to this country, and I am not saying that they should, but there is a disparity. People who come to this country never seem to have any trouble claiming money when they have not contributed. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> It is all very well the Minister sighing, but that sort of thing enables people who are against our membership of the EU to score an easy hit. It also enables those who represent, shall we say, somewhat less democratic parties in this country to stir up all sorts of feeling against those who come here from other European countries. As everyone who has spoken has made clear, people are looking for fairness-they want people to be treated fairly.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/22">Once the law is established following the ECJ ruling, it will be incumbent on the Government to implement it as soon as possible so that those who are lawfully entitled to benefits receive their lawful entitlement. On the basis of what I have said and what my hon. Friend so ably said in opening the debate, it is clear that the Government have not moved with due speed. At each stage, they appear to have taken the maximum time available to them and tested every deadline. That is not how the Government should behave, particularly when many of the British citizens involved are elderly and disabled, and when every month really matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/23">In his response, I hope that the Minister will answer the questions raised by my hon. Friend and other hon. Members who have spoken in this debate, and that he will move to resolve the issues surrounding the past presence test and its lawfulness, or otherwise, and implement the settled law with all possible speed.</p>

Member for North Thanet expresses his views in a forthright way, and I appreciate the manner in which he has presented his case, not only during this debate but during our meetings in the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/3">The starting point is the judgment by the European Court of Justice in October 2007, and I want to explain what that meant. In case C-299/05, the Court decided that certain benefits belonging to Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom should not be classified as special non-contributory benefits under European law, but should instead be classified as sickness benefits. That change in classification for the UK mainly affected disability benefits-the disability living allowance care component, attendance allowance and carer's allowance, which have been referred to.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/4">The relevant legislation is EC regulation 1408/71, which co-ordinates social security systems in the European Economic Area, and provides rights for workers and people who used to work and, in certain circumstances, their family members. Not all people who are eligible to receive benefits in the UK can export them if they leave the country. For instance, someone who resides in the UK can claim DLA without having a national insurance contribution record. When they leave the country, however, the UK is no longer responsible for paying them and they are not covered by the regulation. Each member state is free to decide who is entitled to be insured under its legislation, which benefits are to be granted and under what conditions, and how those benefits are calculated. Any such decisions are, of course, subject to challenge from individuals or the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/5">When people are covered by the regulation and wish to export their benefit, they are no longer required to meet normal residence and presence conditions although they are still required to meet other conditions of entitlement under domestic legislation. In the UK, that includes a past presence test, whereby an individual is required to have been present in the UK for 26 of the previous 52 weeks, on each day of the award of benefit. For people wishing to export their benefit we have modified that condition so that it is applied only on a single date, on which other conditions of entitlement can be established.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/6">The unmodified test is not new-it has always been part of the conditions of entitlement that all customers are required to meet. Unlike the state pension, for example, disability benefits are not paid because relevant national insurance contributions have been made. They are not means-tested and are paid out of general UK taxation. The purpose of the past presence test is to establish a connection with the UK that is appropriate and proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/7">The hon. Member for North Thanet said that we have failed to comply with the Court's decision. However, since the judgment, more than 1,700 people who have left the UK for another EEA state have been able to export their benefit. They are currently being paid while resident abroad, as long as they meet the eligibility criteria for payment. The hon. Gentleman represents a campaign group of people who previously received benefits, but who moved abroad before the date of the judgment and consequently lost them. As noted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" name="Peter Atkinson">the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson)</phrase>, who is no longer in the Chamber, when those people moved abroad they would have known that their benefits would cease, and would presumably have taken that into account when making their decision to leave the UK. Automatically to reinstate benefits to that group of people could be contrary to both domestic and European law. Apart from ensuring that customers satisfy all relevant domestic requirements, including whether they need help in looking after themselves or caring for others, they also need to satisfy European law on sickness benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.1/1">If I can make my point, I will come to the issue that the hon. Gentleman has referred to.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/2">We know that some customers may have worked in their country of residence. Once that happens, even if they have now stopped work, they are no longer the responsibility of the UK for payment of sickness benefits, and they will need to claim sickness benefits from their new state of residence. People in the UK can receive a disability benefit, even if they have no income at all. However, under European law relating to sickness benefits, in order to be eligible for payment a person needs to be in receipt of a state pension, or a long-term benefit such as incapacity benefit, or to have paid recent national insurance contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/3">People who moved abroad before the judgment and lost their benefits-such as the constituents referred to by the hon. Member for North Thanet-have written to the Department to ask the Secretary of State to reconsider the disallowance decision, and we have looked carefully at all the available options. We can revise a decision when we have made an official error. The definition of an error specifically</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/4" class="indent">&quot;excludes any error of law which is shown to have been an error by virtue of a subsequent decision of a Commission or the court.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/5">When we decided to disallow benefit when people moved abroad, the decision was made under relevant legislation that was appropriate prior to the decision by the European Court of Justice. People reclaiming benefits they received in the past must therefore not have worked in their state of residence, must be receiving a long-term contributory benefit such as incapacity benefit or state pension, or must have made recent national insurance contributions. They must also satisfy relevant domestic conditions of entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.1/6">As I noted earlier, we consider the past presence test to be a necessary condition of entitlement to a non-contributory benefit, as it establishes a recent link to the UK. However, we recognise that people abroad who have not left the UK recently will not be able to qualify.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.0/1">Let me make this point as it is relevant to a question raised by the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/2">There are exceptions to the situation that I have outlined, and they include cases when people are terminally ill. When we announced the criteria for payment of the disability living allowance care component and attendance allowance for people claiming from abroad, we made it clear that people in such circumstances would not have to satisfy the 26-weeks past presence requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/3">The hon. Gentleman referred to an e-mail that he received on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-11">11 January</phrase> and the case of people who were asked to pay back around &#163;3,000. I cannot answer in detail about that specific issue now, but I would be happy to look into the case and consider it carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/4">We are paying benefits, including state pensions, to many thousands of expatriates abroad. Most of our expatriates in the EEA live in Spain, and over the last year Ministers and senior officials have visited Spain to meet them and their representatives. They have demonstrated a genuine interest and concern in the lives of British nationals overseas. We are aware that UK nationals may experience difficulties abroad, and we want to help where we can. Since May 2007, my Department has supplied a team of six staff based in Alicante, Malaga and Madrid to provide customer service to support UK nationals living in Spain.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.1/1">The reason why I tried to intervene earlier was to ask the Minister about the Court ruling. I have two questions: first, I think that the Minister said that if the Department were to reinstate benefits from the time the relevant people moved abroad, or from when they lost them on moving abroad, it would in some way breach European or domestic law. I am not quite certain which aspect of law would be breached.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/2">Secondly, what is the Government's view of the ECJ ruling? Did it change European law or simply set out what European law had been all the time?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.182.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" speakername="Jonathan R Shaw" colnum="182"  time="010:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0003.htm#10011238000522">
	<p pid="a.182.2/1">I shall answer those points in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/2">As I was saying before the hon. Gentleman intervened, we are providing staff. We have a presence, and are working with the Spanish authorities. That is in contrast to the characterisation the hon. Gentleman attempted to give of our interest in British people living overseas. The team on the ground offers up-to-date and accurate information on entitlements; it liaises with the Spanish authorities to resolve the most complex cases; and it also works closely with and improves co-operation with the Spanish benefits agency-the National Institute of Social Security. The team is approached on occasion by customers who are priority cases in difficult welfare and health care situations, and who need quick intervention. Recent cases have included dealing with terminally ill customers requiring medical cost advice, and giving support to vulnerable customers when benefits have not been claimed.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/3">People who cannot receive a benefit from the UK may be able to receive a benefit or service from their new state of residence. If they are integrated in their new community and satisfy relevant conditions they may be able to receive benefit and assistance from social services, just like people who come to the UK. In fact, we know that people can and do receive help. For example, there are messages on various websites. One person who left the UK in 2004 recounts that she had three strokes and has</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/4" class="indent">&quot;received excellent treatment in France&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/5">She writes on the website:</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/6" class="indent">&quot;I received a letter telling me I am considered 80% or more disabled and will receive an allowance which will pay for a home help. My husband will also get an allowance for helping me in the house with washing, dressing etc.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/7">She goes on to say that although she is happy with the help she gets in France she feels bitter that she cannot get help from the UK, as she and her husband paid into the system all their working lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/8">I am pleased that lady is receiving the help she requires. As Minister for disabled people I strongly support the provision of services for disabled people, but the imposition of conditions such as the past presence test is compatible with regulation 1408/71. If the hon. Member for Forest of Dean wishes, I shall send him details of the regulation. Conditions of entitlement under domestic legislation must be taken into consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/9">The European Commission has indeed written to us to start infringement proceedings, as hon. Members have noted today, on the basis that it considers the past presence test to be an unlawful residence test. We have replied explaining our position in detail and in particular ensuring that the Commission understands how we treat workers. We have not yet received a response.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/10">Members have asked why we do not agree with the Commission. The UK is not alone among member states in disagreeing from time to time with the European Commission in this and other policy areas. I am sure that hon. Members present have disagreed with it, and have called on the UK Government to argue their case. Of course, that is what we do when we disagree. However, we have never published such correspondence with the European Commission. It is important that we can have frank and robust exchanges with the Commission, and to publish them would undermine our opportunity to engage in them. That is not true just of the present case; it is the general custom and practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.0/1">I think the Minister was guilty of slightly mischaracterising what I and my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet said. I did not ask why the Government disagree with the European Commission. I asked the Minister to set out in detail why the Government think that the past presence test is compatible with the ECJ rule. I have no problem with the Minister disagreeing with the Commission-I frequently do so-so I do not want to leave him with the idea that I am complaining about that. I just want to know why the Government think that what they are doing is compatible with the ECJ ruling. The point that I made about the Commission was that it was apparently being more transparent about its discussion with the British Government than the Government were being.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.1/1">I am grateful for that clarification of the hon. Gentleman's position.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/2">Several hon. Members raised the issue of costs. The figures referred to this morning are projected costs of &#163;50 million by 2011, on the existing past presence test. That is what we project at the most, and that was our reply to the parliamentary question tabled by the hon. Member for North Thanet. That does not take account of what would happen without the past presence test, if benefits were backdated in the way that the hon. Gentleman argued for.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.1/1">On the basis of the number of people moving abroad and who have already moved abroad, and the cases that have come up so far, we make a general estimate. I shall set out our method in more detail for the hon. Gentleman, in a letter that I shall ensure is placed in the Library. As I have said, we estimate what the figure will be at the most, but we obviously need to be cautious when accounting for public expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> talked about savings. It is a reasonable point that other savings will be made when people move abroad; but, of course, people's patterns and plans change. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has met people who have moved to Spain and then decided to move back to the UK, as of course they are entitled to do. It is difficult to make projections relating to people's behaviour and the social services they will use.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/3">In most cases, when people are dissatisfied with a Department's decision they have the right to appeal to an independent tribunal.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.2/1">On the point about cost, the Minister has clarified the answer that he gave Parliament about what would happen if the past presence test were used, and without backdating. Has the Department made any estimates of the costs of the two elements? How much would it cost if claims were backdated to the point when people left the UK, and what would the situation be without the past presence test? Has the Department made those estimates, and can the Minister furnish us with the information today, or include it in his letter to my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet?</p>

	<p pid="a.184.3/1">I shall certainly ensure that we can provide a response on the costings, to take into account not applying the past presence test, as the hon. Gentleman suggests.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/2">We have identified and submitted a small number of cases for tribunal hearings and applied for those appeals to be appointed as lead cases. I know that there has been some criticism of the delay, but obviously hon. Members will be aware that the tribunal service is the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice and I will ensure that the criticisms are passed to that Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/3">The need to get things right and deal with the delays is because the benefits were designed before the rulings came into being, as the hon. Member for Hexham noted. We have had to get the system right. It is not the case that we have been wantonly disingenuous and dragged our heels, as some Members have tried to characterise the Government's behaviour. Members should look at the track record in terms of the benefits that the Government have paid out to disabled people and compare it to that of other Governments. I think our record stands up very well. The hon. Member for Forest of Dean made a point about Polish workers and talked about how some extreme parties would use that case. Perhaps he should not fan those flames in the way that he did.</p>

	<p pid="a.185.0/1">All we are asking for is consistency. The Government appear to be perfectly prepared to pay people who now live in the Minister's constituency, or people who live in my constituency in Kent, considerable sums of money, in the form of benefits decreed by the European Union-I have no problem with that. That money is paid to people who are not resident in the United Kingdom, people who have come here and paid no taxes, no rates, no nothing, for the majority of their working lives. They may be paying taxes now, but they have not paid them for 30, 40 or 50 years. Therefore, we cannot understand why United Kingdom citizens-UK passport-holders-who are now resident in European countries are being discriminated against, and those citizens cannot understand it themselves. That is the point. It has nothing to do with racism, extremism or anything else.</p>

	Goldstone Report
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.186.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" speakername="Martin Linton" colnum="186"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0004.htm#10011238000531">
	<p pid="a.186.2/1">It is good to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble. I am glad to see so many hon. Members as I consider this to be a vital debate on the Goldstone report and the Government's attitude to it before the vote in the United Nations General Assembly next month and, possibly, in the Security Council the month after.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/2">As one of the few people who have read the report from cover to cover, I regard it as one of the most thorough and thoughtful I have ever read, and a model of even-handedness. I do not say that the original motion before the Human Rights Council was even-handed because it referred only to Israel. However, the amended mandate of the mission, as agreed between the president of the committee and Richard Goldstone, was even-handed because it refers to human rights violations by all parties before, during and after the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/3">The Israelis have criticised the process and refused to give evidence. However, a panel of prominent international lawyers under Elizabeth Wilmshurst, a former Foreign Office lawyer, looked at the report and concluded that it was not invalidated by the criticism, nor by Israel's refusal to give evidence-far from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/4">I was one of the first group of MPs to enter Gaza after the military operations in February, along with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase>. We saw many of the same things and spoke to many of the same people as the mission. Our accounts were listened to, but we did not have the time or resources to cross-check every fact and assess the reliability of every witness. Richard Goldstone did so with meticulous care. I do not know whether to be surprised to discover that all the horrors that we could hardly believe were true.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/5">The first strike by an Israeli jet fighter at 11.20 on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-27">27 December</phrase> caught a group of policemen on a three-week training course doing their morning sport exercise; 48 of them were killed on the spot. There were no allegations that the police force took part in combat, yet 248 members of the Gaza police were killed. The report found that to be a violation of international humanitarian law on several counts.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/6">We saw the effects of shelling on the hospital and ambulances at al-Quds hospital. The report found that the direct attack on the hospital violated the fourth Geneva convention. We also visited the al-Wafa hospital and saw lumps of debris that were still smoking three weeks after the attack. The report confirmed that it was a white phosphorus attack that was reckless, unjustifiable and in violation of the Geneva convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/7">Israeli paratroopers fired mortars into the busy al-Fakhura street in Jabaliyah, killing 24 people, nearly all of whom were civilians. They landed just a few metres from a United Nations school where 1,368 civilians were sheltering. In a sober, understated way, the report said that the decision to deploy mortars in a location filled with civilians was not a choice any reasonable commander would have made. The commander would have known that it would result in civilian deaths. A missile strike on the door of the al-Maqadmah mosque in Jabaliya, where 200 men had gathered for evening prayers, killed 15 and injured 40. There was no suggestion that the mosque was used to launch rockets, store weapons or shelter combatants. That too was found to be a grave breach.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/8">The commander of the paratroop brigade in Jabaliyah, Colonel Hartzi Halevi, who has since become brigadier general, was in the news only last week when he suddenly cancelled a visit to King's college London because the British Government would not give an assurance that he would not be arrested.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/9">A condolence tent, where relatives were mourning the victims of a flechette attack was itself hit by a flechette attack. Four mourners and an ambulance driver were killed and more than 20 were injured. The report found those attacks to be wilful killing, designed to kill and maim victims and, as such, were violations of international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/10">One of the most distressing parts of our visit was talking to former inhabitants of Izbat Abd Rabbo, a village that had been razed to the ground; there was nothing left except rubble. The report confirms one incident that we heard about at the time:</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/11" class="indent">&quot;Shortly after 12.30 p.m., the inhabitants of that part of Izbat Abd Rabbo heard megaphone messages telling all residents to leave.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/12">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/13" class="indent">&quot;At about 12.50 p.m., Khalid Abd Rabbo, his wife Kawthar, their three daughters&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/14">-aged nine, five and three and their grandmother-</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/15" class="indent">&quot;stepped out of the house, all of them carrying white flags. Less than 10 metres from the door was a tank, turned towards their house. Two soldiers were sitting on top of it having a snack (one was eating chips, the other chocolate, according to one of the witnesses). The family stood still, waiting for orders from the soldiers as to what they should do, but none was given. Without warning, a third soldier emerged from inside the tank and started shooting at the three girls and then also at their grandmother.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/16">The girls and the grandmother died. Their parents</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/17" class="indent">&quot;shouted for help and a neighbour, who was an ambulance driver and had his ambulance parked next to his house, decided to come to their help. He put on his ambulance crew clothes and asked his son to put on a fluorescent jacket. They had driven a few metres from their house...when Israeli soldiers...ordered them to halt and get out of the vehicle.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/18">The account continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/19" class="indent">&quot;The soldiers ordered him and his son to undress and then re-dress. They then ordered them to abandon the ambulance and to walk towards Jabaliyah...The family decided that they had to make an attempt to walk to Jabaliyah&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/20">The parents carried the girls on their shoulders and the grandmother was carried by family members.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/21">The verdict of the Goldstone report was that the soldier &quot;deliberately directed lethal fire&quot; at the girls and their grandmother and that the soldiers knew that the ambulance driver</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/22" class="indent">&quot;did not constitute a threat&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/23">and deliberately aggravated the consequences of the shooting by forcing him to abandon the ambulance.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/24">That is just one example. The report investigated incidents involving 34 Palestinian civilians who lost their lives owing to Israeli fire that was intentionally directed at them. In each case, it found that the Israeli armed forces opened fire on civilians who were not taking part in the hostilities and who posed no threat to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.1/1">I will come to Richard Goldstone's views about the Israeli internal inquiries in a moment. He says that they are inadequate and do not conform to international inquiry standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/2">First, I will mention another Israeli officer who cancelled his trip to London last week. Colonel Itai Virob, commander of the Kfir Brigade, was asked recently to give evidence about allegations that his men beat Palestinians even when they were not suspected of any offence. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/3" class="indent">&quot;using violence and aggression...is not only allowed but sometimes imperative&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/4">He continued that</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/5" class="indent">&quot;a slap, sometimes a hit to the back of the neck or the chest...sometimes a knee jab or strangulation to calm someone down is reasonable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/6">If one thinks that is bad, the soldiers under his command were even worse. An eye-witness saw them</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/7" class="indent">&quot;just knee [Palestinians] because it's boring, because you stand there 10 hours, you're not doing anything, so they beat people up.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/8">Another witness said:</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/9" class="indent">&quot;There were a lot of reservists that participated, and they totally had a celebration on the Palestinians: curses, humiliation, pulling hair and ears, kicks, slaps. These things were the norm.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/10">I should also mention the attacks on the Gazan economy. One chicken farmer</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/11" class="indent">&quot;watched as the armoured bulldozers destroyed the chicken farms, crushing the wire mesh coops with&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/12">31,000 chickens inside. The report continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/13" class="indent">&quot;He noted that the drivers of the tanks would spend hours flattening the chicken coops, sometimes stopping for coffee breaks, before resuming their work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/14">Gaza's only fully operational cement-packing plant was systematically destroyed over four days. Helicopter-launched rockets were used to destroy the main manufacturing line. Bulldozers destroyed the factory walls. The report notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/15" class="indent">&quot;The silo had not been entirely destroyed...so explosives were attached to its supporting columns.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/16">It says that it was</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/17" class="indent">&quot;a very deliberate strategy of attacking the construction industry&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/18">with no military reason or justification.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/19">I will not go on about the beatings, the degrading treatment of detainees or the use of civilians as human shields. If people want to read about those things, they can read the full report, which I recommend. Goldstone's conclusion was that rather than fighting the Palestinian armed groups in Gaza in a targeted way, as Israel was entitled to do, it had chosen to punish the whole population. That was a policy of collective punishment and the report states that it was a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish, humiliate and terrorise a civilian population.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/20">International law places an obligation on states to investigate breaches of the Geneva convention, but the report found that Israel's own investigations-I come to the point raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase>-were totally inadequate. Such investigations appear to have relied exclusively on interviews with Israeli officers and soldiers, those conducting them were not interested in interviewing victims or witnesses, and they did not start until six months after the event.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/21">The inadequacy of Israel's own investigations has meant that the report attaches enormous importance to the principle of universal jurisdiction. The report considers that universal jurisdiction is a potentially efficient tool for enforcing international law when states fail to do so. If soldiers are not punished for such casual cruelty, if generals do not investigate, if the Israeli Government spokesman, Mark Regev, simply denies on television that anything of this kind ever occurred, it eats away at the moral fibre.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.3/1">Just in case the hon. Gentleman was going to make this point, I readily concede that the report does not just mention the Israelis. The inquiry also found violations of international law in the actions of Hamas and Fatah. However, as Goldstone points out, the fact that Hamas is responsible for grave breaches of international law does not make the Israeli breaches any less grave. Goldstone worries about what he calls the &quot;culture of impunity&quot; that spreads through Israeli armed forces and the Government, who show contempt for the Geneva conventions and for international law as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.3/2">We have to understand that the Palestinians do not have the power to solve the problems that face them, and the Israelis do not have the will. It is only the international community that can resolve the situation, but it must act decisively and courageously. Universal jurisdiction is one way in which we can show how deeply we disapprove of what the Israelis have done.</p>

	<p pid="a.189.4/1">My hon. Friend has spent 11 minutes-12 minutes now-of what is a very important and interesting contribution to a critical debate concentrating entirely on the allegations faced by the Israeli military and Government surrounding the events of Operation Cast Lead. Is he going to make the same mistake that I believe Judge Goldstone has made in focusing entirely on the one side-the democratic Government who are themselves investigating the events-without dealing with the terrorism from Hamas?</p>

	<p pid="a.190.0/1">If my right hon. Friend had read the Goldstone report, she would know that many pages are devoted to the violations by Hamas and, indeed, some to the violations by Fatah. Out of the 428 pages, Goldstone devotes perhaps 20 or 30 to Fatah and Hamas, which seems a proportionate approach given that they are responsible for 13 deaths, rather then 1,300.</p>

Frankly, if the two Israeli officers had come to London last week, it would have been a good thing if they had been arrested and, indeed, prosecuted. The Foreign Secretary seems to think that arrest warrants would set the peace process back, but what sets the peace process back is the perception that the UK is applying double standards and enforcing international law against one country, but not against another.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.5/1">Indeed, I agree with my hon. Friend. What is more impressive is that Richard Goldstone cannot be dismissed as a friend of Hamas or as being worse than Ahmadinejad, as the Israelis tried to do. He regards himself as a Zionist and considers an independent inquiry into Gaza as being in Israel's interests as well as that of the Palestinians. Goldstone agrees with my hon. Friend's point. He is a veteran of inquiries into Rwanda and Serbia, he speaks with enormous authority on this matter, and he has come to the same conclusion as us.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.8/1">I am sure that my hon. Friend is not intentionally misleading the House, but the fact is that when Goldstone considered his mandate, he decided to go back only six months from the start of Cast Lead, not back over the eight years and 9,000 rocket attacks sent into Gaza by Hamas, which led the Israelis to have the justification of defending their people.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.0/1">I assure my hon. Friend that if he reads the full report, Goldstone does go back and interprets before, during and after to mean putting the matter in the context of the whole history and going back over many years. However, the point is that after this exhaustive inquiry, Goldstone was driven to the very important conclusion that a lasting peace settlement will never be achieved unless the culture of impunity is ended and violations of international law are punished.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/2">When an arrest warrant was issued for Tzipi Livni, the Israeli ambassador Ron Prosor was quoted in the papers as demanding a change in our law. Frankly, it is not his place to demand a change in our law; that is up to us. I for one would not support such a change. The Foreign Secretary said at the time that Israel is a strategic partner and a close friend so we should give the power to apply for arrest warrants to the Attorney-General. Is he suggesting that arrest warrants should be denied on the basis of friendship? Surely the Attorney-General is supposed to be entirely impartial in her legal role and changing the law in such a way would just feed the perception that double standards were being applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.0/3">On the main point about the report-I will end my comments as soon as I can-it is a good thing that the Government did not vote against the Goldstone report and try to persuade our European partners not to oppose it. However, I also think that they should have voted in favour. The reason the Government gave for not doing so was that they wanted to give the Israelis and the Palestinians six months to conduct their own inquiries. That seems sensible, but, of course, that is what Goldstone recommends anyway. When the Goldstone report comes back to the General Assembly and goes to the Security Council, I urge strongly the Foreign Secretary to support it.</p>

He failed to adequately recognise Israel's right to protect its citizens from murderous attacks and paid insufficient attention to Hamas's acts of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/3">Judge Goldstone's mission was limited by the mandate of the UN Human Rights Council, which was for an investigation of the military operations conducted in Gaza, excluding from his remit the seven years of rocket attacks by Hamas on Israel, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> has mentioned. Israel estimates that, since October 2001, 9,000 rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza into its southern towns by Hamas. It is not good enough for Judge Goldstone to characterise those as acts by &quot;Palestinian armed groups&quot;. He was also mistaken when he decided to consider only actions in the entire occupied Palestinian territory and Israel from <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-19">19 June 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/4">Estimates vary, but I know that up to 1,380 people were killed during Operation Cast Lead, which is a shocking number of deaths. Many more were injured and made homeless and workless. However, the responsibility for those deaths lies at the door of Hamas. There is no Government represented at the UN that would tolerate a sustained and murderous attack on its citizens for a period of seven years such as that carried out by Hamas on Israel.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.3/2">There are victims on Israel's side, too. I must at this point declare an interest, regarding a visit I made to Israel with Labour Friends of Israel in September, when the Judge's report was published. During that visit I was fortunate to meet around 20 young men and women who lived in Sterodt, in the south of Israel. They had seen their classmates killed, blown up in the streets by Hamas rockets. Many had been injured, but they were stoic in their determination not to be driven out of their homes by terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.3/3">They were without doubt traumatised. Their families were forced to adopt tactics that might seem almost comical: not being able to take a shower because for some families the shower was the bomb shelter and they might find themselves wet and without clothes in the presence of their entire family. Football can only be played under a protective shield mounted over a small piece of land. There are regular air raid warnings and drills to practise how to stay safe and minimise the risk of injury and death. That is no way to live. I repeat, which Government represented at the UN would tolerate such a threat to its citizens?</p>

	<p pid="a.193.3/1">If my hon. and learned Friend will allow me, I will make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.3/2">More should be done to help ease the situation in Gaza. The EU announced last January its willingness to reactivate its border assistance mission at the Rafah crossing, but conditions have militated against that. Instead of admonishing Israel for seeking to protect its citizens from attack, will our Government work with EU partners to agree a substantial offer of assistance to facilitate the opening and operation of crossings into Gaza? What discussions has my hon. Friend the Minister had within the EU to bring that about? I am pleased to see him here this morning and am sure that he can shed light on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.3/3">I have one final point, on universal jurisdiction. It is important that we bring to justice those guilty of crimes committed during warfare, but we should be ashamed of the fact that our judicial system can be manipulated so that a magistrate in a junior court can issue a warrant for the arrest of representatives of both Governments and the military from countries with whom we are friends and allies.-<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I will explain. I am ashamed of the fact that Tzipi Livni, a woman of great stature and courage and a leader of her people, cannot come freely to Britain. It is nonsense that US and UK Ministers and generals might find themselves under similar restrictions in other countries. That area of law needs urgent review, and I ask the Minister what steps are being taken to correct that legal nonsense.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.0/1">Thank you, Mrs. Humble. I will be brief so that other Members can speak. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> on securing the debate, on what he said and the way in which he said it. This is a debate in the British Parliament about accountability, and I have some specific points, which I would like the Minister to respond to when he replies, concerning the Goldstone report, the attitude taken at the UN Human Rights Council and the question of universal jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/2">After the Gaza bombing had ceased and a ceasefire of a sort was in place, the Goldstone commission was set up, and it went into enormous detail to look at what was going on. He gave a comprehensive report, which is not, in my view, unbalanced or one-sided, because it makes criticisms of all parties. When the report was finally delivered to the UN Human Rights Council, the British Government's representative, although not abstaining, extraordinarily did not participate in the discussion or vote at the end of the deliberations in Geneva. I would be grateful if the Minister explained exactly what the British Government's representatives were doing at the time, because it seems to me that if we send representatives to the Human Rights Council in Geneva we expect them to be there, to participate in the discussions. If the British Government are not prepared to support the referral of the Goldstone commission's report to the Security Council, they should do us the courtesy of explaining why. There appears to have been further obfuscation later on when it got to the UN Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/3">I think Goldstone is a brave man. He stood out against apartheid. He is not an enemy of Israel. Indeed, he has quite strongly Zionist views, which many of us in this Chamber might or might not agree with. The fact is that he is a respected jurist around the world who has delivered an important report, and maybe we should treat it with some respect and have the matter dealt with properly by the Security Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.1/1">The hon. Gentleman cites the authority of the UN Human Rights Council and its resolution as a source of legitimacy in the matter. Does he not recognise that some countries that voted in favour of the resolution and that have seats on the UN Human Rights Council have themselves grotesquely poor human rights records, such as Syria, Cuba and Saudi Arabia? To cite that as the authority on which to judge a liberal democracy is perhaps to apply double standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.2/1">Most countries that are represented on the UN Human Rights Council have difficult human rights records, including the United States over Guantanamo Bay and this country over extraordinary rendition and the imprisonment of child asylum seekers. Many other countries have serious human rights questions to be asked of them. I do not resile from that, and I understand the points that are being made. None the less, the Minister must explain why the British Government representative could not bring themselves to take part in the decision to refer the matter to the Security Council. I am sure that the hon. Member for Harwich will agree with me on that point, if not on the other points that I have made concerning the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.2/2">The Goldstone report goes into a lot of detail about the destruction of economic and civilian life in Gaza. It mentions the deliberate destruction of houses, water tanks and centres of employment and economic life. It was not just a retaliatory attack, but an intention to destroy the very economic fibre of Gaza and reduce its people to the misery and poverty with which they are forced to survive at the present time. It was a wanton act of destruction that was disproportionate to the alleged threat that Israel was facing at the time because a ceasefire was already in operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.0/1">One of the things that struck me about Operation Cast Lead was how Israel, which prides itself on being a democracy, kept all foreign journalists on a hill outside the Gaza strip so that they could not witness what was taking place.

	<p pid="a.195.1/1">Absolutely. The whole point about a democracy is that it opens itself up to accountability and observation. Israel made very sure that journalists could not get into Gaza. We should be grateful to al-Jazeera and others that remained in Gaza throughout the conflict for sending live footage of what was going on. Such action probably helped to hasten the end of the conflict rather than prolong it, which is what would have happened had they not been there.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.2/1">Those of us who visited Gaza before the conflict and Operation Cast Lead are aware that the economic damage to which my hon. Friend refers was being inflicted even then and is still being inflicted now by the blockade. I am sure that we all welcomed the Prime Minister's support for an end to the blockade in Prime Minister's questions last week, but does my hon.

	<p pid="a.195.3/1">Absolutely. I first visited Gaza in 1998 post-Oslo. There was an amazing air of optimism around. Developments were under way and farming, education and employment were all growing; it was a great time. Go there now, and one will see the horrors, destruction and misery of life for ordinary people. In effect, the people of Gaza are imprisoned. Let us put that in a wider context. When the police in this country decide to surround a demonstration and perform a &quot;kettling&quot; operation, people quite quickly become angry, annoyed and distressed. They either turn on each other or on the police, and very quickly a nasty conflict develops. Think of the people of Gaza who are under occupation. They cannot travel, move, work or live a normal life. Those who have managed to develop industries and employment or who have tried to create a sense of community saw it all destroyed in Operation Cast Lead.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/2">If we wish to bring about peace in the area, we must stop the occupation of the west bank and the imprisonment of the people of Gaza. The borders must be open and respect shown for the democratic process within Gaza and the west bank that has resulted in elected Government. Whether one likes it or not, that must fundamentally be what the democratic process is about.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/3">Lastly, I want to turn to universal jurisdiction, which I mentioned in my intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea. I was deeply involved in the whole issue of General Pinochet, including his arrival in this country on an arms-buying spree, his eventual arrest on an extradition warrant from Spain and the historic decision by the House of Lords to declare universal jurisdiction on human rights matters to be competent for British courts. It was good enough then, and many people were very pleased with it, because General Pinochet's popularity had not lasted. People said, &quot;This is a good thing. We are bringing murderers to justice.&quot; However, now that the Foreign Secretary and others see Israel as an ally, it is seen to be inconvenient to apply a similar process to people who said that there was no humanitarian crisis in Gaza and who ordered the bombing of civilian installations in Gaza during Operation Cast Lead. Surely they, too, have humanitarian law questions to answer in British courts should they show up in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.3/4">I am proud of the fact that we have universal jurisdiction in British courts, and I will in no way support the reduction of that right in any parliamentary move that is made by the Government. When the Minister replies, I suggest that he tells us that that nonsense has been dropped and that we will stick with our human rights law and universal jurisdiction. If that means that people such as Tzipi Livni cannot come here unless they are prepared to answer legal questions, so be it. It might discourage other people from bombing civilian targets in the future. Surely that is the whole point of having that law and of international human rights law.</p>

I should like to touch briefly on the important legal implications of the Goldstone report rather than its content, which has been dealt with extensively by my hon. Friend with his usual clarity and articulation. Goldstone is unique; there has never been such a meticulous and judicial analysis of atrocity within so short a time of those atrocities being committed either by a nation state or by others. I have read the report and already it has achieved the iconic status that is normally, in literary terms, reserved for &quot;Ulysses&quot;. We always used to ask each other, &quot;Have you actually read &quot;Ulysses&quot;?&quot; The answer was a test of both one's veracity and virility.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.2/1">Yes, and stamina. We now ask each other who has read Goldstone. I have, and found it a harrowing and dreadful experience. Worse than the destruction of schools and hospitals and the wanton blowing up of civilian targets is the wanton destruction of 40 per cent. of the agricultural output of Gaza. I have one rhetorical question that I wanted to ask when I tried to intervene on my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>. How does a country defend its people by wantonly destroying 40 per cent. of the agricultural capacity? More than anything else, it is the casual cruelty that is the most devastating. Goldstone mentions the casual shooting of children and civilians while soldiers do nothing except eat on the top of a tank. Effectively, they are doing it for fun. That reawakens images of the worst regiments of history; images with which my generation were brought up. I am talking about images of the Waffen SS doing precisely the same thing. That is what is so horrifying in the Goldstone report.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/2">Let me briefly touch on the even-handedness of Goldstone. The Goldstone report centres on Israel and the actions of the Israeli army because 1,440 people have been injured and killed-including 400 children-by that army. It is hardly surprising that Goldstone concentrates on such matters. Israel is an immensely prosperous state that is supported by the most prosperous state on Earth and many of the most prosperous institutions. It is a state that, ever since I entered politics, I have supported and worked for its right to exist. It is a state born out of indescribable suffering, which happened in my lifetime. So, I do not take any criticism from those who might say that I am anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli-I am not and never have been-but Gaza opened the eyes of people like me, who had been quiet for far too long on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.2/3">What happened in Gaza is chronicled in Goldstone. What is the effect?</p>

	<p pid="a.197.0/1">I welcome the debate. I come from a similar background to my hon. and learned Friend and have been going to that part of world since before I came into this place. Does it disturb him, as it disturbs me, that people use &quot;democracy&quot; and the existence of an internal electoral system that appoints a parliament as an excuse-a smoke-and-mirrors scheme to hide behind-to justify the actions of what anyone else would say has become a pariah state?</p>

	<p pid="a.197.1/1">I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. Democracy, laudable though it undoubtedly is, is only one hallmark of civilisation; how one behaves in that democracy is another. The Third Reich started out as a democracy; Hamas is a democracy; democracy is not the only thing. The repetition of the phrase, &quot;This is the only democracy in the middle east&quot;, with Israel therefore deserving some special treatment, is costing us dear in international terms and in international relations.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/2">Briefly, on the legal consequences of Goldstone, does the report have a legal base in British jurisprudence? Yes, it does, it most certainly does-it is evidence. Ironically, one of the reasons why it is evidence is because of the extreme loosening of the evidential barriers effected by the Government in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, in the teeth of opposition from people such as myself. None the less, that is the effect: Goldstone is an evidential document in British jurisdiction, and may be used as such.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.2/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman mentions the examples of brutality cited in Goldstone, which are based on examples provided to Goldstone by non-governmental organisation evidence. The NGO evidence, as Goldstone himself stated, was based almost entirely on unverifiable publications from politicised NGOs, such as the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, whose analysis it is fair to say is not wholly objective. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman not accept that some of the evidence base in Goldstone is highly questionable and that the report is not the objective document that he pretends it to be?</p>

	<p pid="a.198.0/1">That interpretation of Goldstone is highly selective, but let me answer the real question, which came at the end: do I not accept that some of the evidence in Goldstone is questionable? Of course I do. I have been a criminal barrister for a long time and have prosecuted and defended-I am happy or unhappy to say-some of the most venal, serious, dangerous, nasty and on occasion violent crimes that have been committed in this jurisdiction. Of course I know that all evidence needs to be tested. That is why the report needs to be tested in a proper arena; it needs to be tested in a British court, or in a court. Brought before such a judicial test, it may well be that some parts of the report will be found wanting. Frankly, I disagree-the report is a devastating indictment, in its form, its content and the nature and background of the man who wrote it. However, that is all that it is: an indictment. That indictment cries out to be tried.</p>

In the case of Tzipi Livni-not a case in which I was retained-inevitably what happened was that evidence was placed before a British district judge, of whom there is no criticism at all. I shall listen carefully to the Minister's reply, when he comes to deal with the issue. If he says that the district judge can be criticised, he is wholly at odds with the Foreign Secretary, who has spoken to me in such terms as, &quot;There is no criticism of that district judge.&quot; That district judge, on the evidence placed before him or her-I do not know which, but it was a Westminster district judge-found that there was a prima facie case to answer, because of the evidence of the atrocities committed in Gaza and the authority exercised by Tzipi Livni at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.0/3">That is the British system. In our system, we have the contribution of the citizen to a degree not exemplified elsewhere. We have jury trial, for instance-the first trial without a jury starts today, ironically, but the basis of our system is still jury trial. The citizen decides; the citizen can initiate process; and the citizen can go to a district judge and put evidence before the judge-if the evidence is there, process will issue. That is our system and I find nothing shameful in that at all. What I find shameful is the speed with which our Prime Minister got in touch with the Israeli Government and told them that there was something wrong with our judicial process. What I find shameful is that the Attorney-General-our Attorneys-General in this Government have a lot to answer for in how they have used their office in the build-up to the Iraq war and now this-going to a Hebrew university, talked about war &quot;lawfare&quot; and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Israel's leaders should always be able to travel freely in the United Kingdom&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.0/5">Why? Why should Israel's leaders &quot;always&quot; be able to travel, no matter what they do or the atrocities committed by their Government, army and the IDF on their behalf? Why? The time has long gone in this world when those who commit war crimes can believe that they can travel with impunity and immunity into civilised states and not face universal jurisdiction.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.0/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman comes from a proud tradition of the British left of being staunchly anti-imperial and anti-imperialist. Is there not something vaguely imperial about the ambition of universal jurisdiction, the idea that a British court can detain and arrest the leader of another country? Is that not an inversion of the anti-imperial tradition of which he used to be an advocate?</p>

	<p pid="a.199.1/1">It is not just our courts, but all the courts of any country that has signed the fourth Geneva convention and its protocol. That is the point, the jurisdiction is universal, which is the precise opposite of colonial. It is a universal jurisdiction, so that those who commit war crimes and atrocities know that their movement will be restricted in the world. Ironically, those who denied the freedom of movement to others, find that movement is denied to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/2">I shall oppose-I very much hope that the wider House will oppose-any attempt to restrict universal jurisdiction at the behest of any state, however powerful, whose leaders are accused and against whom there is prima facie evidence of committing such crimes.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.6/1">I asked the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase> a parliamentary question about the report and he set out the flaws in November last year: it did not adequately recognise Israel's right to protect its citizens or pay sufficient attention to Hamas's actions; it made broad assertions about detailed interpretation of international law over which we differ; and it lacked an authority of Israeli perspective, so crucial to determining the legality of the actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.6/2">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase> mentioned the rocket attacks by Palestinian militants, targeted at innocent civilians in southern Israel, which constituted a breach of international humanitarian law but was not addressed. As I mentioned in an earlier intervention, there have been 9,000 such attacks since October 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.6/3">We have heard a lot about international universal jurisdiction and the way that the Goldstone report was used to attempt the arrest in December last year of Tzipi Livni, Leader of the Opposition in Israel and former Foreign Minister. Hamas has since admitted that it worked in co-ordination with lawyers in this country on that case to try to achieve that. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree said, that has led to the cessation of visits by Israeli leaders and senior officials, dangerously affecting our relations with that country and, more importantly, our influence over the middle east peace process.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.6/4">I should like to say a few words in support of the commitments made by the Attorney-General in Jerusalem earlier this month, and the Foreign Secretary last month, to look at ways in which the system can be reformed, because if we are going to retain our strategic partnership with Israel and continue to have a constructive role in any middle east conflict it is vital that Israeli visitors, whether in Government or not, are able to come to this country for meetings with UK politicians and the wider community. It is important to recognise that Ms Livni is a strong proponent of the two-state solution and of renewing peace negotiations, yet her visit was cancelled, so she could not discuss with our Government those specific issues that would help the peace process rather than hinder it. That is the consequence of this action.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.6/5">I would like to see the law reforms. I support the principle of universal jurisdiction for international law, but I would like to see our courts protected from being used as campaign forums by politically motivated groups that are not really interested in justice, but are interested in scoring party political or other political points in this long-running conflict in the middle east, which is not going to be resolved in courts of law. Our courts have been left dangerously open to political manipulation and being brought into disrepute. There is a way forward by allowing the Attorney-General to decide whether this should happen. The Attorney-General is, in the end, responsible for deciding which prosecutions should go ahead, based on the likelihood of both a conviction and a public interest test. We may have the embarrassment of leaders being arrested but no prosecution following on from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.6/6">Although this state of affairs has little appeal to those who have serious concerns, it is now attracting the efforts of those seeking to use our law to embarrass foreign political leaders who they dislike. We need international, universal jurisdiction to deal with people such as the genocidaires from Rwanda and war criminals from Bosnia and Serbia, and the war lord from Afghanistan who was prosecuted successfully, but this is not what it was designed or intended for.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.0/1">If my hon. Friend is saying that a better way of operating the law of universal jurisdiction would be to involve the Attorney-General at an earlier stage in determining whether there should be arrest, not just deciding whether there should be a prosecution, does he think it was wise for that same post-holder-the Attorney-General-to go to Israel and give a guarantee in advance that, as far as the British Government are concerned, no Israeli leader would be arrested if they came to the UK? Is not that rather prejudicing her office?</p>

	<p pid="a.201.0/1">I do not think that is right. I think we had a serious diplomatic problem with Israel that needed to be resolved sensibly. The approach being adopted by the Foreign Secretary, with whom I discussed this matter last night, is sensible. We need to work with the Ministry of Justice and the Foreign Office to find a sensible solution to this issue to enable us to prosecute people such as the Rwandan genocidaires, yet at the same time play a constructive role in the middle east peace process, which these efforts hinder.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.2/1">If I give way any more, nobody else is going to get in.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/2">The Government have rightly called for Israel to conduct an independent inquiry into what happened, as did Goldstone, and this call has been echoed by international partners as well as many NGOs. I welcome the answer given by Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead in the other place to a parliamentary question earlier this month, saying that the Israeli authorities have carried out, or are currently undertaking, investigations into 140 separate incidents, including but not limited to the 34 highlighted by Goldstone inquiry. Although those investigations are being carried out by the IDF and not by an independent body, which would be preferable, the fact that Israel is conducting these inquiries should not be ignored. Too often Israel is painted as a country incapable of self-scrutiny. Yet we only need to look back as far as 2006, to the Winograd investigation and to 2005, to the Sasson Report, to know that this is far from true. Winograd was in response to the Lebanon conflict in 2006 and Sasson was commissioned to look into the funding of settlement expansion.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/3">Sasson exposed the fact that state bodies were covertly diverting funds to settlements improperly and the Winograd report was critical of the military strategy employed in the second Lebanon war, particularly the decision to respond with an immediate intensive military strike, following the kidnapping of Israeli servicemen, Ehud and Goldwasser. Israel has, in the past, conducted proper inquiries into such matters, found itself wanting and acted accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/4">Israel has established a legal system that is respected throughout the world, with a Supreme Court that is open to all, with few restrictions on its jurisdiction. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-29">29 December 2009</phrase>, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that a 14 km west bank stretch of Israel's highway 443, a main road between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, should not be closed to Palestinians, despite the military's fears that after six Israeli deaths on the road in terror attacks during the second intifada, opening the road could result in more deaths of Israeli citizens. Nevertheless, the Israeli Supreme Court decided that that road should be opened.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/5">I highlight these points because they are too often overlooked. Although our Government were right to call for Israel to conduct an inquiry into possible breaches of international law during the Gaza conflict, although the Goldstone is merely an indictment not a proven fact, as my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1709" name="Robert Marshall-Andrews">the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)</phrase> said-unlike my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> who, on introducing the debate, effectively took it as proven fact-and although Israel's current investigations may not be perfect, it is right that we give Israel the opportunity to show the international community that it is taking these allegations seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/6">We should at least wait to hear the outcome of Israel's investigation before offering premature condemnations, such as we have heard today. Israel may establish a fully independent inquiry.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.1/1">No, there is not time.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/2">Several prominent Members of the Knesset, including Kadima party MK and chair of the Israel-United Kingdom Parliamentary Friendship League, Nachman Shai, have called for such a judicial inquiry into Operation Cast Lead in response to Goldstone.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/3">Israel is entitled, as a liberal democracy, to time to respond to the Goldstone report fully. I do not see any sign of Hamas setting up an inquiry into the war crimes that it is alleged to have committed, with considerable evidence behind the allegations, such as rocketing Israeli civilians indiscriminately or using its own citizens as human shields effectively to maximise casualties to create the pressure on Israel that we have seen. Only last week, there were three rockets fired into and 10 mortar attacks on Israel from Gaza, endangering innocent lives as well as the efforts of the international community to get Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations restarted. The situation in Gaza is unlikely to improve while these attacks are still occurring and Hamas refuses to renounce violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/4">Although I disagree with the level of restrictions imposed by Israel at the crossings into Gaza, we should not forget the threat that Israel faces. Removing these restrictions means that Hamas and other terrorist groups will have greater opportunity to smuggle in weapons and carry out terrorist attacks. Hamas has, in the past, used such building materials to fortify its military infrastructure and construct weapons. Egypt's recent blocking of crossings from Egypt into Gaza, and the fact that it deported <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1405" name="George Galloway">the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Galloway)</phrase>, are signs of its changing attitude to some of the problems that it is now seeing, which Israel has seen for a long time.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/5">Mr. Hood, I do not want to take up any more time. Our Government have the right approach to both international universal jurisdiction and the Goldstone report. I commend them on their stance so far and hope that that will continue and that there will be an early announcement on how they intend to deal with universal jurisdiction.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.3/1">Mr. Hood, I take your hint.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.3/2">Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase>, whom I congratulate on securing this debate, I was an eye witness to the immediate aftermath of the invasion of Gaza-as were my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase>-as part of the first parliamentary delegation into Gaza after the withdrawal of the IDF. Therefore the report has a certain poignancy, in addition to that felt by other hon. Members who have taken the trouble to read it.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.3/3">Yes, we did see the destruction of entire villages, hospitals, some of the 280 schools and some of the 95 per cent. of private industry that was destroyed. We saw the destruction of civil society, including police stations. Nearly 250 police officers were killed in deliberate bombing attacks, most on the first day of the bombing. Yes, we did stand in the rubble of the legislature in Gaza and we spoke to some of its democratically elected Members. I thought that that would have some resonance for hon. Members in this House, even those who seem to have a blind spot in discussing this issue-unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea-and seeing both sides of the argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.3/4">Yes, there were atrocities on both sides, but disproportionately and massively, more atrocities were committed by Israeli forces. If the deaths of 352 children are not a murderous act as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase> said, I do not know what is. We saw the evidence of white phosphorous having been used; it was still reignitable three weeks after the troops had left. Yes, I have been to Ashkelon and seen the conditions that people live in and yes, that is intolerable, but it is a functioning modern city, as Sderot is. One cannot make a comparison between the suffering of people in Gaza and the suffering of people in Israel in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.3/5">I shall mention two other points. The first, which is dealt with in the Goldstone report, is the suppression by the Israeli authorities of organisations such as Breaking the Silence and B'Tselem, and the bombing of UNRWA-the United Nations Relief and Works Agency-facilities. Again, the eyewitness reports that we received and the people we met, mainly through the facility of those well respected organisations, are also unable to tell their story to the outside world. Of course, the siege continues. Only 15 per cent. of the trade that was getting into Gaza before the blockade started is getting there now.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.3/6">I ask my hon. Friend the Minister two questions. First, please will he address what the Government's attitude to the Goldstone report is now and why, given the time that has elapsed, the Government cannot come off the fence and say that the allegations made in Goldstone ought to be investigated? Secondly, the universal jurisdiction point is not about the dark arts of diplomacy and Government-to-Government discussions; it is an important point about civil liberties for this country. Many hon. Members, as well as many of our constituents, will not stomach attempts by the British Government to remove traditions that we are very proud of in this country simply because somebody described as an international partner requests us to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.3/7">In the context of what is happening in the middle east, the failure to secure a settlement freeze, the injustice suffered by the Palestinian people, the effect that has on moderates and particularly President Abbas at the moment, in the west bank and the Gaza strip, the Goldstone report and universal jurisdiction are vital not just as arcane debating points here, but to our constituents and to the Palestinian people in Gaza and the west bank.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">The hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> has done the House a great service by proposing the debate. All the contributions so far show that people are engaged and feel very strongly on both sides.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/2">When an action such as Operation Cast Lead happens, it is right that we get to the facts. Those of us who saw the pictures on television, whether from al-Jazeera or other sources, and who heard the reports coming out of Gaza at the time said we felt that the action was disproportionate and there was a case for investigating allegations of war crimes on both sides.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/3">I was delighted to be invited and felt strongly enough to go to Gaza to see the situation for myself, as part of the parliamentary delegation that was mentioned. The facts that we saw on the ground in a limited, restricted way, given our time and ability to verify things, only confirmed what we had seen on television-that the destruction was huge and wanton. Some of the villages we saw had been targeted not just for military targets, but for civilian targets. We talked to people who lived there, who said that first they had been fired on from the air, then the tanks had fired on their houses and, because some were still standing, the troops then came in, laid charges and blew the rest of the houses down. We went to that village, stood on the rubble and saw house after house that had been destroyed, so if anyone tells me that they think that was correct action, fair action and along the lines of international law, I cannot accept it.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.3/1">We all recognise that there have been many victims of the conflict and many horrific things happened, but will the hon. Gentleman also recognise that some of the victims are casualties of the terrorist tactic of launching attacks from close proximity to civilian centres?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.204.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" speakername="Edward Davey" colnum="204"  time="012:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0007.htm#10011238000591">
	<p pid="a.204.4/1">We visited Ashkelon and saw the damage that had been done by Hamas rockets, and the report is very clear, quite rightly, that firing by Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups from Gaza indiscriminately on Israeli civilians is a war crime and a crime against humanity. I condemn every single one of those rockets fired indiscriminately against civilians. <i>[Interruption.] </i>The hon. Gentleman is talking about where they were fired from, but I do not know how he knows where they were all fired from. Some were clearly fired from civilian centres, but if he thinks that justifies wiping out-razing to the ground-a whole village, he is coming at this from a different political perspective from mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/2">We did not just visit homes and speak to people. We saw the hospitals and schools that had been destroyed. We went to an ice cream factory. The report talks about the cement factory, the flour mill and the water and sewage works, but we also saw ice cream factories. We met a Palestinian entrepreneur who had been working with Israeli businesses for 20 or 30 years, supplying ice cream to Israel, and had been one of the moderates in Gaza, trying to get free enterprise going in Gaza. He told us that he was absolutely disillusioned by the Israelis, how his business had been destroyed, how people had been thrown out of work and that it was completely unjustifiable because he had never allowed any Hamas militant anywhere near his factories.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/3">Those are the facts about what we saw, but I readily confess that it was limited and could not be verified on every account. The question is how far Judge Goldstone's report gets to the truth. It cannot get all the way there. Israel refused to take part, so the mission did not hear from both sides, which is a limitation of the report, but Judge Goldstone can hardly be criticised for that.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the fact that the Israelis refused to take part enhances the perception of bias in the whole report and that it would have been much more helpful if there had been co-operation from the Israelis?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.205.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" speakername="Edward Davey" colnum="205"  time="012:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0007.htm#10011238000593">
	<p pid="a.205.1/1">Of course. My point is that the Goldstone report cannot be criticised because one party refused to give evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/2">There are some valid criticisms of the report. One is that the resolution tabled at the UN to create the debate on the report and the follow-through from the report was biased. It was not as balanced as the report itself. The Government did not actually abstain-they were not in the room-but I can understand why they would have abstained if they had been in the room, because of the limitations of the resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/3">However, some of the other criticisms levelled at the Goldstone report do not stand up to analysis. People talk about a biased mandate. Judge Goldstone amended the mandate to ensure that it was balanced and brought in the issue of rockets fired on civilians from Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/4">People say that the report is politically motivated; they talk about many of the shortcomings of the United Nations Human Rights Council. However, the report was written not by the Human Rights Council, but by one of the world's greatest jurists, who is an expert at looking into war crimes as a result of his experience in Rwanda and Yugoslavia.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/5">One criticism says that the report did not adequately recognise Israel's right to protect its citizens. That is a fundamental misunderstanding of the report's mandate. The report was not set up to look into the legality of the war, but to look into the behaviour of all parties during that conflict. Therefore, I do not think that criticism can undermine the findings and thrust of the Goldstone report.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/6">I am particularly taken by the findings of the expert meeting convened at Chatham House at the end of November last year, referred to briefly by the hon. Member for Battersea. It involved a number of experts in international and humanitarian law: Elizabeth Wilmshurst, whom people will know as the former Foreign Office legal adviser, Professor Matthew Craven, Dr. Catriona Drew, Professor Charles Garraway, Professor Steven Haines, Professor Fran&#231;oise Hampson and Professor Sir Nigel Rodley. Together, they were an extremely experienced and expert group to consider issues of international law. They looked into the criticisms of the procedural aspects of Goldstone and their report concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The meeting was of the view that the Report was very far from being invalidated by the criticisms. The Report raised extremely serious issues which had to be addressed. It contained compelling evidence on some incidents.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/8">That is the judgment of independent academics who are experts in the field, and therefore I do not think that the report can be dismissed. I hope that the Government will tell us what they intend to do at the UN and regarding their relations with Israel, to ensure that the report is answered; it cannot be shelved. We need to hear the full answers, and to ensure that people are held to account. Any moves to undermine the need for accountability on such matters should be opposed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.206.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" speakername="Brooks Newmark" colnum="206"  time="012:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0007.htm#10011238000594">
	<p pid="a.206.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> on securing the debate. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase>, who would have responded to the debate on behalf of the Opposition, has asked me to express his apologies. He is visiting Tokyo at the invitation of the Japanese Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/2">The contributions that we have heard this morning from both sides of the House show the strength of feeling about Gaza that exists among members of all political parties. What happened in Gaza during the Israeli military action 12 months ago was an appalling human tragedy, and today the people of Gaza-1 million or more of our fellow human beings-continue to suffer. The debate has also shown how opinions about events in Gaza have become polarised, which reflects the stark division of opinion in the middle east itself. To most Israelis, Operation Cast Lead was a necessity, a national duty even. Israel had withdrawn from the Gaza strip-dismantling its settlements and evicting settlers by force-and she hoped for peace. Instead, she saw Gaza taken over by a group dedicated to Israel's destruction and rocket attacks on Israeli civilians. When I talk to Israeli representatives, I find that they express regret about the loss of life among civilians in Gaza, but they point to the fact that in 2008 and 2009 more than 1,750 rockets and more than 1,500 mortar shells were fired into Israel. To most Israelis, including men and women passionately committed to peace and to a two-state solution, military action in Gaza was justified by the need to protect their fellow citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/3">In the Arab and the wider Muslim world, an utterly different narrative is heard. The argument there is that an imperfect but more or less effective ceasefire was wrecked by Israeli incursions into Gaza, which prompted retaliatory attacks from Hamas. Night after night, television screens showed shocking graphic images of women and children killed and maimed by Israeli bullets and shells. Not only Syria and Iran, but traditionally more moderate countries such as Turkey and Malaysia, reacted with anger.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/4">We can understand why Israel felt compelled to take action to protect her citizens from rocket attacks, but there can be no doubt that the war in Gaza has damaged prospects for peace in the middle east and Israel's hopes for permanent security along with it, and has caused an immense and continuing humanitarian crisis in the Gaza strip. We shall not get an enduring peace in the middle east unless that legacy can be addressed, and both political and economic progress can be made with regard to Gaza. That includes addressing the serious and grave allegations of human rights violations that have been made against both the Israeli defence forces and Hamas. Throughout the conflict, we called for those allegations to be fully investigated, and we have supported the establishment of a UN fact-finding mission to Gaza and the work of Judge Goldstone. It is a pity that the Israeli Government decided not to engage with the commission, because the consequence is that the report lacks an authoritative Israeli perspective on the military and legal criteria that the Israeli defence force used.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/5">Like the Government, we think that the Goldstone report has flaws. It refers to the rocket attacks on Israel, describing them in paragraph 108 as probable war crimes, and it also denounces how Gilad Shalit is being held and criticises Hamas for the murder and abuse of its political opponents inside Gaza, but those paragraphs make up only a small proportion of a report, the bulk of which deals with allegations against the Israeli forces and makes severe criticisms of them. It does not adequately recognise Israel's legal right to protect its citizens; nor does it pay sufficient attention to the actions of Hamas.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/6">We continue to believe that the allegations listed in the Goldstone report need to be fully investigated, and addressed by both Israel and the Palestinians. It is a pity that the resolution tabled at the UN Human Rights Council was so utterly one-sided, failing even to mention Hamas by name. That is why we called on the Government to vote against the resolution. The Government's action in instructing the British delegate to leave the room rather than to vote either way, or even record a formal abstention, was an abdication of responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/7">The Goldstone report also deals at length with the humanitarian problems in Gaza, which were made much worse by the war and continue today. We want to see the crossing points reopened as soon as possible, to allow food, medical and hospital supplies to be brought in without limit. The Israeli authorities have told us that they believe such humanitarian aid is being allowed through but that Hamas activists prevent it from reaching ordinary people. The aid agencies tell us that basic needs are still not being met. Will the Minister give us the British Government's assessment of the adequacy of food and medical supplies reaching Gaza, and what action they are taking to improve matters on the ground?</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/8">In a written answer dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-02">2 November 2009</phrase>, the Government said that the United Kingdom had not yet been able to spend any of the &#163;20 million of funding earmarked for reconstruction in Gaza because of restrictions imposed by Israel on the entry of building materials. The essential reconstruction of homes, schools and health facilities is not happening, and well over half of Gaza's population does not have daily access to water. That state of affairs is morally wrong, and can surely only add to the bitterness that will make political reconciliation even more difficult to achieve. What actions are the Government taking both bilaterally and through the European Union to find ways to accelerate the pace of reconstruction in Gaza? What is the status of negotiations to reopen the crossing points, and does the Minister believe that there might need to be some kind of international presence on the ground to help to overcome the political obstacles to restoring the normal flow of goods for civilian use?</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/9">One consequence of events in Gaza has been the increased risk to Israeli politicians of arrest if they visit the United Kingdom, as we have heard in today's debate. It is essential that Israeli leaders should be able to come to this country to talk about bilateral relations, and in particular about the middle east peace process. I note that the Attorney-General said recently that the Government intended to address that problem, possibly by changes to legislation, but I hope that the Minister will give us a bit more detail when he replies.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.0/10">It is in the interests of the United Kingdom to see a genuine and enduring peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. In our view, that settlement has to be based upon a two-state solution in which Gaza forms an integral part of a sovereign and viable Palestinian state. Such a solution is vital to the future safety and security of Israelis and Palestinians alike.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.0/1">I wholeheartedly congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has always been a courageous politician, who speaks out on the issues that matter most to him, and I hope that he has a successful year. I also congratulate him on how he has advanced his cause. Many of us saw the horrific events last year, and have responded all around the world with heartfelt concern for those affected. My hon. Friend put his case very well.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/2">The Government's position starts firmly from the belief that, in all our responses, we should focus on the desirability of an enduring peace in the middle east. All hon. Members will know the Government's position, but I state for the record that we believe in a two-state solution, with a viable-not violable, as I believe I heard <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase> say-Palestinian state and Israel secure within her borders.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/3">Of course, as two of my hon. Friends said, Israel has an absolute right to protect itself. However, that does not give it carte blanche to use any means that it wants, and nor does it allow it to stray beyond the bounds of what is morally right or what is legally right under international law-or, for that matter, under its own law.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/4">Similarly, Israel has a right to build homes for its people, but it does not have the right to build homes exactly where it chooses. We have made it absolutely clear that we are critical of all plans to continue with the settlement process, particularly in East Jerusalem. We believe that Israel should stop all illegal settlements. Indeed, that is why we supported the statement made at the European Council's December meeting:</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The Council is deeply concerned about the situation in East Jerusalem. In view of recent incidents, it calls on all parties to refrain from provocative actions. The Council recalls that it has never recognised the annexation of East Jerusalem. If there is to be genuine peace, a way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of two states.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/6">That is strongly our view as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/7">We also urge upon Israel the absolute seriousness of the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which was mentioned by several hon. Members. It is morally indefensible to kettle the Palestinian people. The hon. Member for Braintree asked about the Government's view on enabling the reconstruction of Gaza. We do not believe that that is moving fast enough. With our colleagues in the European Union, we have urged Israel to be open to much more humanitarian aid. We are not able to provide the support that we stand ready to give, and we urge Israel to do more.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.1/1">Yes, of course. That is why we want to ensure that humanitarian aid can get through. However, aid is also needed to enable people to rebuild homes that were destroyed a year ago. To us, that seems a vital part of the ongoing peace process. That is why I am glad that the European Union came to a clear view on the matter before Christmas. The continued policy of closure was unacceptable and, we believe, politically counter-productive.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.2/1">I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend when he is in full flow. The EU passed a view on that point, but may I press him on the matter? Will the EU, and my hon. Friend in discussion with other Ministers, do more than take a view and come together to see whether solutions cannot be found to help Israel find ways to open the border crossing?</p>

	<p pid="a.209.3/1">Yes. There is constant discussion between our Prime Minister and others, particularly Mr. Sarkozy, the President of France, about how we might do that. However, I do not want to underestimate the difficulties. Of course, while Hamas refuses to renounce violence, it will always be more difficult. I return to the fact that, especially in winter months, there is a real humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We want to see humanitarian aid and other aid get through as fast as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/2">Several hon. Members spoke of universal jurisdiction. We wholeheartedly support that concept. That is why we have always supported the International Criminal Court. On a slightly different point, it is why we have always supported the European arrest warrant. There are crimes that need to be prosecuted, whether through the European arrest warrant or the international arrest warrant. We need people to appear before a court, and to be prosecuted. However, the direct parallel with General Pinochet drawn by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> is a slightly different matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/3">I was disappointed that, for a time, it was not possible to bring Pinochet to trial for the undoubtedly criminal acts that he ordered in Chile, not least because several of my friends were killed there under his dictatorship. That case was slightly different, however; the problem was extradition. In the present case, it is vital that international war crimes are prosecuted. It seems odd and unusual that in England and Wales-but not in Scotland, which has a different legal system-arrest warrants can be sought and issued without the prior request of the police or the advice of a prosecutor. That is different from what pertains in many other countries. The key point is that we wholeheartedly support the concept of universal jurisdiction. The question is how it is prosecuted in individual countries. Discussions about how we can move forward are ongoing, and I hope that they will bear fruit in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.0/1">The problem with the Minister's description is this: if the law is changed to allow the universal arrest warrant to be issued against individuals only with the permission of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney-General-or the Home Secretary, the equivalent of the Minister of the Interior-one moves straight into the political field. We have already heard statements from Ministers here that Israeli Ministers and leaders, whoever they might be, must be free to travel in this country. That suggests that the ability to obtain an arrest warrant through a district judge is a powerful and important instrument for human rights and humanitarian law.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.1/1">In some aspects, my hon. Friend has a point. It is not that the Government want literally any politician, anywhere in the world, to be free to come to the UK because we want a conversation with them. However, I push it back to the hon.

I am not able to reveal what the Government intend, but I hope that we will soon be able to do so. We support the idea of universal jurisdiction, but how it is applied in the UK is a matter for us to consider. None the less, other countries would not be able to move to a prosecution without a prosecutor having made a case, and without the police having requested a warrant. It is important that we move to a system under which politicians from Israel-and, for that matter, other countries-should be able to travel to the UK, but as I said earlier, it should not be a carte blanche arrangement for all.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.7/2">I pay tribute to many elements of the Goldstone report. There were 188 interviews, and more than 300 reports were reviewed. However, it does not provide the whole story. The report itself acknowledges that, but it was for reasons to do with Israel's not providing evidence and not engaging with the report, which we deprecate. We wish that Israel had taken part.</p>

	Davies Review
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.212.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" speakername="John Grogan" colnum="212"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0008.htm#10011238000608">
	<p pid="a.212.1/1">This is the fifth time that I have had the pleasure of initiating a debate on free-to-air sporting events. The first such occasion was on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-02">2 April 2003</phrase>-we were all so much younger then-and that was followed by debates in January 2005, in 2008 and in April 2009. However, I have never been more optimistic or more chipper about the future of listed sporting events than I am on this occasion, and that is largely because of the findings of the Davies committee review of listed events. The Davies review is the fifth such review since 1981, when the then Conservative Government passed the Broadcasting Act 1981, which put listed events on a statutory basis for the first time; before that, there had just been an agreement between the BBC and the Independent Broadcasting Authority. With some reservations, I welcome many of the recommendations in the Davies committee report.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/2">Three fundamental principles underlie the report. First, it recognises the relevance of listed events in the digital age. Although there will be far more channels than in the past, not everyone will be able to afford the &#163;400 that Sky Sports, for example, costs, so the basic divide will remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/3">Secondly, the report provides interesting analysis of how many people have access to premium sports channels. Frontier Economics did a study for the committee and calculated that on the basis that 60 per cent. of BSkyB customers and 25 per cent. of Virgin Media customers subscribe to premium sports channels, and given that Ofcom estimates that there were about 12.5 million pay-TV households in 2008, about 6.1 million households have access to premium sports channels, which means that an awful lot of households have no access.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/4">Thirdly, the review provided statistics underlining the fact that an event will attract far more viewers when it is on the A list than when it is on subscription TV. There are many examples of that. When Andy Murray was in the final of the 2008 US Open, viewing figures on Sky peaked at 1.4 million, compared with 12.7 million on the BBC when Nadal played Federer at Wimbledon. In the same year that viewing figures for Open golf reached about 13 million on the BBC, those for the Ryder cup reached about 3.6 million on Sky.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/5">I welcome the fact that the Davies review reinforced all those points. I also welcome the additions that the review proposed to the A list of events that must be made available to free-to-air TV.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.2/1">Before the hon. Gentleman moves on to the debate about the A list, may I congratulate him on bringing to the House a debate that affects the quality of life of millions of people? People are really interested in this issue and want us to address it and get policy right. Before he moves away from Sky, however, does he deplore its charging policy for pubs and clubs, which adds to the divide that he mentioned and denies access to key sporting events to a group of people who work hard all their lives and who deserve to see sporting events?</p>

	<p pid="a.212.3/1">As chairman of the all-party group on beer, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the issue of subscription TV access to sport in pubs is often pressed on me. Sky's charges have gone up by about 800 per cent. over the years, which makes it difficult for many publicans to show subscription sport. It is also unfortunate that publicans can access Sky Sports channels only through the Sky Sports platform and not other platforms, which is a restraint on competition.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.0/1">I, too, congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing a debate on a long-held interest of his, which I share. Although I accept that the viewing figures are much lower on paid-for TV channels such as Sky, does he accept that Sky has done an enormous amount to raise the standard of TV sports coverage?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.213.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" speakername="John Grogan" colnum="213"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0008.htm#10011238000612">
	<p pid="a.213.1/1">I accept entirely that Sky Sports coverage, for those who have access to it, is magnificent. Sky has developed its platform and its business in an era when listed events have been part of our lives, so the two are not incompatible. For the serious sports fan who can afford subscription sport, Sky and ESPN-there could be other players in the future-play a magnificent and important role.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/2">The six events that the Davies committee suggested should go on the A list were the home Ashes cricket series; the qualifiers for the European football championships and the World cup in the home nations concerned; Welsh rugby union matches in the Six Nations, for broadcast just in Wales; and the Open golf championship, the rugby union world cup and the Wimbledon tennis tournament in their entirety.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/3">I have two qualifications, however, about a couple of the deletions that the report proposes from the A list. First, it is interesting that the British Olympic Association has opposed the deletion of the winter Olympics. We are all looking forward to Vancouver in a few weeks' time, and who knows when we will have another curling moment or another Torvill and Dean moment, when the nation, to its surprise-certainly on the former occasion-was gripped by British success at the winter Olympics? The British Olympic Association is wise to suggest that the winter Olympics should remain on the list. Similarly, the rugby league challenge cup final has been discussed in a separate debate, so I will not dwell on it, but it is seen as a central event in national life, particularly in the north of England, and there is a case for keeping it on the list, particularly as that is the view of the rugby league authorities themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/4">Secondly, Davies suggests dropping the B list of events that must be made available in highlight form. Highlights were extremely politically controversial last year, when the highlights of the England versus Ukraine football match became available only at the last minute and those of the British Lions tour of South Africa were available only in Wales. That shows the potential for the B list to help viewers.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/5">The central point I want to address is that the governing bodies may not have reacted quite so positively to the Davies committee report. Some have suggested that expanding the A list will have a real impact on grass-roots support, and I want to rebut that argument in a number of ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/6">First, it is worth remembering that many of our sporting competitors have protected-list events. In Australia, for example, cricket test matches are listed, and Australians could sit up through the night last summer watching their national team's defeat, even though we could not have the pleasure of doing so in the UK without access to Sky TV. I have spoken to Cricket Australia, which is much more positive about Australian legislation on the issue-also being reviewed at the moment-than the England and Wales Cricket Board is about proposals here, and it is possible that some 2020 events will be listed in the Australian review. In Australia, people argue that English cricket is an example of why the country needs to retain its list. Equally, in Germany, France, Ireland, Belgium and Italy, the national football team's qualifying matches are currently listed.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/7">It is also worth remembering that free-to-air broadcasters do not get their rights for free when it comes to the A list; they have to pay a fair and reasonable price. The rights holders-the ECB or anyone else-can appeal to the regulator, Ofcom, to set that price, which is partly based on past prices and the state of the market. Most governing bodies recognise the need for balance and share their rights between free-to-air and subscription broadcasters. Rugby league famously does that and has seen a continuing increase in its income over the years, sharing coverage between the BBC and Sky. Rugby union and golf also adopt such an approach. The ECB has adopted a rather different approach in recent years, but it has been controversial in English cricket, and indeed was one of the major issues dividing the counties the last two times that Giles Clarke stood for election to the ECB.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/8">I would argue that in the national interest, some limited intervention is necessary, and I look to the views of Andrew Strauss, the England cricket captain. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-20">20 November 2009</phrase>, <i>The Times</i> reported that Strauss had declined to support the ECB's campaign to continue being allowed to sell broadcast coverage of the Ashes to the highest bidder in the free market:</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The England captain preferred to cite both sides of the argument rather than explicitly back his employer, which has claimed that returning live Ashes matches to terrestrial broadcasters from 2016 would lead to significant cuts in funding...Strauss described the case for a return to terrestrial television as 'very important and very valid', adding: 'If more people watching a cricket match means that more people play, that is a huge benefit, but if you have more funding to allow people to play the game then that is important as well. There are two sides.'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/10">That statement was brave and important.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.214.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" speakername="Robert Wilson" colnum="214"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0008.htm#10011238000613">
	<p pid="a.214.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely powerful case. Does he agree that coverage of the home Ashes could be shown on both free-to-air and pay TV, as in South Africa?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.214.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" speakername="John Grogan" colnum="214"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0008.htm#10011238000614">
	<p pid="a.214.1/1">Absolutely, and the listed events regime allows that to happen. For the Ashes, we are in effect talking about 2017 because the 2013 series has already been sold. However, that seems to be the obvious solution, and there are precedents for it. This year and in previous years, Sky and the BBC have both shown the FA cup final live, and in the future that will be true of ESPN and ITV. In all cases, only some of the rights of any governing body will be listed. For cricket, the vast majority of test matches, one-day internationals and so on will be up for sale to the highest bidder, should the ECB so wish. It is unlikely that Sky and other subscription broadcasters will walk away from the table, particularly if there is the potential to simulcast the Ashes series in 2017, which is some way away.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/2">There are also the national football teams of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is a great pity that until Scotland qualifies for a European championship or a World cup, someone could grow up in Scotland and never see their national team on free-to-air TV. It is important to recognise that the Davies proposals suggest that qualifying matches be listed only in the home nation concerned. Football authorities in Scotland would still be able to sell the rights to the rest of the United Kingdom, and there would probably be competitive bidding, particularly between the BBC and ITV. With digital expansion, many more channels will meet the qualifying criteria of availability to 95 per cent. of the population. Once we have digital switchover, instead of five channels qualifying for those criteria, there could well be 10, 15 or more.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/3">Most governing bodies receive public money from the lottery and the Sports Council to fund grass-roots sport and other activities. That is explicitly recognised in the Government's consultation document, which states that</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/4" class="indent">&quot;the Secretary of State...considers that a further factor that may be of relevance in the balance, is the extent...to which the sport in question has received direct or indirect public funding&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/5">Between 2009 and 2013, Sport England will give &#163;37 million to cricket and &#163;30 million to rugby union. The best figure I could find regarding how much money is raised for grass-roots cricket from broadcasting contracts was around &#163;13 million. That figure came from a study by Deloitte for BSkyB. The amounts of money that go in from broadcasting and from the public purse are not dissimilar. It is worth remembering that &#163;1.5 million of national lottery funding was invested in the new Welsh rugby union centre of excellence, which opened last month. SportScotland gave the Scottish Football Association &#163;1.4 million last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/6">If the governing bodies believe in an entirely free market approach, why are they receiving public money? They cannot have it both ways. If hard-pressed taxpayers and lottery players are funding sports, should they not be able to see some of the events on free-to-air TV?</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/7">There is another interesting phrase in the Government's consultation document:</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The Secretary of State also provisionally considers that a properly managed sporting body is likely to wish to have a diversified income source, in particular because of the recognised vagaries of broadcasting revenue streams.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/9">According to Giles Clarke's written evidence to the Davies committee, 80 per cent. of cricket's income is from broadcasting revenue, double that of the next nearest sport, which I think is Scottish football where about 40 per cent. of income is derived from broadcasting. Clearly, there is an imbalance, which cricket needs to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/10">There is some controversy over the figures for participation in cricket. Cricketing bodies argue that participation has increased in recent years, but research for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Sport England suggests that if there has been an increase it has been marginal compared with sports such as cycling and athletics, which have much greater exposure on free-to-air TV.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/11">It is likely that sponsorship will be higher with free-to-air exposure. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-13">13 October 2009</phrase>, <i>The Times</i> reported that Kevin Peake, the marketing director of npower, had hinted that having the Ashes back on free-to-air television might persuade the company to continue sponsorship beyond its present deal, which expires in 2011. A recent report from Deloitte, commissioned by BSkyB and entitled, &quot;The impact of broadcasting on sports in the UK&quot;, noted that for rugby union, a key benefit of the Six Nations free-to-air strategy was the impact on sponsorship revenue. Exposure on free-to-air TV could have various effects.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/12">I have a number of further points. I urge the Government to make a decision swiftly after the consultation period ends in March. As I understand it, this is an area where a Minister can decide; there is no further parliamentary process and it is something that can be wrapped up before the general election. I hope that free-to-air broadcasters look carefully at the new list, if there is one. There is a responsibility, particularly on the BBC, to look at the list that Parliament has decided on and do everything possible to ensure that events on the A-list are shown on free-to-air TV.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/13">Finally, the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, always told the parliamentary Labour party that it was through the little things in government that a difference could be made. This is not a matter of life and death, or peace and war, but-as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> pointed out-it affects the quality of life of many people. Many people have spent their lives volunteering as coaches, for example, in a variety of sports, and they would like to spend their retirement being able to watch the great national and international events on television. It is impossible to calculate the impact of sport on young people in inspiring them to take up cricket, rugby, football or athletics. When the Olympic games are on free-to-air TV-I am told that the BBC wants to show every event live in 2012-there will be a huge impact on the next generation in encouraging them to take up sport. That impact cannot be measured, but we know that it is of tremendous value to our society.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.216.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1412" speakername="Sin Simon" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport"  colnum="216"  time="012:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0009.htm#10011238000615">
	<p pid="a.216.0/1">Let me congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate and on his erudite and insightful tour d'horizon from which, I am sure hon. Members will agree, we have all profited. He has been a dogged campaigner on this issue for many years, and he now describes himself as chipper, which will please us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/2">I start by reaffirming the Government's belief in ensuring that as many people as possible have the opportunity to enjoy our great sporting events via free-to-air television. We all recognise that sport is a key element in our national identity and part of the glue that binds us together as a society. The excitement and interest generated by major sports events is something that little else on television can match.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/3">The decision to review the listed events regime, to ensure that it was fit for purpose, was based on a number of factors. The Government recognised, as my hon. Friend said, that with the development of digital technologies and other changes to the broadcasting environment, viewers now have a much greater choice of channels, as well as a greater range of different ways to view sporting events. Viewers' attitudes to subscription TV and the consumption of premium content, especially sports coverage, have changed, and to take account of those developments we set up an independent panel to review the regime and make recommendations to the Secretary of State. The panel, under the chairmanship of David Davies, was asked to review three areas: the principle of a list; the criteria against which listed events could be chosen; and the content of any list.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/4">As part of its work, the panel recognised the importance of ensuring that its recommendations were informed by as wide as possible a range of views. It undertook a public consultation from <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-08">8 April</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-20">20 July</phrase>. At the same time it wrote to 187 sporting, media, broadcasting, viewer and other organisations-domestic and international -inviting them all to participate in the consultation exercise. It consulted very widely; Davies did not just make it up. Some of the organisations had meetings with panel members; others made submissions in writing. The panel visited the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly and arranged a joint meeting of the all-party groups on media and sports to hear Members' views directly. The panel also commissioned quantitative and qualitative research to ascertain broader public views, and an initial analysis of viewing patterns, as well as a general analysis of the impact of listing on the sale of sports broadcast rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/5">The panel reached clear conclusions as to the criterion that should be used in determining whether an event was capable of being listed-the major event test. It should be an event that</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/6" class="indent">&quot;has a special resonance and not simply a significance to those who ordinarily follow the sport concerned&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/7">Such an event is likely to be a pre-eminent national or international event in sport or to involve the national team or national representatives, and is likely in any event to command a large television audience. The panel identified a number of events that it felt passed the test, as set out in the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/8">In response to the report, the Secretary of State has provisionally concluded that he should accept the panel's recommendations on the retention of a list in principle and the use of the major event test to draw up the list. He has also provisionally accepted the events that have been identified as passing the major event test. The Secretary of State considers that the panel has come forward with a persuasive set of reasons for retaining the listing system. He provisionally agrees that as many members of the UK population as possible should have access to the important sporting events in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/9">The media landscape is changing fast, but it appears from the material before the panel that for varying reasons a significant proportion of the population do not have access to pay television and that although some can see such events in other ways-perhaps, expensively, at the pub-a significant proportion of the population do not do so and will not in future. The Secretary of State is particularly concerned about the inability of those on low incomes to access subscriber services upon which such events might otherwise be broadcast. He considers it important that the UK and its individual nations should be able to promote their individual sense of identity. One way in which that is achieved is through our all being able to join together in enjoyment and celebration of such important events. However, it is important to recognise that the panel expressed no view about, and took no account of, the impact or consequences of listing on a sport or sporting body, stating that it considered that such matters were for the Secretary of State to take into account. My hon. Friend the Member for Selby put forward, interestingly and at some length, arguments to offset those that he anticipates will be put by some sporting bodies whose events have been added to the list.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/10">The Secretary of State's provisional conclusion is that, in making any final decision on which events should be listed, he should take account of the possible impacts that such listing might have on the sport in question and on those broadcasters affected. For that reason he considers that the major event test should be accompanied by an impact assessment. That will involve his considering any matters relating to the impacts of listing that are drawn to his attention, and then assessing whether listing would have a disproportionate impact on the interests of those adversely affected by it. Having reached his provisional conclusions the Secretary of State is required to carry out a statutory consultation with the broadcasting authorities and any affected rights holders, in line with the Broadcasting Act 1996, before announcing his final decision. The principal factors that the Secretary of State has provisionally concluded should be taken into account are set out in the consultation document, which was published last month.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/11">It is important to emphasise that the Secretary of State has provisionally arrived at the conclusion that he will accept the recommendations in the report, but that he will consider the implications for sporting bodies and grass-roots sport, and has not reached any final views. He is still considering the issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.3/1">The impact assessment is the consultation process. As part of that process the impact on sports and their revenues and on grass-roots sport is to be considered now, given that it was not considered as part of the Davies review. All of that will inform the firm conclusions that the Secretary of State will seek to reach- having provisionally announced the conclusions that he has already come to-as soon as possible after the consultation closes at the beginning of March.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.3/2">As hon. Members will know, listing does not guarantee that an event will be shown live on free-to-air television. Similarly, excluding an event from the list does not necessarily mean that it will be lost to free-to-air television. We await the Secretary of State's final views. We must not, and I cannot, pre-empt the consultation. Hon. Members, and my hon. Friend the Member for Selby in particular, made good points and expressed strong views in the debate. The process remains open for interested parties to make input on any aspect of the consultation, particularly on the impact on finances and grass-roots sport. It is open to anyone, so I encourage anybody with a strong view to put in their views before <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-05">5 March</phrase>. I reiterate the Secretary of State's firm intention to reach a final conclusion swiftly after that.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood, and I am grateful for the opportunity for this debate. I am pleased to see the Minister. I admire him greatly for his conscientiousness in his task, and for his care and concern about the issues for which he is responsible.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/2">I am also pleased that other hon. Members can be here to support the debate, and shall be happy to give way liberally to anyone who wants to intervene, and, subject to your consent, Mr. Hood, and the Minister's, to cede time to hon. Members who want to contribute. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" name="Meg Munn">The hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)</phrase> returned from Kurdistan only this weekend, and I am sure that hon. Members will be keen to hear what she has to report to the House. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on the Kurdistan region in Iraq, will also want to contribute to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/3">I place on the record my appreciation of Ibrahim Dogus, who has lobbied me since I was a London assembly member in 2000 on Kurdistan and the interests of the Kurdish community here. We have a very large Kurdish community in Croydon. I would also like to place on record my thanks to Akif Wan, of the Peace in Kurdistan campaign, for all the briefings that he has given me over the years.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/4">In the debate today, we have to canter through the issues, in terms of Kurdistan sitting abreast of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran. However, I will try to touch on those concerns one after the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/5">In many ways, as British people we have some responsibility in the area, bearing in mind both the failure of the commitments we made, up to and including the treaty of S&#232;vres, and the 1946 expulsion of the Kurdistan Democratic party from Iraq by Britain after the second world war. However, that should not distract us from the fact that we have vital interests, separate from those of Kurdish people, in seeing proper peace and good trade in Kurdistan, not only because we are suffering from the difficulties of a clash of civilisations but because the region is of high importance to us in terms of our own energy security and that of our European partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/6">Of course, those considerations should not blind us to the importance of continuing to support the Government's policy of being strongly opposed to any terrorist outrages by the PKK-the Kurdistan Workers party. However, I think we can be very positive about the approach that Kurds take. In the main, Kurds are secularist and have a very good understanding of the geopolitics of why it is not in the interests of the west to see an independent Kurdistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/7">We need to recognise that the Kurdish community in London is a very large contributor to the city. There are 250,000 Kurds in London and the rest of the UK. Obviously that is a smaller number than the 2 million who are in Istanbul, but none the less one can recognise the important part the Kurdish diaspora plays in Turkey.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/8">Turkey is a country that, in many ways, is a bulwark for security in Asia Minor. It is an ally of ours that has one of the biggest armies in NATO, an economy that is dynamic and a population with a very young age profile. Therefore it would make a worthy entrant to the European Union. Nevertheless, it is important for us that any discussions about EU membership for Turkey should take the best possible advantage of any leverage to secure the proper treatment of Kurdish minorities, particularly defence of Kurdish people's right to use their own language fully-not only within Turkish courts, as is currently allowed, but within political discourse in Turkey-and most importantly in terms of human rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate in the House. However, does he share my disappointment that the EU does not appear to have effectively used its influence to get Turkey to change its attitude to human rights generally and to the Kurds in particular? I am sure that he will acknowledge our debt to Kurds and Kurdistan, and that the UK has a historical duty to those people and that region. This country has betrayed those people for more than a hundred years, not least in failing to defend them properly during the atrocities-</p>

	<p pid="a.221.2/1">I am very grateful, Mr. Hood, for the comments of my hon. Friend. Britain has a great historical responsibility to the Kurds and it is incumbent upon the Government and indeed upon Members of the European Parliament to continue to be active in ensuring that further discussions on Turkish EU membership are used to the best advantage.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.3/1">In Birmingham, there are quite a few Sorani Kurds. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the lessons to learn in terms of protecting all sorts of minorities-be it Turkmen minorities within Kurdish areas or otherwise-are on the ways to avoid disputes developing into more volatile disputes involving terrorism?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.221.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" speakername="Andrew Pelling" colnum="221"  time="012:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0009.htm#10011238000625">
	<p pid="a.221.4/1">I know that the hon. Gentleman has an important Sorani Kurd community in his constituency. In that regard, it is interesting to note how the Kurdistan Regional Government, or KRG, area has thrived, which shows, as he said, the importance of combating the temptation to go down the terrorist route. What is perhaps encouraging is that the Kurdish community has quite often acted in a very responsible way despite having many reasons for feeling antagonised.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/2">Obviously we are going through one of those periodic bands of Kurdish political parties that reflect the rather complicated army/democracy or non-secularist/secularist Ataturk traditions in Turkey. However, it is entirely unhelpful that we have ended up in a situation where the DTP-the Democratic Society party-is again facing the prospect of being banned.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/3">There are 3,000 Kurdish children in detention in Turkey and there has been a significant number of arrests of Kurdish politicians. For example, there has been the arrest of Ahmet Turk, whose surname is itself an irony, because it shows how someone's own language or nomenclature cannot be used, and the arrest of Aysel Tujluk. That situation means that there is a clever political arrangement whereby the number of Kurdish representatives in the Turkish Parliament is taken below the required 20, such that the party cannot operate any more.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/4">When one thinks about the violent forced evacuations of Kurdish villages that took place in the 1990s, one can understand why Kurds might feel the temptation to be very aggressive on these issues. However, it is encouraging that Ocalan, who has been put into even worse solitary confinement conditions, is urging his colleagues to go down the constitutional route. It is also encouraging-although there may be a repeat of previous experience-that a new party, the Peace and Democracy party, will be launched on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-01">1 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/5">There are obviously many implications for the whole region. Many of us also have Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot minorities in our communities. I was very pleased to meet the Greek Cypriot Democratic Rally leader, Nicos Anastasiades, because obviously there is also an issue in relation to Cyprus. It is encouraging that, in many ways, Turkish Cypriots are now moving closer.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/6">We should encourage Turkey to take a very positive view of tolerance of Kurdish language rights and other rights. Furthermore, through the European Union, we should encourage Turkey to respond to the issue raised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>. The EU should say that a condition of EU membership for Turkey must be the proper economic development of south-east Anatolia, so that the inequalities that exist there are dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/7">Let me now move on to talk about other countries. In Iran, it is disturbing that although Kurdish people are very willing to work with the state, there is arbitrary arrest and in reality we face the situation of judicial killing. One such judicial killing has already taken place and 12 other Kurds are on death row. In Syria, quite clearly there is much arbitrary detention and torture.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/8">As for the KRG, it is a story of great success. One of the reasons for that is the visionary way that John Major acted, to ensure that there was no bombing of northern Iraq after the first Gulf war. However, there are still many important issues and concerns. One is where the writ of Kurdistan runs to. Does it include some areas around Mosul-not Mosul itself, but some villages around Mosul that in reality are more Kurdish than Iraqi? There is also the important issue of having a proper oil revenue-sharing agreement, so that there is the best possible investment in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/9">As a country, we have a real interest in and concern about the amount of trade that we can do in the area. To some extent, we are being overtaken by the Germans, the Scandinavians, the Italians and, of course, the Turks. In many ways, many organisations that invest in Kurdistan are actually partially owned by parts of the Turkish army. We have a great interest in ensuring that we do our best. I am sure that good work is done by the embassy representation in Erbil, but there might be advantage in having Department of Trade and Industry representation there as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/10">I have one particular interest. It is not a personal interest, but I have a long-standing friend with an interest in the provision of a direct air link between London and Erbil. Currently, the journey is expensive and is normally made via Vienna. I understand that the UK is not happy to have direct flights back due to security issues, but the issue could be resolved by making greater provision for air marshals on such trips and by investing properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/11">There have been great controversies in the House about the KRG's approach to minorities. Early-day motions have been tabled about the treatment of Christians and the prospective expulsion of Christians and Assyrians from the KRG area. That might be due partly to the fact that there has been a great deal of confusion about property rights post-Saddam. I would be interested to know the Government's view. To what extent do such issues exist within the KRG area? The Bishop of Croydon has certainly spoken out on the persecution of Christians there as an issue of concern. However, we must not let that blind us to the fact that the KRG has been especially successful, although we must be worried about further political shootings as a result of the tensions arising from the elections this March.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/12">What are the Government doing to persuade Turkey of the poor merits of banning the DTP? What pressure are they bringing through the European Union to ensure that if Turkey is given entry, the rights of Kurds will be protected fully? Would we consider observing elections properly, both in Kurdistan in Iraq and in Turkey, to ensure that Kurdish rights are protected fully? What can be done to promote our trade interests in Kurdistan and encourage direct flights to Erbil? Finally and perhaps most controversially, what does the Minister think would be the advantages of pushing for the release of Ocalan so that we could have a constitutional rather than terrorist-based settlement for Kurds within Turkey?</p>

	<p pid="a.223.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" name="Andrew Pelling">the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling)</phrase> on securing this debate and thank him warmly for his generosity in allowing me to make a short contribution. I chair the all-party parliamentary group on the Kurdistan region in Iraq, and, as he said, I have just returned from my first visit there.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/2">The year 2003 brought liberation for the people of the Kurdistan region of Iraq, who made up the only Iraqi force that fought alongside British and American forces. However, I believe that the UK has overlooked Kurdistan, the most secure and successful region of Iraq, undermining the whole country's renewal and hindering British commercial and political objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/3">Politicians and businesspeople whom I met were mystified and disappointed by the British Government's behaviour since liberation. As the Prime Minister said to me, Kurdistan is the success of UK policy, yet the policy has not involved equal treatment for all the people of Iraq. The UK has been reluctant to develop our relationship with the Kurdish region for fear of causing problems with the majority Arab population, and its continuing improvement and success in the development of democracy and the security of the people is not being embraced as a model for the wider region. Instead, the British Government's failure to update their understanding of the security situation in the region has damaged British interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/4">Trade must be a greater priority in Iraqi Kurdistan. Companies investing there can later expand their operations to the south. For many British and other companies, Kurdistan is now the only part of Iraq that is truly open for business; the rest is only partially open, although I hope that it will catch up with Kurdistan as soon as possible. Kurdistan's political, civic and business leaders have long appealed for such links. They appreciate the quality and expertise of British companies and institutions and wish to be our political and security ally.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/5">As the hon. Gentleman said, we have fallen behind a number of other European countries. There has been no official UK ministerial trade mission. The trade missions that do go to the region have no support from UK Trade and Investment. The embassy office in Kurdistan's capital, Erbil, is understaffed compared with other missions and marooned many miles from the capital, although staff recognise the opportunities and do their best to deal with the inadequacies of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/6">Many people mentioned the problem of visas. Chambers of commerce members whom we met told us that business people from Kurdistan travel regularly-sometimes twice a month-to other parts of Europe, but that travel to Britain is difficult and that obtaining a visa involves going to Amman.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/7">The hon. Gentleman discussed the issue of Christians in the region. As a practising Methodist and chair of the all-party Methodist group, I focused in depth on the position of Christians in the Kurdistan region, as many have fled from the rest of Iraq. I had detailed discussions with the Bishop of Erbil and Mr. Sarkis Aghajan Mamendu, a former deputy Prime Minister who has led the efforts to protect and promote the interests of Christians in the Kurdistan region. Both men told us that the Kurdistan regional government take an active role in not only ensuring the rights of Christians but offering a safe haven to Christians fleeing persecution from other regions of Iraq. I commend the region for its generosity in welcoming Christians and protecting their position.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.0/1">I have been to the region on a number of occasions and seen for myself the efforts of the government to discriminate in favour of Christians in order to show their tolerance, such as digging water wells, rebuilding villages and schools and allowing churches. There are problems, but the government are making great strides and efforts to tolerate Christianity.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.224.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" colnum="224"  time="013:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0010.htm#10011238000628">
	<p pid="a.224.1/1">Indeed, I would say support Christians, not just tolerate them.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/2">I was impressed by the Parliament's interest in developing democracy. With the help of Gary Kent, who supports the all-party group, I gave two seminars to more than half the MPs from the Kurdistan Parliament. They want to develop their understanding of democracy further. One main concern in Kurdistan is the need for a census. No accurate census has been taken for the best part of 50 years. It is important for all aspects of public policy planning, but it is also crucial to fairness in the allocation of seats in the Iraqi Parliament. There is concern that the forthcoming census will not be done fairly, so technical help from Britain is requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/3">Finally, on women's rights, the leaders in Kurdistan have taken a brave stance on problems common in the middle east, such as so-called honour killings and female circumcision. I acknowledge their leadership in such matters. I also met members of the women's committee of the Sulaymaniyah provincial council. They have made great advances in establishing the concerns of female council employees, challenging sexual harassment and creating a cr&#232;che. Their practical radicalism stands out in the middle east, where women's interests are normally way down the political agenda. I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend's response to those issues.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.225.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" speakername="Chris Bryant" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe"  colnum="225"  time="013:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0010.htm#10011238000629">
	<p pid="a.225.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" name="Andrew Pelling">the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling)</phrase> wholeheartedly on securing this debate on a subject that has not been debated for many years, except as a subsidiary to other debates on Turkey, Iraq or Iran. The issue is an important one that probably needs more than half an hour to amplify.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/2">I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" name="Meg Munn">the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)</phrase>, who knows many of the ins and outs of the issues because she used to be in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and was much respected when she was there. I know that she does a good job with her all-party parliamentary group, as does my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1525" name="Ann Clwyd">the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)</phrase>. Between the two of them, they have managed to establish a better parliamentary relationship than we have with many countries within the European Union. I pay tribute to them because that is of considerable benefit to the region and it informs politics in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/3">There are clear UK interests in the region. First, as has been mentioned, many UK companies are active in Iraq, Turkey and Iran and many companies would like to be more active. We would like to be able to provide more assistance. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central made a good point about the need to beef-up our effort in terms of UK Trade and Investment and our presence. We do not want all the business to be hoovered up by the Germans or French.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/4">Secondly, there is a clear UK interest because we want peace and stability in the region. The contribution many young men and women in our armed forces made in Iraq was important to this country's stability and security. We want to ensure that we do not have to go back to Iraq. Ensuring that there is stability and long-term economic prosperity in the Kurdish region of Iraq is therefore vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/5">I will go through the countries that have large Kurdish communities. The hon. Gentleman referred to Turkey. He is right that we want to see Turkey as a member of the European Union. We think that that would be good for the UK. It would be good to have a secular, Muslim country in the European Union and we do not believe that Europe should be a Christian club, as some people have called it. Incidentally, that forgets the history of countries such as Spain, where Moorish influence is significant in thought, culture and architecture. We also believe that Turkey's membership of the European Union will be vital because it is probably the Asian tiger on our doorstep. It is also a country that helps to guarantee our security against terrorism and international criminality, and our energy security. It is therefore vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/6">We do not want Turkey to join the European Union at any cost. It will not be able to do so unless it complies fully with the acquis communautaire. There is a great deal of work it still has to do on human rights and a range of elements of its legal system to ensure that the Turkey that joins the European Union can be a proper member of it. A line from a song in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; says:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Marry the man today and change his ways tomorrow.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/8">That cannot be done with a country that is applying to join the European Union. We must be sure that the changes have been introduced before it joins.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/9">The Kurdish issue in Turkey is one of the key issues that must be resolved effectively before Turkey can accede to the Union. There are other issues such as Cyprus, but the Kurdish issue is key. We were concerned when, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-11">11 December</phrase>, the Turkish constitutional court closed the DTP, the Kurdish nationalist party. That is why we supported strongly the European Union statement that expressed concern. Things have moved on since then. Ahmet Turk said that the 19 DTP MPs will return to Parliament as BDP-Peace and Democracy party-members. We welcome Interior Minister Atalay's remarks about moving towards greater democracy and resolving the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/10">We support the tackling of the terrorist threat posed by the PKK. However, it must be possible to distinguish between nationalism that depends on the use of violence and terrorism and believes in violent overthrow and the legitimate political aspirations of individuals who want to see a different political outlook. I am visiting Istanbul this weekend and will have meetings with my opposite number, Mr. Bagis. I look forward to having discussions with him on these issues and about Turkey's eventual accession to the European Union, which I am hopeful about.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/11">The hon. Member for Croydon, Central and my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley rightly raised Iran. The human rights situation in Iran is horrific, not only for Kurds, but for many other people. Not only are we wholeheartedly opposed to the use of the death penalty, but the judicial process that leads to its use in Iran is completely flawed. The death penalty is still used for minors, despite Iran being signed up to international obligations that prohibit its use for under-18s. That shows that even though Iran has signed up, it is not complying, and that it has a casual disregard for human rights. We have raised that point on at least 20 occasions, specifically in relation to the situation faced by Kurds in Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/12">On Iraq, the Kurdistan Regional Government is established in the constitution. Last March saw the successful visit of Massoud Barzani to this and other EU countries. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley and my right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley have had regular conversations with the KRG. There has been significant progress on a great number of issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/13">One issue on which there is progress to be made is female genital mutilation. The German non-governmental organisation WADI-Association for Crisis Assistance and Development Co-operation-reckons between 75 and 85 per cent. of women are subjected to female genital mutilation. We take that seriously and want to address the problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley mentioned the problem. The KRG has said that it wants to hold a conference soon on that issue and we are keen that that should happen swiftly. We stand ready to assist in making it happen. There are deeply entrenched cultural views that must be addressed; it is a long-term issue that obviously cannot be changed overnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/14">My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley raised the issue of visas. People in the Kurdistan region of Iraq undoubtedly face significant difficulty in doing business and travelling. I am certain that that harms the ability of people in the UK to do business. As I am sure she will acknowledge, there are significant security issues over whether we will provide a full visa service in Iraq. We are looking at whether we can bring about changes, but I cannot announce anything now.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/15">The hon. Member for Croydon, Central raised the issue of elections and whether we will be monitoring them closely. He was right. We are of course delighted that there have been successful rounds of elections in Iraq. Many people thought that that would never happen. Indeed, some people in the UK thought it was inappropriate for us to try to bring about a democratic Iraq. I disagree with those people. It has been a pleasure to see that the effort of British troops in Iraq has secured what have generally been reckoned to be decent rounds of elections, although they have not by any means been perfect.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/16">The hon. Gentleman is right that we must ensure that the conditions of elections are improved. We will monitor that closely through our embassy and consular staff in Baghdad, Erbil and Basra. We want to report back on that. I am sure that the all-party parliamentary group will take a keen interest, as will the hon. Gentleman, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley and my right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/17">Abdullah Ocalan's imprisonment in Turkey has been raised. I was not sure whether the hon. Member for Croydon, Central was calling for him to be released. That is a matter for the Turkish authorities. However, the state of Turkish prisons and the access available for international visitors are of international concern. Although in general the conditions in Turkish prisons are far from ideal, they have improved somewhat in recent years. We want to see further improvements, and I will raise that with my counterpart when I am in Istanbul this weekend.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.1/1">May I say at the outset how pleased I am to have obtained the opportunity to initiate this debate and how pleased I am to see that the Minister is here to reply to it?</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/2">My motivation in seeking the debate is a series of concerns that have been put to me by a number of local radio operators, particularly by the Shetland Islands Broadcasting Company, which operates in Shetland. In the Northern Isles, we have the benefit of two very effective commercial local radio stations and two BBC radio stations-Super Station Orkney, BBC Radio Orkney and BBC Radio Shetland are the other three. I mention that because for communities with a strong sense of identity, the existence and operation of local radio stations is, as is the case in many communities, an important part of our local ethos and identity. We should be careful before we make changes that may in some way operate to the disadvantage of those stations. Recently, there has been a trend for a diminution in the scope available to local newspapers, and it would be unfortunate if local radio stations were to go the same way.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/3">I want to talk about the future of local radio in the broadest sense, but I will be talking mostly about the switchover to digital radio. As we are also discussing the future of local radio, I should say that if local radio is to have a future, government at all levels will have to be a bit more careful about how they use it. When I was preparing for the debate, SIBC brought to my attention the decision of the Scottish Government to let the radio advertising for their Christmas drink-drive programme through the big boys. As a consequence, SIBC-a very small, genuinely local, independent service, which is the only commercial service that would carry the adverts in Shetland-was excluded from such coverage. That sort of sloppy thinking in government will have to change if local radio is to have a future.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a number of these small independent radio stations, such a Time FM in my own area, serve a niche market that is perhaps not served by their bigger neighbours-some of the BBC stations-and that they will need financial help to try to accommodate the new technology?</p>

	<p pid="a.228.3/1">Yes, I do think that-although I do not necessarily agree with the point about financial help, which is a different matter altogether. The hon. Gentleman is right to mention the nature of local radio stations. I should point out that several hon. Members are present for this debate in Westminster Hall today, which reflects the fact that the subject excites a wide-range of interest. Had I realised how wide the interest was when I applied for the debate, I would have probably applied for a 90 rather than a 30-minute debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.0/1">In a moment. I will accommodate as many of my hon. Friends-indeed, hon. Members from all parties-as I possibly can. The number of briefings that have come my way have borne testimony to the wide-range of interest there is in the issue. I realise that the matter is still very much a work in progress for the Government, but the nature and range of the briefings that I have received suggest that there is still a lot of work to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/2">If hon. Members will indulge me for a moment, a briefing I have not read is the one that came my way from Ofcom. I had a quick flick through it and reached the back page, which, for the benefit of the record, has a map of most of the United Kingdom on it-in fact, the map includes the Isle of Man, which is not even part of the United Kingdom. The only parts of the United Kingdom that the map does not include are the islands of Orkney and Shetland. I have a suspicion that somebody at Ofcom might pick up the <i>Hansard</i> report of this debate and read it, so may I just place on the record that if Ofcom wants me to read its briefing, it will have to show my constituency on its maps? If Ofcom cannot be bothered to do that, I will not be bothered to read its briefing.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.1/1">My hon. Friend has initiated an important debate. Local radio stations have grown up and spread quite rapidly. If digitalisation leads to the closure of those stations, it would be a retrograde step. Would it also be true to say that the BBC has not done all that it could have in relation to local radio in areas such as north-east Scotland? That area has the same population as Cornwall, which gets a 24/7 service, but it gets five and 10-minute opt-outs, which is a long way short of what the BBC should be providing.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.2/1">Indeed. I was a constituent of my right hon. Friend for long enough to know the truth of that. Certainly, the BBC is very patchy across the country. We are well served in the Northern Isles for the population that we have, but as he says, the situation in north-east Scotland is very different.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.4/1">No, I am not saying that. The purpose of today's debate is to start the discussion and ask a wide range of questions that have not been properly ventilated. If I may say so, hitherto this has been something of an anorak's debate, but as the White Paper &quot;Digital Britain&quot; comes forward, it is clear that there will be a wider interest in the matter. I have a lot of questions. I have said already that the matter is a work in progress for the Government, but clearly they have not got all the answers right yet.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.5/1">My question flows from everything that the hon. Gentleman has said.

	<p pid="a.230.2/1">I must make a little bit of progress first. I certainly do not pretend to be an expert on these matters, but over the past few months, a number of concerns about the Government's plans for local radio, as set out in the Digital Economy Bill, have been raised with me. Given the importance of local and community stations to the surrounding communities that they serve, I want to raise those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/2">I should also place on the record my acknowledgement of the efforts of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> in relation to his early-day motion 436, of which I am also a signatory. The main area of concern I want to raise is that the Government's push into digital switchover is in danger of creating what appears to be an unlevel playing field for local stations. That is a consequence of how the market in this area operates and is a recognition of the fact that although we talk very loosely about local radio, there are at least two national companies-Bauer and Global-that are providing local radio in different areas of the country. That is having its own impact on the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/3">First, I want to raise with the Minister the issue of the 2015 switchover date. The concern raised with me is that that could leave more than 120 local commercial stations and 200 community radio stations with an uncertain future in analogue. Effectively, the switchover will have created a two-tier radio industry. The &quot;Digital Britain&quot; White Paper proposed that such radio stations should form part of an ultra-local tier of radio. I understand that the decision to leave those stations on FM is driven by the limitations of the UK's current digital radio network, which apparently lacks sufficient capacity for every station in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/4">Among the concerns raised with me is that it is too expensive for local radio stations to go digital in that way. I hope the Minister will agree that it would be most unsatisfactory if local operators were forced out of business because of rising costs. I know from my own constituency experience that that is a very real danger-I am thinking of those costs associated with going digital. It is important for regions to keep a variety of local operators that often have valuable local knowledge and serve specific communities. I hope that the Minister will agree with me that it is essential that one digital platform is not advantaged at the expense of all other alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/5">I would also be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the concerns that, should radio go digital as planned, those stations left on FM will find it increasingly difficult to retain listeners, and as a consequence advertisers, due to their absence from DAB-only radios and their unavailability on alphabetised digital station lists. A combination of reduced listening and lack of digital functionality could make those stations less attractive to advertisers. It is, of course, extremely important that FM does not become irrelevant to radio, especially considering that there is unlikely ever to be a DAB multiplex in the entirety of my constituency, and indeed in many other parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/6">One proposed solution, on which I would like there to be greater debate, is DAB plus. That has been proposed to allow all radio to go digital and is being implemented in other countries around the world. The representations that have been made to me have indicated that there are two problems with DAB: first, that it has a gatekeeper, meaning that one cannot operate one's own transmitter; and secondly, that it is on double the frequency of the FM band so that, as a consequence, relays are needed for the same coverage, which will be particularly problematic in hilly areas, such as Shetland. If Ofcom had shown Shetland on the map and shown any of its topography, readers could see that we have a fair number of hills there.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/7">As a parliamentarian who represents thousands of constituents living in hilly areas, I would like some assurance from the Minister that people in such areas will not be forgotten. I hope that he will understand my concern at the comments made to me that current proposals will not provide a digital migration path for stations serving remote rural areas. I am told that AM/FM enjoys near-universal coverage of 99 per cent., but that DAB is significantly below that. I am aware that the Government have required that the DAB outreach should cover 90 per cent. of the whole population before the upgrade timetable will begin, but my suspicion is that when it comes to looking at where the remaining 10 per cent. will be, the communities of Orkney and Shetland will both feature in the list.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.0/1">I totally agree with what my hon. Friend has been saying, as will those who run my local radio station, Radio Jackie, which is very popular. They also suggested that the Government must make it absolutely clear that FM will not be switched off, that there should be a public information campaign so that the public can be reassured that it will not be switched off, and that the licensing regime should be more sensible, including much longer licences, so that those local radio stations that might have to remain on FM while the digital roll-out is sorted out have viable businesses.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.1/1">I am alarmed to admit, such is the level of detail I have acquired in the past seven days, that I am familiar with Radio Jackie, having received a briefing from those who run it. My hon. Friend's points are, for the most part, sound. As he illustrates, what we are discussing is very much a work in progress. Until, and unless, the concerns that he has outlined can be addressed satisfactorily, we should not rush head-first towards a switchover date for which there is no obviously compelling factor, technological or otherwise, other than that it was felt that that would be the only way to get things moving.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/2">Several of the briefings I have received in the past few days mentioned the possibility of being able to upgrade to DAB plus in future. Is that something the Government are looking at and, if so, why not upgrade to DAB plus from the beginning, rather than trying to bolt it on a later stage? Where is the Government's thinking in relation to DAB plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/3">I would also be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the fact that three quarters of all radio listening is still to traditional FM/AM radio. I understand that there are 120 million analogue radios in the UK, compared with 10 million DAB sets. The average purchase prise, I am told, of a DAB set is &#163;85. The Minister said in departmental questions last July that the Government were</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/4" class="indent">&quot;working with industry to come up with sets that are consistently priced at &#163;20 or less.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-07-20.563"><i>Official Report</i>, 20 July 2009; Vol. 496, c. 563</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/5">We still seem to be some way from that, so I would be interested to know what progress the Government are making.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/6">I find the question of in-car listening compelling, as I generally listen to the radio while driving around. In-car listening is currently estimated to account for about 20 per cent. of all radio listening, yet DAB is currently in fewer than 1 per cent. of all UK cars. That figure is expected to rise to just 10 per cent. by 2015. I understand that the Government have recommended that all new car radios sold in the UK by the end of 2013 should be digital, but that is just two years before the proposed switchover date. What impact will that have on the 2015 switchover date?</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/7">It was recently suggested to me that DAB is 12 times less energy efficient in its usage than FM/AM. Have the Government considered that, and what are they doing to ensure that the energy efficiency of the switchover costs will be taken properly into account?</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" name="Brian H Donohoe">The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase> asked me about the Digital Economy Bill, and I say to him genuinely that I do not oppose it. There is much in that Bill that is very positive, particularly clauses 34 and 35, and it seems to have brought with it a whole range of opportunities for local radio. It has been widely and warmly received by the industry. However, it is also fair to say that a tremendous amount of detailed work still needs to be done. I hope that the debate will allow the Minister to at least start to explain how the Government are addressing some of that important detail to ensure that switchover will operate effectively for all parts of the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.1/1">On the point about the importance the Government place on local radio, it seems that local radio stations, and certainly those in my constituency, Pirate FM and Atlantic FM, do not necessarily feel that they have had the opportunity to get their points across at an early stage.

Will smaller local radio get more access to higher-quality FM while it is still around?</p>

	<p pid="a.233.2/1">I am pretty confident that I shall address all those points in my brief remarks. Let me make some progress before I take any more questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/2">Digital switchover provides new opportunities and increases functionality. It is an essential part of securing the long-term future. The total revenue of the commercial sector has fallen from &#163;750 million in 2000 to &#163;560 million now. At the same time, transmission costs have gone up, with stations now bearing the cost of carriage on FM, DAB, online and digital TV. A market facing such rising costs and falling revenue is unsustainable and puts the health of the entire sector under threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/3">Although the path to digital may not be easy, we are convinced that it is the only route for securing the long-term future of radio, and that is a view shared by the vast majority of the sector, notwithstanding some of the reservations raised by hon. Members. Therefore, rather than a catalyst for decline, the changes set out in the Digital Economy Bill are essential to secure the survival of local radio.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/4">For the first time, we will have three distinct tiers. First, there will be a tier of national services, both commercial and BBC, with a wide range of content. It will allow the commercial sector to compete more effectively with the BBC, employ high-profile presenters and attract high value national advertising and sponsorship.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/5">Secondly, a regional or large local tier, again comprising commercial and BBC services, will provide a wide range of programmes, including regional news, traffic and travel. The tier will increase the coverage size and potential revenue of many large local stations, which in turn will increase the opportunity for linked advertising between regions so that regional commercial operators can benefit from quasi-national advertising.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/6">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland mentioned the issue of advertising being badly commissioned by the Scottish Government, which I understand. None the less, the benefits of linked advertising for regional radio can be very great if commissioned sensitively.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.2/7">Most important in the context of today's debate, there will be a tier of local and community radio stations with the specific focus of informing and reflecting the communities they serve. They will be distinct from the national and regional tiers because of the very local nature of their content and they will benefit from less competition for local advertising funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.3/2">I am not sure whether I have enough time to continue. I do, so let me be clear: we see a digital future for all radio eventually. However, with more than 50 BBC services, nearly 350 commercial stations, 200 licensed community stations, the current infrastructure will not support a move to digital for everybody. For small commercial and community stations, the coverage area and the cost of carriage of a digital multiplex are too great. That is one reason why, for the time being, we believe that those stations are best served by continuing to broadcast on FM.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.6/1">Some of the small stations have already invested in being on digital. Are they not in danger of being kicked off to FM having made that investment, and would that be a fair outcome?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.234.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1412" speakername="Sin Simon" colnum="234"  time="013:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0011.htm#10011239000095">
	<p pid="a.234.7/1">No, small stations are not in such danger. Stations that are already on digital are not in danger of being kicked off digital, but they are suffering the extra cost of running on two platforms. That is one of the reasons why we need an orderly, managed and reasonably speedy transition to an affordable single platform for as many people as can afford to be on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.7/2">The idea of stations on more than one platform is not new, which moves us to a key point that has not been widely understood-it is really important. Listeners have for decades moved between FM and medium wave, and historically also to long wave. The current generation of DAB sets has tended to make that move a rather sharp distinction, which has led to the fear that FM will end up being a second-class ghetto tier. To avoid that, we are committed to ensuring the implementation of a combined station guide, which is similar to an electronic programme guide, that will allow listeners to access all stations by name, irrespective of the platform. Future sets will simply have a list of station names. The listener will not distinguish between FM and digital stations, but will simply select the station by name. We are already working with the industry on that system and encouraging its development and introduction as quickly as possible. That is a crucial difference that has not been widely promulgated or understood. It means that people can stay on FM and the new sets can service the same market.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.7/3">Only 5 per cent. of the digital radio receivers currently on sale cannot receive FM. It is our intention that all digital receivers should be able to receive FM as well as complying with the World DMB profile, which will ensure that they can support other technologies to accommodate future changes. That crucial distinction has not been widely understood. When I explained it to people in the industry, it made a big difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.7/4">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland asked whether we could upgrade to DAB-plus from the beginning. I understand why he says that, but we are not right at the beginning. There are 10 million DAB sets out there for which people have laid out large amounts of money. The BBC completed a study into the issue last year, and concluded that, on balance, it was not worth writing off that technology because of the impact on the 10 million people who had bought DAB sets. We have said that all new technology should be DAB-plus and future compatible so that further change is future-proofed and DAB-plus is not excluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.7/5">As for the switchover date of 2015, the hon. Gentleman asked whether it was the only way we would get things moving. The Government believe that 2015 is an achievable date. The actual date that switchover happens will depend on the criteria for listenership and coverage being satisfied. We think it can be done by 2015, and that it is important to set a challenging target.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.7/6">The issue of &#163;20 sets was raised. There are already some &#163;30 sets. We have five years to go until 2015, so we remain confident that we will have &#163;20 sets by then.</p>

	<p pid="a.236.0/1">I am interested to hear what my hon. Friend says about the 2015 date. Can I take it from what he said this morning that 2015 is an aspiration to encourage the industry to move towards digital-to put their house in order and get things ready? However, if the coverage is not there in places such as the constituencies of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon.

	<p pid="a.236.1/1">As I said, we believe it is an achievable date. If more than 50 per cent. of listeners are not on digital by then, and if coverage is not similar to FM-98.5 per cent.-it will not happen on that date. If for any other unforeseen reason, we are not, as a nation, in good shape to do it by then, we will not do it. We will not switch over at an inappropriate time, but we believe that it can and should be done in 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.1/2">As time ticks on, let me say that a relatively small and cheap piece of hardware will be available to convert in-car sets to something that works in the future as well as the present.</p>
