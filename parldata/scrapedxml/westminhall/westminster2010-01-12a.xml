	<p pid="a.167.2/1">Good morning, Mrs. Humble. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue and I hope that my voice will last long enough for me to place my concerns on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/2">Simon Morgan e-mailed me just before Christmas. He told me that his father had died on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-12">12 December 2009</phrase>. Chris Morgan and his wife had lived in Alicante in Spain and were endeavouring to secure the payment of exportable benefits. Let me quote from an article written by Chris Morgan for the <i>Costa Blanca News</i> in May 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/3" class="indent">&quot;In the past, the Department of Work and Pensions...decided that anyone who was receiving a disability living allowance, carer's allowance or attendance allowance and moved to another EU country would not receive this allowance. In 2005, a 'test' case was put before the European Court of Justice...in an attempt to&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/4">secure these benefit payments for</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/5" class="indent">&quot;non-UK residents. On the 18th October 2007, the ECJ ruled against the UK but for the next 18 months the DWP procrastinated,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/6">saying</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/7" class="indent">&quot;'We are considering the legal implications of a decision by the European Court of Justice and will inform you of the outcome when the result is known.' In March this year&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/8">that is, 2009-</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/9" class="indent">&quot;we were informed by the DWP...that they were now able to look at our case. The letter went on to say, 'The ECJ have decided that certain UK disability benefits are to be considered sickness benefits. This means that they will be paid to some people who leave the UK to live in another EEA state or Switzerland.' The letter-</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/10">to Chris Morgan-</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/11" class="indent">&quot;then states, 'The decision affects Disability Living Allowance (care component only), Attendance Allowance and Carer's Allowance. These benefits can now be paid'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/12">if you satisfy</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/13" class="indent">&quot;'certain eligibility conditions'...from a letter we received at the end of April...it would appear that the DWP have shut the door on ALL those, like us, who are already living abroad because this latest letter states, 'As you had not been present...in Great Britain for 26 weeks out of the previous 52 on the day you asked us to look at the decision again, you cannot get Attendance Allowance'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/14">The late Chris Morgan, eight months ago, summed up the Government's shameful position precisely and they have been wriggling on the hook ever since.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/15">The UK/EU Disability &amp; Carers Group, based in Northern France, wrote to the Prime Minister recently, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/16" class="indent">&quot;While you are busy deciding when you are going to comply with the European Court of Justice ruling...we...have received...the following message from the wife of one our members who resides in Spain, having gone there on doctor's&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/17">orders</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/18" class="indent">&quot;with the hope that it would prolong his life-as it did.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/19">The letter says:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/20" class="indent">&quot;I am writing on behalf of my husband.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/21" class="indent">They do not think he will last until next week. We are just waiting for the Army to fly in my two sons tomorrow and then they will increase the morphine and he will not be lucid. They say he is fading fast.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/22" class="indent">The first thing he said this morning was, 'The DWP has won. I am going to die before they cough up...' The rest is unprintable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/23">My first question to the Minister is how many more UK citizens now living within the EU or in Switzerland will have to die without receiving the benefits to which they are entitled, while this Government remain in breach of the law?</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/24">The Minister is aware that this is not the first occasion on which I have raised this issue in debate. He is aware that I have tabled parliamentary questions to his Department and have challenged the Prime Minister orally on the subject at Prime Minister's Question Time.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/25">The Minister may find that he has a personal interest in this matter. Another claimant has written from his home in France to Revenue and Customs, declining to pay his tax. That claimant says:</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/26" class="indent">&quot;For over six years I have been denied the Disability Living Allowance to which I am entitled under judgement of the European Court of Justice. I am very disabled and losing my sight, yet the DWP continues to squabble with the European Commission, which is now taking&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/27">Her Majesty's Government</p>
	<p pid="a.167.2/28" class="indent">&quot;to court for failure to pay British citizens living in the EU the sickness benefits to which they are entitled under Community law. This sickness benefit would be tax-free, and exceeds the amount of my private pension, which you tax-like rubbing salt into an open wound.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.168.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" speakername="Roger Gale" colnum="168"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0001.htm#10011238000505">
	<p pid="a.168.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his kind comments and his support: he, in common with a number of Members on both sides of the House, is seeking justice for that group of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/2">As I said in the summer Adjournment debate-I will put it on the record again because it is relevant-setting aside the matter of law, which we will come to in a moment, there is an impression abroad that the people we are talking about are rich, have gone to the sun, saying, &quot;The hell with the United Kingdom&quot;, and live in splendid retirement with big yachts and lots of drink, and that they do not need any benefits. My hon. Friend has made the point that a huge number of those people have gone south for the benefit of their health, because they have respiratory or other conditions, and are eking out an existence. The other important point, to which I will return, is that they have been UK citizens and taxpayers, and many still are.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/3">The chap I mentioned a moment ago who wrote to Revenue and Customs lived-his family and all their friends still live-in the parliamentary constituency of Chatham and Aylesford. Some 50 Members of Parliament from all parties have a constituency interest in this subject, and I hope and believe that more of them will join us later this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/4">Many of the claimants have appealed against the DWP ruling. That is why they have sought the support of their UK Members of Parliament. I believe that the appeal process has been deliberately spun out by the Department. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-03">3 December 2009</phrase>, my constituent, John Hamilton, noted that the Directgov website had been revised to read:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/5" class="indent">&quot;The Department for Work and Pensions...has selected a small number of these appeals...(known as lead cases). These have been sent for tribunal hearings. The DWP has requested that similar cases are suspended until the tribunal has made a decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/6" class="indent">It is expected that the tribunal will not hear these cases until January 2010 at the earliest.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/7">That is despite the fact that on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-20">20 November 2009</phrase>, tribunal Judge Jeremy Bennett ruled:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The Tribunal Service at Sutton shall establish the availability of the parties and their representatives before listing, subject to the proviso that the hearing must take place in January 2010 unless directed otherwise by a Judge hearing this case.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/9">That was translated by Daniel Vickery, Social Security and Child Support Appeals tribunals team leader at Sutton into the following request:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/10" class="indent">&quot;Could you please provide me with your availability for January and February.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/11">My constituent, John Hamilton, has now been told to look at dates at the beginning of March, so Judge Bennett's ruling is effectively being pushed into the long grass.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/12">In the meantime, what of the grounds for the Government's continued defiance of the ECJ ruling-the so-called past presence test, requiring a claimant to have lived in the United Kingdom for 26 of the previous 52 weeks to be eligible to claim? In response to one of my earlier parliamentary questions back in June, the Minister asserted:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/13" class="indent">&quot;The Department is already complying with the European Court of Justice ruling on the payment of exportable disability benefits.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-06-22.680"><i>Official Report</i>, 22 June 2009; Vol. 494, c. 680W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/14">We now know that statement to have been ill-advised.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/15">The European Commission website states:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The European Commission has decided to take legal action against the United Kingdom for not paying certain benefits&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/17">exportable DLA, attendance allowance and carer's allowance-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/18" class="indent">&quot;to EU citizens residing abroad.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/19">Abroad in this case means within the European Union or Switzerland. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-09">9 October</phrase>, the Commission addressed a letter of formal notice to the UK authorities. The British Government had two months to respond. That is the first stage of what is called the infringement procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/20">The British Government did reply within two months-just. However, in response to my question asking for sight of that response, the Minister for Pensions and the Ageing Society said:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/21" class="indent">&quot;Correspondence between the European Commission and the member states...on such cases is generally regarded...as confidential&quot;.-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-12-08.249"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 December 2009; Vol. 502, c. 249W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/22">I should like to know why. The infringement proceedings are in the public domain; why is the Government's response not in the public domain?</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/23">The clue might be found in the tardy answer, sent on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-17">17 December</phrase>, from the Prime Minister in response to my oral question to him on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-11">11 November</phrase>. It took the man in No. 10 more than a month to be able to tell me:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/24" class="indent">&quot;We have carefully considered the application of the 26 out of 52 weeks 'past presence' requirement and believe it to be compatible with European Community law.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/25">So I guess that is what we said in reply to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/26">Perhaps it is a pity that instead of relying on his hapless junior Minister for advice, the Prime Minister did not read the Commission website for himself. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/27" class="indent">&quot;British authorities require the claimant to have spent 26 of the previous 52 weeks in the UK...This requirement goes against the European rules coordinating social security benefits and justifies the Commission's decision to start an infringement procedure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/28">Nothing could be clearer. The Government of the United Kingdom are coldly and deliberately acting outside European law. That fact is confirmed by Jackie Morin, a member of the Commission's staff, in a letter to my constituent John Hamilton dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-03">3 December 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/29">Quite simply, the Government are in breach of the law and they are disingenuously using weasel words and artifice to try to deny to sick, elderly UK citizens who have served this country-many of them in the armed forces-and who have paid their dues throughout their working lives the money owing to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/30">The situation gets worse. Overnight, I received an e-mail on the matter. Unfortunately, I have not been able to go back to the person who sent it to me to secure consent to name them, so I shall have to hand it to <i>Hansard</i> on the understanding that for the moment their anonymity is protected. The e-mail states:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/31" class="indent">&quot;In June last year (2009) I received a letter from the DWP Debt Collection for what they describe as an overpayment of &#163;3,800 for Carers Allowance...I explained...that I had not left the UK permanently in August 2004&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/32">the date to which the attempted reclaim related-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/33" class="indent">&quot;had sold our property then, rented afterwards, and the pensions department were informed of change of address, and&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/34">that I</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/35" class="indent">&quot;had taken permanent residence in France at the beginning of March 2006. The lady I spoke to said she would call me back the following week, but did not...I received no phone call. I have received no correspondence until today.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/36">That was <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-11">11 January</phrase>. The e-mail continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/37" class="indent">&quot;My allowance was stopped at that time&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/38">March 2006-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/39" class="indent">&quot;and my husband, who is 72 years old and had suffered a massive heart attack (leaving his heart working at 70 per cent.), has diabetes, diverticular disease, asthma, arthritis and...mobility problems as a result...was awarded Attendance Allowance for life in 2003. I had to leave my full time job to become a &#163;50 a week full time carer. Today I received a letter stating if I do not repay this amount&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/40">&#163;3,800-</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/41" class="indent">&quot;by the 19th of this month legal action will commence...we do not have any money, the house we live in belongs to our daughter&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/42">and we</p>
	<p pid="a.168.1/43" class="indent">&quot;have no savings. We receive &#163;160 per week which includes an allowance for me as a 'wife', and our daughter and son in law help us out financially. We do not even own a car. There is no way we can afford to repay...money, which I believe I do not owe anyway...as we are waiting for reinstatement of our benefits, which we have pursued since August 2006&quot;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.172.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="172"  time="009:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0002.htm#10011238000510">
	<p pid="a.172.0/1">I commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> on his passionate speech, in which he described many detailed and moving cases. I also congratulate him on his long track record on this matter, and on everything he has said today. He has done more than anyone to highlight what is an all too familiar tale of a Department that is willing to use every trick in the book to avoid meeting its legal and moral obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/2">The hon. Gentleman has done an excellent job in framing the issue today, and I do not wish to go over ground that he has already covered. However, it is worth re-emphasising what we are not dealing with here. As he said, this is not a tabloid-friendly tale of people from other European countries arriving in the UK and claiming benefits, as has been reported in some quarters. The men and women affected are from here and have paid their taxes here, but are having their entitlement denied to them when they need it most. As has been said, they are not wealthy people. This cannot be spun as part of a wider Government crackdown on wealthy non-doms; the 2,000 to 3,000 or so people who are affected are generally elderly and manifestly in poor health with advancing disability. They have paid their taxes and national insurance contributions and have earned the right for help with their disabilities. Many of them have moved abroad not out of choice but on medical advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/3">The reason to move to some place with warmer weather at this time of year should be self-evident-it is tempting for the younger and the able-bodied, let alone for those who have worked all their lives, such as an older couple I know who lived in Scotland. The man had worked for the Ministry of Defence until he retired at 65. When he retired he was living in MOD housing, and he and his wife decided to look around for warmer weather and a reasonably economical place to live; they decided to head for Spain. He had paid his dues all his life and had never asked for a penny, and for the Government now to put so much effort into avoiding their responsibilities to them in this way is shameful. The Government are avoiding those responsibilities, but the job of Government is to provide fair and decent treatment, particularly to the vulnerable and the disabled.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/4">When I was a local councillor, I had experience of a local authority trying to deny individuals fair treatment. When elderly people fell in the streets, the first response they would get would be from loss adjusters who would try to put them off and imply that it was their fault. Most people gave up and went away. We have a Government with a track record of denying for years a fair deal to investors in Equitable Life, despite the ruling of the ombudsman. Today we are dealing with benefits paid for by those who have worked all their lives-many of them never taking a penny. Many of them are ill and some are disabled, and they have gone to live abroad, many for health reasons. They are being denied not something that can be argued about, but an entitlement. The question has been taken up at European Court level. This is an entitlement, not something that is up for debate. The Court has decided: the Government were found guilty, and in the run-up to the election the Minister has a lot of explaining to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/5">The European Court of Justice ruling on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October 2007</phrase> was very clear. It said that those eligible and in receipt of the care component of DLA, attendance allowance and carer's allowance should be able to continue to receive those benefits when they leave the UK. That was because they were classed as &quot;sickness cash benefits&quot; under EU law. That ought to have been the final word on the issue, and the Government should have accepted the ruling and paid out the benefits. Instead, it seems that the ruling itself has been warped by the Department to create yet another loophole.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/6">We are now in the farcical position whereby claimants cannot have their benefits reinstated if they had them removed before the European Court of Justice ruling, because the Government will not admit that their decision to remove benefits before then was wrong. The ruling by the European Court was that people should be entitled to receive those benefits. People who had their benefits removed by the Government before the date of the ruling should have them reinstated immediately, with backdating and a full apology. Instead, they are told that unless they appealed within 13 months of losing their benefit, they have no grounds for their benefit to be reinstated. Essentially, if they took the Department for Work and Pensions at its word and made the mistake of assuming that the Government would act within EU law, they would miss out. Not only that, but when someone writes to the Government to request that their benefit be reinstated they have to meet the eligibility criteria of having been resident in the UK for at least 26 weeks out of the past 52. The very fact that their benefits were removed, means that they are already living abroad, so there is little prospect of meeting that criteria at any time.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/7">If I have misunderstood the situation, I invite the Minister to clarify it, but it seems as if every possible effort has been made to construct artificial loopholes and roll after roll of red tape to keep vulnerable people from receiving the help to which they are entitled. I agree with the hon. Member for North Thanet that the Minister is a decent individual, but he is trying to defend the indefensible. It seems that Ministers have been making up the rules as they go along, and that is quite deplorable behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/8">In the Minister's winding-up speech, we need to hear that this shameful saga will not be allowed to drag on into the next Parliament, although I doubt he will have much say in that matter. It is an embarrassment that the European Commission has seen no other option but to take the UK Government to court to try to force us to meet our obligations. I appeal to the Minister to save the time, expense and embarrassment of battling another court case, and to instead announce today that the benefits will be reinstated without further argument or details hidden in the small print. I would also like a firm answer on how many people stand to be affected, and how much this will cost the Government-how much money the Government have withheld from them so far. I would not be at all surprised if the money spent fighting a legal battle in the European Court of Justice, and now fighting the Commission, was not too different a sum from that being held back from UK citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/9">Will the Minister also publish a copy of the Government's response to the Commission's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-09">9 October 2009</phrase>, giving formal notice of legal proceedings? The Government have refused to make the letter public, citing confidentiality. Frankly, it is not a matter of national security. Those people-possibly thousands-missing money that is rightfully theirs deserve to know whether the Government are still attempting to wriggle out of their obligations. The Government have so often professed to be interested in fairness; it ought to be a matter of shame for Labour Members here today that the matter has still not been resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/10">People on low incomes who depend on such benefits to make ends meet do not have time for endless pontification from the DWP. As we heard this morning, some who have fought the battle have lost not only the battle but, in the meantime, their lives. I hope that today's debate will have pressed home to the Minister how far there is to go before fairness is delivered to those people. I cannot help but feel that if the time and energy spent by civil servants and the Government in devising ways to avoid their obligations had been invested in finding a fair solution, we would not be debating the issue today. I hope that this is the last time that we do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.0/1">My hon. Friend cites a figure of 20,000 claims. It is the first time that I have heard that figure. It is a phenomenal increase on the 3,000 that we believe are in the system now. Where on earth are these figures coming from? We ought to know that, too.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.1/1">The straightforward answer from my point of view is that they come from a written answer; the Minister can tell us where the numbers come from. It is difficult to reach a total. The estimated case load for disability living allowance is 20,000, but in an excellent piece of Government speak, no numbers are given for attendance allowance and carer's allowance because they equal</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/2" class="indent">&quot;less than 5,000 and therefore&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/3">equal</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/4" class="indent">&quot;zero when rounded to the nearest 10,000&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-01-28.563"><i>Official Report</i>, 28 January 2009; Vol. 487, c. 563W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/5">Only someone in government could, on seeing that 5,000 people were entitled to something, round the figure down to zero, but that is what we are told has happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/6">To put the figures in context, the &#163;50 million estimated expenditure is about 0.1 per cent. of the total spent on such benefits, while the number of people affected is about 0.4 per cent. of the number on such benefits. Those numbers do not seem that dramatic or significant, given the Department's estimates for the growth of disability living allowance, attendance allowance and carer's allowance over time. I do not understand why the Government are working so hard to limit the number of claims, and I would be grateful if the Minister filled us in on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/7">At the end of February 2009, a month after the Minister answered that question, we had the fourth written statement to Parliament. That was 10 months after the previous one and one year and four months after the original judgment. On a Government website, Ministers finally published details of the eligibility criteria for those who were not claiming disability benefits when they left the UK, but who wished to claim them when they moved abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/8">In a parliamentary written answer, the Government stated that the past presence test had been modified for those claiming from another EEA state so that they had to have been in Great Britain for not less than 26 of the previous 52 weeks. The Government also said that the test would be applied only once, on the date on which the entitlement to benefit was established. In other words, someone who claimed more than six months after having moved abroad would not be eligible for benefits. It would be helpful if the Minister told us how many people living abroad would be eligible for such benefits if the past presence test was not in place and what estimates the Department has made of the number who will be eligible over time. The Department must have done some thinking about that when deciding on its implementation of the ECJ ruling.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/9">In June last year-these things move very slowly-the Government said that they had had 2,100 requests for payment or reinstatement of awards from people living in EEA states. At that point, decisions had been made on 1,100 requests, with 1,000 pending a decision. For the benefit of hon. Members, will the Minister give us the latest information on how many requests for payment of benefits have been received and how many have been processed and had a decision made on them? Of those on which a decision has been made, how many have resulted in a benefit being awarded? In other words, how many requests for benefit have been successful?</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/10">There is another disappointing aspect to the lack of dispatch in the Department's approach. In June last year, the Government said that 1,400 people who lived abroad were in receipt of benefits, but that the DWP had only &quot;started to process&quot; claims for DLA from other states following the statement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-24">24 February</phrase>. It therefore took a year and four months after the ECJ ruling for the DWP to start processing claims. Given that we are talking largely about disabled and elderly claimants living abroad, such a period can be significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/11">The issue has obviously attracted great interest. There has been an e-petition on the No. 10 website, the media have given the subject a lot of coverage, and colleagues such as my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet have raised the issue in Parliament. As he said, the Prime Minister wrote to him saying that the 26 out of 52 weeks past presence rule was</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/12" class="indent">&quot;compatible with European Community law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/13">I have been through the ECJ judgment carefully-it is not riveting reading-and it would be helpful if the Minister set out why the Department thinks that the past presence test is compatible with the ruling, given that the European Commission does not think so and has indicated to the Department that it intends to introduce infringement proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/14">On the issue of openness and transparency, I can understand why the Minister does not want to share specific correspondence, but given the information that has not been provided to the House-my hon. Friend drew attention to it-it is disappointing to see what is available on the European Commission website. There, the Commission clearly sets out that it is taking legal action against the UK for not paying benefits and that it</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/15" class="indent">&quot;addressed a Letter of Formal Notice to the UK authorities. The British authorities have two months to respond&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/16">as my hon. Friend said. Again, the Department took the full two months, so it did not exactly act with all due speed. The Commission then sets out the benefits and the ECJ ruling. It also says that the past presence test</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/17" class="indent">&quot;goes against the European rules coordinating social security benefits and justifies the Commission's decision to start an infringement procedure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/18">We can get all that information from the Commission website, but when we ask Ministers to set out the discussions that they have had and the position that they have taken, we get rather less information. This is not something that I thought that I would say, or that we hear often in the House, but the European Commission is being more open and transparent than the British Government, and the Minister should rectify that.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/19">I have asked the Minister to set out the number of claimants abroad. Just to be clear, will he tell us what estimate the Government have made of the predicted case load and expenditure for existing claimants who move abroad, claimants who already live abroad and both sets of claimants combined? The Minister has talked about 2010-11, which is assumed to be the first full year for implementation of the ruling, but what does full implementation actually mean and why has it taken two years to reach this stage?</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/20">It is worth making one final point, which my hon. Friend and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase>, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, have touched on. One reason why the issue has attracted attention and annoyed some of those living abroad is that the same European Union rules that say that British citizens who lived here all their lives, paid taxes, contributed, worked and then moved abroad should get the benefits under discussion, also say that people who come here from other European countries are entitled to other benefits. We read all the time in the papers-the stories are not made up, but are backed by parliamentary answers-about people who have come to the UK from other European countries and have not worked here or paid taxes, but who, under EU rules, can claim benefits for themselves and their children. People find that extraordinary. We hear stories about Polish workers coming to the UK who can claim child benefit for their children, when their children do not even live here, but in Poland.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/21">The Government never seem to look for clever loopholes to avoid paying such people, who never seem to have any trouble claiming benefits. I do not suggest that they should not get those benefits-under EU rules, these things work in both directions-but it is strange that the Government have looked for every opportunity to deny money to those who have worked here, paid their taxes and gone abroad. Ministers never seem to make similar efforts with those who come to this country, and I am not saying that they should, but there is a disparity. People who come to this country never seem to have any trouble claiming money when they have not contributed. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> It is all very well the Minister sighing, but that sort of thing enables people who are against our membership of the EU to score an easy hit. It also enables those who represent, shall we say, somewhat less democratic parties in this country to stir up all sorts of feeling against those who come here from other European countries. As everyone who has spoken has made clear, people are looking for fairness-they want people to be treated fairly.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/22">Once the law is established following the ECJ ruling, it will be incumbent on the Government to implement it as soon as possible so that those who are lawfully entitled to benefits receive their lawful entitlement. On the basis of what I have said and what my hon. Friend so ably said in opening the debate, it is clear that the Government have not moved with due speed. At each stage, they appear to have taken the maximum time available to them and tested every deadline. That is not how the Government should behave, particularly when many of the British citizens involved are elderly and disabled, and when every month really matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/23">In his response, I hope that the Minister will answer the questions raised by my hon. Friend and other hon. Members who have spoken in this debate, and that he will move to resolve the issues surrounding the past presence test and its lawfulness, or otherwise, and implement the settled law with all possible speed.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble. As other hon. Members have noted, you take a personal interest in matters relating to the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/2">I begin by paying tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase>, who has been pursuing this issue for a long time. He and I have had meetings and he acts in his own doughty way but always in a manner of reasonableness, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> said. The hon. Member for North Thanet expresses his views in a forthright way, and I appreciate the manner in which he has presented his case, not only during this debate but during our meetings in the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/3">The starting point is the judgment by the European Court of Justice in October 2007, and I want to explain what that meant. In case C-299/05, the Court decided that certain benefits belonging to Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom should not be classified as special non-contributory benefits under European law, but should instead be classified as sickness benefits. That change in classification for the UK mainly affected disability benefits-the disability living allowance care component, attendance allowance and carer's allowance, which have been referred to.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/4">The relevant legislation is EC regulation 1408/71, which co-ordinates social security systems in the European Economic Area, and provides rights for workers and people who used to work and, in certain circumstances, their family members. Not all people who are eligible to receive benefits in the UK can export them if they leave the country. For instance, someone who resides in the UK can claim DLA without having a national insurance contribution record. When they leave the country, however, the UK is no longer responsible for paying them and they are not covered by the regulation. Each member state is free to decide who is entitled to be insured under its legislation, which benefits are to be granted and under what conditions, and how those benefits are calculated. Any such decisions are, of course, subject to challenge from individuals or the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/5">When people are covered by the regulation and wish to export their benefit, they are no longer required to meet normal residence and presence conditions although they are still required to meet other conditions of entitlement under domestic legislation. In the UK, that includes a past presence test, whereby an individual is required to have been present in the UK for 26 of the previous 52 weeks, on each day of the award of benefit. For people wishing to export their benefit we have modified that condition so that it is applied only on a single date, on which other conditions of entitlement can be established.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/6">The unmodified test is not new-it has always been part of the conditions of entitlement that all customers are required to meet. Unlike the state pension, for example, disability benefits are not paid because relevant national insurance contributions have been made. They are not means-tested and are paid out of general UK taxation. The purpose of the past presence test is to establish a connection with the UK that is appropriate and proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.0/7">The hon. Member for North Thanet said that we have failed to comply with the Court's decision. However, since the judgment, more than 1,700 people who have left the UK for another EEA state have been able to export their benefit. They are currently being paid while resident abroad, as long as they meet the eligibility criteria for payment. The hon. Gentleman represents a campaign group of people who previously received benefits, but who moved abroad before the date of the judgment and consequently lost them. As noted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1635" name="Peter Atkinson">the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson)</phrase>, who is no longer in the Chamber, when those people moved abroad they would have known that their benefits would cease, and would presumably have taken that into account when making their decision to leave the UK. Automatically to reinstate benefits to that group of people could be contrary to both domestic and European law. Apart from ensuring that customers satisfy all relevant domestic requirements, including whether they need help in looking after themselves or caring for others, they also need to satisfy European law on sickness benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.2/1">I shall answer those points in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/2">As I was saying before the hon. Gentleman intervened, we are providing staff. We have a presence, and are working with the Spanish authorities. That is in contrast to the characterisation the hon. Gentleman attempted to give of our interest in British people living overseas. The team on the ground offers up-to-date and accurate information on entitlements; it liaises with the Spanish authorities to resolve the most complex cases; and it also works closely with and improves co-operation with the Spanish benefits agency-the National Institute of Social Security. The team is approached on occasion by customers who are priority cases in difficult welfare and health care situations, and who need quick intervention. Recent cases have included dealing with terminally ill customers requiring medical cost advice, and giving support to vulnerable customers when benefits have not been claimed.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/3">People who cannot receive a benefit from the UK may be able to receive a benefit or service from their new state of residence. If they are integrated in their new community and satisfy relevant conditions they may be able to receive benefit and assistance from social services, just like people who come to the UK. In fact, we know that people can and do receive help. For example, there are messages on various websites. One person who left the UK in 2004 recounts that she had three strokes and has</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/4" class="indent">&quot;received excellent treatment in France&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/5">She writes on the website:</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/6" class="indent">&quot;I received a letter telling me I am considered 80% or more disabled and will receive an allowance which will pay for a home help. My husband will also get an allowance for helping me in the house with washing, dressing etc.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/7">She goes on to say that although she is happy with the help she gets in France she feels bitter that she cannot get help from the UK, as she and her husband paid into the system all their working lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/8">I am pleased that lady is receiving the help she requires. As Minister for disabled people I strongly support the provision of services for disabled people, but the imposition of conditions such as the past presence test is compatible with regulation 1408/71. If the hon. Member for Forest of Dean wishes, I shall send him details of the regulation. Conditions of entitlement under domestic legislation must be taken into consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/9">The European Commission has indeed written to us to start infringement proceedings, as hon. Members have noted today, on the basis that it considers the past presence test to be an unlawful residence test. We have replied explaining our position in detail and in particular ensuring that the Commission understands how we treat workers. We have not yet received a response.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.2/10">Members have asked why we do not agree with the Commission. The UK is not alone among member states in disagreeing from time to time with the European Commission in this and other policy areas. I am sure that hon. Members present have disagreed with it, and have called on the UK Government to argue their case. Of course, that is what we do when we disagree. However, we have never published such correspondence with the European Commission. It is important that we can have frank and robust exchanges with the Commission, and to publish them would undermine our opportunity to engage in them. That is not true just of the present case; it is the general custom and practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.185.0/1">All we are asking for is consistency. The Government appear to be perfectly prepared to pay people who now live in the Minister's constituency, or people who live in my constituency in Kent, considerable sums of money, in the form of benefits decreed by the European Union-I have no problem with that. That money is paid to people who are not resident in the United Kingdom, people who have come here and paid no taxes, no rates, no nothing, for the majority of their working lives. They may be paying taxes now, but they have not paid them for 30, 40 or 50 years. Therefore, we cannot understand why United Kingdom citizens-UK passport-holders-who are now resident in European countries are being discriminated against, and those citizens cannot understand it themselves. That is the point. It has nothing to do with racism, extremism or anything else.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.2/2">As one of the few people who have read the report from cover to cover, I regard it as one of the most thorough and thoughtful I have ever read, and a model of even-handedness. I do not say that the original motion before the Human Rights Council was even-handed because it referred only to Israel. However, the amended mandate of the mission, as agreed between the president of the committee and Richard Goldstone, was even-handed because it refers to human rights violations by all parties before, during and after the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/3">The Israelis have criticised the process and refused to give evidence. However, a panel of prominent international lawyers under Elizabeth Wilmshurst, a former Foreign Office lawyer, looked at the report and concluded that it was not invalidated by the criticism, nor by Israel's refusal to give evidence-far from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/4">I was one of the first group of MPs to enter Gaza after the military operations in February, along with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase>. We saw many of the same things and spoke to many of the same people as the mission. Our accounts were listened to, but we did not have the time or resources to cross-check every fact and assess the reliability of every witness. Richard Goldstone did so with meticulous care. I do not know whether to be surprised to discover that all the horrors that we could hardly believe were true.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/5">The first strike by an Israeli jet fighter at 11.20 on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-27">27 December</phrase> caught a group of policemen on a three-week training course doing their morning sport exercise; 48 of them were killed on the spot. There were no allegations that the police force took part in combat, yet 248 members of the Gaza police were killed. The report found that to be a violation of international humanitarian law on several counts.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/6">We saw the effects of shelling on the hospital and ambulances at al-Quds hospital. The report found that the direct attack on the hospital violated the fourth Geneva convention. We also visited the al-Wafa hospital and saw lumps of debris that were still smoking three weeks after the attack. The report confirmed that it was a white phosphorus attack that was reckless, unjustifiable and in violation of the Geneva convention.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/7">Israeli paratroopers fired mortars into the busy al-Fakhura street in Jabaliyah, killing 24 people, nearly all of whom were civilians. They landed just a few metres from a United Nations school where 1,368 civilians were sheltering. In a sober, understated way, the report said that the decision to deploy mortars in a location filled with civilians was not a choice any reasonable commander would have made. The commander would have known that it would result in civilian deaths. A missile strike on the door of the al-Maqadmah mosque in Jabaliya, where 200 men had gathered for evening prayers, killed 15 and injured 40. There was no suggestion that the mosque was used to launch rockets, store weapons or shelter combatants. That too was found to be a grave breach.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/8">The commander of the paratroop brigade in Jabaliyah, Colonel Hartzi Halevi, who has since become brigadier general, was in the news only last week when he suddenly cancelled a visit to King's college London because the British Government would not give an assurance that he would not be arrested.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/9">A condolence tent, where relatives were mourning the victims of a flechette attack was itself hit by a flechette attack. Four mourners and an ambulance driver were killed and more than 20 were injured. The report found those attacks to be wilful killing, designed to kill and maim victims and, as such, were violations of international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/10">One of the most distressing parts of our visit was talking to former inhabitants of Izbat Abd Rabbo, a village that had been razed to the ground; there was nothing left except rubble. The report confirms one incident that we heard about at the time:</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/11" class="indent">&quot;Shortly after 12.30 p.m., the inhabitants of that part of Izbat Abd Rabbo heard megaphone messages telling all residents to leave.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/12">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/13" class="indent">&quot;At about 12.50 p.m., Khalid Abd Rabbo, his wife Kawthar, their three daughters&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/14">-aged nine, five and three and their grandmother-</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/15" class="indent">&quot;stepped out of the house, all of them carrying white flags. Less than 10 metres from the door was a tank, turned towards their house. Two soldiers were sitting on top of it having a snack (one was eating chips, the other chocolate, according to one of the witnesses). The family stood still, waiting for orders from the soldiers as to what they should do, but none was given. Without warning, a third soldier emerged from inside the tank and started shooting at the three girls and then also at their grandmother.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/16">The girls and the grandmother died. Their parents</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/17" class="indent">&quot;shouted for help and a neighbour, who was an ambulance driver and had his ambulance parked next to his house, decided to come to their help. He put on his ambulance crew clothes and asked his son to put on a fluorescent jacket. They had driven a few metres from their house...when Israeli soldiers...ordered them to halt and get out of the vehicle.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/18">The account continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/19" class="indent">&quot;The soldiers ordered him and his son to undress and then re-dress. They then ordered them to abandon the ambulance and to walk towards Jabaliyah...The family decided that they had to make an attempt to walk to Jabaliyah&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/20">The parents carried the girls on their shoulders and the grandmother was carried by family members.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/21">The verdict of the Goldstone report was that the soldier &quot;deliberately directed lethal fire&quot; at the girls and their grandmother and that the soldiers knew that the ambulance driver</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/22" class="indent">&quot;did not constitute a threat&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/23">and deliberately aggravated the consequences of the shooting by forcing him to abandon the ambulance.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/24">That is just one example. The report investigated incidents involving 34 Palestinian civilians who lost their lives owing to Israeli fire that was intentionally directed at them. In each case, it found that the Israeli armed forces opened fire on civilians who were not taking part in the hostilities and who posed no threat to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.1/1">It is a pleasure to be here this morning, and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> on securing the debate about British Government policy regarding the report of Judge Richard Goldstone following his investigation into Operation Cast Lead.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/2">Although I concur with my hon. Friend on his description of the eminence of Judge Goldstone and his team, I will say that Judge Goldstone is not omnipotent and that there were flaws in his report. I support the view taken by Ministers here, that his report is unjust in implying a moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas. He failed to adequately recognise Israel's right to protect its citizens from murderous attacks and paid insufficient attention to Hamas's acts of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/3">Judge Goldstone's mission was limited by the mandate of the UN Human Rights Council, which was for an investigation of the military operations conducted in Gaza, excluding from his remit the seven years of rocket attacks by Hamas on Israel, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> has mentioned. Israel estimates that, since October 2001, 9,000 rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza into its southern towns by Hamas. It is not good enough for Judge Goldstone to characterise those as acts by &quot;Palestinian armed groups&quot;. He was also mistaken when he decided to consider only actions in the entire occupied Palestinian territory and Israel from <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-19">19 June 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.1/4">Estimates vary, but I know that up to 1,380 people were killed during Operation Cast Lead, which is a shocking number of deaths. Many more were injured and made homeless and workless. However, the responsibility for those deaths lies at the door of Hamas. There is no Government represented at the UN that would tolerate a sustained and murderous attack on its citizens for a period of seven years such as that carried out by Hamas on Israel.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.0/1">I, too, have visited Sterodt, and the fear of the people there that my right hon. Friend has described is absolutely genuine. However, if she is saying that the flaw in the Goldstone report was the time limit placed on the date from which it enquired, and she has talked about other things that should be looked at, why has she failed to mention the existence of the Hamas ceasefire long before Operation Cast Lead, or the blockade that existed in an extreme form since Hamas was elected to Government and in one form or other for a long time before that? If she wants to be balanced, why does she not mentioned those things?</p>

	<p pid="a.194.0/1">Thank you, Mrs. Humble. I will be brief so that other Members can speak. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> on securing the debate, on what he said and the way in which he said it. This is a debate in the British Parliament about accountability, and I have some specific points, which I would like the Minister to respond to when he replies, concerning the Goldstone report, the attitude taken at the UN Human Rights Council and the question of universal jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/2">After the Gaza bombing had ceased and a ceasefire of a sort was in place, the Goldstone commission was set up, and it went into enormous detail to look at what was going on. He gave a comprehensive report, which is not, in my view, unbalanced or one-sided, because it makes criticisms of all parties. When the report was finally delivered to the UN Human Rights Council, the British Government's representative, although not abstaining, extraordinarily did not participate in the discussion or vote at the end of the deliberations in Geneva. I would be grateful if the Minister explained exactly what the British Government's representatives were doing at the time, because it seems to me that if we send representatives to the Human Rights Council in Geneva we expect them to be there, to participate in the discussions. If the British Government are not prepared to support the referral of the Goldstone commission's report to the Security Council, they should do us the courtesy of explaining why. There appears to have been further obfuscation later on when it got to the UN Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/3">I think Goldstone is a brave man. He stood out against apartheid. He is not an enemy of Israel. Indeed, he has quite strongly Zionist views, which many of us in this Chamber might or might not agree with. The fact is that he is a respected jurist around the world who has delivered an important report, and maybe we should treat it with some respect and have the matter dealt with properly by the Security Council.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.0/1">I welcome the debate. I come from a similar background to my hon. and learned Friend and have been going to that part of world since before I came into this place. Does it disturb him, as it disturbs me, that people use &quot;democracy&quot; and the existence of an internal electoral system that appoints a parliament as an excuse-a smoke-and-mirrors scheme to hide behind-to justify the actions of what anyone else would say has become a pariah state?</p>

	<p pid="a.197.1/1">I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. Democracy, laudable though it undoubtedly is, is only one hallmark of civilisation; how one behaves in that democracy is another. The Third Reich started out as a democracy; Hamas is a democracy; democracy is not the only thing. The repetition of the phrase, &quot;This is the only democracy in the middle east&quot;, with Israel therefore deserving some special treatment, is costing us dear in international terms and in international relations.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/2">Briefly, on the legal consequences of Goldstone, does the report have a legal base in British jurisprudence? Yes, it does, it most certainly does-it is evidence. Ironically, one of the reasons why it is evidence is because of the extreme loosening of the evidential barriers effected by the Government in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, in the teeth of opposition from people such as myself. None the less, that is the effect: Goldstone is an evidential document in British jurisdiction, and may be used as such.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.0/1">That interpretation of Goldstone is highly selective, but let me answer the real question, which came at the end: do I not accept that some of the evidence in Goldstone is questionable? Of course I do. I have been a criminal barrister for a long time and have prosecuted and defended-I am happy or unhappy to say-some of the most venal, serious, dangerous, nasty and on occasion violent crimes that have been committed in this jurisdiction. Of course I know that all evidence needs to be tested. That is why the report needs to be tested in a proper arena; it needs to be tested in a British court, or in a court. Brought before such a judicial test, it may well be that some parts of the report will be found wanting. Frankly, I disagree-the report is a devastating indictment, in its form, its content and the nature and background of the man who wrote it. However, that is all that it is: an indictment. That indictment cries out to be tried.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.0/2">Now I come to the principle of universal jurisdiction, which so shames my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>, who would take no interventions on the subject. Let us deal with universal jurisdiction, which she finds so abhorrent. In the case of Tzipi Livni-not a case in which I was retained-inevitably what happened was that evidence was placed before a British district judge, of whom there is no criticism at all. I shall listen carefully to the Minister's reply, when he comes to deal with the issue. If he says that the district judge can be criticised, he is wholly at odds with the Foreign Secretary, who has spoken to me in such terms as, &quot;There is no criticism of that district judge.&quot; That district judge, on the evidence placed before him or her-I do not know which, but it was a Westminster district judge-found that there was a prima facie case to answer, because of the evidence of the atrocities committed in Gaza and the authority exercised by Tzipi Livni at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.0/3">That is the British system. In our system, we have the contribution of the citizen to a degree not exemplified elsewhere. We have jury trial, for instance-the first trial without a jury starts today, ironically, but the basis of our system is still jury trial. The citizen decides; the citizen can initiate process; and the citizen can go to a district judge and put evidence before the judge-if the evidence is there, process will issue. That is our system and I find nothing shameful in that at all. What I find shameful is the speed with which our Prime Minister got in touch with the Israeli Government and told them that there was something wrong with our judicial process. What I find shameful is that the Attorney-General-our Attorneys-General in this Government have a lot to answer for in how they have used their office in the build-up to the Iraq war and now this-going to a Hebrew university, talked about war &quot;lawfare&quot; and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.198.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Israel's leaders should always be able to travel freely in the United Kingdom&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.0/5">Why? Why should Israel's leaders &quot;always&quot; be able to travel, no matter what they do or the atrocities committed by their Government, army and the IDF on their behalf? Why? The time has long gone in this world when those who commit war crimes can believe that they can travel with impunity and immunity into civilised states and not face universal jurisdiction.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.1/1">It is not just our courts, but all the courts of any country that has signed the fourth Geneva convention and its protocol. That is the point, the jurisdiction is universal, which is the precise opposite of colonial. It is a universal jurisdiction, so that those who commit war crimes and atrocities know that their movement will be restricted in the world. Ironically, those who denied the freedom of movement to others, find that movement is denied to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/2">I shall oppose-I very much hope that the wider House will oppose-any attempt to restrict universal jurisdiction at the behest of any state, however powerful, whose leaders are accused and against whom there is prima facie evidence of committing such crimes.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.6/1">I asked the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase> a parliamentary question about the report and he set out the flaws in November last year: it did not adequately recognise Israel's right to protect its citizens or pay sufficient attention to Hamas's actions; it made broad assertions about detailed interpretation of international law over which we differ; and it lacked an authority of Israeli perspective, so crucial to determining the legality of the actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.6/2">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase> mentioned the rocket attacks by Palestinian militants, targeted at innocent civilians in southern Israel, which constituted a breach of international humanitarian law but was not addressed. As I mentioned in an earlier intervention, there have been 9,000 such attacks since October 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.6/3">We have heard a lot about international universal jurisdiction and the way that the Goldstone report was used to attempt the arrest in December last year of Tzipi Livni, Leader of the Opposition in Israel and former Foreign Minister. Hamas has since admitted that it worked in co-ordination with lawyers in this country on that case to try to achieve that. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree said, that has led to the cessation of visits by Israeli leaders and senior officials, dangerously affecting our relations with that country and, more importantly, our influence over the middle east peace process.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.6/4">I should like to say a few words in support of the commitments made by the Attorney-General in Jerusalem earlier this month, and the Foreign Secretary last month, to look at ways in which the system can be reformed, because if we are going to retain our strategic partnership with Israel and continue to have a constructive role in any middle east conflict it is vital that Israeli visitors, whether in Government or not, are able to come to this country for meetings with UK politicians and the wider community. It is important to recognise that Ms Livni is a strong proponent of the two-state solution and of renewing peace negotiations, yet her visit was cancelled, so she could not discuss with our Government those specific issues that would help the peace process rather than hinder it. That is the consequence of this action.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.6/5">I would like to see the law reforms. I support the principle of universal jurisdiction for international law, but I would like to see our courts protected from being used as campaign forums by politically motivated groups that are not really interested in justice, but are interested in scoring party political or other political points in this long-running conflict in the middle east, which is not going to be resolved in courts of law. Our courts have been left dangerously open to political manipulation and being brought into disrepute. There is a way forward by allowing the Attorney-General to decide whether this should happen. The Attorney-General is, in the end, responsible for deciding which prosecutions should go ahead, based on the likelihood of both a conviction and a public interest test. We may have the embarrassment of leaders being arrested but no prosecution following on from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.6/6">Although this state of affairs has little appeal to those who have serious concerns, it is now attracting the efforts of those seeking to use our law to embarrass foreign political leaders who they dislike. We need international, universal jurisdiction to deal with people such as the genocidaires from Rwanda and war criminals from Bosnia and Serbia, and the war lord from Afghanistan who was prosecuted successfully, but this is not what it was designed or intended for.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.2/1">If I give way any more, nobody else is going to get in.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/2">The Government have rightly called for Israel to conduct an independent inquiry into what happened, as did Goldstone, and this call has been echoed by international partners as well as many NGOs. I welcome the answer given by Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead in the other place to a parliamentary question earlier this month, saying that the Israeli authorities have carried out, or are currently undertaking, investigations into 140 separate incidents, including but not limited to the 34 highlighted by Goldstone inquiry. Although those investigations are being carried out by the IDF and not by an independent body, which would be preferable, the fact that Israel is conducting these inquiries should not be ignored. Too often Israel is painted as a country incapable of self-scrutiny. Yet we only need to look back as far as 2006, to the Winograd investigation and to 2005, to the Sasson Report, to know that this is far from true. Winograd was in response to the Lebanon conflict in 2006 and Sasson was commissioned to look into the funding of settlement expansion.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/3">Sasson exposed the fact that state bodies were covertly diverting funds to settlements improperly and the Winograd report was critical of the military strategy employed in the second Lebanon war, particularly the decision to respond with an immediate intensive military strike, following the kidnapping of Israeli servicemen, Ehud and Goldwasser. Israel has, in the past, conducted proper inquiries into such matters, found itself wanting and acted accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/4">Israel has established a legal system that is respected throughout the world, with a Supreme Court that is open to all, with few restrictions on its jurisdiction. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-29">29 December 2009</phrase>, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that a 14 km west bank stretch of Israel's highway 443, a main road between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, should not be closed to Palestinians, despite the military's fears that after six Israeli deaths on the road in terror attacks during the second intifada, opening the road could result in more deaths of Israeli citizens. Nevertheless, the Israeli Supreme Court decided that that road should be opened.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/5">I highlight these points because they are too often overlooked. Although our Government were right to call for Israel to conduct an inquiry into possible breaches of international law during the Gaza conflict, although the Goldstone is merely an indictment not a proven fact, as my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1709" name="Robert Marshall-Andrews">the Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews)</phrase> said-unlike my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> who, on introducing the debate, effectively took it as proven fact-and although Israel's current investigations may not be perfect, it is right that we give Israel the opportunity to show the international community that it is taking these allegations seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.2/6">We should at least wait to hear the outcome of Israel's investigation before offering premature condemnations, such as we have heard today. Israel may establish a fully independent inquiry.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.214.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" speakername="John Grogan" colnum="214"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0008.htm#10011238000614">
	<p pid="a.214.1/1">Absolutely, and the listed events regime allows that to happen. For the Ashes, we are in effect talking about 2017 because the 2013 series has already been sold. However, that seems to be the obvious solution, and there are precedents for it. This year and in previous years, Sky and the BBC have both shown the FA cup final live, and in the future that will be true of ESPN and ITV. In all cases, only some of the rights of any governing body will be listed. For cricket, the vast majority of test matches, one-day internationals and so on will be up for sale to the highest bidder, should the ECB so wish. It is unlikely that Sky and other subscription broadcasters will walk away from the table, particularly if there is the potential to simulcast the Ashes series in 2017, which is some way away.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/2">There are also the national football teams of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is a great pity that until Scotland qualifies for a European championship or a World cup, someone could grow up in Scotland and never see their national team on free-to-air TV. It is important to recognise that the Davies proposals suggest that qualifying matches be listed only in the home nation concerned. Football authorities in Scotland would still be able to sell the rights to the rest of the United Kingdom, and there would probably be competitive bidding, particularly between the BBC and ITV. With digital expansion, many more channels will meet the qualifying criteria of availability to 95 per cent. of the population. Once we have digital switchover, instead of five channels qualifying for those criteria, there could well be 10, 15 or more.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/3">Most governing bodies receive public money from the lottery and the Sports Council to fund grass-roots sport and other activities. That is explicitly recognised in the Government's consultation document, which states that</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/4" class="indent">&quot;the Secretary of State...considers that a further factor that may be of relevance in the balance, is the extent...to which the sport in question has received direct or indirect public funding&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/5">Between 2009 and 2013, Sport England will give &#163;37 million to cricket and &#163;30 million to rugby union. The best figure I could find regarding how much money is raised for grass-roots cricket from broadcasting contracts was around &#163;13 million. That figure came from a study by Deloitte for BSkyB. The amounts of money that go in from broadcasting and from the public purse are not dissimilar. It is worth remembering that &#163;1.5 million of national lottery funding was invested in the new Welsh rugby union centre of excellence, which opened last month. SportScotland gave the Scottish Football Association &#163;1.4 million last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/6">If the governing bodies believe in an entirely free market approach, why are they receiving public money? They cannot have it both ways. If hard-pressed taxpayers and lottery players are funding sports, should they not be able to see some of the events on free-to-air TV?</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/7">There is another interesting phrase in the Government's consultation document:</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The Secretary of State also provisionally considers that a properly managed sporting body is likely to wish to have a diversified income source, in particular because of the recognised vagaries of broadcasting revenue streams.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/9">According to Giles Clarke's written evidence to the Davies committee, 80 per cent. of cricket's income is from broadcasting revenue, double that of the next nearest sport, which I think is Scottish football where about 40 per cent. of income is derived from broadcasting. Clearly, there is an imbalance, which cricket needs to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/10">There is some controversy over the figures for participation in cricket. Cricketing bodies argue that participation has increased in recent years, but research for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Sport England suggests that if there has been an increase it has been marginal compared with sports such as cycling and athletics, which have much greater exposure on free-to-air TV.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/11">It is likely that sponsorship will be higher with free-to-air exposure. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-13">13 October 2009</phrase>, <i>The Times</i> reported that Kevin Peake, the marketing director of npower, had hinted that having the Ashes back on free-to-air television might persuade the company to continue sponsorship beyond its present deal, which expires in 2011. A recent report from Deloitte, commissioned by BSkyB and entitled, &quot;The impact of broadcasting on sports in the UK&quot;, noted that for rugby union, a key benefit of the Six Nations free-to-air strategy was the impact on sponsorship revenue. Exposure on free-to-air TV could have various effects.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/12">I have a number of further points. I urge the Government to make a decision swiftly after the consultation period ends in March. As I understand it, this is an area where a Minister can decide; there is no further parliamentary process and it is something that can be wrapped up before the general election. I hope that free-to-air broadcasters look carefully at the new list, if there is one. There is a responsibility, particularly on the BBC, to look at the list that Parliament has decided on and do everything possible to ensure that events on the A-list are shown on free-to-air TV.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/13">Finally, the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, always told the parliamentary Labour party that it was through the little things in government that a difference could be made. This is not a matter of life and death, or peace and war, but-as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> pointed out-it affects the quality of life of many people. Many people have spent their lives volunteering as coaches, for example, in a variety of sports, and they would like to spend their retirement being able to watch the great national and international events on television. It is impossible to calculate the impact of sport on young people in inspiring them to take up cricket, rugby, football or athletics. When the Olympic games are on free-to-air TV-I am told that the BBC wants to show every event live in 2012-there will be a huge impact on the next generation in encouraging them to take up sport. That impact cannot be measured, but we know that it is of tremendous value to our society.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.216.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1412" speakername="Sin Simon" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport"  colnum="216"  time="012:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0009.htm#10011238000615">
	<p pid="a.216.0/1">Let me congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate and on his erudite and insightful tour d'horizon from which, I am sure hon. Members will agree, we have all profited. He has been a dogged campaigner on this issue for many years, and he now describes himself as chipper, which will please us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/2">I start by reaffirming the Government's belief in ensuring that as many people as possible have the opportunity to enjoy our great sporting events via free-to-air television. We all recognise that sport is a key element in our national identity and part of the glue that binds us together as a society. The excitement and interest generated by major sports events is something that little else on television can match.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/3">The decision to review the listed events regime, to ensure that it was fit for purpose, was based on a number of factors. The Government recognised, as my hon. Friend said, that with the development of digital technologies and other changes to the broadcasting environment, viewers now have a much greater choice of channels, as well as a greater range of different ways to view sporting events. Viewers' attitudes to subscription TV and the consumption of premium content, especially sports coverage, have changed, and to take account of those developments we set up an independent panel to review the regime and make recommendations to the Secretary of State. The panel, under the chairmanship of David Davies, was asked to review three areas: the principle of a list; the criteria against which listed events could be chosen; and the content of any list.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/4">As part of its work, the panel recognised the importance of ensuring that its recommendations were informed by as wide as possible a range of views. It undertook a public consultation from <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-08">8 April</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-20">20 July</phrase>. At the same time it wrote to 187 sporting, media, broadcasting, viewer and other organisations-domestic and international -inviting them all to participate in the consultation exercise. It consulted very widely; Davies did not just make it up. Some of the organisations had meetings with panel members; others made submissions in writing. The panel visited the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly and arranged a joint meeting of the all-party groups on media and sports to hear Members' views directly. The panel also commissioned quantitative and qualitative research to ascertain broader public views, and an initial analysis of viewing patterns, as well as a general analysis of the impact of listing on the sale of sports broadcast rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/5">The panel reached clear conclusions as to the criterion that should be used in determining whether an event was capable of being listed-the major event test. It should be an event that</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/6" class="indent">&quot;has a special resonance and not simply a significance to those who ordinarily follow the sport concerned&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/7">Such an event is likely to be a pre-eminent national or international event in sport or to involve the national team or national representatives, and is likely in any event to command a large television audience. The panel identified a number of events that it felt passed the test, as set out in the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/8">In response to the report, the Secretary of State has provisionally concluded that he should accept the panel's recommendations on the retention of a list in principle and the use of the major event test to draw up the list. He has also provisionally accepted the events that have been identified as passing the major event test. The Secretary of State considers that the panel has come forward with a persuasive set of reasons for retaining the listing system. He provisionally agrees that as many members of the UK population as possible should have access to the important sporting events in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/9">The media landscape is changing fast, but it appears from the material before the panel that for varying reasons a significant proportion of the population do not have access to pay television and that although some can see such events in other ways-perhaps, expensively, at the pub-a significant proportion of the population do not do so and will not in future. The Secretary of State is particularly concerned about the inability of those on low incomes to access subscriber services upon which such events might otherwise be broadcast. He considers it important that the UK and its individual nations should be able to promote their individual sense of identity. One way in which that is achieved is through our all being able to join together in enjoyment and celebration of such important events. However, it is important to recognise that the panel expressed no view about, and took no account of, the impact or consequences of listing on a sport or sporting body, stating that it considered that such matters were for the Secretary of State to take into account. My hon. Friend the Member for Selby put forward, interestingly and at some length, arguments to offset those that he anticipates will be put by some sporting bodies whose events have been added to the list.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/10">The Secretary of State's provisional conclusion is that, in making any final decision on which events should be listed, he should take account of the possible impacts that such listing might have on the sport in question and on those broadcasters affected. For that reason he considers that the major event test should be accompanied by an impact assessment. That will involve his considering any matters relating to the impacts of listing that are drawn to his attention, and then assessing whether listing would have a disproportionate impact on the interests of those adversely affected by it. Having reached his provisional conclusions the Secretary of State is required to carry out a statutory consultation with the broadcasting authorities and any affected rights holders, in line with the Broadcasting Act 1996, before announcing his final decision. The principal factors that the Secretary of State has provisionally concluded should be taken into account are set out in the consultation document, which was published last month.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/11">It is important to emphasise that the Secretary of State has provisionally arrived at the conclusion that he will accept the recommendations in the report, but that he will consider the implications for sporting bodies and grass-roots sport, and has not reached any final views. He is still considering the issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood, and I am grateful for the opportunity for this debate. I am pleased to see the Minister. I admire him greatly for his conscientiousness in his task, and for his care and concern about the issues for which he is responsible.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/2">I am also pleased that other hon. Members can be here to support the debate, and shall be happy to give way liberally to anyone who wants to intervene, and, subject to your consent, Mr. Hood, and the Minister's, to cede time to hon. Members who want to contribute. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" name="Meg Munn">The hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)</phrase> returned from Kurdistan only this weekend, and I am sure that hon. Members will be keen to hear what she has to report to the House. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on the Kurdistan region in Iraq, will also want to contribute to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/3">I place on the record my appreciation of Ibrahim Dogus, who has lobbied me since I was a London assembly member in 2000 on Kurdistan and the interests of the Kurdish community here. We have a very large Kurdish community in Croydon. I would also like to place on record my thanks to Akif Wan, of the Peace in Kurdistan campaign, for all the briefings that he has given me over the years.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/4">In the debate today, we have to canter through the issues, in terms of Kurdistan sitting abreast of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran. However, I will try to touch on those concerns one after the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/5">In many ways, as British people we have some responsibility in the area, bearing in mind both the failure of the commitments we made, up to and including the treaty of S&#232;vres, and the 1946 expulsion of the Kurdistan Democratic party from Iraq by Britain after the second world war. However, that should not distract us from the fact that we have vital interests, separate from those of Kurdish people, in seeing proper peace and good trade in Kurdistan, not only because we are suffering from the difficulties of a clash of civilisations but because the region is of high importance to us in terms of our own energy security and that of our European partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/6">Of course, those considerations should not blind us to the importance of continuing to support the Government's policy of being strongly opposed to any terrorist outrages by the PKK-the Kurdistan Workers party. However, I think we can be very positive about the approach that Kurds take. In the main, Kurds are secularist and have a very good understanding of the geopolitics of why it is not in the interests of the west to see an independent Kurdistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/7">We need to recognise that the Kurdish community in London is a very large contributor to the city. There are 250,000 Kurds in London and the rest of the UK. Obviously that is a smaller number than the 2 million who are in Istanbul, but none the less one can recognise the important part the Kurdish diaspora plays in Turkey.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/8">Turkey is a country that, in many ways, is a bulwark for security in Asia Minor. It is an ally of ours that has one of the biggest armies in NATO, an economy that is dynamic and a population with a very young age profile. Therefore it would make a worthy entrant to the European Union. Nevertheless, it is important for us that any discussions about EU membership for Turkey should take the best possible advantage of any leverage to secure the proper treatment of Kurdish minorities, particularly defence of Kurdish people's right to use their own language fully-not only within Turkish courts, as is currently allowed, but within political discourse in Turkey-and most importantly in terms of human rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate in the House. However, does he share my disappointment that the EU does not appear to have effectively used its influence to get Turkey to change its attitude to human rights generally and to the Kurds in particular? I am sure that he will acknowledge our debt to Kurds and Kurdistan, and that the UK has a historical duty to those people and that region. This country has betrayed those people for more than a hundred years, not least in failing to defend them properly during the atrocities-</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.221.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" speakername="Andrew Pelling" colnum="221"  time="012:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0009.htm#10011238000625">
	<p pid="a.221.4/1">I know that the hon. Gentleman has an important Sorani Kurd community in his constituency. In that regard, it is interesting to note how the Kurdistan Regional Government, or KRG, area has thrived, which shows, as he said, the importance of combating the temptation to go down the terrorist route. What is perhaps encouraging is that the Kurdish community has quite often acted in a very responsible way despite having many reasons for feeling antagonised.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/2">Obviously we are going through one of those periodic bands of Kurdish political parties that reflect the rather complicated army/democracy or non-secularist/secularist Ataturk traditions in Turkey. However, it is entirely unhelpful that we have ended up in a situation where the DTP-the Democratic Society party-is again facing the prospect of being banned.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/3">There are 3,000 Kurdish children in detention in Turkey and there has been a significant number of arrests of Kurdish politicians. For example, there has been the arrest of Ahmet Turk, whose surname is itself an irony, because it shows how someone's own language or nomenclature cannot be used, and the arrest of Aysel Tujluk. That situation means that there is a clever political arrangement whereby the number of Kurdish representatives in the Turkish Parliament is taken below the required 20, such that the party cannot operate any more.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/4">When one thinks about the violent forced evacuations of Kurdish villages that took place in the 1990s, one can understand why Kurds might feel the temptation to be very aggressive on these issues. However, it is encouraging that Ocalan, who has been put into even worse solitary confinement conditions, is urging his colleagues to go down the constitutional route. It is also encouraging-although there may be a repeat of previous experience-that a new party, the Peace and Democracy party, will be launched on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-01">1 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/5">There are obviously many implications for the whole region. Many of us also have Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot minorities in our communities. I was very pleased to meet the Greek Cypriot Democratic Rally leader, Nicos Anastasiades, because obviously there is also an issue in relation to Cyprus. It is encouraging that, in many ways, Turkish Cypriots are now moving closer.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/6">We should encourage Turkey to take a very positive view of tolerance of Kurdish language rights and other rights. Furthermore, through the European Union, we should encourage Turkey to respond to the issue raised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>. The EU should say that a condition of EU membership for Turkey must be the proper economic development of south-east Anatolia, so that the inequalities that exist there are dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/7">Let me now move on to talk about other countries. In Iran, it is disturbing that although Kurdish people are very willing to work with the state, there is arbitrary arrest and in reality we face the situation of judicial killing. One such judicial killing has already taken place and 12 other Kurds are on death row. In Syria, quite clearly there is much arbitrary detention and torture.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/8">As for the KRG, it is a story of great success. One of the reasons for that is the visionary way that John Major acted, to ensure that there was no bombing of northern Iraq after the first Gulf war. However, there are still many important issues and concerns. One is where the writ of Kurdistan runs to. Does it include some areas around Mosul-not Mosul itself, but some villages around Mosul that in reality are more Kurdish than Iraqi? There is also the important issue of having a proper oil revenue-sharing agreement, so that there is the best possible investment in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/9">As a country, we have a real interest in and concern about the amount of trade that we can do in the area. To some extent, we are being overtaken by the Germans, the Scandinavians, the Italians and, of course, the Turks. In many ways, many organisations that invest in Kurdistan are actually partially owned by parts of the Turkish army. We have a great interest in ensuring that we do our best. I am sure that good work is done by the embassy representation in Erbil, but there might be advantage in having Department of Trade and Industry representation there as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/10">I have one particular interest. It is not a personal interest, but I have a long-standing friend with an interest in the provision of a direct air link between London and Erbil. Currently, the journey is expensive and is normally made via Vienna. I understand that the UK is not happy to have direct flights back due to security issues, but the issue could be resolved by making greater provision for air marshals on such trips and by investing properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/11">There have been great controversies in the House about the KRG's approach to minorities. Early-day motions have been tabled about the treatment of Christians and the prospective expulsion of Christians and Assyrians from the KRG area. That might be due partly to the fact that there has been a great deal of confusion about property rights post-Saddam. I would be interested to know the Government's view. To what extent do such issues exist within the KRG area? The Bishop of Croydon has certainly spoken out on the persecution of Christians there as an issue of concern. However, we must not let that blind us to the fact that the KRG has been especially successful, although we must be worried about further political shootings as a result of the tensions arising from the elections this March.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.4/12">What are the Government doing to persuade Turkey of the poor merits of banning the DTP? What pressure are they bringing through the European Union to ensure that if Turkey is given entry, the rights of Kurds will be protected fully? Would we consider observing elections properly, both in Kurdistan in Iraq and in Turkey, to ensure that Kurdish rights are protected fully? What can be done to promote our trade interests in Kurdistan and encourage direct flights to Erbil? Finally and perhaps most controversially, what does the Minister think would be the advantages of pushing for the release of Ocalan so that we could have a constitutional rather than terrorist-based settlement for Kurds within Turkey?</p>

	<p pid="a.223.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" name="Andrew Pelling">the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling)</phrase> on securing this debate and thank him warmly for his generosity in allowing me to make a short contribution. I chair the all-party parliamentary group on the Kurdistan region in Iraq, and, as he said, I have just returned from my first visit there.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/2">The year 2003 brought liberation for the people of the Kurdistan region of Iraq, who made up the only Iraqi force that fought alongside British and American forces. However, I believe that the UK has overlooked Kurdistan, the most secure and successful region of Iraq, undermining the whole country's renewal and hindering British commercial and political objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/3">Politicians and businesspeople whom I met were mystified and disappointed by the British Government's behaviour since liberation. As the Prime Minister said to me, Kurdistan is the success of UK policy, yet the policy has not involved equal treatment for all the people of Iraq. The UK has been reluctant to develop our relationship with the Kurdish region for fear of causing problems with the majority Arab population, and its continuing improvement and success in the development of democracy and the security of the people is not being embraced as a model for the wider region. Instead, the British Government's failure to update their understanding of the security situation in the region has damaged British interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/4">Trade must be a greater priority in Iraqi Kurdistan. Companies investing there can later expand their operations to the south. For many British and other companies, Kurdistan is now the only part of Iraq that is truly open for business; the rest is only partially open, although I hope that it will catch up with Kurdistan as soon as possible. Kurdistan's political, civic and business leaders have long appealed for such links. They appreciate the quality and expertise of British companies and institutions and wish to be our political and security ally.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/5">As the hon. Gentleman said, we have fallen behind a number of other European countries. There has been no official UK ministerial trade mission. The trade missions that do go to the region have no support from UK Trade and Investment. The embassy office in Kurdistan's capital, Erbil, is understaffed compared with other missions and marooned many miles from the capital, although staff recognise the opportunities and do their best to deal with the inadequacies of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/6">Many people mentioned the problem of visas. Chambers of commerce members whom we met told us that business people from Kurdistan travel regularly-sometimes twice a month-to other parts of Europe, but that travel to Britain is difficult and that obtaining a visa involves going to Amman.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.0/7">The hon. Gentleman discussed the issue of Christians in the region. As a practising Methodist and chair of the all-party Methodist group, I focused in depth on the position of Christians in the Kurdistan region, as many have fled from the rest of Iraq. I had detailed discussions with the Bishop of Erbil and Mr. Sarkis Aghajan Mamendu, a former deputy Prime Minister who has led the efforts to protect and promote the interests of Christians in the Kurdistan region. Both men told us that the Kurdistan regional government take an active role in not only ensuring the rights of Christians but offering a safe haven to Christians fleeing persecution from other regions of Iraq. I commend the region for its generosity in welcoming Christians and protecting their position.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.1/1">Indeed, I would say support Christians, not just tolerate them.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/2">I was impressed by the Parliament's interest in developing democracy. With the help of Gary Kent, who supports the all-party group, I gave two seminars to more than half the MPs from the Kurdistan Parliament. They want to develop their understanding of democracy further. One main concern in Kurdistan is the need for a census. No accurate census has been taken for the best part of 50 years. It is important for all aspects of public policy planning, but it is also crucial to fairness in the allocation of seats in the Iraqi Parliament. There is concern that the forthcoming census will not be done fairly, so technical help from Britain is requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/3">Finally, on women's rights, the leaders in Kurdistan have taken a brave stance on problems common in the middle east, such as so-called honour killings and female circumcision. I acknowledge their leadership in such matters. I also met members of the women's committee of the Sulaymaniyah provincial council. They have made great advances in establishing the concerns of female council employees, challenging sexual harassment and creating a cr&#232;che. Their practical radicalism stands out in the middle east, where women's interests are normally way down the political agenda. I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend's response to those issues.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-01-12a.225.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1779" speakername="Chris Bryant" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe"  colnum="225"  time="013:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100112/halltext/100112h0010.htm#10011238000629">
	<p pid="a.225.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" name="Andrew Pelling">the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling)</phrase> wholeheartedly on securing this debate on a subject that has not been debated for many years, except as a subsidiary to other debates on Turkey, Iraq or Iran. The issue is an important one that probably needs more than half an hour to amplify.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/2">I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" name="Meg Munn">the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)</phrase>, who knows many of the ins and outs of the issues because she used to be in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and was much respected when she was there. I know that she does a good job with her all-party parliamentary group, as does my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1525" name="Ann Clwyd">the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)</phrase>. Between the two of them, they have managed to establish a better parliamentary relationship than we have with many countries within the European Union. I pay tribute to them because that is of considerable benefit to the region and it informs politics in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/3">There are clear UK interests in the region. First, as has been mentioned, many UK companies are active in Iraq, Turkey and Iran and many companies would like to be more active. We would like to be able to provide more assistance. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central made a good point about the need to beef-up our effort in terms of UK Trade and Investment and our presence. We do not want all the business to be hoovered up by the Germans or French.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/4">Secondly, there is a clear UK interest because we want peace and stability in the region. The contribution many young men and women in our armed forces made in Iraq was important to this country's stability and security. We want to ensure that we do not have to go back to Iraq. Ensuring that there is stability and long-term economic prosperity in the Kurdish region of Iraq is therefore vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/5">I will go through the countries that have large Kurdish communities. The hon. Gentleman referred to Turkey. He is right that we want to see Turkey as a member of the European Union. We think that that would be good for the UK. It would be good to have a secular, Muslim country in the European Union and we do not believe that Europe should be a Christian club, as some people have called it. Incidentally, that forgets the history of countries such as Spain, where Moorish influence is significant in thought, culture and architecture. We also believe that Turkey's membership of the European Union will be vital because it is probably the Asian tiger on our doorstep. It is also a country that helps to guarantee our security against terrorism and international criminality, and our energy security. It is therefore vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/6">We do not want Turkey to join the European Union at any cost. It will not be able to do so unless it complies fully with the acquis communautaire. There is a great deal of work it still has to do on human rights and a range of elements of its legal system to ensure that the Turkey that joins the European Union can be a proper member of it. A line from a song in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; says:</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Marry the man today and change his ways tomorrow.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/8">That cannot be done with a country that is applying to join the European Union. We must be sure that the changes have been introduced before it joins.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/9">The Kurdish issue in Turkey is one of the key issues that must be resolved effectively before Turkey can accede to the Union. There are other issues such as Cyprus, but the Kurdish issue is key. We were concerned when, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-11">11 December</phrase>, the Turkish constitutional court closed the DTP, the Kurdish nationalist party. That is why we supported strongly the European Union statement that expressed concern. Things have moved on since then. Ahmet Turk said that the 19 DTP MPs will return to Parliament as BDP-Peace and Democracy party-members. We welcome Interior Minister Atalay's remarks about moving towards greater democracy and resolving the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/10">We support the tackling of the terrorist threat posed by the PKK. However, it must be possible to distinguish between nationalism that depends on the use of violence and terrorism and believes in violent overthrow and the legitimate political aspirations of individuals who want to see a different political outlook. I am visiting Istanbul this weekend and will have meetings with my opposite number, Mr. Bagis. I look forward to having discussions with him on these issues and about Turkey's eventual accession to the European Union, which I am hopeful about.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/11">The hon. Member for Croydon, Central and my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley rightly raised Iran. The human rights situation in Iran is horrific, not only for Kurds, but for many other people. Not only are we wholeheartedly opposed to the use of the death penalty, but the judicial process that leads to its use in Iran is completely flawed. The death penalty is still used for minors, despite Iran being signed up to international obligations that prohibit its use for under-18s. That shows that even though Iran has signed up, it is not complying, and that it has a casual disregard for human rights. We have raised that point on at least 20 occasions, specifically in relation to the situation faced by Kurds in Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/12">On Iraq, the Kurdistan Regional Government is established in the constitution. Last March saw the successful visit of Massoud Barzani to this and other EU countries. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley and my right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley have had regular conversations with the KRG. There has been significant progress on a great number of issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/13">One issue on which there is progress to be made is female genital mutilation. The German non-governmental organisation WADI-Association for Crisis Assistance and Development Co-operation-reckons between 75 and 85 per cent. of women are subjected to female genital mutilation. We take that seriously and want to address the problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley mentioned the problem. The KRG has said that it wants to hold a conference soon on that issue and we are keen that that should happen swiftly. We stand ready to assist in making it happen. There are deeply entrenched cultural views that must be addressed; it is a long-term issue that obviously cannot be changed overnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/14">My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley raised the issue of visas. People in the Kurdistan region of Iraq undoubtedly face significant difficulty in doing business and travelling. I am certain that that harms the ability of people in the UK to do business. As I am sure she will acknowledge, there are significant security issues over whether we will provide a full visa service in Iraq. We are looking at whether we can bring about changes, but I cannot announce anything now.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/15">The hon. Member for Croydon, Central raised the issue of elections and whether we will be monitoring them closely. He was right. We are of course delighted that there have been successful rounds of elections in Iraq. Many people thought that that would never happen. Indeed, some people in the UK thought it was inappropriate for us to try to bring about a democratic Iraq. I disagree with those people. It has been a pleasure to see that the effort of British troops in Iraq has secured what have generally been reckoned to be decent rounds of elections, although they have not by any means been perfect.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/16">The hon. Gentleman is right that we must ensure that the conditions of elections are improved. We will monitor that closely through our embassy and consular staff in Baghdad, Erbil and Basra. We want to report back on that. I am sure that the all-party parliamentary group will take a keen interest, as will the hon. Gentleman, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley and my right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/17">Abdullah Ocalan's imprisonment in Turkey has been raised. I was not sure whether the hon. Member for Croydon, Central was calling for him to be released. That is a matter for the Turkish authorities. However, the state of Turkish prisons and the access available for international visitors are of international concern. Although in general the conditions in Turkish prisons are far from ideal, they have improved somewhat in recent years. We want to see further improvements, and I will raise that with my counterpart when I am in Istanbul this weekend.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.0/1">In a moment. I will accommodate as many of my hon. Friends-indeed, hon. Members from all parties-as I possibly can. The number of briefings that have come my way have borne testimony to the wide-range of interest there is in the issue. I realise that the matter is still very much a work in progress for the Government, but the nature and range of the briefings that I have received suggest that there is still a lot of work to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/2">If hon. Members will indulge me for a moment, a briefing I have not read is the one that came my way from Ofcom. I had a quick flick through it and reached the back page, which, for the benefit of the record, has a map of most of the United Kingdom on it-in fact, the map includes the Isle of Man, which is not even part of the United Kingdom. The only parts of the United Kingdom that the map does not include are the islands of Orkney and Shetland. I have a suspicion that somebody at Ofcom might pick up the <i>Hansard</i> report of this debate and read it, so may I just place on the record that if Ofcom wants me to read its briefing, it will have to show my constituency on its maps? If Ofcom cannot be bothered to do that, I will not be bothered to read its briefing.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.5/1">My question flows from everything that the hon. Gentleman has said.

	<p pid="a.230.0/1">That takes the debate to a level beyond that which I had intended to discuss today. If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will not go down that line.

	<p pid="a.230.2/1">I must make a little bit of progress first. I certainly do not pretend to be an expert on these matters, but over the past few months, a number of concerns about the Government's plans for local radio, as set out in the Digital Economy Bill, have been raised with me. Given the importance of local and community stations to the surrounding communities that they serve, I want to raise those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/2">I should also place on the record my acknowledgement of the efforts of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> in relation to his early-day motion 436, of which I am also a signatory. The main area of concern I want to raise is that the Government's push into digital switchover is in danger of creating what appears to be an unlevel playing field for local stations. That is a consequence of how the market in this area operates and is a recognition of the fact that although we talk very loosely about local radio, there are at least two national companies-Bauer and Global-that are providing local radio in different areas of the country. That is having its own impact on the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/3">First, I want to raise with the Minister the issue of the 2015 switchover date. The concern raised with me is that that could leave more than 120 local commercial stations and 200 community radio stations with an uncertain future in analogue. Effectively, the switchover will have created a two-tier radio industry. The &quot;Digital Britain&quot; White Paper proposed that such radio stations should form part of an ultra-local tier of radio. I understand that the decision to leave those stations on FM is driven by the limitations of the UK's current digital radio network, which apparently lacks sufficient capacity for every station in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/4">Among the concerns raised with me is that it is too expensive for local radio stations to go digital in that way. I hope the Minister will agree that it would be most unsatisfactory if local operators were forced out of business because of rising costs. I know from my own constituency experience that that is a very real danger-I am thinking of those costs associated with going digital. It is important for regions to keep a variety of local operators that often have valuable local knowledge and serve specific communities. I hope that the Minister will agree with me that it is essential that one digital platform is not advantaged at the expense of all other alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/5">I would also be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the concerns that, should radio go digital as planned, those stations left on FM will find it increasingly difficult to retain listeners, and as a consequence advertisers, due to their absence from DAB-only radios and their unavailability on alphabetised digital station lists. A combination of reduced listening and lack of digital functionality could make those stations less attractive to advertisers. It is, of course, extremely important that FM does not become irrelevant to radio, especially considering that there is unlikely ever to be a DAB multiplex in the entirety of my constituency, and indeed in many other parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/6">One proposed solution, on which I would like there to be greater debate, is DAB plus. That has been proposed to allow all radio to go digital and is being implemented in other countries around the world. The representations that have been made to me have indicated that there are two problems with DAB: first, that it has a gatekeeper, meaning that one cannot operate one's own transmitter; and secondly, that it is on double the frequency of the FM band so that, as a consequence, relays are needed for the same coverage, which will be particularly problematic in hilly areas, such as Shetland. If Ofcom had shown Shetland on the map and shown any of its topography, readers could see that we have a fair number of hills there.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.2/7">As a parliamentarian who represents thousands of constituents living in hilly areas, I would like some assurance from the Minister that people in such areas will not be forgotten. I hope that he will understand my concern at the comments made to me that current proposals will not provide a digital migration path for stations serving remote rural areas. I am told that AM/FM enjoys near-universal coverage of 99 per cent., but that DAB is significantly below that. I am aware that the Government have required that the DAB outreach should cover 90 per cent. of the whole population before the upgrade timetable will begin, but my suspicion is that when it comes to looking at where the remaining 10 per cent. will be, the communities of Orkney and Shetland will both feature in the list.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.1/1">I am alarmed to admit, such is the level of detail I have acquired in the past seven days, that I am familiar with Radio Jackie, having received a briefing from those who run it. My hon. Friend's points are, for the most part, sound. As he illustrates, what we are discussing is very much a work in progress. Until, and unless, the concerns that he has outlined can be addressed satisfactorily, we should not rush head-first towards a switchover date for which there is no obviously compelling factor, technological or otherwise, other than that it was felt that that would be the only way to get things moving.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/2">Several of the briefings I have received in the past few days mentioned the possibility of being able to upgrade to DAB plus in future. Is that something the Government are looking at and, if so, why not upgrade to DAB plus from the beginning, rather than trying to bolt it on a later stage? Where is the Government's thinking in relation to DAB plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/3">I would also be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the fact that three quarters of all radio listening is still to traditional FM/AM radio. I understand that there are 120 million analogue radios in the UK, compared with 10 million DAB sets. The average purchase prise, I am told, of a DAB set is &#163;85. The Minister said in departmental questions last July that the Government were</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/4" class="indent">&quot;working with industry to come up with sets that are consistently priced at &#163;20 or less.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-07-20.563"><i>Official Report</i>, 20 July 2009; Vol. 496, c. 563</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/5">We still seem to be some way from that, so I would be interested to know what progress the Government are making.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/6">I find the question of in-car listening compelling, as I generally listen to the radio while driving around. In-car listening is currently estimated to account for about 20 per cent. of all radio listening, yet DAB is currently in fewer than 1 per cent. of all UK cars. That figure is expected to rise to just 10 per cent. by 2015. I understand that the Government have recommended that all new car radios sold in the UK by the end of 2013 should be digital, but that is just two years before the proposed switchover date. What impact will that have on the 2015 switchover date?</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/7">It was recently suggested to me that DAB is 12 times less energy efficient in its usage than FM/AM. Have the Government considered that, and what are they doing to ensure that the energy efficiency of the switchover costs will be taken properly into account?</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" name="Brian H Donohoe">The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase> asked me about the Digital Economy Bill, and I say to him genuinely that I do not oppose it. There is much in that Bill that is very positive, particularly clauses 34 and 35, and it seems to have brought with it a whole range of opportunities for local radio. It has been widely and warmly received by the industry. However, it is also fair to say that a tremendous amount of detailed work still needs to be done. I hope that the debate will allow the Minister to at least start to explain how the Government are addressing some of that important detail to ensure that switchover will operate effectively for all parts of the country.</p>
